Columnist Molly Ivins Dies
By JOHN MORITZ STAR-TELEGRAM AUSTIN BUREAU

Star-Telegram (Ft. Worth, TX)
http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/16591107.htm
January 31, 2007

AUSTIN =E2=80=94 Molly Ivins, whose biting columns mixed
liberal populism with an irreverent Texas wit, died at
5:30 p.m. Wednesday at her home in Austin after an up-
and-down battle with breast cancer she had waged for
seven years. She was 62.

Ms. Ivins, the Star-Telegram's political columnist for
nine years ending in 2001, had written for the New York
Times, the Dallas Times-Herald and Time magazine and
had long been a sought-after pundit on the television
talk-show circuit to provide a Texas slant on issues
ranging from President Bush=E2=80=99s pedigree to the culture
wars rooted in the 1960s.

"She was magical in her writing," said Mike Blackman, a
former Star-Telegram executive editor who hired Ms.
Ivins at the newspaper=E2=80=99s Austin bureau in 1992, a few
months after the Times-Herald ceased publication. "She
could turn a phrase in such a way that a pretty hard-
hitting point didn=E2=80=99t hurt so bad."

A California native who moved to Houston as a young
child with her family, Ms. Ivins was diagnosed with
breast cancer in 1999. Two years later after enduring a
radical mastectomy and rounds of chemotherapy, Ms.
Ivins was given a 70 percent chance of remaining
cancer-free for five years. At the time, she said she
liked the odds.

But the cancer recurred in 2003, and again last year.
In recent weeks, she had suspended her twice-weekly
syndicated column, allowing guest writers to use the
space while she underwent further treatment. She made a
brief return to writing in mid-January, urging readers
to resist President Bush=E2=80=99s plan to increase the number
of U.S. troops deployed to Iraq. She likened her call
to an old-fashioned "newspaper crusade."

"We are the people who run this country," Ms Ivins said
in the column published in the Jan. 14 edition of the
Star-Telegram. "We are the deciders. And every single
day, every single one of us needs to step outside and
take some action to help stop this war.

"Raise hell," she continued. "Think of something to
make the ridiculous look ridiculous. Make our troops
know we=E2=80=99re for them and are trying to get them out of
there. Hit the streets to protest Bush's proposed
surge."

She ended the piece by endorsing the peace march in
Washington scheduled for Saturday. 01-27 "We need
people in the streets, banging pots and pans and
demanding, "Stop it, now!' " she wrote.

The spice of Texas

Born Mary Tyler Ivins on Aug. 30, 1944, in Monterey,
Calif., Ms. Ivins was raised in the upscale River Oaks
section of Houston. She earned her journalism degree at
elite Smith College in Massachusetts in 1965. From
there she ventured to Minnesota, taking a job as a
police reporter for the Minneapolis Tribune.

Growing weary of the winters in the Upper Great Lakes
and missing the spice of Texas food and its politics,
Ms. Ivins moved to Austin to become co-editor of the
Texas Observer, long considered the state=E2=80=99s liberal
conscience.

Nadine Eckhardt, the former wife of the late Texas
novelist Billy Lee Bramer and who later married former
U.S. Rep. Bob Eckhardt of Houston, said Ivins soon made
herself a fixture in the Austin political and cocktail
party scene in the early 1970s.

"That=E2=80=99s where she became the Molly Ivins as we=E2=80=99ve come
to know her," said Eckhardt, an Ivins friend for nearly
four decades. "The Observer had such wonderful writers
doing such wonderful stories at the time, and Molly was
always right in the middle of everything."

Her writing flair caught the attention of the New York
Times, which hired her to cover city hall, then later
moved her to the statehouse bureau in Albany. Later,
she was assigned to the Times=E2=80=99 Rocky Mountain bureau in
Denver.

Even though she wrote the Times=E2=80=99 obituary for Elvis
Presley in 1977, Ms. Ivins said later that she and the
sometimes stodgy Times proved to be a mismatch. In a
2002 interview with the Star-Telegram, Ms. Ivins
recalled that she would write about something that
"squawked like a $2 fiddle" only to have a Times editor
rewrite it to say "as an inexpensive instrument." Ms
Ivins said she would mention a "beer belly" and The
Times would substitute "a protuberant abdomen.=E2=80=9D

So Ms. Ivins returned to Austin in 1982 to become a
columnist for the Dallas Times-Herald and reconnecting
with such political figures as Ann Richards, who would
later become governor, and Bob Bullock, then the hard-
drinking state comptroller who later wielded great
power as lieutenant governor.

Trademark language

The column provided Ms. Ivins the freedom to express
her views with the colorful language that would become
her trademark. She called such figures as Ross Perot,
former U.S. Sen. John Tower and ex-Gov. Bill Clements
"runts with attitudes." As a candidate for governor,
George W. Bush became "Shrub," a nicknamed she never
tired of using.

Surprised became "womperjawed." A visibly angry person
would "throw a walleyed fit."

Ms. Ivins, who was single and had no children, told
readers about her first bout with cancer in a matter-
of-fact afterword in an otherwise ordinary column.

"I have contracted an outstanding case of breast
cancer, from which I fully intend to recover," she
wrote on Dec. 14, 1999. "I don=E2=80=99t need get-well cards,
but I would like the beloved women readers to do
something for me: Go. Get. The. Damn. Mammogram. Done."

Ms. Ivins authored three books and co-authored a
fourth. She was a three-time finalist for a Pulitzer
Prize and had served on Amnesty International=E2=80=99s
Journalism Network, but the iconoclastic writer often
said that her two highest honors were being banned from
the conservative campus of Texas A&M University and
having the Minneapolis police name their mascot pig
after her when she covered the department as a reporter
during one of her first jobs in the newspaper business.

Funeral arrangements were pending.

This is sad, indeed. For me, ranks up there with the
passing of so many "heroic" voices.

I'm not so sure we should do this. We all know that Bill's it, but as I say on
my blog (aarontieger.blogspot.com):

"Boston's best poets - the ones who most successfully evoke <i>Boston</i>
(among other things - have all existed outside of any institution, if not
opposed to one. I'm thinking of Wieners, Jonas, Corbett. <i>Columbus Square
Journal</i> or Joe Torra's "Brisk Walk to Harvard Square" are so wonderful
because they evince their sense of place in a completely unsanctioned capacity.
To attempt to render such life official (or to attempt to render it in an
official capacity) is laughable."

Best,
Aaron Tieger

>
> Here's a note I just sent to Chris Emery of Salt regarding a posting by
> "Jen" about Angel Exhaust 19.
>
> Hey Chris--
>
> The posting on Angel Exhaust is wrong.  The ending, on page 142 of issue
> 19 goes like this:
>
> Methan:  Why is it called Devastate your Aunt Jeremy?
> Manly:  It was a misundertanding between the two editors.
> Methan: Are you going to explain the poetic landscape, and your spectrum
> allotment, as a way of telling the reader what to expect?
> Manly: They probably wouldn't know what to expect even if we disclosed
> all that.
> Methan: So what's the poetry like?
> Manly: It is full of wonderfully sibilant s and amazingly lateral l
> sounds.  Let me expand on that if you will.  Corcoran is like Corcoran.
> Glass is like Glass.  Holman is like Holman.  Holman is more like Holman
> than like Morris.
> Methan:  I've never heard of them.
> Manly: Maybe you should read Angel Exhaust.
>
> Not a word in Duncan's back page note about Mssrs. Philpot or Nolan.
>
> Jen's telling a fib that you should correct to set the record straight.
>
> Jesse Glass
>
> Take a look at "Jen's" posting at Saline and you'll see what a little
> creative fibbing can accomplish.

>
> Elizabeth Bishop in Brazil
>
> Elizabeth Bishop lived in Brazil more or less
> continuously from 1951 to 1966 and then intermittently

> from the deprived and anxious world of her early
> childhood. Creative Writing Brazil will have a
> discussion about Bishop's life and work in Brazil. We
> can also assist you with your travel plans to visit
> Elizabeth Bishop's house in Ouro Preto and other noted
> Bishop landmarks in Brazil. Also, introduce you to
> renowned Bishop scholars and translators of her work.
> -----
>
> Tour of Sao Paulo & Salon Reading
>
> Throughout the week, everyone will be having casual
> get togethers with leading Brazilian poets, editors,
> writers, and publishers. An important aspect of the
> workshop is an interaction between participants and
> their contemporary counterparts in Brazil. You will
> visit important cultural sites, bookstores, and
> literary landmarks. All participants will have an
> opportunity to read at the Salons in Sao Paulo and New
> York City. Also, Rattapallax magazine will assist with
> the publication of the work produced during the
> workshops in literary and online journals.

In death match, fearless poets spar but haiku lives
by Joanna Connors, the Plain Dealer

Thursday, February 01, 2007

The first thing you have to consider when you're putting on a death match any sort of death match -- is lo cation. Venue.

Where will the idea of fighting to the death be accepted without a lot of fuss? You want a certain comfort level among the spectators, a familiarity with bulletproof vests and hand-to-hand combat. A sense of history would help, too.

So it came to pass that Cleveland's second official Haiku Death Match took place Wednesday at high noon at City Hall, in the rotunda, where the marble floors and columns echo with the names "George Forbes" and "Dennis Kucinich" and "Mike White." Where mayors have donned bulletproof vests to face their people, and city council presidents have brought to mind the gladiators of ancient times.

CALL FOR PAPERS

A Special Issue of The Wallace Stevens Journal

Topic: Sound in Stevens

Given Wallace Stevens' pronouncements about the significance of sound
and the prominent attention to sound and sonic phenomena throughout his
poetry, it is time again to devote attention to this important facet of
his poetics. This special issue of The Wallace Stevens Journal welcomes
papers on any aspect of the expressivity of sound in Stevens.
Particularly welcome are papers on the rhythms of Stevens' verse as well
as articles that introduce new scholarly directions since the Fall 1991
WSJ volume, "Stevens and Structures of Sound." Suggested topics follow:

* Stevens' play with the sonic properties of English, French, and other
foreign or symbolic languages
* The role of rhythm and other sonic poetic structures in Stevens' verse
* The non-semantic and other properties of sound that might interest Stevens
* Explications, with examples, of Stevens' famous pronouncements and
winking subterfuges regarding the role of sound and the sound of words
in poetry
* The range of human and non-human speakers in Stevens' verse
* Consideration of how sound in Stevens may or may not connect with
Stevens' politics
* Critical resistance or impediments to studies of sound and rhythm in
Stevens
* The significance of Stevens' experiments with sound in relation to
other modernist as well as later experimental writers
* Reflection on Stevens' reading style and reception of his poetry
readings, live and recorded

Papers should be sent by July 15, 2007, to:

Natalie Gerber
Department of English
277 Fenton Hall
SUNY Fredonia
Fredonia, NY 14063

dear listmemebers,

it has been long time since i wrote something for this list. now, i =
would like to comment the site of green integer. surfing, i came upon =
it, and was really amaizing to see so much poets all arround the world, =
including the former yugoslav poets! which i find really great! i was =
specially interestied in the poets from serbia, i am from serbia, and i =
was so sad to see that some right wing oriented poets are on the list... =
 and now i think about how in small cultures such as serbia, you cannot =
have a second scene, because we are all 'one big family', right and =
left, and every poet who ever wrote experimental poetry is erased, =
acctually could not be establish as a poet of any value,  it doesnt fit =
into the picture of great national poetry, and what you call moderate =
modernisam and postmodernism, or what you call(ed) mainstream poets just =
that kind of poetry do exist. other kind of poets cannot survive, they =
are out of sight, out of attention of dominant culture, and of course, =
they could never be in attention of outside gaze, outside attention. i =
find it very very sad...  i dont know how are in other cultures outside =
usa.....

Spring Workshops at the Poetry Project


The Poetry School Of Poetry =AD  Douglas Rothschild
Tuesdays at 7 Pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 13th

Writing  poetry is difficult; writing good poetry, more difficult still. In
this  workshop, we will focus on exactly what we think is good in a poem &
determine how our senses of aesthetics inform our responses to this
question. Working within our own aesthetic notions we will then begin to
refine our  writing, & help each other to write the best poems that we can.
The workshop  will conduct a number of actual experiments with writing that
will allow us to  step outside the world of id, which wants to keep all the
beautiful words,  & into the artistic self, which understands which pieces
fit & which  belong elsewhere. We will also engage the basic Poetry School
of Poetry premise  that the poet=B9s first job is to learn how to edit. Dgls
N. Rthschld has been  behind the foods table at the New Years Reading more
times than it is worth  mentioning. He has also written a number of
chapbooks, the most ground breaking  entitled The Minor Arcane.  He has
taught what seem to be innumerable college writing classes, and is
currently teaching at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, a CUNY
school.=20


The Visible Unseen: Writing Outside Borders =AD Akilah Oliver
Thursdays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 15th

Are  poetry and prose virtual realities, simulations of something other, or
the real  thing? Where does the =B3I=B2  live? How many moments exist in  the
moment of the line? What  borders of form are crucial for us to hang on to =
&
which boundaries are  collapsible? In this workshop, we  will explore the
connections and tensions between the visible and the unseen  world/s, not a=
s
dualities or binaries, but as complementary sites of  composition. Through
engagement with text (written and visual), public spaces, the imagination,
dreams and Eros, participants are invited to think of writing as that which
re-imagines the known and the unknown. Though this is a text based workshop=
,
poets, prose writers, and artists from all disciplines are welcome. Reading=
s
include: Giorgio Agamben, Laura Mullen, Whitman, Anne Waldman, Derrida, &
Ben Okri. Akilah Oliver is the  author of the she said dialogues: flesh
memory, An Arriving Guard of Angels, Thusly  Coming to Greet, a(A)gust, &
The Putterer=B9s Notebook. She is faculty at the Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics Summer  Writing Program at Naropa University.


Impurity  Rocks! A Poetry Lab & Workshop =AD Joanna Fuhrman
Fridays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 16th

The class will focus on  =B3impure=B2 poetry, poetry that employs a mixture of
tones and styles. Special  emphasis will be placed on works that combine
narrative and humor with  linguistic and imagistic disjunction. In-class
exercises and take-home assignments  will touch on issues of scale, space,
sound, genre and wordplay. Time will also  be devoted to reading published
poems as well as in-depth discussions and  critiques of student work. Joann=
a
Fuhrman is the author of three collections of  poetry, Freud in Brooklyn,
Ugh Ugh Ocean and Moraine, all published by Hanging Loose Press. She has
taught poetry  writing at The University of Washington, The Cooper Union
Saturday Outreach  program and in the New York City Public Schools.


Poetry  For The Page, Stage, And Computer Screen =AD Thomas Savage
Saturdays At 12 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 17th

This  course is a writing workshop where students' writing is the main
focus.  Also used as inspiration and writing prompts will be samples of wor=
k
by  writers from The Beats, Black Mountain poets, The New York School (all
generations), Language Poetry, Poets Theater, Pablo Neruda, and works being
published today online, among other sources. Practices will include  readin=
g
as well as writing assignments and, in a great Poetry Project tradition,
in-class writing. Thomas Savage has written eight published books of  poems
including most recently Bamiyan Poems, Brain Surgery Poems and Political
Conditions/Physical  States. His poems  have appeared in many print and
online venues including The New York Times, Hanging Loose, Rattapallax, Big
Bridge, Black Box, and regularly on the Wryting-L website. He has taught
poetry  workshops at The Poetry Project and Tribes Gallery.

I forward this announcement from Tim Atkins (English/London Transnational
Poet) who is the editor of Onedit, an online mag. Apart from the fact that I
am in it (and if you are hungering for more poems and fragments from
Sleeping With Sappho, there is a robust number of them) (end of
parenthesis!), Tim is an acute, smart editor (as well as a lively, totally
irreverent - i.e. 'contemporary' - translator of Horace) and he does real
well with selecting and presenting \ the work of a robust range of
characters, I mean, poets.

Enjoy,

Stephen Vincent

there isn't really a &quot;deconstructionist&quot; theory -- and it's profoundly odd to think of deconstruction as a theory that a poet would then &quot;represent.&quot;

Still, if you're really interested in deconstruciton and poetry, a good place to look would be in Derrida's essays on Jabes and Ponge --

Sure there's a deconstructionist theory. it's the theory that the method of deconstruction produces valuable outcomes when applied to texts.

and i thought he meant "representing" deconstruction in the sense that LL Cool J can be said to be "representing" Queens.

When I was studying Deconstruction, I often wrote poems ABOUT it. . .and
attempted to "stay true" to Derrida as meager as my understanding was. . .

well, and some of the best poets were theorists like Kant. I mean, he
writes using bricks, which look ugly if you don't step back to see the
architecture that he's  building up. Whereas Hegel writes more like
Virginia Woolf--because of the way that he constructs sentences, I
mean.

& maybe that would be a good way to start, looking for a poet who
writes "sentences"  with a perforated horizon (i am thinking of
melville here of course.)

Dubravka,
Green Integer is, yes, one of the publishing houses I
most admire. Their catalogue is...droolworthy. Green
Integer makes me *swoon*. Beautiful little books, too.
Everyone should pore carefully over the wonders of
Green Integer Review and its previous incarnation.
And, you might read Douglas Messerli's (sorta the
mastermind behind Green Integer, I believe) comments
and poems on the Argotist Online lately.
Amicalement,
Alex

Well if "poets" can include Kant and Hegel,
maybe we should also look at , oh, Bart Starr.

I remember that for Paul de Man, Rousseau was the one writer who could not be deconstructed--who was always, so to speak, way out in front of the reader/critic.

Re: Joanna Connors in her column in the Arts & Life section of today's (Thursday, February 1, 2007) Plain Dealer, reviews the Haiku Death Match sponsored by Mayor Frank Jackson's Rotunda Art Committee

http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/1170322671208500.xml&coll=2

Too bad this story -- and the Haiku Death Match -- perpetuates the sorry misunderstanding of haiku as 5-7-5 syllables in English. In Japanese, they count sounds, not syllables, so if one writes 17 syllables in English, it's a much longer poem than what the Japanese write. Scholars and translators, not to mention the vast bulk of leading haiku poets writing in English, have put this to bed long ago (shall I list them?), yet still the misperception of haiku is rampant in North America and elsewhere in the English-speaking world. Not only is 5-7-5 the wrong target in English, but where's the season word, the cutting word or two-part juxtaposition, the sensory objective imagery? That's nearly never taught in schools. Major textbooks and curriculum guides are frequently wrong, misguided, partial, or superficial. It's a shame, and does disservice to haiku as literature in English. And books such as *Honku*, *Haikus for Jews*, and their misguided ilk merely perpetuate these misperce
ptions. It's simply pseudo-haiku -- haiku in name only -- while serious haiku poets who appear in the pages of *Modern Haiku* or *Frogpond*, or in anthologies such as Cor van den Heuvel's *The Haiku Anthology* (third edition from W. W. Norton, 1999) get insufficient respect. What can be done about these misperceptions?

I'm sure the Haiku Death Match was a lot of fun, but it does perpetuate the misunderstanding.

This might seem a rhetorical question meant to stir waters, but believe me,
it is not:
what do poets represent?

Why is it then that whenever I see a transliteration of a Japanese haiku it gives every appearance of having seventeen syllables? E.g., "natsu-gusa ya / tsuwamono-domo-ga / yume no ato" (Basho)

Too bad this story -- and the Haiku Death Match -- perpetuates the sorry misunderstanding of haiku as 5-7-5 syllables in English. In Japanese, they count sounds, not syllables, so if one writes 17 syllables in English, it's a much longer poem than what the Japanese write. Scholars and translators, not to mention the vast bulk of leading haiku poets writing in English, have put this to bed long ago (shall I list them?), yet still the misperception of haiku is rampant in North America and elsewhere in the English-speaking world. Not only is 5-7-5 the wrong target in English, but where's the season word, the cutting word or two-part juxtaposition, the sensory objective imagery? That's nearly never taught in schools. Major textbooks and curriculum guides are frequently wrong, misguided, partial, or superficial. It's a shame, and does disservice to haiku as literature in English. And books such as *Honku*, *Haikus for Jews*, and their misguided ilk merely perpetuate these
 misperce
ptions. It's simply pseudo-haiku -- haiku in name only -- while serious haiku poets who appear in the pages of *Modern Haiku* or *Frogpond*, or in anthologies such as Cor van den Heuvel's *The Haiku Anthology* (third edition from W. W. Norton, 1999) get insufficient respect. What can be done about these misperceptions?

I'm sure the Haiku Death Match was a lot of fun, but it does perpetuate the misunderstanding.

I don't have an immediate answer to your question of "why", though I
believe Michael Dylan Welch is right about this. Most of this covered in
William Higginson's Haiku Handbook, but even in the haiku entry in
Wikipedia one can learn that a haiku is generally (there are exceptions) 17
*on* or sounds, more like a *mora*, "a phonetic unit similar but not
identical to the syllable of a language such as English." It's true that 17
English syllables is generally longer than a Japanese haiku. A syllable in
English may also carry a meaning in a different way than an "on" in
Japanese. Generally a 17-syllable haiku in English seems noticeably longer
than a haiku in Japanese, if only a little bit.  But the syllable-length
issue may be a less dynamic question than the others Welch brings up, i.e.
various things about seasonal words, cutting words, juxtapositions, "haiku
mind," the frequent practice of linked haiku or renga (sometimes renku) to
form a longer work, etc.

Did I read once that in Japanese haiku there is something called a
"delayed verb"--or maybe it's just delayed action: that there is no
overt action in a haiku until the last line--maybe even no verb until
the last line--and that this is a function of Japanese grammar that we
can't do in English grammar?  --ShaunAnne

sure, a poet must not be seen as the theorist's spokesperson.
however, from a purely academic perspective, many critics opine that John
Ashbery constructs the best example from west.

Dubravka:

This is a fascinating comment & something that I suspected also. It
would be interesting to here Douglas Messerli's comments on this. I'm
also hoping you could give a few examples of these new experimental
Serbian poets & any translations that might be available online.
Certainly with the advent of the web, it must be much easier for un
(der)represented to establish a virtual presence, which is at least a
beginning to achieving a bit of recognition.  Or if nothing else
propose to one of these monstrous poetry webzines like Jacket or Big
Bridge to put together a collection of the poets you think are
beneath the radar.

& for myself I would be also interested to know if there is a
historical Serbian avant garde of which we in the west know nothing...

and just what would the "method" of deconstruction be?  and supposing
that there were a "deconstructionist," how would such a person go
about this representing?

"There is no one, single deconstruction.  Were there only one, were
it homogeneous, it would not be inherently either conservative or
revolutionary, or determinable within the code of such
oppositions.  That is precisely what gets on everyone's nerves."

"'deconstruction is firstly this destabilization on the move in, if
one could speak thus, 'the things themselves'; but it is not negative."

"what it does is less to disturb them than to bring into the open
that which is disturbing them and menacing their consistency, their
order, their pertinence. "

I had a feeling that e-mails like Aldon Nielsen's would start to arrive.
What is it about Derrida that brings out this kinda "gotcha" in people?

Deconstruction is a practice like any other. I'll venture that it's far
more pinned down by norms than poetry.

I wonder if Derrida lists give these kind of responses about poetry.
Actually, I bet they do!

I don't have an immediate answer to your question of "why", though I=20
believe Michael Dylan Welch is right about this. Most of this covered in

William Higginson's Haiku Handbook, but even in the haiku entry in=20
Wikipedia one can learn that a haiku is generally (there are exceptions)
17=20
*on* or sounds, more like a *mora*, "a phonetic unit similar but not=20
identical to the syllable of a language such as English." It's true that
17=20
English syllables is generally longer than a Japanese haiku. A syllable
in=20
English may also carry a meaning in a different way than an "on" in=20
Japanese. Generally a 17-syllable haiku in English seems noticeably
longer=20
than a haiku in Japanese, if only a little bit.  But the syllable-length

issue may be a less dynamic question than the others Welch brings up,
i.e.=20
various things about seasonal words, cutting words, juxtapositions,
"haiku=20

And though he certainly never intended it to spin the way it did and still does, Derrida himself acknowledged the practice of deconstruction and clarified its intent many times over.  For an easy start, his earlier interviews (first volume of collected - title escapes me right now) work well.

  His thinking through poetry and process, as related to deconstruction, among other considersations, are evidenced in his focus on a few poets' work, especially on de Man, though their relationship is hotly debated, for obvious reasons.

  My last post of the day, so happy weekend all!

While I think it's a good idea to understand that 5-7-5 is simply a
convenience of sorts, even something of a mistranslation (even
something of a cultural oversight), I feel about this pretty much the
way I feel about bending any formal rule.  I.e., it's fun to use
5-7-5 as an arbitrary constraint in composing haiku, just as it's fun
to use 14 lines as an arbitrary constraint in composing sonnets.
(Which latter might not result in 14 lines, ysee, but that won't keep
me from calling it a sonnet.)

Granted, correcting the misconception is one thing. But having fun
with same is quite another, which, to me, is one reason I write
poetry.

Best,

Joe

mIEKAL,

The avant-garde in a country like Serbia, or others places, may work
differently, having other points of reference. Is the avant-garde more a
matter of spirit, rather than associated with a specific style? Is it a
style or an idea?

The virtual space gives us a chance to discuss these points without all of
us being around a coffee house table though that would be even better.

Ciao,

Murat

Hiroaki Sato, who translated I think all the poems in his Japanese anthology
(Literature of Eight Islands?), said that a haiku is written in a single
line and the division into three lines (5-7-5) was a western invention. He
even had done a series of haiku translations in single lines, very
interesting ones since they undercut exactly that split between objective
concrete (nature) and concluding inspiration.

Of course, I do not know how much of this Hiro made up.

Those, certainly, but also his youthful, hyper-romantic love poems to
Jenny von Westphalen -- which City Lights published a long time ago.

See also Peter Demetz, "Karl Marx and the Poets," and S.S.
Prawer, "Karl Marx and World Literature" -- Marx was always inspired
by poetry.

I thought it was a gesture to deconstruction.

Jeff just told me he traded the Saab in for a new Focus wagon. I am glad

I am forwarding this following note from Doug Messerlli:


I just wanted to say that my ongoing PIP (Project for Innovative Poetry)
listing on the Green Integer site is not meant to be a tombstone to some
sort of past notion of poetic achievement, but an ongoing bibliographic
resource with vital younger poets added as they publish new and major poetic
work.
Accordingly, I seek out any suggestions and additions, simply asking for
complete bibliographical material, a photo, and a listing, in the original
language, of the books (with publisher name, city and date).
With regard to Dubrvka Djuric's statements, accordingly, the writers she
enjoys and world obviously hope to promote do not necessarily need to be
"erased" or ignored. Green Integer also seeks out new translations on any
interesting figures in any language.

mIEKAL,

The avant-garde in a country like Serbia, or others places, may work
differently, having other points of reference. Is the avant-garde more a
matter of spirit, rather than associated with a specific style? Is it a
style or an idea?

The virtual space gives us a chance to discuss these points without all of
us being around a coffee house table though that would be even better.

Ciao,

I've seen a great deal of poetry in the last few years which seems to my limited understanding of the term "deconstruction" to have been the product of deconstruction.  This led me to ask a question on my blog (shantideva2.blogspot.com) "Which is more basic to the act of creation, construction or deconstruction?"  So far, no one has answered my question.  If anyone is interested, I would be interested in seeing some replies.  Regards, Tom Savage

Forward this to Poetics for me?

Yes, just like cereal, except poets think better.  Poets also taste better.

I may be "old-fashioned" or just clueless, but I learned deconstruction =
as a process of reading / analyzing texts, in my case texts in the =
ancient Greek & Latin canon.=20

for instance, one demonstration of deconstructive practice came from my =
Latin prof, who discussed Catullus' use of a term in Carmen 2 (passer =
=3D both "sparrow" and "term of endearment [in an obscene sense]") -- so =
the following passage can be read, simultaneously, on two levels:

Passer, deliciae meae puellae,
quicum ludere, quem in sinu tenere,
cui primum digitum dare adpetenti...=20

[Passer], delight of my girlfriend,=20
who plays with it, holds it in her lap,=20
for whose advances she offers her finger...

you can read passer as "sparrow" *and* "cock," and the dissonance -- or =
at least two-levelness -- creates a lexical or semantic tension that is =
not resolved.=20

as I write this, it strikes me that this is nothing more than an =
elaborate pun -- am I off the track re: deconstruction? or is =
deconstruction just "havin' fun with texts"?

two digressions:

Carl-Michael Bellman (18th c.) used to put polyglot dirty jokes in his =
songs, so that one (I don't remember which) throws in "ge bj=F6rnen mat" =
a propros of nothing else in the piece -- "give the bear food" -- but =
when pronounced in Swedish, this phrase actually says something very =
rude in Russian.=20

has anyone else in List-land tried reading Finnegans Wake with an Irish =
accent? you pick up on a lot of buried information if you try this -- it =
dawned on me reading one passage that "damn fairy ann" could be read as =
"donc fait rien" -- then the whole page morphed into a kind of Joycean =
French argot, before my eyes... and no, I was perfectly sober at the =
time.

------

so, ultimately, what I'm asking: isn't deconstruction the recognition of =
multiple readings of a given text, where each and all exist =
simultaneously and in conjunction with every other reading? in other =
words, can one claim it to be similar to negative capability?

forgive the intrusion -- have a disorienting and wonder-making weekend.=20

Bowering pretty much hit it out of the ballpark with Bart Starr

and then later someone else with the cereal as poetry too (yum--i
wanna be a shortstop to god).

(if you don't see the beauty of Bart Starr as poetry just read the
last page of chapter 3--i think  it's ch. 3 of De la
Grammatologie...or is it the last page of chapter 1? it's within the
last 3--

where

it all all starts with the violence of plowing a furrow into a field....

that would be the best place to start the big tour).

and if you ever want to talk about the beautiful metaphors that math
makes, or the justice implied in algebra...

i was just about to say when the computer stopped:

theory doesn't kill poetry, people do.

[if you run into those people who are gutting these beautiful
buildings to use them as weapons, as people do, smack 'em for me
please because you can be sure they're just taking pieces off the
surface...the insides are nice and most philosophers say that poetry
is the highest form of thinking after all--that's why i left that
field for this one anyhow.]

Dear BuPo,

Can anyone point me towards critical notes/essay concerning the works
of Michael Palmer, Claude Royet-Journoud or Anne-Marie Albiach? I'm
also looking for a discussion of the analytic lyric if anyone has
anything.

I've got Norma Cole's *Crosscut Universe,* but not sure where else to
find the goods. If anyone knows anything or has written something
they'd be willing to send me, it would be greatly appreciated.

Working on a thesis examining these figures and the Argentine poet,

yes, i am happy to have one book of green integer, i admire douglas messerli
work, we met more than 10 years ago, which was so important for me, and i
translated some of his poems, and i wrote about the anthologies: language
poetries, and along with silliman's from american tree, it was back in 1988
the first book i menaged to get in then socialist yugoslavia, and then
started my interest in language
poetry and poets... from his introduction in that anthology i learned lot of
language poetry and poets, and the 'from other side of century' is one of
the
most important anthologies of us innovative poetry in my library. and i was
so sad when few years ago  i heard that sun and moon doesnt exist anymore,
and i was happy when i got from messerli first book in my library of these
beautiful green integer books...

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

thanks to douglas messerli and michael end for their comments!

i will try to elaborate what i see as problematic... small culture =
usually severly excluds radical poetry, and it is usually that academics =
and critics construct narrative of national 'radical' poetry from the =
very moderate modernist/postmodernist and in the worst case of =
antimodernist poets and their poetry. as one example i will mention the =
name of one of the most celebrated poets, who in last 16 years win all =
national prices, who i think recently enters serbian academy of science, =
milosav tesic (i think that i saw his name listed). he  wrote the most =
regressive poetry in serbia today. his poetry is one of the most =
important in the construction of new postsocialist serbian sociaty, that =
is closed society, fundamenatlist and nationalistc  in meny ways, =
religious, and etnic and for sure antiinnovative. if i appy language =
poet's materialistic theory of verse, then it is that on the simbolic =
level the kind of poetry that poets wrote is in some relations to the =
dominant national project or to, on the contrary to the oppositional =
political project. many poets that i find in this list were 'radical' 20 =
or 30 or 70s years ago, and today, i.e. after 1991 most of them become =
very conservative.=20

when i first in 1988 read and translated first texts by language poets =
(bernstein, silliman, hejinian, watten, etc) i said to myself, these =
crazy us poets connect politic and ideology with poetry, what it has to =
do with eachother... but after 1991, as a literary critic, thanks to my =
translations of language poets, i realized that many, most, almost all, =
urban belgrade poets from 70 became in poetry opsessed with nation, =
religion, and the shift was obvious: their poetry in 70s and 80 were =
urban, individualsitc, usually inhereting modernist traditions but never =
was too much experimental, but with postsocialism, they started being =
involved in (re)construction of national and religious identities, and =
ideology of colosed society so instead of individual 'I', urban =
landscapes, colloquial urban language, you had 'i' which is actualy 'we' =
(the 'i' is important if she/he belongs to the national or religious =
community in a fundamental way, and patriarchal 'we'). language became =
very archaic, they introduced traditional poetc devices, and instead of =
urban poetry, you could read just and only the rural ones (with rare =
exceptions).=20

the other thing is the question what is innovative in a local context. i =
will start with the quotation of the croatian poet and theoretician from =
70s and 80s who wrote long ago, refering to slovene, croatian and =
serbian literatures at that time. he wrote that understanding of =
literature in this nations "always involved notion of a political =
dimension. so this is how the amalgam that identified language with =
national values was created, also forming a literature that served as an =
articualtion of national self-importance. in this way, the language =
almost automatically become a national value, just like mythology, =
political victories and defeats. language could not be entrusted to =
someone who mutilated it (srecko kosovel), who expressed national =
defeatism, because readings turned on the national political issue above =
all else. " i quoted this because the most radical avant-garde poets =
from the begining of the 20s century like ljubomir micic and his brother =
branko ve poljanski (complicated case, serbs from croatia, who in zagreb =
in early 20s established avant-garde magazine zenit, then moved to =
belgarde - so they are croatian and serbian avant-garde For the magazine =
SEE website of belgrade national library: =
http://www.digital.nbs.bg.ac.yu/novine/zenit ), were never, specially in =
serbia established as cultural value. according to that, in the end of =
60s and during seventies, in slovenia, croatian and vojvodina (northen =
part of serbia) begun the radical practices, most of that formations =
were in some relation with conceptual art, similar international  art =
movements, but at that time just slovenian radical poets were in =
slovenia established as cultural value, you all know of tomaz salamun =
was one of then. in serbia the most radical poets were even today =
excluded from the company of poets who are wothy of any mentioning. they =
would be accepted if they change their practice start writing prose, or =
start writing more acceptable kind of poetry
.
and of course, there were poets who were in 70 established as 'radical' =
poets, but if i have in mind practice of language poets, their =
radicalism would be questioned. but there were practices that were =
radical as language poets at that same time. most of those poets were =
conceptual artists, but were and still are too radical for the dominant, =
as you say middlebrow, culture. and in that culture there is NO place =
for innovative, experimental poetry, in its 'purist' way.=20
=20

i find on green integer list names of srecko kosevel (mentioned in the =
quotation above, slovenian avant-garde poet from 20s, died very young) =
and miroslav krleza (croatia) who lived long and was before first world =
avant-garde, between 2 world war was representative of bourgoise high =
modernism, and from that time he was against avant-garde, and after =
second world he was official play writer and among  the most influental =
figures in socialist time. vasko popa was the most important serbian =
poet of socialist modernism.... these figures are today counterstones,  =
constitutive figures, of national of literatures but are not the =
representatives of radical innovative poetry practices (except srecko =
kosovel).=20

in 1923 branko ve poljanski published a book panics under the sun =
(panika pod suncem). in his introduction poljanski wrote " bogdan =
popovic will go through needles ears before krmeza (coin: krleza who is =
pig) will understand me,  and his brother micic ednded the foreward with =
the words: "our fatherland was the sadest that when we had to be born in =
there." when i read them today, i realised that nothing changed.

but i think and i hope that it is time for us to see what is and that =
was experiment poetry in a small national cultures ... because it is =
critical method that is established in us language poetry.

I answered this mail and it disappeared (deconstructed to its inexistence)

I was saying that I appreciate what you are writing especially your notes o=
n
J. Joyce.

And that in vulgar Italian "uccello" (bird) is a cock. Well, not "sparrow"
(passero) but we are close. And for those who have read some Catullus, not
the one I was supposed to read at high school, this makes sense.

Fox, dreaming of the space between human and

"Humans and beasts are different species, but foxes are between humans and
beasts. The dead and the living walk different roads, but foxes are between
the dead and the living. Transcendents and monsters travel different paths,
but foxes are between transcendents and monsters. Therefore one could say to
meet a fox is strange; one could also say it is ordinary."

thank you murat for this comment, when i read it, it occured to me the
important question WHO IN ONE LOCAL CONTEXT HAS A POWER TO DEFINE WHAT IS
INNOVATIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL.  and as far as i remember, many critic here
wrote about the poet i mentioned as original and innovative.

the other thing regarding vasko popa that occured to me is: how one 'small'
culture reprezents itself for itself, and how it represents itself for other
cultures. then, who is transisser into other culture, how he or she
represents poetry and context of the poet re want to represent, and what is
transmissor's  poetical/political status in his or her culture, and how
poets in that culture will accept the other, the work of the poet who
through the translation enters their own cultural, and political and poetica
context. what purpose this work will seve in that culture where it is
introduced. being connected for the start with radical  artistic context,
popa was author who was not importatnt at all. few years ago i was kindly
invited by the fellow poet to participate in a round table on his work, and
for the first time i read him, at list some major works, and what i find,
that his poetry is dealing with all metanarratives of socialist former yu
society... inscribing himself into the canon of great and important national
poets.... and he was really important poet in introducing socialist
modernism in serbia, after period of socialist realism, but that kind of
poetry is not important for me. there is need to constract different canons,
here too!


as a long time translator of us poetry, i started in 1984 translating black
mountain poets, first of all robert duncan and denise leverotv, and when i
discovered in 1988 language poets, i constantly transltae this kind of
poetry, and i could now conceptualize it, that i fill the gap in my own
culture, the kind of work i would like to have in my culture and it serve me
to make my own poetical context.

another exhamples. in 1986  working within theoretical/artist community for
space investigation i decided to write about modern and postmodern dance. in
usa and german library i find many books on isadora duncan, ruth st denis,
mary wigman, etc. but at the begining of 1990s in belgrade used bookshops my
husband misko suvakovic and i found the books by maga magazinovic, who was
pupil of rudolf laban, and other improtant dance and theater persons from
the beginning of 20 century. and i havent heard of her in my own culture.
recenlty, after i finished a huge work on usa experimental women poets, i
start again reading micic, poljanski and few other poets, and understand
that i have to search for paund, marinetti, kruchonik, and i have in my own
culture the best exhamples from the same or little later period....

Are chapbooks just limited to poetry?  Cervena Barva, a small press in
Boston, is trying experiments with "chapbooks" in fiction, too.  They just
published one of mine called Out of the Arcadian Ghetto.

This is the post I wanted to reply to and waited.  Now Poetics emails  seem
to have dried up and are bypassing me:  This happened in Sept., too,  but then
I let it go.  Somehow I started receiving Poetics mail again in  January.
Last summer I wrote an email every 3 weeks or so that must have  had too little
to do with Poetics, which I take to mean international politics  via poetry, or
poetry via int'l politics, and had to do with North American  non-poets who
were in a chronic state of treating disabling conditions or in a  disabling
state of treating chronic conditions ... of how internalized stigma  caused them
to react against one another and to become harmful to their fellow  human
beings; -- it was worse than *thoughts* about our situation that led to  the harm:
 There were housing loss and other alarming hazards.  It was  watching people
become homeless before our eyes.  It was these people's own  hardball
antagonism toward not being *normal.*  *Phobia,* if you can  get people to go in for
it, is treated as a psychological condition for which  there is *therapy.*
Education serves that purpose as well.

*Disabled* people comprise 20% of the U.S. population and *would* represent
the largest minority in the U.S. if they chose to associate, to be inclusive
along the lines of type of *disability.*  Mainly, I think the word
*disability* is misleading because it says nothing for *ability,* and most of  the
*disabled* people I have met are more *able* than not.

Depressives are not viewed as in the *innocent* group, but are  more likely
in the *bad guys* group.  20% of depressives are suicidal;  the rest are not.

I did not have illnesses as a child and had a strong constitution.  I  grew
up feminist, more than my mother, and at an early age, earlier than the  norm:
at 12, I read Ms. Magazine.  So I have those memories to  draw on and try to
recapture.  For years, I was adequately *private* and  stable following dx.
The passing of time, not living as if I were in a  race, and my enthusiasm for
holistic treatment for bipolar -- as if  that were my *job* -- caused a loss in
academic peer structure and the chance  for employment.

A couple of points on haiku.

Everything Michael Dylan Welch said about haiku is accurate.  He's been
writing in the genre a long time.

Sato is a real authority on haiku and no, he didn't make it up about the
1-line, 3-line thing.

Issues around haiku are further confounded by teachers who like the
seventeen syllable rule because it gives them something to teach that's
far simpler than teaching about ‘capturing the moment' or whatever you'd
like to call the ‘spirit' of haiku.  There's also the issue of well-known
English language poets who put out books of haiku in mid-career which
unfortunately usually contain novice-level haiku because they are,
unfortunately, novices at haiku.  People figure that if a well-known poet
writes a three-line sentence and calls it haiku it must be haiku. There's
more, of course but.....

if you really want to know about haiku in English simply get Lee Gurga's
excellent book, "Haiku: A Poet's Guide," Modern Haiku Press, Box 68
Lincoln IL, 62656, USA ($20).  That's the address in the book, but it may
have changed.  I'm sure Lee won't mind me giving you his email as he's
VERY dedicated to haiku.  He's a past editor of Haiku, which is the Poetry
of the U.S. haiku world, also past-pres of Haiku Society of America.

Sure, one can use any formal restraint as a poetic game, as a challenge of
sorts. But as challenges go, in haiku, the syllabic challenge (whatever pattern
 you might choose) is mighty superficial. Indeed, in my years of teaching
haiku,  I've seen that it's the easiest thing in the world for students of nearly
all  grade levels to count their pretty little syllables. Why brag about
pulling on  your underwear all by yourself when your hair is on fire? It's a
trivial  "discipline." And these same haiku, while hitting that trivial target --
again,  an incorrect target in English -- are widely missing the more important
targets.  And most often, these proud 5-7-5ers are completely oblivious to
those other  targets -- ones that are actually more important. Why bother with
arbirary  constraints for haiku when there are far more serious, literary,
challenging,  and effective constraints that you miss in the process of focusing
on  5-7-5?!?

It can be fun to write cinquains or iambic pentameter, or the recent  "Fib"
form (counting syllables in subsequent lines to match the Fibonacci  sequence).
But when it comes to haiku, writing 5-7-5 syllables in English isn't  the
same as following the prescribed syllables of cinquains or pentameter or  Fibs.
That's because following 5-7-5 assumes a "correctness" for that pattern in
English, which isn't accurate when it's really a borrowed form. Yes, sonnets are
borrowed from Italian to English, but at least that's the same alphabet, so
it's  not fraught with the problems of translating from Japanese to English.
It's  folly to translate the number (5-7-5) without thinking more deeply about
what is  being counted. Yet that is precisely what has happened that lead to
the false  conception of haiku being 5-7-5 syllables in English. Quite simply,
when we  apply that pattern to English syllables, we miss the boat. It's
simplistic and  naive.

A person can do whatever they like and call it haiku (Lord knows that's
happened plenty enough). If you're having fun, knock yourself out. But if you're
writing 5-7-5 haiku, it's best to be aware of how you're writing a poem that's
 markedly longer than what is expressed in a Japanese haiku (not all of which
are  5-7-5, by the way). It's best to be aware that you're writing in a
pattern that,  for good reason, pretty much ALL of the leading haiku poets writing
in English  do not follow. It's best to be aware that writing 5-7-5 frequently
creates  artificial syntax and awkward line breaks purely for an unnecessary
constraint  while more important strategies (also constraints) are completely
missed.  Indeed, most 5-7-5 haiku writers tend to be completely unaware of the
other  strategies necessary for traditional haiku, though perhaps that's a
separate  problem, although it's frequently caused by a belief that 5-7-5 is all
there is  to it. In any event, if one aims at seasonality and a two-part
juxtapositional structure, and employs objective sensory imagery, you can let
the rest of form take care of itself (organically). But of course, there's more
to it than that -- writing in the present tense, no titles, no rhyme, seldom
any  similes or metaphors, employing fragments rather than full sentences,
employing  allusion, and more. And perhaps the most important aspect of all --
implication.  It's very hard to do well, to hint at something that the reader
can figure out  on his own, making a leap of understanding that's made possible
because of your  restraint as a poet, because you deliberately left something
out. As I like to  emphasize in haiku workshops, don't write about your
emotion, write about what  caused your emotion. Then, if you do it right, the reader
can  feel what you felt without your having to say so. But of course all of
this is  missed by those who think haiku is only a 5-7-5 syllable-counting
poetry trick.  Some "challenge."

As I say in the title of one of my haiku lectures: "Haiku: It's Bigger Than
You Think." Yet of course, it's also smaller than most English speakers think,
 too.

Michael

P.S. Nearly every serious haiku poet I know has had a progression in their
haiku -- and I'm talking about many hundreds of leading haiku poets who I pay
attention to, perhaps even thousands. They nearly all started out writing
5-7-5,  as did I. And then they progressed to learning the more important aspects
of the  genre (and haiku is best thought of as a genre of poetry, of which
"form" is  just one aspect). At this point, nearly all of them stop writing in
the 5-7-5  pattern. The few exceptions to this progression include those who
went straight  to avoiding 5-7-5 in the first place. But there are clear reasons
for this  progression. It's not that 5-7-5 is "abandoned." Rather, it is
apprehended as  something that was inappropriate in the first place, and causes
many problems in  English. Higher targets are sought -- ones, in fact, that turn
out to be  far more challenging and require far more discipline. If 5-7-5 in
English serves  any useful purpose, it is purely as the first stepping-stone on
a long path.  But, alas, too many people, even otherwise accomplished poets,
stop at just  that first stepping stone with their haiku.

While I think it's a good idea to understand that 5-7-5 is simply  a
convenience of sorts, even something of a mistranslation (even
something of a cultural oversight), I feel about this pretty much the
way I feel about bending any formal rule.  I.e., it's fun to use
5-7-5 as an arbitrary constraint in composing haiku, just as it's fun
to use 14 lines as an arbitrary constraint in composing sonnets.
(Which latter might not result in 14 lines, ysee, but that won't keep
me from calling it a sonnet.)

Granted, correcting the misconception  is one thing. But having fun
with same is quite another, which, to me, is  one reason I write
poetry.

Where does de Man say this? I admit I'm surprised,
since he "deconstructs" the Profession de foi du
vicaire savoyard (Emile) in a very smart paper (one of
the best on the Profession de foi). Rousseau -- see
the Grammatologie -- was a cornerstone of
"deconstructionist" reading practices from the
beginnings of poststructuralism. Far from being
"impossible to deconstruct", if you ask me!
Not to mention: anyone who has read Rousseau carefully
knows that his texts are veritable conundrums,
vertiginous, infinitely tricky and unstable.
"Impossible to deconstruct"? Rousseau's a master of
slippery vocabulary (related terms with unstable
boundaries, reinvented familiar words or notions...),
and he can get you to call black orange in under five
minutes.
So, I'd love to know where (and how, why, etc) de Man
makes this claim.

I agree with that completely. A quick scan of my bookshelf reveals probably more green integer titles than from any other poetry press. A few of my faves:

Arcanum 17, Andre Breton
tender buttons (i think there's another edition in print, but i also seem to recall it's small and printed on cheap paper)
lorca's suites

i just checked the site, and i see that there's a planned release of Berkeley's Three Dialogues which will no doubt be very cool and i intend to buy
quickly. The thing i love about green integer is that they're a publisher you can trust. i often am browsing in a bookstore and will see something by
someone i haven't heard of and buy it, and as a result discover someone amazing. that's actually where my introduction to larry eigner came from, and
I'm very much indebted to messerli for publishing "readiness/enough/depends/on" for that reason.

speaking of math metaphors, my mother, who died a few year ago, wrote a
1000-p. book on math as an art form which remains unpublished. I am sending
chapters to a few math friends of hers but am interested in finding out if
anyone out there knows enough high-level math--set theory esp & can read
complex equations--to edit it, cut it in half. will contact MIT Press too.
Thanks.

Haiku in Japanese is nearly always written and published in a single
verticle line (there are no breaks between the parts of 5, 7, and 5 mora). So  yes,
the three-line form is a Western invention, and Hiroaki Sato (a friend of
mine, and whose translations I've also published in my journal Tundra) advocates
that haiku in English should be a single horizontal line to be equivalent to
Japanese. That's certainly a choice, and many people do write excellent
one-line  haiku in English (some of mine are in one line). However, the argument is
also  made that a single horizontal line doesn't necessarily "look" like
poetry,  whereas the lineations of three lines does. So that's another choice, and
the  three lines do echo the three parts of the Japanese haiku (though
actually,  there is typically the equivalent of enjambment over two of the three
parts in  most Japanese haiku, the other part being set off with a kireji, or
cutting word). I would assert that the three-line convention for
English-language haiku is a perfectly acceptable one, though I also write haiku  in one line,
as well as the occasional "concrete" or visual haiku, and feel no  hesitation
to use more than three lines if the poem seriously warrants it. There  are
other factors that are more important.

Hiroaki Sato's *From the Country of Eight Islands* was cotranslated with
Burton Watson. Watson translated some of the haiku therein, as I recall, and
they appear in three lines. Sato's haiku translations (in other books) are
occasionally in three lines, though typically he uses a single line. He also
avoids all punctuation, which can be confusing but also create interesting
ambiguities, so that again is another choice.

Hiroaki Sato, who translated I think all the poems in his  Japanese anthology
(Literature of Eight Islands?), said that a haiku is  written in a single
line and the division into three lines (5-7-5) was a  western invention. He
even had done a series of haiku translations in  single lines, very
interesting ones since they undercut exactly that split  between objective
concrete (nature) and concluding inspiration.

Of  course, I do not know how much of this Hiro made  up.

I think poets are usually ahead of the game. Why do you think most theorists write about exclusively old literature (the canon)?

"Constructivism" seems a better word for the poets who often get "accused" of instantiating Derrida's theories... but I think most poets, including those who love  a lot of theory (of which I'm one), work their own poetics out in practice (which can include dialogues--often playful--with pre-existing theory).

I think "we" (I don't include myself) are often too eager, when we encounter strange poetry, to "justify" its strangeness by explaining it as the manifestation of a theory, rather than looking at what the text is and does, and then thinking about what theory might be possible as a result of that.

As if poetry had to be justified.
That's not meant as a joke about margins.

I like Derrida, but a lot of his thought is decades (at least) behind art. Jameson's analysis of Perelman misses out on the critical terms Perelman's writing makes possible.

I love Bernstein, but his earlier theory (which I also love) gets quoted too much by critics in the process of trying to explain (away?) his poetry, which exceeds that theory in its breathtaking variety, and is irreducible to the latter.

Examples.

some poets are practitioners of Dcvism in the sense that they challenge the
idea that lots and lots of words are needed to say something.

Hi Dubravka,

Thanks for your fascinating post. Also, the tone of it is appealing: it
isn't calling for anybody's head on a platter; it is articulate and
progressive, not bitter or vengeful. You do not play the nationalistic
trumpet but, instead, question the political and poetical value of
aggressive nationalism. You speak for the value of experimental poetry that
introduces critical methods into poetry. That is important in poetry and in
contemporary society.

Poetry needs to be able to deal with situations such as
http://alternet.org/blogs/peek/47507 . Intensest engagement with language,
these days, is not necessarily in a poemy poem on a page. It can happen off
the page and even off the art map. Poetry needs to be able to go there.

i probably should have said methods, but that's splitting hairs. too many useless idiots have made careers out of the kind of obtuse nonsense you
quote from Jacque D below. the method(s) of deconstruction is/are straightforward and more or less uninteresting.

put simply, to deconstruct, one must

1.) pick a text
2.) identify one or more implications of the text
3.) generate a number of bad puns using techniques usually drawn from etymology, linguistics, and semiotics
4.) use those puns as support for a thesis that runs counter to or in some way subverts the implications you have identified in the text.

It's really not all that complex, and there's more than one way to flay that particular feline, and as a result I'm often quite surprised that there's
so much mystique surrounding the idea. Even if it were a valid way to go about constructing an argument, i don't know that it's actually useful in
saying anything about the original text or its author. Moreover, criticism employing such methods is usually so badly written (see, eg, Dissemination,
the rhetoric of romanticism, or laugh of the medusa) that it's often impossible to give it the value of simply being fun to read, which, for example,
one can find in similarly goofy ideas propagated by other schools of thought like the medieval scholastics, the ancient neo-platonists, or some of
derrida's more entertaining, non-deconstructionist peers like Gilles Deleuze or ones who are simply better philosophers like Foucault or Zizek who are
good reads for the quality of argument even though they're wrong about almost everything.

Michael, you're not going to get any argument from me about any of
that, much of which I've come across in my own readings. I'm simply
suggesting that policing a form that isn't, in the first place,
native to English might (might) produce the unintended consequence of
ascribing too rigorously to rather arbitrary, if historically
motivated, formalities. Contrary to many who compose them, sonnets
are not simply about counting syllables or lines either. Me, I'd
rather use the 5-7-5 reflexively, for instance, to challenge the
tendency of some who dabble in non-native forms to produce an
orientalized English. Granted, there are other ways to do this, and
doing this raises  perhaps some vexing issues.

(But see my recent ~Finger Exorcised~, on BlazeVOX, for a page of
doubtless feeble attempts at related haiku humor. Hell, I even use
the incorrect plural, "haikus," as a sort of dirty joke. [Sound it
out -- in English.] But I still feel a few items there manage to use
the constraint to good effect.)

Oh -- but that must be (responding to another thread now, Michael,
this isn't directed at you) -- the "deconstructionist" in me, as per
the committee report that resulted in my second tenure denial.

Anyway. The additional constraints you helpfully elaborate on are
indeed more interesting than the syllable/line game.

Best,

Joe

I think the statement in question is from the interview with Rosso at the =
end of _The Resistance to Theory_, where de Man states:=20

"...I have a tendency to put upon texts an inherent authority, which is =
stronger, I think, than Derrida is willing to put on them. I assume, as a =
working hypothesis (as a working hypothesis, because I know batter than =
that), that the texts *knows* in an absolute way what it's doing. I =
knowthis is not the case, but it is a necesary working hypothesis that =
Rousseau knows any time what he is doing and as such there is no need to =
deconstruct Rousseau. In a complicated way, I would hold to the statement =
that 'the text deconstructs itself, is self-deconstructive' rather than =
being deconstructed by a philosophical intervention from outside the =
text."=20

This is a crucial point and underlies the difference between Derrida on =
Rousseau in _Of Grammatology_ and de Man on Derrida on Rousseau in "The =
Rhetoric of Blindness." Barry and Alex are differing over whether the text =
can be deconstructed by the critic vs. whether the text is "in deconstructi=
on." De Man seems to suggest the latter, shifting emphasis away from the =
work done by the critic to the work already at work in the work. ("I never =
had an idea of my own," says de Man.) It is interesting to note that de =
Man then adds that the difference is that he is a philologist and not a =
philosopher (as Derrida is).=20

Where does de Man say this? I admit I'm surprised,
since he "deconstructs" the Profession de foi du
vicaire savoyard (Emile) in a very smart paper (one of
the best on the Profession de foi). Rousseau -- see
the Grammatologie -- was a cornerstone of
"deconstructionist" reading practices from the
beginnings of poststructuralism. Far from being
"impossible to deconstruct", if you ask me!
Not to mention: anyone who has read Rousseau carefully
knows that his texts are veritable conundrums,
vertiginous, infinitely tricky and unstable.
"Impossible to deconstruct"? Rousseau's a master of
slippery vocabulary (related terms with unstable
boundaries, reinvented familiar words or notions...),
and he can get you to call black orange in under five
minutes.
So, I'd love to know where (and how, why, etc) de Man
makes this claim.
Amicalement,
Alex

the Eyes*, with an introduction by John Berger, was published by Aperture in 2003, and has just
been released in an Italian edition by Postmedia. *The Book of 101 Books: Seminal Photography
Books of the Twentieth Century*, with catalogue essays by Strauss, was published by P.P.P.
Editions and D.A.P. in 2001. *Between Dog & Wolf: Essays on Art & Politics* was published in 1999
by Autonomedia, and *Broken Wings: The Legacy of Landmines* (with photographer Bobby Neel Adams)
came out in 1998. His essays have appeared in a number of recent books and monographs on artists
such as Leon Golub and Nancy Spero, Martin Puryear, Miguel Rio Branco, Francesca Woodman, Carolee
Schneemann, and Alfredo Jaar. He was the founding editor of *ACTS: A Journal of New Writing*
(1982-1990), and author of a book of poetry, *Manoeuvres*, before moving from San Francisco to New
York in 1993. He has been awarded a Logan grant, three Artspace grants, a Visiting Scholar
Research Fellowship from the Center for Creative Photography, a Guggenheim fellowship in 2003-04,
and the Infinity Award for writing from the International Center of Photography in 2006. Strauss
taught at the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College from 2001-05, and is now on the
faculties of both the Graduate School of the Arts and the undergraduate studio art program at
Bard.

In his introduction to *Between the Eyes*, John Berger wrote, “Strauss, who is a poet and
storyteller as well as being a renowned commentator on photography (I reject the designation
critic) looks at images very hard . . . and comes face-to-face with the unexplained. Again and
again. The unexplained that he encounters has only little to do with the mystery of art and
everything to do with the mystery of countless lives being lived.” And Luc Sante wrote, “David
Levi Strauss brings an eloquent and deep moral seriousness to his examination of photography.
Again and again he makes the ringing point that trying to separate aesthetics and politics can
only result in vacuity. He is photography’s troubled conscience.”

Half hope, half fear. Like when people who react against politically committed art say, on the one
hand, that such art is pretentious, delusional, and dishonest, since art is powerless to cause
real political change; and, on the other hand, that this kind of art is irresponsible and
dangerous, since it inflames the passions of the already savage rabble. So which is it, dog or
wolf?

Am I wrong to think then that deconstruction is not going to make a come- back?

It has been passed- over?

I'm not sure that this will go through.

Anyway, deconstruction is not a method or a means of locating subtexts; it
relates on one hand to new criticism (in the sense that it treats the text
as a messy entirety) and on the other to cultural studies (in the sense
that peripheral/diacritical symptoms/tropes are of great importance - and
thexe often subvert or disturb and apprent transparency of the surface).
Years ago I wrote a paper that was used in a course on deconstruction (not
mine); it was on the difference between the Sheffer stroke (not both A and
B) and its dual (neither A nor B) in terms of the history of the shapes of
the symbols in relation to psychoanalytical concerns (feminism, the
phallic, expulsion, etc.). So there's first of all the simple logic
involved, and second, its actual process of construction, its history, and
so forth. The 'subversion' - such as it might be considered - is in using
the (logical) formation to consider issues of origination, the
'primordial,' gender, etc., from the standpoint of this 'veering.'

Deconstruction also references the metaphysics underlying a text - not in
the sense again of _sub_ text - but underlying in the sense of implicit
within it, incoherent within it, the slight edge that tends elsewhere,
that threatens to overturn the text. (Again, years ago I did a Kristevan
analysis of the '10 commandments' (in the Hebrew) along these lines.) So
that what might seem a barrier, is open, and what is open, might seem a
barrier, the gate which isn't a gate (yes, there's a relation to Zen I
think).

All of that said, it's difficult to pin the process down - since it's
neither process or product; I think of it, like glas, as a discourse which
has always already continued and continues to continue, a discourse of
humans which undercuts conclusion, totality, absolute - but which
nonetheless carries a very real political component, activist as well.

To me: "deconstruction" is a sensational term used to hype a technique
that, again, to me, at basics is a way of balancing a text, a way to
provide suggestions in order to improve succeeding instantiations of its
_moral content_ as it's construed of its binaries nexus (sounds like
Baskin Robbins, yes?).  Me, well, I still love existentialism.  Old style.

I hail from the world of visual art first,
and only know the term as a philosphical
one ... the notion of using `deconstruction`
as a formula for literary critique eludes me
since it seems to contradict what Derrida
meant it to represent ... which was not a
formulaic method. (but I also love that
goofy DeleuZe) so maybe I`m just
expressing my incredulity at
deconstruction-as-a-literary device

however, I love your notion of a binary
nexus in Baskin Robbins. Would that
make Hagen Daas an intervenous drip?

respectfully,
joan

i disagree with such
obvious obfuscations
intended to add mystique

what you have described is a method and the things that you say are not subtexts are subtexts. deconstruction is little more than linguistic
legerdemain. I can't respond to your paper about the sheffer stroke because i haven't read it, but the idea of extrapolating issues of gender and
metaphysics from the speculations about the psychology behind the choice of symbols is precisely the sort of deconstructionist nonsense that ought be
avoided at all costs. There are no metaphysics underlying texts because metaphysics is a philosophical card game akin to 52 card pick up that no one
can win or lose. therefore any attempt to "get at" the metaphysics underlying texts (if they really aren't subtexts, which i take to be either a very
dubious assertion or quibbling over terms and either way nonproductive) is doomed to produce only the most unstable and stipulated of philosophical
card houses, the value of which houses is questionable from the outset.

I again assert that deconstruction is a method, and that the method is observable in deconstructivist texts like the ones i mentioned previously. I
personally see no value in such a method and await any supporter of it to show me it's value without invoking meaningless heidegger derived jargon
such as "always already". say "is." it means the same thing. no really, it does.

Actually it doesn't, and your reply is not only harsh but more inclined to
invective than analysis. Go for it. But 'always already' deals with pre-
suppositions, the continuous establishment of a state of affairs, not a
copula. - Alan

Is it really possible that a group of intelligent poets can be so
dumb about deconstruction when they use its understanding of  text
every day?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

Yes, I've found that being a Haiku Cop is tiring -- and surely also  tiresome
to the perps (who may or may not give a hoot). However, I remain buoyed  by
those who are grateful to learn something because, so they say, they hadn't
had a clue before, despite blissfully writing perfect 5-7-5 tripe. In any
event, I'm mostly interested in why haiku is so WIDELY mistaught in North  America,
leading to the popular perception (among the general populace, as well  as
serious poets, even though they should know better) that haiku is simply (and
maybe only) a poem in a pattern of 5-7-5 syllables. Sometimes folks are told a
little bit more, but usually it's still highly superficial and frequently
misguided by the 5-7-5 misunderstanding. So rather than "policing" the genre,
I'm more interested in correcting the idiocy of outdated textbooks and
curriculum guides that perpetuate misunderstands and harmful oversimplifications  of
the genre, in both Japanese and English. But it's so hard to change the
course of these behemoth ocean-liners.

Despite my advocacy for a more informed understanding of haiku, I recognize
that "pseudo-haiku" can still be a lot of fun. I've also tried writing some
myself, and it can be quite a challenge (not merely the 5-7-5 gimmick, but
crafting the poem for other specific purposes). (For a friend's online  comic
strip, I've written a long series of "bad" haiku that are spoken by a  green
goblin. Nothing to do with literary haiku, and quite a challenge to write,  but
they're all perfectly 5-7-5.) But the key thing is that this shallow and
misguided perception of haiku is ultimately detrimental to haiku as literature,
insofar as they perpetuate misunderstandings. (In the comic, the goblin will
probably be killed off because his haiku are so bad -- though of course I like
to think that they're a "good" kind of bad, in the way that Bulwer-Lytton or
"Bad Hemmingway" fiction contest winners are good.)

Some folks have argued that sonnets are more maleable than the 14-line
iambic pentameter that's the most common or traditional. I have no problem with
that for sonnets. However, I am not offering the same defence of malleability in
 support of non-5-7-5 haiku. Rather, it was the wrong target in the first
place,  and exhibited the transfer of the *number* of something while paying no
attention to what is being counted (they count sounds in Japanese, which are
not  always the same as English syllables -- or rather, most English syllables
can  vary a lot more than Japanese ones). So I'm NOT saying that haiku in
English  should avoid 5-7-5 simply because I think haiku should be malleable (the
way  some people think sonnets should be, or are). Rather, I'm saying that
haiku has  a number of aspects to it, and some of those aspects have been found
to be  essential, and translatable, across languages, including structure
(two-part  juxtaposition), seasonal reference, and so on. Form, however, is
problematic. If  you stick with the number, and pay no attention to the differences
between  languages, you end up with 17 syllables in English that says
significantly more  than a Japanese haiku does. It's for good reason that the great
majority of  contemporary translators and the vast majority of leading haiku
poets do not  employ the 5-7-5 pattern, but instead pay greater attention to other
aspects of  structure and content.

Joe, I'll take a look at your ~Finger Exorcised~ on BlazeVOX very soon. And
thanks, Charlie (Rossiter) for your comments. Charlie, in your mention of Lee
Gurga, you meant to say that he edits *Modern Haiku* (you had said just
*Haiku*). It is indeed the *Poetry* of the English-speaking haiku world (the
journal was founded in 1969, and is the magazine of record for haiku in English,
now edited, as you know, by Charles Trumbull). Visit _www.modernhaiku.org_
(http://www.modernhaiku.org)  for more information,  plus many sample essays and
poems. In addition to Lee's fine book, I also  recommend William J.

Subject: Re: Haiku Death  Match

Michael, you're not going to get any argument from me about any  of
that, much of which I've come across in my own readings. I'm simply
suggesting that policing a form that isn't, in the first place,
native  to English might (might) produce the unintended consequence of
ascribing  too rigorously to rather arbitrary, if historically
motivated,  formalities. Contrary to many who compose them, sonnets
are not simply  about counting syllables or lines either. Me, I'd
rather use the 5-7-5  reflexively, for instance, to challenge the
tendency of some who dabble in  non-native forms to produce an
orientalized English. Granted, there are  other ways to do this, and
doing this raises  perhaps some vexing  issues.

(But see my recent ~Finger Exorcised~, on BlazeVOX, for a page  of
doubtless feeble attempts at related haiku humor. Hell, I even use
the incorrect plural, "haikus," as a sort of dirty joke. [Sound it
out  -- in English.] But I still feel a few items there manage to use
the  constraint to good effect.)

Oh -- but that must be (responding to  another thread now, Michael,
this isn't directed at you) -- the  "deconstructionist" in me, as per
the committee report that resulted in my  second tenure denial.

Anyway. The additional constraints you helpfully  elaborate on are
indeed more interesting than the syllable/line  game.

Best,

Joe

Hey Alan, that sounds really interesting:

"Sheffer stroke (not both A and
B) and its dual (neither A nor B) in terms of the history of the shapes of
the symbols in relation to psychoanalytical concerns (feminism, the
phallic, expulsion, etc.)."


How did you parse out the embedded 'or' and its negations? These two choices
look identical (which is why you mention the significance of 'always already'.)

Second glance shows a countermotion: one towards grouping ('not both') and the
other towards distribution (neither/nor).

...


I find Derrida's writing to be a rich reserve of information from which a
'routine' has been lately abstracted. For example, essays in *Writing and
Difference* teach us something about Raymond Rousset's 'ultrastructuralist'
imagination and how this affected his criticism of Corneille. "Force and
Signification" is, on this level, a thematic reading of Rousset's "Form and
Signification". "Violence and Metaphysics" is a philosophical biography of
Emmanuel Levinas as he grapples with Husserl and Heidegger. We learn something
about *Totality and Infinity*. These basic stories get lost in the drift.

I'm not sure this will go through. The two functions are duals of each
other and both can be used as the 'basis' of propositional logic; in other
words, everything in propositional logic can be derived from either of
these. For example if you have | for "neither A nor B" then A|A is simply
"not A" and this also holds for "not both A and B."

And yes, grouping and distribution; they're both "kinds" of expulsion -
A|B simply implies either the null set or "anywhere but here - elsewhere"
- depending on whether A and B are complements, and "not both A and B"
implies both possibly elsewhere and that "veering" - one or the other
possibly, or neither, anything but the intersection.

I haven't thought of Derrida in terms of narrative - can you say more
about this?

Thanks, Alan

Many years ago I read a book about the subject under discussion in these posts called "Deconstruction."  I forget who the author was but it wasn't Derrida.  I came away from this book with the feeling that "Deconstruction" (the idea, process, or concept, not the book), was just a fancy way for saying "to take something apart .  When I said in a previous post that I'd read a lot of poetry influenced by deconstruction, it was to that aspect of it or to my impression of it that I referred. I also tend to associate it with Language Poetry or poetry influenced by the Language group.  Regards, Tom Savage

Last year, there was a good thread among poets about the difference for  them
in publishing in online v. print publications.  Mostly, the biggest
difference was that in print publication, more attention was paid to precision  in
line breaks, layout, and font -- that was their overall  experience.  Now I want
to ask how writers and poets feel about  self-publishing when they encounter
it and at their own websites v. publishing  in online publications.  It seems
sometimes such a small psychological  difference in transitting between the wr
iter's own website v. an  official publication.  What is the bias that suggests
that people who edit  other writers' work are somehow stoic for doing so but
that writers (most  editors are both) are somehow vainglorious for going into
print?   Sometimes I would like to know if it is true -- sometimes it IS true
-- that the  editors of online publications have more editorial acuity than
the writers do  themselves, or if it's a "hands" argument -- having someone
select you and do it  for you by definition carries more weight and prestige.  It
is the same  argument, in smaller and subtler form, inherent in the favoritism
shown for  large houses.  In general, it is taking time (as should be
expected) for  online publications to gain the acclaim of print publications -- even
though  smaller print publications are invariably hard to find and therefore
are  restricted to small library audiences of 2,000 or fewer readers.  Weblogs
are usually female (like the Buckthorn in botany), and so therefore are
deemed  "low" as art goes.  I find certain conversational weblogs to be pure and
engrossing.  I think they may be higher art than some people tend to  realize,
depending on their creator.  It is an exciting way to cut out  middle men and
bullshit.  It is a species of self-publishing.  Topics  weblogs are arguably
valuable to more people.  Other thoughts?  Should  it be harder to access
online publications to increase the sensation that they  are not self-published,
that they have prestige?  Should they be  umbrella-listed at sites such as
webdelsol?

I have to concentrate on Tocqueville but before I do:

when I read your description of what neither A nor B means I think you're on the
verge of switching logical categories from those that stem from forms of
division into forms of equation - 'either/or' for 'if/then.' The vertical bar
you use, "A/A", seems to bespeak a detachment within self-identity that had
begun in disjunction.

It's that connection that I find interesting, narcissistically and perhaps
narratologically speaking. I'm thinking about how to answer that more fully.

An excellent way in to a lot of these questions about what deconstruction is, and what it has to do with literature, would be through an essay by Rodolphe Gasche, "Deconstruction as Criticism," published in Glyph 6: Johns Hopkins Textual Studies (1979): 177-215. (Gasche has also written a couple of books about Derrida, but I haven't read them. His more recent book on Kant's aesthetics is really hard going but worth the effort for anyone interested in the topic.)

I'm not sure about the "if/then" - that implies process; there's also the
"if then else" formulation which works here - if A then not A^B else ??
- and process involves temporality; the "if" also seems itself to be on
the verge or hinge. It might be the difference between temporality and a
state-of-affairs, although both can be considered potentials..

I don't know if you're familiar with Spencer Brown's Laws of Form - he
makes a similar jump between states-of-affairs and temporality (involving
if I remember imaginary quantities) - which again I'm not sure of. But he
starts I think by describing "making a distinction" which is already a
process...

Hi Ann

I've self-published 7 poetry books, 3 novels and 3 recordings. Print
publishers have published 2 books. POD publishers have published 2, with 2
more on the way. I like to think this gives me some knowledge of the
subject, though the scenario is probably changing as we speak.

In today's publishing climate, I have no choice but to be the publisher of
last resort.

As a self-publisher, my books don't sell very well, but I do have
distribution channels for any orders that might come in. Every year I manage
to sell a few copies to college libraries.

My print books published by a small press found their way to college
libraries regularly, probably because Potes & Poets was an established press
and because whoever did the ordering could do a mass order of poetry books
through SPD.

MY POD books have appeared without any problems, probably because I do my
own typesetting; I don't know anybody else who wants the job or could do it
as well, unfortunately, it's probably cost me some publishing opportunities
with some presses. The POD books don't make it to the college libraries or
receive distribution beyond the site where they're sold, e.g., www.lulu.com
or www.cafepress.com.


The biggest problem we face continues to be distribution of our work.

Some POD publishers, such as Geoffrey Gatza of BlazeVox, are finding ways to

improve distribution so that people can find the books at Amazon.com, if not
on the shelf at the local chain or indie bookstore. More publishers might be
doing similar things as I write this.

Whether the works are self-published, print, or POD, the reviews I receive
are about the same, although some magazines seem to avoid reviewing
self-published books.

If the reviews are accurate, I can't say---in relation to my own work,
anyway---that editor and publishers in print or online have more acuity.
I think POD publishers might be more open to publishing edgy work because
they don't have to endure the costs associated with print publishing.
Practical matters involving money might influence or outweigh artistic
judgment.

I do think ezines deserve parity with print zines because they're creating a
literary culture online that is more adventurous than what I read in many
print zines.

I receive the most satisfaction when somebody else publishes me because
it makes me feel that somebody other than me thinks my work is worth
publishing. Although I feel great when a writer sends me a complimentary
book because he considers me "one of the real ones," I don't feel too
satisfied when his publisher returns a manuscript I've submitted on the hope
that the editors will feel the same way about my work as the author does.

Given the nature of the publishing business in a time when corporations
rule, I think the notion that a self-published or POD-published small press
differs in any significant way from the more established small presses
should be discarded. Most of us are really on our own as writers, regardless
of publisher, and have to work every possible angle to get our work out.

Nobody has a monopoly on editorial acuity.

The less work I have to do in relation to publishing and promoting my books,
the more satisfaction I receive. But I'm not holding my breath while waiting
for a publisher to tell me, "You're great, baby, Now, just sit back and
we'll do it all for you., and give you royalties on top of it"

It makes for nice day dreams, but that's about it.

I don't have time to read many blogs, but I wouldn't sell women writers
short. Through her blog, Eileen Tabios has been a great supporter of my
work, almost reviving a book of mine that I'd pretty much considered dead.
She has an excellent site. I think other are better qualified to address the
subject of blogs.

There's my two cents (adjusted for inflation.

Subject: Audience & publishing

Last year, there was a good thread among poets about the difference for
them
in publishing in online v. print publications.  Mostly, the biggest
difference was that in print publication, more attention was paid to
precision  in
line breaks, layout, and font -- that was their overall  experience.  Now I
want
to ask how writers and poets feel about  self-publishing when they encounter

it and at their own websites v. publishing  in online publications.  It
seems
sometimes such a small psychological  difference in transitting between the
wr
iter's own website v. an  official publication.  What is the bias that
suggests
that people who edit  other writers' work are somehow stoic for doing so but

that writers (most  editors are both) are somehow vainglorious for going
into
print?   Sometimes I would like to know if it is true -- sometimes it IS
true
-- that the  editors of online publications have more editorial acuity than
the writers do  themselves, or if it's a "hands" argument -- having someone
select you and do it  for you by definition carries more weight and
prestige.  It
is the same  argument, in smaller and subtler form, inherent in the
favoritism
shown for  large houses.  In general, it is taking time (as should be
expected) for  online publications to gain the acclaim of print publications
-- even
though  smaller print publications are invariably hard to find and therefore

are  restricted to small library audiences of 2,000 or fewer readers.
Weblogs
are usually female (like the Buckthorn in botany), and so therefore are
deemed  "low" as art goes.  I find certain conversational weblogs to be pure
and
engrossing.  I think they may be higher art than some people tend to
realize,
depending on their creator.  It is an exciting way to cut out  middle men
and
bullshit.  It is a species of self-publishing.  Topics  weblogs are arguably

valuable to more people.  Other thoughts?  Should  it be harder to access
online publications to increase the sensation that they  are not
self-published,
that they have prestige?  Should they be  umbrella-listed at sites such as
webdelsol?

Dear Poetics List,

Many of the excellent submissions I received last year for the Puddle
leaflet series were in response to a call posted to this list in August. I
was delighted by the excellent submissions received after that call - thanks
everyone. I'm currently welcoming submission to the series on an ongoing
basis. Questions about the series &/or submission welcome at <
max@maxmiddle.com>.

The following is a note about the 2007 subscription with mention of an
ongoing call for submission to the series.

Cheers, Max

2007 Puddle leaflet subscription available

In May 2006, the Puddle leaflet series was initiated under the new imprint,
Griddle Grin. To date, eight Puddle leaflets have been published. It's been
a stirring adventure so far! Puddle leaflets published in 2006 are on letter
sized paper and oriented aesthetically around visual poetry. This year, I'll
be employing a range of printing formats. I'm currently inviting submission
in any poetic genre/discipline; submission will be enthusiastically welcomed
whether sent by email or by post.

I was overwhelmed by the excellent response to my request for submission in
August 2006: my appreciation and gratitude to the contributors. I also wish
to thank Grant Wilkins for his expert guidance during the production
process.

Subscription to the Puddle leaflet series for 2007 is $15 (outside Canada,
$15 in US funds). This year, I'll publish one leaflet per month, or more,
and mailings will take place at quarterly intervals. For a complete set of
2006 Puddle leaflets, please send $10 (outside Canada, $10 in US funds).
Forthcoming publications by, amongst others, Donna Kuhn, Caterina Davinio,
Gary Barwin, Gregory Betts and Nico Vassilakis.

Hi Ann

I didn't realize 20% of the population had disabilities. That's an
eye-opener, especially given the corresponding amount of misunderstanding
and mistreatment that accompany many of the conditions.

True, too many people focus only on the disability. I was fortunate to learn
before my formal diagnosis that Tourette syndrome had some positive aspects.
It explained my ability to multi-task and do certain processing functions
exponentially faster than my co-workers and probably accounts for a few of
the poetics techniques I use in my work.

While I pay a heavy price socially for it, and the tics and depression are
less than fun, I don't consider myself disabled. "Society" does. If they
want to send me a disability check for having a "disorder" that I call a
"condition," I'll take the money and mutter under my breath about
"reparations." I didn't write the definition, and all of us share its
consequences.

Other people with other conditions considered disabilities have told me they
have special abilities that people without their conditions don't have.

In many cases, I think we could dump the "disability" paradigm and assess
people according to the "spectrum" of their abilities.

My  symptoms aren't things I can hide. I can't "pass" for  non-Tourettic.




This is the post I wanted to reply to and waited.  Now Poetics emails  seem
to have dried up and are bypassing me:  This happened in Sept., too,  but
then
I let it go.  Somehow I started receiving Poetics mail again in  January.
Last summer I wrote an email every 3 weeks or so that must have  had too
little
to do with Poetics, which I take to mean international politics  via poetry,
or
poetry via int'l politics, and had to do with North American  non-poets who
were in a chronic state of treating disabling conditions or in a  disabling
state of treating chronic conditions ... of how internalized stigma  caused
them
to react against one another and to become harmful to their fellow  human
beings; -- it was worse than *thoughts* about our situation that led to  the
harm:
 There were housing loss and other alarming hazards.  It was  watching
people
become homeless before our eyes.  It was these people's own  hardball
antagonism toward not being *normal.*  *Phobia,* if you can  get people to
go in for
it, is treated as a psychological condition for which  there is *therapy.*
Education serves that purpose as well.

*Disabled* people comprise 20% of the U.S. population and *would* represent

the largest minority in the U.S. if they chose to associate, to be inclusive

along the lines of type of *disability.*  Mainly, I think the word
*disability* is misleading because it says nothing for *ability,* and most
of  the
*disabled* people I have met are more *able* than not.

Depressives are not viewed as in the *innocent* group, but are  more likely
in the *bad guys* group.  20% of depressives are suicidal;  the rest are
not.

I did not have illnesses as a child and had a strong constitution.  I  grew
up feminist, more than my mother, and at an early age, earlier than the
norm:
at 12, I read Ms. Magazine.  So I have those memories to  draw on and try to

recapture.  For years, I was adequately *private* and  stable following dx.

The passing of time, not living as if I were in a  race, and my enthusiasm
for
holistic treatment for bipolar -- as if  that were my *job* -- caused a loss
in
academic peer structure and the chance  for employment.

That is surprising bec if you read Emile on the surface Rousseau is a
revolutionary. If you think abt its implications, Rousseau seems to be a
controlling fascist, no?

you mean one that R was aware of? no. the naive reader can think his plan
for emile is liberating but then you realize that he controls everything
that emile does, takes him away from society like a cult leader.

Thanks, Vernon, for the informed sincerity of your response here.
As both a poet and sometimes publisher over a big chunk of time, I think the
still relatively new electronic publishing modes are still much in
transition - at least I like to think so. From the advantage point of view,
there is:
1. the global (geographic) spread of the makers, the poets as well as the
audience . The disadvantage there is that the network is bloated and too
fast - which, ironically, can create a disaffection, or disinterest - as
what happens to me often now.   I remember the days of very slow overseas
mail - say, two months to get a copy of Work magazine from Detroit, or a new
Jack Spicer book,  to the outback of Nigeria. But boy did I read every page
with an almost ferocious attention. Now I am frequently numbed by getting
too much from everywhere. (But then there is Ron Silliman turning on his
engines every day, enlivened rather than numbed or complaining about the
seeming siege, it seems, and I suspect many are grateful for the attentions
and sales benefits he is able to spread).

2. In the tangible world of trade books, publishing is ideally a dance -
with probably equally share pain and pleasure - between
writer-editor/publisher-
Design/ production
promotion- media reviewers
Book fairs, sales reps and store outlets.

Much of that interplay is now historically dead.
The role of the editor is decidedly absent from most publishing houses which
is a sadness. The loss of this dynamic creates bloated, flat books, or dull
books. A good editor is like a good conductor - insuring a book's rhythm and
pace, etc. (A poet who acts as his/her own editor is like the old saw about
the doctor who treats himself).
As much as I like publishing online, only rarely do I get a good editor who
has a sense of shape, most recently, Tim Atkins at Onedit. The digital
medium invites obesity, a limitlessness.

Design/ Production. Yes, I think a lot of the online mags and ebooks are
beginning to look great (Bridge, Fascicles, Masthead, etc.)  The much easier
implementation of images gives new breathing room to old fashioned "book
illustration."    Again I think online design is an emerging medium of its
own and will only get better.

Promotion/ Reviews
Poetry - at least stuff on the edge -has been so ill served by traditional
print media. However, at its best, the online has not replaced the now
practically dead world of large circulation newspaper reviews. To my
knowledge, we do not have either poet critic of a large stature matched with
a review organ of large mainstream stature to which the combination of
readers/reviewers and review can go to. The sad irony is that we have a
large number of significant (great, whatever) poets and no great review
media to correspond to their accomplishments. ( NYR, NYT, Nation, etc. will
not do the job. Witness whoever he was (David somebody) reviewing Frost and
trying to toss a blink to M Perloff, and experimental poets - that was kind
of off.putting

I put the previous email on some kind of 'draft' hold, and it hatched early.
If still interested, jump to the middle (RESTART) if you already read the

But, I suspect, the confusion of "the value of information" has been
confused with the poem and the book as an object(s) within themselves -
objects with a history and tradition of book making which the hype around
"information" and volume have replaced in an aesthetically unrewarding way.

On the other hand, Ron Silliman, Rain Taxi, blog commentators, etc. have
done much to bring attention to good books that would never have hit the
'hierarchical' radar of NYT, etc.

Distribution through traditional bookstore media is practically dead. Amazon
is devouring bookstore after bookstore. The aesthetic etc pleasures of
looking at poetry books, and all the various associations that can come from
the arrangements of books on a shelf  is more than not, a history. (Even in
libraries, as libraries begin to go to ebooks for their collections, and
small presses no doubt will go to ebook and ebook modes of distribution and
sale and the emergence of comfortable ebook readers (through ebrary, google,
etc.)
How any poetry book will emerge thru these new networks is no doubt a
developing challenge. There are lots of attractions for academia (professor
made anthology/readers will be much more convenient), cross referencing a
poets entire works will be convenient, too, and access to a range of review
and critical  responses to a poet's work will be easier.

This is all fated, it appears definite.

However, the principles of the good printed book (well edited, designed,
promoted, distributed and intelligently reviewed) are not going to
disappear. In this new democratic technology - which everyone can appear as
a poet with a digital ebook - it's going to be an interesting adventure to
see the ways in which a book can emerge from the pack with some of the
traditional values still in tact.

These are my views. In terms of the poetry world, it would be of value, I
suspect to hear from Brent Cunningham or Laura Moriarty to see how they
envision the future among the new givens.

Hello,

I am looking to find out if anyone knows of any good criticism or essays
on the work of Don Byrd, especially his larger work, The Great Dimmestore
Centennial.

I was recently made aware of one article, "In the Domain of the Common: a
Consideration of Don Byrd's Work." Groundswell, v. 2, no. 3 (1987) by
Michael Blitz, but have not been able to find it anywhere.


Let me know if anyone can help.

Best,

Adam, I spend some time with Don's ~The Poetics of the Common
Knowledge~ in ~Industrial Poetics~, just out last fall on Iowa.
You'll note references to Don's critical work in, for instance, Jed
Rasula's ~The American Poetry Wax Museum~ and ~This Compost~. Jed and
Don have a long history as correspondents. Erik Sweet did a short
piece on Don for the Poetry Project Newsletter, April/May of last
year I think.

I'm a great fan of ~Dimestore~, at any rate. Wasn't it reviewed in
the Village Voice back when?  I'm sure others -- Pierre Joris in
particular -- can chime in here with more info.

Best,

Joe

Joe,

I recently read an Don's review of your book on Joris' blog. I'll have to
get myself to actually pick it up one of these days.

Thanks,

At Bad Noise Productions, we have grown tired of the usual reading
situation which has a tendency to produce droopy heads and meager
excitements.

That's why we have begun pioneering NOISE POETRY which involves a
cavalcade of sounds and noises as accompaniment to interesting literary
fare.

Please visit www.badnoiseproductions.com for audio of the NOISE POETRY
performance titled "Mr. Sound Boy King" recorded live at "The
Confessional" reading series on 1 / 20 / 07.

(All sounds produced using mouth + electricity.)

HOMENAJE A EDGARDO ANTONIO VIGO

Hace ya 10 años que se nos fue el artista y poeta argentino Edgardo Antonio
Vigo, xilógrafo, poeta experimental, editor incansable, artecorreísta o
"trabajador en la comunicación a distancia" como solía llamarlo, constructor
de "objetos inútiles y máquinas extrañas", innovador constante, pensador y
teórico y otras variedades no ovacionadas en arte.

A comienzos de los 70s. se integra a los nacientes circuitos del arte correo
siendo uno de sus más constantes creadores hasta el día de su muerte. La
dictadura militar de su país le golpea duramente al hacer desaparecer a su
hijo mayor, Palomo Vigo y, fue a partir de este desgraciado hecho, que su
obra cobra un carácter fuertemente político a la par que aumentan sus
contactos con el exterior, difundiendo la brutal represión y delitos de lesa
humanidad de aquella feroz dictadura.

Su poema visual "Sembrar la memoria" se convirtió en un emblema de la
resistencia a la arbitrariedad e insanía institucional. En los últimos años,
su obra vuelve a la luz, en la Fundación San Telmo (1991) en donde expone
sus obras mayores y, en 1994, es seleccionado para integrar el envío
argentino a la XXII Bienal de San Pablo, Brasil, logrando el reconocimiento
mundial a ese nivel.

Ante tan magno acontecimiento invitamos a los artistas y poetas de todo el
mundo a adherirse a esta recuerdo humilde enviando una sola obra, de
cualquier carácter (que pueda contenerse en uno o dos archivos JPEG de 200
Kb o en un WORD de 3 páginas, únicamente) que resuma su homenaje a tan
insigne artista cuyo mayor mérito fue insuflarnos el afán por la libertad
enfrentándonos a la disyuntiva de tener que optar entre las variadas
posibilidades de significación (incluso de alterar el sentido) que ofrecían
sus obras y asumir y concretar así, a través de la elección personal,
nuestra genuina naturaleza hacia la libertad.

HOMAGE EDGARDO ANTONIO VIGO

Edgardo Antonio Vigo died in 1997 when he was close to 70 years of age, in
La Plata, the city in which he was born. An xylophonist, experimental poet,
conceptualist, builder of "useless objects and strange machines", a constant
innovator whose work was only very recently discovered, he has become a
source of constant surprise, because of the almost indescribable nature of
his proposals. He also cultivated forms, such as mail art and experimental
poetry, which are even today considered sub-artistic, or simply not
considered art at all by vernacular criticism.

In the early 70s Vigo joined the nascent circuits of Mail Art, becoming one
of its most active participants until the day of his death. The military
dictatorship in his country dealt him a cruel blow when one of his sons,
Palomo Vigo, disappeared and it is from that tragic event onwards that his
work acquired a strong political tone, as he extended his contacts abroad,
spreading information about the brutal repression and crimes against
humanity committed by that fierce dictatorship. His visual poem Sembrar la
Memoria (Sowing Memories) is emblematic in front injustice and institutional
illness. In later years his work came to light again, when he exhibited
individually at the San Telmo Foundation (1991) where he presented a
retrospective of his major works. In 1994 he was chosen to be part of the
Argentine contribution to the 22nd São Paulo Biennial (Brazil) where he
received worldwide reconnaissance.

In front so important event we invited artists and poets of everybody to
adhere to this humble memory sending an only work, of any character (that
could control in one or two JPEG files of 200 Kb or in a WORD file of 3
pages, only) that abridge his/her homage to so famous artist whose merit was
give us the toil for liberty confronting us to opcional of having to opt
between the varied possibilities of signification (included altering its
sense) that his works offered and take on and state explicitly so, through
the personal election, our genuine nature to freedom.

Stephen



Thanks, in turn, for amplifying on what I wrote and extending the discussion
into other areas.



I'm still adapting to the increased speed, myself. I love the fast
turnaround time on zine and book submissions,

but I do find myself wondering if  the new book I've published  book has
become "old news"  before I've even had a chance to send out review copies.
The literary world used to have a very slow pace, but that's changed with
the

latest technological developments. In many ways I prefer the faster pace,
but I'm still adapting to it.



Yes, the historical interplay is dead. Submissions of my first unpublished
novel, completed in the mid-1970s,

received personal replies from agents, whereas my most recent submissions
have received form rejection slips. Editors in the major houses seem to have
transferred the process of screening books to agents. I don't even know if
publishers have staff to read through the slushpile. Instead,  they rejected
un-agented submissions out of hand.



I agree that a good editor can be invaluable, spot flaws that hide in one's
blind spot. But a bad editor can misunderstand a work's intent and insist on
revisions that severely diminish the work. I've regarded editors as a

50-50 situation. Some help, some hurt. It's a mixed bag.



I agree about the review situation. I've received some tremendous reviews,
but, generally speaking, poets these days have very few reviewers whose
words can launch a career (of sorts). The magazines you mentioned have done
a good job, but they don't scratch the surface of the good writing being
produced today. The explosion of poetry into different styles and genres
over the past 40 years has affected the reception poets receive, as well.
There's no more room at the top for recognition, but many more qualified
poets are looking for their spot up there.



Online publishing has allowed poetry to expand, but I agree that the reviews
and distribution haven't kept pace. Some of the best poets I know only
manage to receive 5 reviews---at most--- for wonderful works. This limits
how many people can become aware of the work and reduces word-of-mouth, as
well.



I find the bookstore situation depressing because I love to browse and buy
on impulse. Now, I find most bookstores don't have much that interests me,
and when I see something that does, I save money ordering a new or used copy
online.



I do hope that libraries will buy e-books for their collections, but I
haven't seen libraries purchasing POD books as yet. The situation will
change as POD becomes more acceptable and the POD publishers acquire
reputations for the work they publish.



For this to occur, more reviewers and distributors will have to appear on
the scene. I have no suggestions on this one.



But the information we do have, as you say, can be gathered easily online
and cross-referenced.



I still prefer to read from the book instead of the screen, and I think the
book will continue to exist because many others feel the same way.



The path up to recognition from the glut of publication may take a very
different path (or paths) from the ones we're accustomed to. It's too early
to say whether it will be better or worse. But the bright side of the new
technology is that it creates an alterative means for creating and
preserving literature that the traditional venues  no longer pay attention
to.



I do hope some others will share their opinions.

Subject: OOPs -Re: Audience & publishing



I put the previous email on some kind of 'draft' hold, and it hatched early.

If still interested, jump to the middle (RESTART) if you already read the

first part!



---

Thanks, Vernon, for the informed sincerity of your response here.

As both a poet and sometimes publisher over a big chunk of time, I think the

still relatively new electronic publishing modes are still much in

transition - at least I like to think so. From the advantage point of view,

there is:

1. the global (geographic) spread of the makers, the poets as well as the

audience . The disadvantage there is that the network is bloated and too

fast - which, ironically, can create a disaffection, or disinterest - as

what happens to me often now.   I remember the days of very slow overseas

mail - say, two months to get a copy of Work magazine from Detroit, or a new

Jack Spicer book,  to the outback of Nigeria. But boy did I read every page

with an almost ferocious attention. Now I am frequently numbed by getting

too much from everywhere. (But then there is Ron Silliman turning on his

engines every day, enlivened rather than numbed or complaining about the

seeming siege, it seems, and I suspect many are grateful for the attentions

and sales benefits he is able to spread).



2. In the tangible world of trade books, publishing is ideally a dance -

with probably equally share pain and pleasure - between

writer-editor/publisher-

Design/ production

promotion- media reviewers

Distriubtion - Book fairs, sales reps and store outlets.



Much of that interplay is now historically dead.

The role of the editor is decidedly absent from most publishing houses which

is a sadness. The loss of this dynamic creates bloated, flat books, or dull

books. A good editor is like a good conductor - insuring a book's rhythm and

pace, etc. (A poet who acts as his/her own editor is like the old saw about

the doctor who treats himself).

As much as I like publishing online, only rarely do I get a good editor who

has a sense of shape, most recently, Tim Atkins at Onedit. The digital

medium invites obesity, a limitlessness.

But, I suspect, the confusion of "the value of information" has been

confused with the poem and the book as an object(s) within themselves -

objects with a history and tradition of book making which the hype around

"information" and volume have replaced in an aesthetically unrewarding way.



Design/ Production. Yes, I think a lot of the online mags and ebooks are

beginning to look great (Bridge, Fascicles, Masthead, etc.)  The much easier

implementation of images gives new breathing room to old fashioned "book

illustration."    Again I think online design is an emerging medium of its

own and will only get better.

(RESTART!! - IF YOU READ THE FIRST PART)

Promotion/ Reviews

Poetry - at least stuff on the edge -has been so ill served by traditional

print media. However, at its best, the online has not replaced the now

practically dead world of large circulation newspaper reviews. To my

knowledge, we do not have either poet critic of a large stature matched with

a review organ of large mainstream stature to which the combination of

readers/reviewers and review can go to. The sad irony is that we have a

large number of significant (great, whatever) poets and no great review

media to correspond to their accomplishments. ( NYR, NYT, Nation, etc. will

not do the job. Witness whoever he was (David somebody) reviewing Frost and

trying to toss a blink to M Perloff, and experimental poets - that was kind

of off putting, awkward, etc., to say the least.

On the other hand, Ron Silliman, Rain Taxi, blog commentators, etc. have

done much to bring attention to good books that would never have hit the

'hierarchical' radar of NYT, etc.



Distribution through traditional bookstore media is practically dead. Amazon

is devouring bookstore after bookstore. The aesthetic etc pleasures of

looking at poetry books, and all the various associations that can come from

the arrangements of books on a shelf  is more than not, a history. (Even in

libraries, as libraries begin to go to ebooks for their collections, and

small presses no doubt will go to ebook and ebook modes of distribution and

sale and the emergence of comfortable ebook readers (through ebrary, google,

etc.)

How any poetry book will emerge thru these new networks is no doubt a

developing challenge. There are lots of attractions for academia (professor

made anthology/readers will be much more convenient), cross referencing a

poets entire works will be convenient, too, and access to a range of review

and critical  responses to a poet's work will be easier.



This is all fated, it appears definite.



However, the principles of the good printed book (well edited, designed,

promoted, distributed and intelligently reviewed) are not going to

disappear. In this new democratic technology - which everyone can appear as

a poet with a digital ebook - it's going to be an interesting adventure to

see the ways in which a book can emerge from the pack with some of the

traditional values still in tact.



These are my views. In terms of the poetry world, it would be of value, I

suspect to hear from Brent Cunningham or Laura Moriarty to see how they

envision the future among the new givens.

I've heard others say this, as well, but I don;'t know on what
authority. The last 4 books from Junction Press have been produced
POD, and all future books will be. Two of them have sold well enough
to go into second printings. A great many publishers have gone POD.
Even many of the major commercial houses now print their second
printings POD, because like the rest of us they enjoy saving on storage costs.

Libraries don't seem to mind--they buy with as much or as little

I'm glad to stand corrected about libraries purchasing POD books.

I think POD books have covers that feel more like plastic than paper, but I
think this makes them a little more durable.

Covers haven't been a problem for several years. They're printed on
exactly the same stock as offset books, and they're laminated or
varnished with exactly the same materials.

I assume you're thinking about matt-finished covers, which have a
waxy feel. That's the publisher's decision. For a while it was
something of a fad. Appropriate in terms of design for some books,
but the surface tends to damage easily. Again, it's a choice
available regardless of how the book is printed.

I recently had the chance to hear read and eat dinner with an old friend
from school days, whose book is a bestseller in India; I don't know how it's
doing here, but it's written in English.  A super nice guy who also has  always
known quite a lot about technology and the film business through his  mother
and sister.  He says that the plastic book is coming to the mass  market and
that they are bracing themselves for change, and I said that I had  been watching
the small and electronic press world for some time in poetry,  especially.
The only division is prestige -- between paper and business  handling it and
webdesign and own handling it.  As the mass market goes  increasingly
electronic, which is coming, the indies need to define their turf  more clearly, I
think, to defend their prestige and their designs.   Maybe by gallery shows.
Beautiful, limited edition printed  books.

i'm a taxpayer. i'm single, female, anti-war and support the arts and
higher education; in fact the latter is my workplace. as a taxpayer i
feel the government owes it to me to endorse and legislate in favor
of my values: peace, creativity, freedom, decent working and living
conditions for all people, good care and education for kids and an
aspiration to eliminate the suffering of all sentient beings.

I first became aware of the haiku form via an interview with Laurie
Anderson in the early 80s... she claimed to have written "fake haikus"
for her song Kokoku (the interview is archived here:
http://www.archive.org/details/LaurieAndersonOTG)

at least she didn't claim they were "real" haikus -- does anyone
recognize the Japanese text she quotes in the lyrics below?

Kokoku

I come very briefly to this place.=20
I watch it move. I watch it shake.=20

Kumowaku yamano. Watashino sakebi.=20
Watashino koewo. Ushano kokoku.=20
Watashiwa sokoni. Watashiwa asobu.=20

Mountain with clouds. A cry. My voice.
Home of the brave. I'm here now. And lost.
They say the dead will rise again. And here they come now.=20
Strange animals out of the Ice Age. And they stare at you.=20
Dumbfounded. Like big mistakes. And we say: Keep cool.=20
Maybe if we pretend this never happened, they'll all just go away.=20

=20
Sure, one can use any formal restraint as a poetic game, as a challenge
of =20
sorts. But as challenges go, in haiku, the syllabic challenge (whatever
pattern=20
 you might choose) is mighty superficial. Indeed, in my years of
teaching=20
haiku,  I've seen that it's the easiest thing in the world for students
of nearly=20
all  grade levels to count their pretty little syllables. Why brag about

pulling on  your underwear all by yourself when your hair is on fire?
It's a=20
trivial  "discipline." And these same haiku, while hitting that trivial
target --=20
again,  an incorrect target in English -- are widely missing the more
important=20
targets.  And most often, these proud 5-7-5ers are completely oblivious
to=20
those other  targets -- ones that are actually more important. Why
bother with=20
arbirary  constraints for haiku when there are far more serious,
literary,=20
challenging,  and effective constraints that you miss in the process of
focusing=20
on  5-7-5?!?
=20
It can be fun to write cinquains or iambic pentameter, or the recent
"Fib"=20
form (counting syllables in subsequent lines to match the Fibonacci
sequence).=20
But when it comes to haiku, writing 5-7-5 syllables in English isn't
the=20
same as following the prescribed syllables of cinquains or pentameter or
Fibs.=20
That's because following 5-7-5 assumes a "correctness" for that pattern
in =20
English, which isn't accurate when it's really a borrowed form. Yes,
sonnets are =20
borrowed from Italian to English, but at least that's the same alphabet,
so=20
it's  not fraught with the problems of translating from Japanese to
English.=20
It's  folly to translate the number (5-7-5) without thinking more deeply
about=20
what is  being counted. Yet that is precisely what has happened that
lead to=20
the false  conception of haiku being 5-7-5 syllables in English. Quite
simply,=20
when we  apply that pattern to English syllables, we miss the boat. It's

simplistic and  naive.
=20
A person can do whatever they like and call it haiku (Lord knows that's

happened plenty enough). If you're having fun, knock yourself out. But
if you're =20
writing 5-7-5 haiku, it's best to be aware of how you're writing a poem
that's=20
 markedly longer than what is expressed in a Japanese haiku (not all of
which=20
are  5-7-5, by the way). It's best to be aware that you're writing in a=20
pattern that,  for good reason, pretty much ALL of the leading haiku
poets writing=20
in English  do not follow. It's best to be aware that writing 5-7-5
frequently=20
creates  artificial syntax and awkward line breaks purely for an
unnecessary=20
constraint  while more important strategies (also constraints) are
completely=20
missed.  Indeed, most 5-7-5 haiku writers tend to be completely unaware
of the=20
other  strategies necessary for traditional haiku, though perhaps that's
a=20

attention to, perhaps even thousands. They nearly all started out
writing=20
5-7-5,  as did I. And then they progressed to learning the more
important aspects=20
of the  genre (and haiku is best thought of as a genre of poetry, of
which=20
"form" is  just one aspect). At this point, nearly all of them stop
writing in=20
the 5-7-5  pattern. The few exceptions to this progression include those
who=20
went straight  to avoiding 5-7-5 in the first place. But there are clear
reasons=20
for this  progression. It's not that 5-7-5 is "abandoned." Rather, it is

apprehended as  something that was inappropriate in the first place, and
causes=20
many problems in  English. Higher targets are sought -- ones, in fact,
that turn=20
out to be  far more challenging and require far more discipline. If

English serves  any useful purpose, it is purely as the first

Our good friend Frank Sherlock was rushed to the hospital January 22nd  with
a sudden and mysterious illness which turned out to be a serious case of
meningitis.  He needed emergency surgery, and also suffered a heart attack  and
kidney failure as a result of symptoms related to the illness.

The timing could not be worse as this attack of meningitis happened during
the two month window in which Frank is without health insurance.

His friends have come together to help raise money at this critical  time.
We are reaching out to other friends and the poetry community on  Frank's
behalf.  Please consider sending donations for his hospital bills,  physical
therapy, as well as his very expensive medications and other  needs.

If you can make a donation by check or money order at this time please send
it to Frank's longtime friend Matthew McGoldrick.

VERY IMPORTANT:  Please make check or money order out to Matthew  McGoldrick,
and send to his address:

I think we should just call POD productions "books." Whether letterpress,
offset-print, desktop-printed, POD-processed, or whatever other technology,
these are all books.

Vernon, you may be experiencing covers that come from a particular book
manufacturer. I have seen covers on POD-produced books that have been
thinner & much less durable than those on offset-printed books, and I have
seen very durable covers on POD-produced books, but mostly I see covers
that feel exactly the same as offset-printed covers. And I know for a fact
that the same paper can be used for digitally printed covers as for
offset-printed covers. And of course POD-production is not limited to
paperback books. One can have case-bound, cloth-covered books that were
printed via POD technologies, too.

I will echo Mark, i.e. I know for a fact that libraries (college,
university, & public libraries) buy books produced via POD technology. I
don't know if they always know that is what they are buying, but I don't
know if that matters. Also I'd add that a lot of university presses are
using POD technology for their books, allowing them to print shorter runs
for niche books that otherwise, given current costs of producing books and
maintaining inventory, simply wouldn't be published.

Yes, as Ann Bogle suggests, the industry (Apple and Sony, for sure) are
working madly refining portable ebook readers - ones that will replace
and/or parallel textbooks and all other manner of print production.

It's a forgone conclusion that the global marketplace in books will function
via these devices. I suspect that they will be wireless - if not already -
and it will be possible to download whatever book you want (for a price) or
portions of books into the readers. (Individuals will have monthly payment
contracts with ebook providers - say, Baker & Taylor or Blackwells - by
which they bring up books much in the way we pay the phone company.)

The Libraries will have contracts with the ebook providers(again B & T,
Blackwells, ebrary and others (who will have contracts with the publishers)
that will enable POD production of titles they will want preserved on their
shelves for us old fashioned people who might want to check out an actual
book!

I suspect most small press poetry book and magazine publishers are not yet
into this loop in which work is represented on say ebrary, B&T or
Blackwells. The big ones are, for example, UC Press. At this point in time,
it only requires a PDF version of the work to become an ebook, and places
like ebrary are usually eager for anything they can acquire and represent.
There is usually no cost for this representation. The Publisher and provider
make their money through the end user.  (It's not like your PDF takes up
warehouse space). (ebrary, for example, has 120,000 titles in ebook format.
For purposes of research, ebrary also comes with cross-referencing searches
across the entire list, instant bibliographic notations, etc., etc. And
ebrary now has partnerships with both B&T and Blackwells, as well as 'book'
distributors on other continents.)

There is, for one example an international beauty about it by which work
becomes globally accessible. Bilingual editions of poetry, for example, can
be seen in either country and is suddenly accessible to a much larger
audiences in either language.

So, if I were running a small press, I would get Large be making ebooks with
revenue producing contracts with the Big  distributors (ebrary, B&T, and
Blackwells). Google's part in this is still up in the land of dispute as to
whether or not they are genuinely publisher friendly, but I assume they are
working on competitive modes of representation and sale of copyrighted
works.

Again, I would suggest it would be a good idea to get SPD to weigh in on
this as to how they see this new ebook/e-reader situation working for small
presses.

As much as many of us love tangible books, these developments represent a
big chunk of the future.

Jeez. Can't we just decide that all contemporary haikus are "fake" and leave it at that?

Because to my mind that would be at least giving them the benefit of the doubt, since it is extremely unlikely that a "real" sonnet, a "real" dramatic monologue, a "real" epic, a "real" ode, or likewise a "real" haiku could also be a good poem. Only starting from the assumption that using any of this forms or genres is absurd, practically kitsch, is one likely to get anywhere with them.

  There are societies of watercolor painters out there, according to whose members, probably, the works of any important contemporary artist who might produce a watercolor that you'd in the drawing dept. of MoMA or the Whitney are just obtuse efforts that show no sense of the rules of watercolor painting. But really, one should understand that, unlike hobbyists, real artists have only the most contingent interest in following any rules they have not set for themselves.

Sure, one can use any formal restraint as a poetic game, as a challenge
of
sorts. But as challenges go, in haiku, the syllabic challenge (whatever
pattern
you might choose) is mighty superficial. Indeed, in my years of
teaching
haiku, I've seen that it's the easiest thing in the world for students
of nearly
all grade levels to count their pretty little syllables. Why brag about

pulling on your underwear all by yourself when your hair is on fire?
It's a
trivial "discipline." And these same haiku, while hitting that trivial
target --
again, an incorrect target in English -- are widely missing the more
important
targets. And most often, these proud 5-7-5ers are completely oblivious
to
those other targets -- ones that are actually more important. Why
bother with
arbirary constraints for haiku when there are far more serious,
literary,
challenging, and effective constraints that you miss in the process of
focusing
on 5-7-5?!?

It can be fun to write cinquains or iambic pentameter, or the recent
"Fib"
form (counting syllables in subsequent lines to match the Fibonacci
sequence).
But when it comes to haiku, writing 5-7-5 syllables in English isn't
the
same as following the prescribed syllables of cinquains or pentameter or
Fibs.
That's because following 5-7-5 assumes a "correctness" for that pattern
in
English, which isn't accurate when it's really a borrowed form. Yes,
sonnets are
borrowed from Italian to English, but at least that's the same alphabet,
so
it's not fraught with the problems of translating from Japanese to
English.
It's folly to translate the number (5-7-5) without thinking more deeply
about
what is being counted. Yet that is precisely what has happened that
lead to
the false conception of haiku being 5-7-5 syllables in English. Quite
simply,
when we apply that pattern to English syllables, we miss the boat. It's

simplistic and naive.

A person can do whatever they like and call it haiku (Lord knows that's

happened plenty enough). If you're having fun, knock yourself out. But
if you're
writing 5-7-5 haiku, it's best to be aware of how you're writing a poem
that's
markedly longer than what is expressed in a Japanese haiku (not all of
which
are 5-7-5, by the way). It's best to be aware that you're writing in a
pattern that, for good reason, pretty much ALL of the leading haiku
poets writing
in English do not follow. It's best to be aware that writing 5-7-5
frequently
creates artificial syntax and awkward line breaks purely for an
unnecessary
constraint while more important strategies (also constraints) are
completely
missed. Indeed, most 5-7-5 haiku writers tend to be completely unaware
of the
other strategies necessary for traditional haiku, though perhaps that's
a
separate problem, although it's frequently caused by a belief that
5-7-5 is all
there is to it. In any event, if one aims at seasonality and a two-part

juxtapositional structure, and employs objective sensory imagery, you
can let
the rest of form take care of itself (organically). But of course,
there's more
to it than that -- writing in the present tense, no titles, no rhyme,
seldom
any similes or metaphors, employing fragments rather than full
sentences,
employing allusion, and more. And perhaps the most important aspect of
all --
implication. It's very hard to do well, to hint at something that the
reader
can figure out on his own, making a leap of understanding that's made
possible
because of your restraint as a poet, because you deliberately left
something
out. As I like to emphasize in haiku workshops, don't write about your
emotion, write about what caused your emotion. Then, if you do it
right, the reader
can feel what you felt without your having to say so. But of course all
of
this is missed by those who think haiku is only a 5-7-5
syllable-counting
poetry trick. Some "challenge."

As I say in the title of one of my haiku lectures: "Haiku: It's Bigger
Than
You Think." Yet of course, it's also smaller than most English speakers
think,
too.

Michael

P.S. Nearly every serious haiku poet I know has had a progression in
their
haiku -- and I'm talking about many hundreds of leading haiku poets who
I pay
attention to, perhaps even thousands. They nearly all started out
writing
5-7-5, as did I. And then they progressed to learning the more
important aspects
of the genre (and haiku is best thought of as a genre of poetry, of
which
"form" is just one aspect). At this point, nearly all of them stop
writing in
the 5-7-5 pattern. The few exceptions to this progression include those
who
went straight to avoiding 5-7-5 in the first place. But there are clear
reasons
for this progression. It's not that 5-7-5 is "abandoned." Rather, it is

apprehended as something that was inappropriate in the first place, and
causes
many problems in English. Higher targets are sought -- ones, in fact,
that turn
out to be far more challenging and require far more discipline. If
5-7-5 in
English serves any useful purpose, it is purely as the first
stepping-stone on
a long path. But, alas, too many people, even otherwise accomplished
poets,
stop at just that first stepping stone with their haiku.

hey hey, that's (really) my point -- this form(alism) is a starting
place -- I try not to pay a whole lot of attention to "the rules," since
you learn language best in the environment it is spoken -- and anyway
one attractive characteristic of human language is its capacity for
innovation, sometimes (or especially when) enacted by the less fluent
among us...

how about stipulating that there's a form called American (or
English-language) haiku, which is different from but as equally valid as
the original, Japanese form? cf. American and European football (our
"football" and "soccer," as it were)... or is this old ground we're
treading?=20

Jeez. Can't we just decide that all contemporary haikus are "fake" and
leave it at that?
 =20
Because to my mind that would be at least giving them the benefit of the
doubt, since it is extremely unlikely that a "real" sonnet, a "real"
dramatic monologue, a "real" epic, a "real" ode, or likewise a "real"
haiku could also be a good poem. Only starting from the assumption that
using any of this forms or genres is absurd, practically kitsch, is one
likely to get anywhere with them.=20
  =20
  There are societies of watercolor painters out there, according to
whose members, probably, the works of any important contemporary artist
who might produce a watercolor that you'd in the drawing dept. of MoMA
or the Whitney are just obtuse efforts that show no sense of the rules
of watercolor painting. But really, one should understand that, unlike
hobbyists, real artists have only the most contingent interest in
following any rules they have not set for themselves.

Sure, one can use any formal restraint as a poetic game, as a challenge
of=20
sorts. But as challenges go, in haiku, the syllabic challenge (whatever
pattern=20
you might choose) is mighty superficial. Indeed, in my years of
teaching=20
haiku, I've seen that it's the easiest thing in the world for students
of nearly=20
all grade levels to count their pretty little syllables. Why brag about

pulling on your underwear all by yourself when your hair is on fire?
It's a=20
trivial "discipline." And these same haiku, while hitting that trivial
target --=20
again, an incorrect target in English -- are widely missing the more
important=20
targets. And most often, these proud 5-7-5ers are completely oblivious
to=20
those other targets -- ones that are actually more important. Why
bother with=20
arbirary constraints for haiku when there are far more serious,
literary,=20
challenging, and effective constraints that you miss in the process of
focusing=20
on 5-7-5?!?

It can be fun to write cinquains or iambic pentameter, or the recent
"Fib"=20
form (counting syllables in subsequent lines to match the Fibonacci
sequence).=20
But when it comes to haiku, writing 5-7-5 syllables in English isn't
the=20
same as following the prescribed syllables of cinquains or pentameter or
Fibs.=20
That's because following 5-7-5 assumes a "correctness" for that pattern
in=20
English, which isn't accurate when it's really a borrowed form. Yes,
sonnets are=20
borrowed from Italian to English, but at least that's the same alphabet,
so=20
it's not fraught with the problems of translating from Japanese to
English.=20
It's folly to translate the number (5-7-5) without thinking more deeply
about=20
what is being counted. Yet that is precisely what has happened that
lead to=20
the false conception of haiku being 5-7-5 syllables in English. Quite
simply,=20
when we apply that pattern to English syllables, we miss the boat. It's

simplistic and naive.

A person can do whatever they like and call it haiku (Lord knows that's

happened plenty enough). If you're having fun, knock yourself out. But
if you're=20
writing 5-7-5 haiku, it's best to be aware of how you're writing a poem
that's=20
markedly longer than what is expressed in a Japanese haiku (not all of
which=20
are 5-7-5, by the way). It's best to be aware that you're writing in a=20
pattern that, for good reason, pretty much ALL of the leading haiku
poets writing=20
in English do not follow. It's best to be aware that writing 5-7-5
frequently=20
creates artificial syntax and awkward line breaks purely for an
unnecessary=20
constraint while more important strategies (also constraints) are
completely=20
missed. Indeed, most 5-7-5 haiku writers tend to be completely unaware
of the=20
other strategies necessary for traditional haiku, though perhaps that's
a=20
separate problem, although it's frequently caused by a belief that
5-7-5 is all=20
there is to it. In any event, if one aims at seasonality and a two-part

juxtapositional structure, and employs objective sensory imagery, you
can let=20
the rest of form take care of itself (organically). But of course,
there's more=20
to it than that -- writing in the present tense, no titles, no rhyme,
seldom=20
any similes or metaphors, employing fragments rather than full
sentences,=20
employing allusion, and more. And perhaps the most important aspect of
all --=20
implication. It's very hard to do well, to hint at something that the
reader=20
can figure out on his own, making a leap of understanding that's made
possible=20
because of your restraint as a poet, because you deliberately left
something=20
out. As I like to emphasize in haiku workshops, don't write about your=20
emotion, write about what caused your emotion. Then, if you do it
right, the reader=20
can feel what you felt without your having to say so. But of course all
of=20
this is missed by those who think haiku is only a 5-7-5
syllable-counting=20
poetry trick. Some "challenge."

As I say in the title of one of my haiku lectures: "Haiku: It's Bigger
Than=20
You Think." Yet of course, it's also smaller than most English speakers
think,=20
too.

P.S. Nearly every serious haiku poet I know has had a progression in
their=20
haiku -- and I'm talking about many hundreds of leading haiku poets who
I pay=20
attention to, perhaps even thousands. They nearly all started out
writing=20
5-7-5, as did I. And then they progressed to learning the more
important aspects=20
of the genre (and haiku is best thought of as a genre of poetry, of
which=20
"form" is just one aspect). At this point, nearly all of them stop
writing in=20
the 5-7-5 pattern. The few exceptions to this progression include those
who=20
went straight to avoiding 5-7-5 in the first place. But there are clear
reasons=20
for this progression. It's not that 5-7-5 is "abandoned." Rather, it is

apprehended as something that was inappropriate in the first place, and
causes=20
many problems in English. Higher targets are sought -- ones, in fact,
that turn=20
out to be far more challenging and require far more discipline. If
5-7-5 in=20
English serves any useful purpose, it is purely as the first
stepping-stone on=20
a long path. But, alas, too many people, even otherwise accomplished
poets,=20
stop at just that first stepping stone with their haiku.

Eric,

The chorus to the Hunter/Garcia song "Ripple" is a haiku as well:

Ripple in still water
where there is no pebble tossed
nor wind to blow

http://arts.ucsc.edu/gdead/agdl/ripple.html

Since the Grateful Dead and Allen Ginsberg were both acts at the Human
Be-In, and the overlap between Beat-ness and the Merry Pranksters was Neal
Cassady, it's not completely improbable that Hunter and Ginsberg at least
met.

Try reading Roland Barthes, especially 'The Pleasure of the Text/'
and 'Barthes by Barthes'.  Not only is he a beautiful writer, but he
does not pontificate or obfuscate or mystify.  Poets are always aware
that their words have more than one or two kinds of identity or
function (pun, rhyme, say) as well as being signs, and that assigning
meaning is always a matter of overriding complexities.

Subject:      new work from Turkey by Ozcan Turkmen
In-Reply-To:  <F3CA41C0.1C74A31@ozcant>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

I received an email (below) today from Turkey, from Ozcan Turkmen, letting
me know that he has a site up of digital poems. This is an astonishing
event, to me, to visit a site by a fellow digital poet in Turkey, and would
like to share it with you.

It is vey unusual work, I think. If you refresh
http://www.workmanofchild.com repeatedly, you see different pictures from
the place Ozcan Turkmen was born: a prisoner of war camp in Germany from
WWII. He now lives in Istanbul.

These are works of experimental digital poetry. "Entropic Poetry" (done in
Java) finds/creates human meaning around Shannon's notion of entropy. This
is a conceptual poem involving programming, the visual, and an essay on the
concept. "The Story of a Line" (done in Flash) traces human growth through
the consciousness of a geometric figure. "Loopy" looks at the relation of
iteration/the loop to our own existence; "Pornography" seeks some
understanding of what it is.

I note that the full-site menu in the English section of the site is
considerably shorter than the Turkish section of the site, understandably.

It is really encouraging to see a site of this nature. Part of what many of
us treasure is the idea of a Net of art that aspires to international
solidarity in the creation of literary bodies of work that can swim in the
brine of the binary and communicate across many borders. Many thanks to
Ozcan for this moving, intelligent work from Istanbul.

Hi,

I'd like to inform you about my new site : www.workmanofchild.com . I hope
that it will strengthen the relation among us.
My greetings,

Twenty-two flowers individually pose and glow in a transcendent light that highlights their forms, voluptuous and sinuous and vivid. No, nothing like Georgia O´Keefe - these images capture the long line of the forms. Terepka photographs flowers as if they were sheathed in long dresses and white gloves, standing looking back over their bared shoulders at something surprisingly interesting.

I always thought that western poets couldn't write
haiku - regardless of its construct in so far as its
understood by westerners - the syllable is a word,
damn it - not so much a syllable, and I wonder, if
that's the problem in the basic idea.

Do you really want to write haiku?

Well as a response to the last several postings on the topic let me simply
say,,,,,

sentences, quasi-sentences, cute observations, bits of irony etc DON'T
MAKE IT

Please...read Gurga's book and practice in your notebooks and come back
next year and show us what you have learned.

Folks, when you don't know you don't know and all the wishing in the world
doesn't change that.

Of course if you want to write hallmark poems of any sort, haiku included,
go for it...but really who wants to read that crap.  I hope you don't and
I don't either.

Thanks

Charlie

Today the mail run rendered up a stunning set of six beautiful CD's,
each one the product of of Ralph Lichtensteiger's genius.  Yes, I use
that term openly when I speak of this gentleman.  If you haven't heard
of him I suggest that you go to www.lichtensteiger.de to witness the
range of his thought, and his incredible generosity as a teacher.  He is
constantly offering up new downloads of avant-garde music, new takes on
philiosophers, new insights into, and applications of, the thought and
praxis of John Cage, with whom he met and conversed.  And now these
CD's have arrived with their promise of a voyage.  The story of Jason
and the Argonauts, of course tells of the quest for the Golden Fleece--a
journey that has long been regarded in the West as an alchemical
allegory.  Here are the titles of the CD's:

1 klangschiff
2 klangsschiff
3 the remains
4 specters
5 les heterotopies
6 departure

I am delighted to have a voice piece embedded in CD #6.  So I myself have
a seat among Jason's crew!

I haven't yet had a chance to take this aural voyage, but once I've
embarked, I shall report back!

The CD set was pressed in a limited edition of 50.  Price is 25 euros.
Ralph Lichtensteiger is looking for collaborators for other projects.
Several people from this list--including Alan Sondheim, Miekal And and
Dan Weber-- have been featured.   For more information, please contact
Mr. Lichtensteiger via his website.

First off, the word "haiku" is both singular and plural, like the word
"deer," thus it's easy to sound uninformed if you say "haikus." Even Kerouac got
it wrong. But no scholars or translators or serious haiku poets anywhere will
say "haikus." In my experience in dealing with thousands of people over the
last  fifteen years in haiku education, every single person who ever said
"haikus" was  also fairly clueless as to what a haiku even was, whether in English
or  Japanese, and typically all they knew was the misguided notion of 5-7-5
syllables. That it's a misguided notion is terribly old news to those who study
and write haiku with commitment. Yet here I am dredging it up because so few
people have an real understanding of English-language haiku literature --
even  among serious mainstream poetry circles. Though the spans of time are
different,  it's like knowing only Petrarch and having little idea that anyone
tried writing  sonnets in English.

Second, some Americans, out of deference to Japan, do consider their haiku
to be "American haiku" (for example, Kerouac called some of his haiku-like
creations "pops"; Ginsberg offered "American Sentences," although he also wanted
them to be *different* from haiku, even in English; for 20+ years John Brandi
 and Steve Sanfield used to call the haiku they wrote "hoops"). Some
Japanese feel that way about American haiku, too. But many don't. Some American
haiku are deeply loved in Japan. I myself have been a guest in Japan of Shugyo
Takaha, the president of one of Japan's three largest haiku organizations, and
that surely would not happen if there were not some measure of interest and
respect for what is being done in North America (I was vice president of the
Haiku Society of America at the time of that particular visit to Japan). Haiku
in America and Japan are *going* to be different, because the culture and
languages are different. Yet they are also remarkably similar, employing
techniques that CAN be transferred from one language to another, and the best  poets
are doing remarkably things with their haiku in English, even while  sometmes
casting an American slant to it (or Canadian, or British, or Irish, or
Australian, etc.). This writing is approached very seriously. And like any kind  of
literature, there's all sorts of bad with the good, but in my personal
library of about 4,000+ haiku books (nearly all in English, and this is only a
fraction of haiku publications in the last century), I find much very
accomplished poetry.

In 1991 I helped to found the Haiku North America conference, which has  been
held every two years since then (coming up this summer in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina), and it's just one example of the serious study  and criticism of
English-language haiku. Many of the papers and  presentations from the
conference make it into print in journals such as Modern  Haiku (published since
1969, folks -- not a spring chicken as poetry  publications go) and the Haiku
Society of America's Frogpond (published since  1978). These journals don't even
need the help of the HNA conference -- they  have plenty of other criticism
and discussion from other sources, too. There are  other respected haiku
journals that have been around for a number of years. This  is not "fake" haiku they
are writing. Sure, like the content of any poetry  journal, some of it is
better than others. But take a look at Cor van den  Heuvel's *The Haiku
Anthology*. There's some darn good stuff in there. And it's  not by accident that it's
now in its third edition. First edition was in 1974  from Doubleday, second
edition in 1986 from Fireside, and the third edition, in  hardback and paperback,
in 1999 from W. W. Norton. That's just scratching the  surface of the serious
and literary haiku that has been written in this country  for at least sixty
or more years. Fake haiku? Sure, there's plenty of crap, but  also much truly
excellent work. Believe me, some of it runs circles around some  of the crap
that also gets written in Japan, too. Definitely, haiku in Japan has  a hugely
larger and lengthier history than does English-language haiku, but  given that
we only been at it for a hundred years (or more accurately, for most  writers
writing seriously today, about fifty years), what has been accomplished  in a
relatively short period is remarkable.

As for artists and the following of rules, I am reminded of Basho, who said
"learn the rules and then forget them." This statement, in lesser minds, has
been used to justify an ignorance of rules, or deliberate violation of the
rules  simply because one is lazy. What Basho really meant was to internalize the
rules  so well that you no longer have to think of them, the way a chess
grand master  no longer even thinks of stupid moves. It's a stage of unconscious
competence.  Haiku has plenty of wiggle room within its "rules," and I'm also
reminded of  Edith Shiffert, who has said that there really never were any
rules in haiku,  only fashions and trends. I'm not sure how accurate that is, but
it's unwise of  anyone not to be aware of the tradition, and what has gone on
before -- which  happens with incredible frequency, and has been demonstrated
by some of the  "haiku" posted to this list. Nearly all of these poems need
serious surgery and  exhibit a gross lack of understanding of haiku necessities
-- not because they  are merely "rules," but because they are effective
strategies. These stategies  are worth following because they *work*. If you see
what the masters sought, as  Basho also urged, I believe you'll see why it's
worthwhile to adopt techniques  such as the season word, two-part structure, and
so on. It's one thing to write  out of a position of knowledge (that's where
the best innovation usually comes  from), and quite another thing to write out
of naivete, which so often happens  when some people think they are being
"innovative" (at least with haiku).

P.S. Did you know that there's a Museum of Haiku Literature in Tokyo (a
multimillion-dollar facility)? And did you know it has a large library of
English-language haiku, and this it sponsors awards for English-language haiku
through the Haiku Society of America and with the British Haiku Society? Did you
know that at an event called Haiku Chicago in 1995 (held jointly by the Haiku
Society of America and the Haiku International Association of Japan), the
Japanese delegations said that it was the Americans who were chiefly responsible
for the internationalization of haiku, not Japan -- and this was thanks not
only  to cultural curiosity but to the efforts of the best poets writing haiku
in  English over the last century. Did you know that there's an American Haiku
 Archives at the Californis State Library in Sacramento? That there are
numerous  local organizations for haiku in North America? The haiku community is a
rich  one on this continent, and it is respected by Japanese haiku poets.

Jeez. Can't we just decide that all contemporary haikus are  "fake" and leave
it at that?

Because to my mind that would be at  least giving them the benefit of the
doubt, since it is extremely unlikely  that a "real" sonnet, a "real" dramatic
monologue, a "real" epic, a "real"  ode, or likewise a "real" haiku could also
be a good poem. Only starting from  the assumption that using any of this forms
or genres is absurd, practically  kitsch, is one likely to get anywhere with
them.

There are societies of watercolor painters out there, according to whose
members, probably, the works of any important contemporary artist who might
produce a watercolor that you'd in the drawing dept. of MoMA or the Whitney  are
just obtuse efforts that show no sense of the rules of watercolor  painting.
But really, one should understand that, unlike hobbyists, real  artists have
only the most contingent interest in following any rules they  have not set for
themselves.

I wasn't aware of this song ("Crazy Fingers"), so I'm glad to know about  it.
However, this is a far cry from haiku at its best. It's not really haiku at
all, not by ANY stretch. Not only does it hit only the superficial and wrong
target of 5-7-5 syllables (apparently), but it completely misses pretty much
all  of the other targets, including ones more important than form. How can
this be  even haiku, let alone American haiku, let alone at its best? No
disrespect,  but such a claim strikes me as unfounded, probably even naive. Only if by
 "American haiku" you mean a "fake" haiku, then sure, whatever, it's
grrrrrreat.  But why wallow in cluelessness, for that is what it is, at least
regarding  serious literary haiku in English? (Of course, it may work perfectly well
in  other ways, but not as haiku.)

Meanwhile, Alexander Jorgensen wrote "I always thought that western poets
couldn't write haiku - regardless of its construct in so far as its understood
by westerners." I'm curious to know what poetry this statement is based on.
I've  heard that kind of statement often enough -- even from folks like Robert
Bly  (though he's softened his stance more recently) -- and 99 times out of a
hundred, the person saying it has never read (or is even aware of) much of the
 basic literature in English-language haiku. There's so much pseudo-haiku out
 there, too, and that gives an even more cloudy view of haiku as written by
Westerners. Honku and spam-ku and comptuer error message haiku and so on have
nearly no understanding of haiku, and certainly nothing to do with literary
haiku (even while they may be fun on their own terms). It's actually TRUE that
 many western poets can't write haiku, but that's because most of them think
they  just have to count out syllables. Quite simply, they can't write haiku
because  they've never properly studied it as a bona fide English-language
genre of  poetry -- not one that's distinct from Japanese haiku, but a serious
literary  genre that is informed by Japanese haiku and its literary history.

Michael,

  fine, it's fake haiku at its best.  In a footnote to Crazy Fingers in Robert Hunter's collection of songs, Box of Rain, he noted that his intent was haiku and that some verses of the song are closer than others.

  Of course

One of the interesting things about the Libby trial is that there are
bloggers in attendance as well as "conventional" journalists. That means a
more or less steady stream of commentary flowing instantly from the
courtroom to whomever is interested. There have been a few posting on
Huffington Post. I finally troubled to check out this blog today:
http://firedoglake.com/. They have a fat file of articles under "CIA Leak"
and "Libby Case", and I get the impression they'll be posting the evidence
as it's released to the media - the same day it's introduced in court.
That's pretty juicy stuff.

I have a feeling at least one veep is starting to squirm. However you feel
about schadenfreude, I bet you'll pay attention if he has to testify under
oath. Mr. Fitzgerald seems eminently qualified to extract some truth from
under that sclerotic, malevolent facade. The "just gossip" and "I forget"
defenses don't appear to be holding up very well.
=20
I've been bugging y'all for a long time about this case, and the way it's
unfolding has not lessened my sense that it could be the key to collapsing
the whole Bushevik house of cards. Following this one thread leads to the
entire web of deceit. (So do any number of others, but this one is IN COURT

impeachment and wave "stop the war" signs, but criminal court is where thes=

Many deep thanks to Michael Dylan Welch for his letters affirming the LIFE
of American Haiku and providing so many insights and so much information.
     A few times before Haiku has been discussed (and dissed one might say a
bit)-and so often concerning only the syllable counting as though
distinguishing right foot from the left means one knows how to walk. A lot
of what i know have learned from reading Japanese and American haiku is ways
of awareness in the world--practicing different ways of seeing things,
movements, colors and how their particualrs cab be continually framed and
reframed within a very few words, not only to present juxtapostion, but in
doing so to provide as Michael wrote, the data for making a leap inside the
mind--opening into a whole other view of the "scenes" so to speak.
Continually training the eye in finding particulars among all that is
happening within an instant--the haiku a way of learning to see distinctly
that which is hidden in plain sight by the too distracted superficial
attention. Out of a mass of colors, forms, movements, exact notations of a
particular moment in a specific time of year--emerge the particles in the
ongoing flow which present paradoxes, contradcitions, things far apart
suddenly brought close.  A haiku is a form of documentary which "opens one's
eyes"--and if one is so inclined, mind, heart, soul, physical awarenesses.
The importance of the time element is to indicate not a stillness bu a
cotinual process of change, in which the insatnt presented in the poem is
taking part--a transitory movement from the no longer present of the moment
before to the not yet present of the moment after.  On the one hand the
teeming chaos of the moment in its incredible profusion of details, on the
other, the nothingness, unknowable--to see with clarity a continual
becoming--out of chaos and nothingness, that which is.
      Hiaku have brought a continual daily work with seeing, hearing,
moving--details within each instant--site/sight/cite--oscillations of an
opening outwo/ards and a paring to the bare bones.
       Haiku bring not just forms of artistic or mystical "illuminations" as
it were--also bring evidences cotinually of social contradictions, paradoxes
all around one.  To see the world from a crowded bus or within a very
confined space--and find in them both a continual happening. Through barred
windows to see everyday the same view yet to find moment by moment it is
changing.
     I am just touching on a very small area of what study of Haiku can
bring for writing, visual work, being alive.  It's a form of disicpline one
may practice at any time any where.  Even in dreams it can happen.
     There is also the spirtual aspect of haiku as a Way.  This can be found
in a great many poets practising haiku as a method among spiritual
disicplines.
      Pascal wrote:  "it is not the elements which are new, but the order of
their arrangement."  To work with arrangements of course you have to
continually discpline the unedrstanding of the elements, and i think Haiku
teaches one in this, how to go about finding what the elements are at any
moment.  Time spent studying cracks in a wall can be an opening into the
anarkeyological possibilities which are ever available.
       The famous text by Basho called "Learn from the Pine" is a great
introduction to ways of working with Haiku as a discipline in living to find
ways to see and hear and move. In this way, the making of the Haiku is like
an instant between the profusion of reality and the nothingness.  Through
discipline "composition must occur in an instant."
Robert Hass edited a great collection of Haiku and prose by Basho, Suson &
Issa called The Essential Haiku--you can find "learn from the Pine" in
there--
to show how hard it to write haiku--i wrote his in an instant from what seen
outside the window
you can see that i wil have to live a hundred years to make aven an average
one
but what i learn from reading others'--has helped change many ways of seeing
for me and i am very thank ful to Haiku for this--

I don't think there can a haiku better than this one by Paul Violi, which I am proud to have published in a magazine I co-edited many years ago. I don't believe it follows a single one of your rules, nor does it follow the conventional syllable count, but it blows my mind:

                 Don't look at my face.
               No change, just large bills.
               One wrong move will be your last.

Actually, I think this one comes from a side-set genre of haiku that Al
Capone once christened (after a sweet heist by one of his boys) as a

                    Noirku

Though the French are fond of calling Paul Violi's particular piece a

                    Noircoup

The French apparently love to apply a "coup" wherever possible to both
elegant and inelegant seizures, Paul V's piece being of the elegant variety,
Obviously.

I hope the introduction of this particular genre/convention is "helpful",
too.

 The cries of peacocks      It's my own ghost I can't get away from.
 Living on the high wire, the cries of peacocks
 mold your babies out of the lichens
 I sleep cradled in, candles lobbing gardens
  into my dreams. I tamp a cigarette out
 and ripples plume like the mooncalf's
 nipples, fat as apples,
 waiting for teeth. Your night sirens like to ride
  etiquette and property, muscles stung and greening
 bulbs break pendulous earth, mocking hours.
 All night long. That morning, the lowest octaves
 came blushing through your gardens, shelling milk
  from pods where clocks seed the bedroom, upchucking
 stars. Think of my phenomenology
 as menagerie, bestial catastrophe,
 lets you ferment and pass away.

Haiku was originally hokku, the starting verse for haikai no renga (modern term is renku), which alternated 5-7-5 and 7-7 verses in a linked pattern with many rules. Renga can be said to have evolved from waka (modern term is tanka, which means short song -- even today, tanka are chanted at the annual Imperial New Year poetry party), a poem usually by a single person in a 5-7-5-7-7 rhythm. Waka (which means "Japanese song")in turn evolved from uta (which means song). This evolution spans 1,300+ years, and was influenced by Chinese. The traditional syllable count for haiku in Japan is indeed natural to the language, and in Japan one can find public signs that naturally follow a 5-7-5 pattern, yet of course are not intended as haiku.

Yes, of course, mere technique is not poetry. However, the vast majority of the public in North America isn't even aware of the necessary techniques. Only if you know them can you begin to play with them, as the great haiku masters did in Japan -- and the best haiku writers writing in English also do. They write out of knowledge, not naivete. Yet in North America so many people blithely -- and even boldly -- blunder on with what they think of as haiku, and even claim as "experimental" or avant garde, when really it is yet another clueless attempt at what has been done a thousand times before and branded a failure. The words in the "Crazy Fingers" song, have practically *nothing* to do with haiku, despite the claim. Fine enough lyrics, I suppose, but lacking any kind of understanding of haiku. Great if it's "influenced" or "inspired" by haiku, but that's the most that can be said of it. But why dwell on something so minor and tangential to haiku when serious literary haiku is
available for your attention?

It baffles me why there's such a wide gap between a literary understanding of haiku (in English and Japanese) and the popular (mis)perceptions of haiku, even among English professors and practicing poets. I concur with Charlie Rossiter who has said for folks to read a book like Lee Gurga's *Haiku: A Poet's Guide* and then to come back in a year to show what you've learned. There is SO much regarding haiku (and yes, starting with necessary and effective technique) that the vast majority of the public does not know. It's as idiotic as me picking up a trumpet for the first or second time and thinking I can play trumpet like Louis Armstrong. Why do people offer their "haiku" to the public with equal naivete?

Meanwhile, someone asked about the meaning of the words in the Laurie Anderson song, "Kokoku." With help from a Japanese translator friend, here's a loose translation of the meaning (these words have nothing akin with haiku):

Kumowaku yamano. Watashino sakebi.
the mountains where the clouds are gathering, my scream

Watashino koewo. Ushano kokoku.
my voice (acc.),  (I am not sure what Ushano is, assuming it's Ushinau or Ushinatta, the lost homeland)

Watashiwa sokoni. Watashiwa asobu.
I, there, I play

Watashiwa sokoni. Watashiwa asobu.
I, there, I play

Mewotoji. Mewotoji. Kikunowa kotori.
closing my eyes, closing my eyes, what I hear is the little bird's song
Watashino sakebi. Watashino koewo
my scream, my voice (acc.)

Getting back to haiku: To tap into the haiku scene, I recommend joining the Haiku Society of America (www.hsa-haiku.org) or Haiku Canada (search online for it), subscribing to one of the many fine haiku journals out there, especially Modern Haiku (www.modernhaiku.org), and perhaps attending one of many local haiku groups. In California, I know of thriving groups in San Francisco and San Jose, another in Sacramento, one in Southern California that I think currently meets in the Pasadena area. There are groups in Colorado, Boston, New York City, Chicago, North Carolina, Western Massachusetts, the Baltimore area, in Toronto, Ottawa, and B.C. -- and more. Also groups in Australia and New Zealand, in England and in many other European countries (there's a surprisingly large and active haiku scene in Croatia, with some of the world's best haiku poets there -- go figure). Online, for haiku, got to www.theheronsnest.com, or check out www.simplyhaiku.com for a full range of articles,
interviews, and translations in addition to poems in various Japanese genres (including haiku, senryu, tanka, haibun, and haiga) -- at this site the articles strikes me as better than the poems, mind you. But there's lots out there, and much to be wary of, but haiku ain't just what you were taught in grade school.

If any of you are in the Vancouver, B.C., area and might be interested, I'll be giving a lecture and presentation on haiku at the main Vancouver Public Library in the evening on March 12, as part of the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival, which this year attracted about 1,150 entries to its Haiku Invitational, for which I served as a cojudge.

Thanks for your message below, David-Baptiste. I like what you say about how haiku trains the eye. It's like a photographer who "frames" images in his or her mind, even if without a camera. Before I was married, it was informative to take a date to the beach, because I found it revealing of the person to see if they'd notice the tiniest shells or driftwood, and have curiosity for the natural world, or if they limited their conversation to shopping or work or whatever, without much interaction with the environment. Call it, perhaps, a "haiku mind," whether one writes haiku or not -- or even any poetry at all. It's a matter of being present and aware, and it certainly helps one write haiku, which is a poetry of the five senses, with a sensitivity to the seasons and thus to nature. It can also be a way of life, a part of one's cosmology.

For what it's worth, I don't think of the haiku I write as "American haiku." It's haiku.

Haiku deserves a lot of dissing. That's because there's a boat-load of crap out there -- the pseudohaiku, of course, but also the trivial stuff that most people write and think is haiku (though I can hardly blame them, given how haiku is nearly uniformly mistaught in schools). And even those who excel at haiku play a percentage game (as does any poet). I think it was Basho who said one is a master if you write just ten excellent haiku in a lifetime (we have a record, I believe, of something like 1,500 of Basho's haiku; Issa is known to have written 20,000, and most of them are weak or just average). But I think haiku has earned an extra amount of dissing because is strikes so many people as easy, and people dash 'em off, or pervert them as literature by writing flippantly. In his excellent book, *Empire of Signs*, Roland Barthes says "haiku has this rather fantasmagorical property: that we always suppose we ourselves can write such things easily."

For anyone who wants to write seriously *about* haiku, or to study it, I am pretty sure that they will see a difference between the latest pseudo-haiku book like *Haikus for Jews* or *Honku* (about road rage, etc.) and serious literary haiku written in English. However, there's a middle ground between the two that too many people think of as haiku, yet is still far wide of the mark, as any kind of literature. That stuff deserves dissing, too. What is odd is that some people diss the literary achievements because they are naive enough to say that, well, it's not 5-7-5. People cling so hard to that notion, for reasons that I can't fathom. I can only imagine that it's because they learned this incorrect rule (for haiku in English) at an impressionable age, when their teachers could do no wrong, and thus they swallowed it hook, line, and sinker.

For me, haiku makes perfect use of what Eliot called the objective correlative. Haiku dwells on things (nouns) that carry meaning and emotion ("no ideas but in things"). Haiku (even literary haiku) can be many things to different people, but to me it has a spiritual aspect, a sort of approach to infinity (by approaching the narrowest of image-moments). By the way, this spirituality that I find in haiku has little to do with Zen (another misperception of haiku, which the Japanese are puzzled at regarding the American understanding of haiku -- thanks to folks like Alan Watts, R. H. Blyth, Jack Kerouac and other Beats, who promoted haiku from that perspective).

I teach a class on using haiku techniques to improve your longer poetry. The point of view, the awareness, that David-Baptiste mentioned in his message is a big part of that, but so are the ability to control objectivity and subjectivity, to create implication through juxtaposition (and thus create intuitive, emotional, or even intellectual effects), and a reliance on seasons as archetypes to add weight and compression to the poem. Rather than being "easy" to write, haiku can be very hard indeed.

Indeed, the true discipline of haiku has nothing to do with counting syllables. That's trivial and superficial, and nearly everyone I've met who says they like that discipline has been completely unaware of the much more challenging disciplines that literary haiku require. And that's entirely aside from the fact that 5-7-5 syllables in English is a misguided taget relative to the 17 mora of Japanese haiku.

FYI, the word "haiku" need not be treated with a capital H, in the same way that it's not necessary to capitalize the S in "sonnet." Why do people do that? I've never understood that.

Also, Robert Hass's *Essential Haiku* book of poems by Basho, Buson, and Issa (inexplicably and lazily omitting Shiki, the fourth great master of Japanese haiku) is lyrical and approachable, but not the most reliable of translations. For example, Hass repeats an error of an earlier translator of ascribing the "for me going / for you staying / two autumns" haiku to Buson, when in fact it was written by Shiki -- what does that tell you about his sources?

I would also say that "writing in an instant" does not in itself necessarily produce good haiku. Basho rewrote his poems or reordered and restructured their appearance in the *Oku no hosomichi* (Narrow Road to the Interior). Rather, one CAN write in an instant, but one need not stop there. And like any art, or even a sport, it builds upon practice. The perfect serve of a Wimbledon champion is not just in an instant, but is a culmination of a lifetime of practice.

Michael

P.S. I've been asked offlist to share some of my haiku. You'll find some (and some senryu) online, paired with photographs, at http://www.brooksbookshaiku.com/welch/. I put this together about eight years ago.

Subject: Re: Haiku Death Match/HAIKU LIFE

Many deep thanks to Michael Dylan Welch for his letters affirming the LIFE
of American Haiku and providing so many insights and so much information.
     A few times before Haiku has been discussed (and dissed one might say a
bit)-and so often concerning only the syllable counting as though
distinguishing right foot from the left means one knows how to walk. A lot
of what i know have learned from reading Japanese and American haiku is ways
of awareness in the world--practicing different ways of seeing things,
movements, colors and how their particualrs cab be continually framed and
reframed within a very few words, not only to present juxtapostion, but in
doing so to provide as Michael wrote, the data for making a leap inside the
mind--opening into a whole other view of the "scenes" so to speak.
Continually training the eye in finding particulars among all that is
happening within an instant--the haiku a way of learning to see distinctly
that which is hidden in plain sight by the too distracted superficial
attention. Out of a mass of colors, forms, movements, exact notations of a
particular moment in a specific time of year--emerge the particles in the
ongoing flow which present paradoxes, contradcitions, things far apart
suddenly brought close.  A haiku is a form of documentary which "opens one's
eyes"--and if one is so inclined, mind, heart, soul, physical awarenesses.
The importance of the time element is to indicate not a stillness bu a
cotinual process of change, in which the insatnt presented in the poem is
taking part--a transitory movement from the no longer present of the moment
before to the not yet present of the moment after.  On the one hand the
teeming chaos of the moment in its incredible profusion of details, on the
other, the nothingness, unknowable--to see with clarity a continual
becoming--out of chaos and nothingness, that which is.
      Hiaku have brought a continual daily work with seeing, hearing,
moving--details within each instant--site/sight/cite--oscillations of an
opening outwo/ards and a paring to the bare bones.
       Haiku bring not just forms of artistic or mystical "illuminations" as
it were--also bring evidences cotinually of social contradictions, paradoxes
all around one.  To see the world from a crowded bus or within a very
confined space--and find in them both a continual happening. Through barred
windows to see everyday the same view yet to find moment by moment it is
changing.
     I am just touching on a very small area of what study of Haiku can
bring for writing, visual work, being alive.  It's a form of disicpline one
may practice at any time any where.  Even in dreams it can happen.
     There is also the spirtual aspect of haiku as a Way.  This can be found
in a great many poets practising haiku as a method among spiritual
disicplines.
      Pascal wrote:  "it is not the elements which are new, but the order of
their arrangement."  To work with arrangements of course you have to
continually discpline the unedrstanding of the elements, and i think Haiku
teaches one in this, how to go about finding what the elements are at any
moment.  Time spent studying cracks in a wall can be an opening into the
anarkeyological possibilities which are ever available.
       The famous text by Basho called "Learn from the Pine" is a great
introduction to ways of working with Haiku as a discipline in living to find
ways to see and hear and move. In this way, the making of the Haiku is like
an instant between the profusion of reality and the nothingness.  Through
discipline "composition must occur in an instant."
Robert Hass edited a great collection of Haiku and prose by Basho, Suson &
Issa called The Essential Haiku--you can find "learn from the Pine" in
there--
to show how hard it to write haiku--i wrote his in an instant from what seen
outside the window
you can see that i wil have to live a hundred years to make aven an average
one
but what i learn from reading others'--has helped change many ways of seeing
for me and i am very thank ful to Haiku for this--

Bridge Fight

Bow of our boat
In the weedy scene

Non-literate
Letter

Woman in the bushes
In the painting

In the bushes
Helicopter

Down in the river
Our boat

Down in the river

Figures of disputation, 'we
Fought for the bridge for five weeks'

Everything 'til now was water,
Pre-

*

Painting of the battle
On the site of the battle

Flank attack by the language god
Bituminous bastard loves an allegory

Night breeze kicks up between your lines
Within

Illumination flare lights what it can
Beyond bright blackness

Mr. Chien with his hand on the rudder
Mr. Thuong with his thumb shot off

In stuttering etcetera

'Maynard Smith drowned
A kid whose name I can't remember

Was killed by a recoilless
Another guy was killed by a recoilless

And then we took Ed's boat to Cua Viet
Where it hit a mine'

'When there's trouble and we're beset'

Something happening
Something just going to happen

Two monks, one in saffron
One in tweed

Meet the Press: An Evening With Factory School Design Team

The performative culmination of a series of public statements about small
press poetry, anarchism and education, Bill Marsh and Joel Kuszai will
describe the progress of Factory School learning and production collective
in the context of their 2006 move to New York City. Part lecture-theatrics,
part analytic-hijinks, their multimedia performance will demonstrate the
range of their work at Factory School, from research and design to
publishing and resource sharing. Bill Marsh works at the Institute of
Writing Studies on the Queens campus of St. John's University and is
founding member of Factory School. From April 2005 to January 2007 he
curated the Heretical Texts series. Joel Kuszai has been involved in
critical thinking since 2003. He resides in Queens, where he teaches
cultural rhetoric at Queensborough Community College.


Wednesday, February 14, 8:00 pm
Eugene Ostashevsky & Stephen Rodefer

Eugene Ostashevsky's books of poetry include Iterature and Infinite Recurso=
r
Or The Bride of DJ Spinoza, both available through Ugly Duckling Presse. He
translates Russian absurdist literature of the 1930s, and is the editor of
OBERIU: An Anthology of Russian Absurdism, published by Northwestern
University Press. In honor of Valentine's Day, Eugene will strive to bring
tears to the eyes of both the loved and the unloved. The American writer an=
d
Parisian resident Stephen Rodefer is the author of the prize-winning Four
Lectures, Villon by Jean Calais, Emergency Measures, Passing Duration, Mon
Canard and Left Under a Cloud, among many other titles. He is presently

the greatest living American poet, and the oldest living teenager. He has
none of it.



Spring Workshops at the Poetry Project


The Poetry School Of Poetry =AD  Douglas Rothschild
Tuesdays at 7 Pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 13th

Writing  poetry is difficult; writing good poetry, more difficult still. In
this  workshop, we will focus on exactly what we think is good in a poem &
determine how our senses of aesthetics inform our responses to this
question. Working within our own aesthetic notions we will then begin to
refine our  writing, & help each other to write the best poems that we can.
The workshop  will conduct a number of actual experiments with writing that
will allow us to  step outside the world of id, which wants to keep all the
beautiful words,  & into the artistic self, which understands which pieces
fit & which  belong elsewhere. We will also engage the basic Poetry School
of Poetry premise  that the poet=B9s first job is to learn how to edit. Dgls
N. Rthschld has been  behind the foods table at the New Years Reading more
times than it is worth  mentioning. He has also written a number of
chapbooks, the most ground breaking  entitled The Minor Arcane.  He has
taught what seem to be innumerable college writing classes, and is
currently teaching at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, a CUNY
school.=20


The Visible Unseen: Writing Outside Borders =AD Akilah Oliver
Thursdays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 15th

Are  poetry and prose virtual realities, simulations of something other, or
the real  thing? Where does the =B3I=B2  live? How many moments exist in  the
moment of the line? What  borders of form are crucial for us to hang on to =
&
which boundaries are  collapsible? In this workshop, we  will explore the
connections and tensions between the visible and the unseen  world/s, not a=
s
dualities or binaries, but as complementary sites of  composition. Through
engagement with text (written and visual), public spaces, the imagination,
dreams and Eros, participants are invited to think of writing as that which
re-imagines the known and the unknown. Though this is a text based workshop=
,
poets, prose writers, and artists from all disciplines are welcome. Reading=
s
include: Giorgio Agamben, Laura Mullen, Whitman, Anne Waldman, Derrida, &
Ben Okri. Akilah Oliver is the  author of the she said dialogues: flesh
memory, An Arriving Guard of Angels, Thusly  Coming to Greet, a(A)gust, &
The Putterer=B9s Notebook. She is faculty at the Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics Summer  Writing Program at Naropa University.


Impurity  Rocks! A Poetry Lab & Workshop =AD Joanna Fuhrman
Fridays at 7 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 16th

The class will focus on  =B3impure=B2 poetry, poetry that employs a mixture of
tones and styles. Special  emphasis will be placed on works that combine
narrative and humor with  linguistic and imagistic disjunction. In-class
exercises and take-home assignments  will touch on issues of scale, space,
sound, genre and wordplay. Time will also  be devoted to reading published
poems as well as in-depth discussions and  critiques of student work. Joann=
a
Fuhrman is the author of three collections of  poetry, Freud in Brooklyn,
Ugh Ugh Ocean and Moraine, all published by Hanging Loose Press. She has
taught poetry  writing at The University of Washington, The Cooper Union
Saturday Outreach  program and in the New York City Public Schools.


Poetry  For The Page, Stage, And Computer Screen =AD Thomas Savage
Saturdays At 12 pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 17th

This  course is a writing workshop where students' writing is the main
focus.  Also used as inspiration and writing prompts will be samples of wor=
k
by  writers from The Beats, Black Mountain poets, The New York School (all
generations), Language Poetry, Poets Theater, Pablo Neruda, and works being
published today online, among other sources. Practices will include  readin=
g
as well as writing assignments and, in a great Poetry Project tradition,
in-class writing. Thomas Savage has written eight published books of  poems
including most recently Bamiyan Poems, Brain Surgery Poems and Political
Conditions/Physical  States. His poems  have appeared in many print and
online venues including The New York Times, Hanging Loose, Rattapallax, Big
Bridge, Black Box, and regularly on the Wryting-L website. He has taught
poetry  workshops at The Poetry Project and Tribes Gallery.

Folks-
 An era has ended.  Anna Nicole Smith died today in a hotel room in
Hollywood, Florida. She was 39 years old.  I am hopeful that works of art,
music, literature, etc. are forthcoming to commemorate her life and mourn
her tragic death.  A special issue of Painted Bride Quarterly, perhaps.

Oh, maybe I sound ironic, but I really am feeling this one.

Hello all,

I am looking for the book Poetics of Embodiment: A Theory of Exceptions by
Jed Rasula and it does not come up even in a google search.  Perhaps I
have the title wrong. It was reccomended to me by a friend.

If anyone can help me out, let me know. I checked ABE and SPD, nothing
came up there as well.


Thanks,

Adam

No, Finnegan's Wake is a strophe.

  An apostrophe is a diacritical mark,

  Finnegans Wake has critical marks.



  how's that for the Haiku discussion?

    No, Finnegans Wake IS an apostrophe.

Hi,

I wanted to invite people to swing by a (relatively) new mailing list that
I've set up that hopes to explore the intersections between science,
science fiction, and poetry. It casts a fairly wide net, but I hope that
some will find it of interest.

The People's League of Speculative Poetry

http://groups.google.com/group/speculativepoetry/

An open and open-ended community whose poetic work or interests involve,
but is not necessarily limited to: science fiction, science, cybernetics,
metaphysics, futurism, simulacra, junk sci-fi culture, hyper-globalism, and
killer robots. Discussions and postings of poetry and poetics welcome.

Best wishes,
Alan DeNiro

I've followed her career fairly closely, watched the 'reality show,' and
was fascinated; she resisted easy summaries, but there was always a
violent edge to things around her that felt exhausted. She died ten years
older than Anita Berber and six than Christ.

I'm enjoying what you say about haiku--
but one question about what you say below?
why such shorthand staples of early 20th c.---eliot's objective
correlative? or no ideas but in things?
that seems to distort/reduce too the haiku suggestiveness?
for example, the shiki one you quote below...

or, what for you is it to "control objectivity and subjectivity"

A creditable online journal. Lots of integrity. Lots

but if we did that, then folks wouldn't be able to be snobby about authenticity. because we all know that authenticity is what's really important. and
  in order for anything to be authentic, it must first be esoteric. i think what should be done is that all the books about haiku, in particular lee
gurga's that keeps getting recommended, ought to be entrusted to secret societies and all publicly available copies should be burnt. and then everyone
who thinks it's important that a haiku be "real" can join the secret societies, and the rest of us can get on with writing short poems. i'll even
promise to never call a short poem of mine a haiku so long as the haiku-snobs will promise to point out that it isn't really a haiku. then we can all
be at peace with one another in a sort of zen state of mutually acknowledged dumbness.

Here are some interesting Russian sites:

http://cmart.design.ru (net art)
http://www.andrekarpov.com (Andre Karpov, citizen of the world)

I read the essay at www.emich.edu/studentorgs/bhouse , Alexander. Curious.
Many new media artists and critics are at pains to insist on the
unimportance of net art which, they maintain, is no longer serious. I
surmise that what is serious is work in galleries, and performance. And
video and film. And glossy books.

Fishy.

Folks-
 An era has ended.  Anna Nicole Smith died today in a hotel room in
Hollywood, Florida. She was 39 years old.  I am hopeful that works of art,
music, literature, etc. are forthcoming to commemorate her life and mourn
her tragic death.  A special issue of Painted Bride Quarterly, perhaps.

Oh, maybe I sound ironic, but I really am feeling this one.

artists’ books include A Book of Closings and Moonlighting. His serial poem Mantle (with Thom
Donovan) was published by Atticus Finch in 2005, and his next book of poems will be published by
BlazeVox Books in 2007. He currently teaches poetry and typography at the University at Buffalo.

David Levi Strauss is a writer and critic in New York, where his essays and reviews appear
regularly in Artforum and Aperture. His collection of essays on photography and politics, Between
the Eyes, with an introduction by John Berger, was published by Aperture in 2003, and has just
been released in an Italian edition by Postmedia. The Book of 101 Books: Seminal Photography Books
of the Twentieth Century, with catalogue essays by Strauss, was published by P.P.P. Editions and
D.A.P. in 2001. Between Dog & Wolf: Essays on Art & Politics was published in 1999 by Autonomedia,
and Broken Wings: The Legacy of Landmines (with photographer Bobby Neel Adams) came out in 1998.
His essays have appeared in a number of recent books and monographs on artists such as Leon Golub
and Nancy Spero, Martin Puryear, Miguel Rio Branco, Francesca Woodman, Carolee Schneemann, and
Alfredo Jaar. He was the founding editor of ACTS: A Journal of New Writing (1982-1990), and author
of a book of poetry, Manoeuvres, before moving from San Francisco to New York in 1993. He has been
awarded a Logan grant, three Artspace grants, a Visiting Scholar Research Fellowship from the
Center for Creative Photography, a Guggenheim fellowship in 2003-04, and the Infinity Award for
writing from the International Center of Photography in 2006. Strauss taught at the Center for
Curatorial Studies at Bard College from 2001-05, and is now on the faculties of both the Graduate
School of the Arts and the undergraduate studio art program at Bard.
In his introduction to Between the Eyes, John Berger wrote, “Strauss, who is a poet and
storyteller as well as being a renowned commentator on photography (I reject the designation
critic) looks at images very hard . . . and comes face-to-face with the unexplained. Again and
again. The unexplained that he encounters has only little to do with the mystery of art and
everything to do with the mystery of countless lives being lived.” And Luc Sante wrote, “David
Levi Strauss brings an eloquent and deep moral seriousness to his examination of photography.
Again and again he makes the ringing point that trying to separate aesthetics and politics can
only result in vacuity. He is photography’s troubled conscience.”
Half hope, half fear. Like when people who react against politically committed art say, on the one
hand, that such art is pretentious, delusional, and dishonest, since art is powerless to cause
real political change; and, on the other hand, that this kind of art is irresponsible and
dangerous, since it inflames the passions of the already savage rabble. So which is it, dog or
wolf?
~ from Between Dog & Wolf

An anecdote:

In a class on cross cultural criticism, discussing
some of Picasso's later work. A student begins by
stating the images studied are an example of the
objectification of women, that such images of a woman
exposed with legs drawn can only be constructed by
another woman and indicates, which is more interesting
to me, that Picasso's work is bad - malicious, even. I
understand that these are tools for examining culture,
etc - and it's all old for me - but for me what was
more interesting was what it indicated about the
author, Picasso, who in later years was stricken by a
kind of psychological melee related to his declining
health and prostate cancer. What do you think? And
back-channel if deemed safer.
Certainly there is no universality of thought with
regards to these issues of representation, but I'm
trying to gage where some of us are.

Vagina Monologues Gets New Name

vagina_monologues_gets_new_name.html

The Atlantic Theaters marquis in Atlantic Beach Florida caused a stir
when they changed the advertisement for the Vagina Monologues to the
"Hoohaa" Monologues after receiving a complaint about the play's name.

A driver complained to the theater, saying that she saw the title and
was upset that her niece had also seen the title.

Bryce Pfanenstiel, of the Atlantic Theater, said "We got a complaint
about this play The Vagina Monologues. We decided we would just use
child slang for it. That's how we decided on Hoohah Monologues."

Though the theater says they trying not to offend anyone, some are
upset over the change. "A child who is old enough to read it on a
sign should already know what 'vagina' is, as well as vulva, penis,
scrotum, clitoris," some are saying about the sign change.

The Vagina Monologues is an award winning play written by Eve Ensler
which premiered at the off-Broadway Westside Theatre in 1996. The
play is a series of monologues preformed by women that relate to the
vagina, be it through sex, love, rape, menstruation, mutilation,
masturbation, birth, orgasm, the variety of names for the vagina, or
simply as a physical aspect of the female body. A recurring theme
throughout the piece is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment,
and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.

Yes, such lament.  Here's my poem to mark the occasion. It's not very
good--like yesterday's news--  Belz



ANNA NICOLE SMITH (1967-2007)

You said you wanted
to make a name
for yourself.

What kind of name?
They asked.
Anna Nicole Smith,

you replied
in a tiny voice--
then found

a husband's worth
of love in a man
named Howard Stern

who, not a DJ,
knew the logic
of your reply.

Yes. I agree. Our making fun of dead people isn't poetics.

How about ee cummings making fun of buffalo bill's defunct atony? Maybe
it depends on how long the subject is dead? And of course the motives of
the fun-maker?

No. I think Belz did an honest and fair job of poetically eulogizing ANS.

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

Green and Gray

Geoffrey G. O'Brien is a Lecturer at the University of California,
Berkeley, and the author of _The Guns and Flags Project _(UC Press).

http://go.ucpress.edu/O'Brien

"O'Brien writes meditative poetry at the highest level.  The thinking
here is not 'about' anything; rather thinking becomes a modality of
being within which the potential of lyric situations unfolds and
takes on delightful intensities. These are not poems to interpret but
to explore for how the mind attentive to the full resources of lyric
traditions stretches the senses and therefore finds itself more truly
and more strange."-Charles Altieri


Geoffrey G. O'Brien's second collection documents the "remorse of the
senses" that attends each moment of experience, the pain and pleasure
of not exiting a world in which injustice and distraction secure
every sensual event. Attempting to reestablish experience as
something other than complicity, these poems insist on "desiring that
which is as if it were not," making poetry out of neighborhood
flyers, the Patriot Act, and the poverty of presidential speech.
Given this mandate to stay within limited resources, _Green and Gray_
makes a virtue of refusing to abandon them, often relying on an
emphatic recirculation of words and phrases to generate its own
system complexities. These are poems whose materials remember their
former use: the gray of the city and the green it used to be.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is
available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/O'Brien

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

Harm.

Steve Willard's work has been published in _Colorado Review, Volt,
Boston Review, Denver Quarterly,_ and _1913 - A Journal of Forms._

http://go.ucpress.edu/Willard

"You'll want to stop right now and read this book. No day should be
without its adamancy, its invention, its honesty. Its edge of
defiance, mixed with triumph, operates like a spotlight on human
possibility. Always veering just out of sense on a curve of sound,
Willard's is a voice that not only has something new to say but that
has also has found a new way to say it. This is language at the speed
of life."-Cole Swensen, author of _The Book of a Hundred Hands_


This debut volume establishes Steve Willard as a true original, an
artist whose kinetic sense of wordplay is deft, smart, and
unfailingly provocative. Intended to be read in repeated passes,
these poems are Cubist in feel, multifaceted in syntax, and brilliant
in coloration. By turns disjunctive, narrative, plaintive, and
disruptive, _Harm. _makes use of a wide formal range in reaching
toward its ambition, which is nothing short of reclaiming lost human
potentiality from current norms. Syntax flexes and the world is
refigured, observed as if through a different camera's open aperture,
drawing the reader to a new and transformative interior landscape.

Full information about the bookis available online:

If ever I tended toward misanthropic brooding, the postings on this are
inspiring.

Thinking of Aristotle's definition of tragic and given the media-,
fame-hungry society we live in. . . add to that the fact that her child died
before she did, it is tragic and hardly a call for jokes in bad taste.
The only thing I find ironic is that people who write poetry can look at
things with such a shallow gaze.

Well, my wife did that 4 months ago,

Hey folks  - my poem, and my sense of loss, is real. The Anna Nicole Smith
story is complex and symbolic of our age.  I think the fact that you read
the poem as "making fun" might speak more to your own academic detachedness
rather than anything inherently lighthearted about the poem I posted.

She always fascinated me. Like Michael Jackson she broke a lot of taboos,
she couldn't be placed. Her reality show was time slowed, almost milky.
Howard K. Stern talked Ivy League, she murmured. Her son was there. I
never knew what I was watching. I was constantly thrown off, in a way that
her son's death was thrown off, and her death, now, is thrown off.

She couldn't be placed: just as soon as you had it figured out, it
transformed. I did guess that she and Howard were lovers; it was an odd
subtext to the show. The photographs were sexy but meta-sexed; they didn't
register properly, there was always something else going on. On another
list people rave Anita Berber; there's a relationship.

So poetics? Yes because this doesn't fit, it fractures, it breaks the
discourse of the Law, however you want to define it. It's not only
semantics, it's syntax that's broken down, just as reporters couldn't get
"hold" of Michael Jackson.

Then again, her life and death say something about our notions of beauty,
a kind of inconceivable sexuality associated with it, the body can't keep
up. What's incarnate falls apart; it's always already fallen apart.

Finally, there are very real class (economic, geographic, educational)
issues here; like Tonya Harding, she couldn't keep up (I remember TH's
mother saying she couldn't raise an ice princess), or she kept up, on
her own track, in her own way, which is something few of us get to do.

This really was upsetting.

If Paul Violi's "Don't look at my face. / No change, just large bills. / One wrong move will be your last." poem blows your mind, wonderful. It's quite arresting, I agree. But it's not because it has anything to do with haiku (except for the obvious overlap with haiku of having brevity, which gives the poem focus). So the problem here is either you or the poet labelling it as a haiku. For an overview of reasons why it has little to do with haiku, see my online essay "Becoming a Haiku Poet" (http://www.haikuworld.org/begin/mdwelch.apr2003.html). Or see the 2005 edition of *Poet's Market* (Writer's Digest Books, 2004), in which I have an essay on haiku and applying its techniques and aesthetics to the writing of longer poetry. Comments welcome.

By the way, wordplay on "low-ku," "noir-coup," or whatever, is another mark of haiku poetasters. So are most poems about haiku. I went through this stage, too. But I got over it. This is the kind of trivia I got over (from the esteemed pen of Mr. Daniel Zimmerman):

flag haiku

    one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten e-
    leven twelve thirteen

A wee bit of reseach in haiku literature would reveal, by the way, that haiku nearly never have titles, and there are important reasons why. As Charlie Rossiter says, do some *serious* research and study of the genre before proclaiming work as being haiku, let alone saying that you "don't think there can be a haiku better" than the example by Paul Violi. As strong as Violi's poem may be as poetry, and as clear as its virtues are (I could see myself publishing it too), it has nearly nothing to do with haiku, and is easily torn apart for failing as haiku.

And a quick, respectful message to George (Bowering): You say, "Best US haiku I know is Ron Padgett's:"

Seven syllables
Eleven syllables
Seven syllables

I have to hope your tongue is in your cheek. But if so, why? Why promote a poem that doesn't take the genre seriously? If you mean to damn all American poems by favouring such an obviously clueless one, then that seems to suggest an unfamiliarity with the best haiku written in English. And if your tongue's not in your cheek, why would you say this is a good haiku? Have you read Cor van den Heuvel's *Haiku Anthology*, just for starters?

For a slightly dated annotated list of recommended books on haiku, visit http://mensaww.org/HaikuBooks.htm.

Chris Stroffolino also writes that one of the "shorthand staples of early 20th c.---eliot's objective
correlative? or no ideas but in things?" . . . "seems to distort/reduce too the haiku suggestiveness."

I would answer by saying this: Because haiku -- perhaps more than any other poetry (because it's so short) --  relies on the emotive power behind things, the notion of the objective correlative increases its suggestiveness rather than distort or reduce it. We have an immediate reaction to the word chair that's different, say, than our reaction to the word soup. And think, too, of how we react differently to "easy chair" compared with "electric chair." I'm just naming things with these examples, but these objects correlate to immediate emotions or feelings, or connotations and associations. Even a "stone" will carry some feeling for us when we read the word in a poem, though of course the nature of that feeling may vary from person to person. There's more to the concept of the objective correlative than just this, of course, but haiku relies on the emotive power of things perhaps more strongly than other poetry. To the extent that haiku is mostly objective, focusing on nouns a
nd things such as they are (yet presented in such a way to imply a relationship and an intuitive feeling), haiku strongly rely on the emotive weight associated with each thing named in the poem. Certainly there are subjective or nonliteral elements in some haiku (such as in Shiki's poem, "for me going / for you staying / two autumns," or Basho's haiku about the cicada's cries piercing the rocks), but not every haiku is or needs to be strictly objective. It's a matter of finding balance, within each poem, and in a particular poem relative to other poems. They are examples of controlling the objectivity and subjectivity, and typically, where there's a subjective element in haiku, it's usually in the context of something that's clearly objective -- something that grounds the rest of the poem so the subjective element isn't overpowering.

Sure, you can do ____ (whatever: fill in the blank) in a haiku -- but not necessarily often (heck, even have a title once in a very rare while, if it somehow really needs it). Haiku is not a strict set of rules (don't think that I think it is). Rather, haiku is a field of multiple targets, and a good haiku will hit multiple targets at once, but not necessarily all of them -- and occasionally miss one or two of them (on purpose) that certain people might feel are more important and should never be missed. That's why it's good to see haiku as a continuum with other kinds of poetry. Poetry first, labels later (if at all). But, I hasten to say, as soon as you label something as haiku, it had better be a proper understanding of haiku that you mean -- and for too many folks, that's not the case.

Michael
P.S. To discuss another poem offered here, from Eric (mr.eric.yost@GMAIL.COM):

Golf Haiku

Robin watches drive,
waits until I leave the tee,
probes divot for worm.

Here are some problems with this "haiku" (which I would hope would be among the 1,000 haiku one writes before trying to publish any -- a task that haiku writer Jim Kacian set for himself):

1. It has a title, which haiku avoid (and in this case, the title is redundant -- we know from the poem that it's about golf, and we don't need to be condescended to and be told it's a haiku; in other "haiku" that have titles, the title is a sort of cheating -- adding a fourth line).
2. It drops natural articles in the first and third lines (a robin, a/my drive, the divot). Paul O. Williams, writing in *The Nick of Time: Essays on Haiku Aeshetics*, calls this tontoism. It arises when a person is insufficiently accomplished at crafting the poem to make it properly fit a form (if they wish to follow a prescribed syllable count), or if they think somehow that it's "better" simply to be briefer (if they're not following a set form). Ted Kooser has written that a good poem is like looking at tropical fish through the bottom of a glass-bottom boat, and that you don't want things to clatter down onto the glass as you look, or see smudges on the glass, and thus make you aware of where you're looking from. Rather, you want to be totally absorbed in what you're seeing, to experience IT as much as possible. As soon as you resort to tontoism, you show the apparatus, the scaffolding, and also reveal that following an arbitrary syllable count like an obedient school bo
y is more important than crafting good content. (Let form be an extension of content!) The words of a good poem should be as invisible as possible, letting you feel the meaning or experience the image as sharply as possible -- this is why haiku is sometimes called the "wordless poem" (Alan Watts; Eric Amann). My goodness, the haiku crime of tontoism should be punishable by a lifetime of having to listen to Rod McKuen poetry speeded up to chipmunk speed. That's such a basic matter of crafting. I would have expected better on this discussion list.
3. It is presented as a sentence (ending with a period, even), and is oblivious to the fragmentary nature of haiku. Starting with a lowercase letter in this case would also prevent the misreading of "Robin" as a person's name, which muddies the interpretation of this poem. The lopping off of the article ("a robin") is another contributor to the wooliness in this line.
4. It lacks the two-part juxtapositional structure that focuses our attention on a specific emotion that we can figure out (the poem lacks implication and reverberation). Haiku, too, are usually not narrative like this one, and are usually best if they avoid a cause/effect presentation.
5. The poem is choppy and awkward.
6. Because of the worm, I suppose we can imagine it's spring or summer (I'd have to check the history of "worm" as a seasonal indicator), but the seasonal element isn't strong here. (That doesn't bother me too much, though.) A strong seasonal element, however, can greatly deepen the effect of a poem by tapping into seasonal or natural archetypes, and alluding to other poems about the same subject (allusion and a technique known as honkodori is common in Japanese poetry).
7. The biggest problem is that this is a so-what poem. There's no implication, nothing for the reader to figure out. I like the image well enough -- that a bird is waiting for your divot to look for worms (that's either a smart robin, or a lazy one). But that's all there is too it, and it's obfuscated by the awkward and unnecessary syntax, all in the name of 5-7-5. But something more needs to be left out, to be implied. Consider, for example, this poem: "an old woolen sweater / taken yarn by yarn / from the snowbank." When students in my classes figure out that it's about a bird taking bits of yarn for a nest in spring, their faces light up with realization -- they "get it." Yet no bird is mentioned. Most of the time, if a haiku doesn't leave something out to be "got," then it fails as a haiku, no matter how well the objectivity or subjectivity is controlled, whether it employs a kigo or kireji equivalent, or shasei (sketching form life) techniques -- and more. And through al
l of this, of course, it's irrelevant whether the poem is 5-7-5 or not.

On the good side, this poem is objective, but the POINT of using objectivity is to create some sort of subjective reaction -- an emotional or intuitive moment. And this poem feels too shallow in its use of objective description to have created enough of a leap, overtones, or reverberation. It's got a greater starter image for a haiku, that haiku don't end with images, they start with them.

Maybe with my good Protestant origins, I have never been at home with
adherence to any kind of orthodox system of behavior, but I find your
insistences about Haiku (origins and form) static and humorless.
Occasionally I work among elderly Chinese emigrants here in San Francisco,
and indeed, for example, in making watercolors, many of them continue to
adhere unwaveringly to 'branches, leaves, blossoms and bird' forms -
sometimes attractive but boring, boring, rigid, etc. At best you want to
tear up the pages and introduce students to the fresh experience of montage,
collage, etc.
Such as with Violi's haiku - the juxtaposition of what he has done against
conventional content is startling, refreshing - a response that I find with
what I can only sense to be  'good' translations of 'ancient' haiku. Much of
which I suspect Paul Violi and many of us have been variably interested
readers - whether via Pound, Rexroth, Waley & on.

Your argument for a formally true Haiku, seems as claustrophobic to me as
someone who might argue - with similar orthodox leanings - that Coltrane,
Rollins, etc., etc. are not making authentic "ballads".   Morph, my friend,
morph - it is, from my experience, at least, a mutable, non-static universe
of which the contemporary spirit and practice of haiku is inextricably
involved.

I don't think something has to be esoteric to be authentic. That's certainly the case for haiku (and here I note that the theme for the 2005 Haiku North America conference was "authenticity"!). In fact, if a haiku is too esoteric, it tends to *lose* authenticity for many people because they can't relate to it, or even stretch themselves to do so. Better, I think, to be esoteric (if you want) while also still being sufficiently authentic and accessible. Leaf through the pages of *Modern Haiku* magazine, or Cor van den Heuvel's *The Haiku Anthology*, and over and over you will find poems that strike a fine balance between the esoteric (alienating in the extreme) and the immediate (to easy and comfortable in the extreme). It's a balance between the universal and the particular, and a balance between the expression of the self and the effective communication of that self to someone else.

More to the point here, Jason (re your message below), it seems I or others come off as haiku snobs to you. Forgive me for such snobbishness, if you can. And then I hope you and anyone else who feels the same way can still take a look at the ISSUE itself to see whether you understand it fully or not. I guess I am wagging a finger here, aren't I? And I'm obviously in earnest. But there are problems that deserve to have fingers wagged at them. Indeed, tell me, what else are we who write literary haiku supposed to do? I don't want to be snobbish about haiku -- in fact, one of the virtues of haiku is how accessible it can be, in that it focuses on everyday subjects of personal immediacy (Issa wrote about the flies in his house, Buson about his dead wife's comb underfoot). Yet what should we do if we see haiku being so widely misunderstood, even just in the mainstream poetry community (never mind the general public)? What, pray tell, am I being dumb about (to refer to the end of y
our message)?

I discuss the issue of influences in haiku, and the range of possibilities in the genre, in particular regarding the anthology *Unswept Path*, from White Pine Press -- an excellent yet flawed book. In this review, I deride the notion of a secret handshake for haiku poets. A secret society or the ghettoization of haiku is not what I think is good for anybody, hence this discussion. These are tricky matters of education, and unfortunately it seems to need to begin with the implication that person A is educated, and person B is not. It need never be brought up, except that, in this case person B seems to be claiming, even if not overtly, to be "educated" about haiku, when in fact that's demonstrably not the case. I'm interested in deghettoizing haiku here, and that means, I think, some education for those outside the haiku g
hetto, as well as some education for those in the ghetto. A dialog between the two will do worlds of good. That's what I'm after. Telling me to keep my haiku to myself in a secret society isn't going to help. So how do we curb such haiku "snobbishness" and address the real issue at hand?

but if we did that, then folks wouldn't be able to be snobby about authenticity.
because we all know that authenticity is what's really important. and
  in order for anything to be authentic, it must first be esoteric. i think what
should be done is that all the books about haiku, in particular lee
gurga's that keeps getting recommended, ought to be entrusted to secret
societies and all publicly available copies should be burnt. and then everyone
who thinks it's important that a haiku be "real" can join the secret societies,
and the rest of us can get on with writing short poems. i'll even
promise to never call a short poem of mine a haiku so long as the haiku-snobs
will promise to point out that it isn't really a haiku. then we can all
be at peace with one another in a sort of zen state of mutually acknowledged
dumbness.

A couple of years ago, on a dare, I composed a renga according, as
far as I understand them, to the orthodox rules, including the
seasonal references in their ordained places, etc. Except of course
that a renga is supposed to be a group effort. But there are enough
of me to go around.

RENGA

Summer? In Sumer
I'd expect it.
But here?

Waver of light rising
off the tarmac.

In such a state
anything,
tire tracks.

...and if I were a bird
I would fly away...

Harvest moon
through smoke
rising, enormous.

Filtered by leaves the light
stains your face.

Made love to
on the deep soft
purple duff.

Come out come out come all ye
wherever you are.

Easy to leave
Cheyenne
this morning.


A mountain somewhere
with something on it.

Having pissed, polar bear
is whiter
than snow.

Frozen, Moon River flows
through frozen fields.

Each day the bird
has learned
a different tune.

Repetition the wild card
in this game.

Who wrote who wrote who
wrote the
book of love?

Ask her: who wrote, wrought
what? "Which needs?" she says.

First there is
a mountain
with a white bear.

Fly away, build a nest
and shriek your heart out.

Only bees
can understand
the flowers.

One can refuse to be
reborn, maybe.

Ah, the opinion that every opinion is just as good as every other

I trust the writer understands that both Violi's haiku and Padgett's are

I think the writer is reacting to Bowering's and Schwabsky's lionizing
of Padgett's and Violi's poems, respectively, and not the poems
themeselves.

I agree with Vincent that morphing is necessary, but MDW makes a good
point, one that shouldn't have to be made. Know the history of the
poem, its implications and subtleties, and THEN subvert it.

Well, i think the real issue is one of investment and value. You're a person who has devoted a considerable amount of time and energy into a poetic
form, and as such that form has a value for you that it simply doesn't for me, as a person who generally is a little bit snide towards the idea of
form from the get go. I think where the disconnect takes place is that you're mistaking a lack of interest in the minutiae of something that you say
is complex (i'm not saying it's not complex, just that i don't know enough about it to be able to affirm or deny) for naivete, which is a little bit
insulting. I can maybe illustrate with my own experience writing haiku. Like most people at some point in the third or fourth grade, my language arts
teacher introduced the idea of syllables, as well as the idea of poems that don't possess end rhyme, by talking about these short little japanese
poems called haiku that have a 5-7-5 syllable pattern. I think for most people that's the beginning and end of the interest in the form. I know that
it has been largely for me. I've written all manner of poems in a 5-7-5 formula, and all manner of people have told me that that's not really haiku,
to which my only response can be, okay, so what? so what if they're not haiku? if i don't know what the real purpose of a haiku is, and what the real
goal is, and am in fact trying to achieve some other goal and mistakenly calling it haiku, i'm not being naive, i'm just using the wrong word. So i
stop calling it haiku, and we can go about our lives happily enough never discussing it again. However, there's something very peculiar about in
particular the haiku booster that really rubs me the wrong way. almost like some people take a sort of obscene pleasure in "correcting" the mistake of
the less informed. at some point it becaomes as trivial a matter as whether kirk or picard were a superior starship captain.

so what i'm saying is, i think what in your messages has gotten my back up a bit is the way it's expressed in such an accusatory and aloof manner, as
if haiku is the only way to write a short poem, and that if one is working at the length of haiku there can't possibly be a goal higher than in
realizing the conventions of haiku. being mainly an anti formalist and against the idea of poetic form that can't be expressed in a number of words
fewer than the form permits the poem, i'm skeptical of such claims from the outset. So it takes some convincing for me to buy in to the idea that
there really is something in this constructed form which genuinely warrants societies being dedicated to it, magazines devoted to it, and books
written exploring teh depth of it. But instead of convincing, all i seem to get from people like you who do think there is that kind of value in this
particular set of conventions is a sort of arrogant browbeating about how i don't know anything about the subject and that if i want to talk about it,
i really need to do my homework.

Well fine, i say, i hate homework so lets just not talk about it. Let teh haiku snob wallow in his penny-ante beat, and i'll roll my eyes and move on
to something that i think genuinely is of value.

If that makes sense, and I promise you i'm not trying to be adversarial, just trying to sort through the array of emotions and their instigations in
the thread about haiku to date that prompted me to dispatch a snarky email. If you really want my opinion, this last email has gone a longer way
towards getting me interested in haiku than your previous emails which seemed largely concerned with showing how some poems claiming to be haiku are
not in fact.

What i'd really like to see is for defenders of the form to make a concerted effort to talk about what it is that they like about it. What is it about
the seasonal words and juxtapositions that you find in haiku that make them so essential and raises this above other forms like, for example, an
aubade? I think maybe you'd get farther with snide jackasses like me if you focussed more on the positive argument for real haiku rather than the
negative argument against fake haiku. Because i generally don't find things that are defined primarily by contrast to things which they are not to be
particularly interesting. birds are cool because they have wings, not because they don't have gills, y'know?

All of that having been said, i want to let you know that I really appreciate the sincerity and tone of your last email, and I want you to know that
by it, you've aroused a curiosity in me about the form that did not exist when i snarkily suggest that haiku be relegated to mystery cults. There's
very little as effective as the sincere expression of passion for a topic to make another person sympathetic to investigating it. I've ordered Gurga's
book, and am looking forward to reading it. I don't know if i'll become a haiku fanatic, or even if i'll ever try to write a haiku, but you've swayed
me to thinking that maybe there's something i'm missing out on, and that's a tactic that is very effective with me.

> I don't think something has to be esoteric to be authentic. That's certainly the case for haiku (and here I note that the theme for the 2005 Haiku North America conference was "authenticity"!). In fact, if a haiku is too esoteric, it tends to *lose* authenticity for many people because they can't relate to it, or even stretch themselves to do so. Better, I think, to be esoteric (if you want) while also still being sufficiently authentic and accessible. Leaf through the pages of *Modern Haiku* magazine, or Cor van den Heuvel's *The Haiku Anthology*, and over and over you will find poems that strike a fine balance between the esoteric (alienating in the extreme) and the immediate (to easy and comfortable in the extreme). It's a balance between the universal and the particular, and a balance between the expression of the self and the effective communication of that self to someone else.

And then I hope you and anyone else who feels the same way can still take a look at the ISSUE itself to see whether you understand it fully or not. I guess I am wagging a finger here, aren't I? And I'm obviously in earnest. But there are problems that deserve to have fingers wagged at them. Indeed, tell me, what else are we who write literary haiku supposed to do? I don't want to be snobbish about haiku -- in fact, one of the virtues of haiku is how accessible it can be, in that it focuses on everyday subjects of personal immediacy (Issa wrote about the flies in his house, Buson about his dead wife's comb underfoot). Yet what should we do if we see haiku being so widely misunderstood, even just in the mainstream poetry community (never mind the general public)?

I discuss the issue of influences in haiku, and the range of possibilities in the genre, in particular regarding the anthology *Unswept Path*, from White Pine Press -- an excellent yet flawed book. In this review, I deride the notion of a secret handshake for haiku poets. A secret society or the ghettoization of haiku is not what I think is good for anybody, hence this discussion. These are tricky matters of education, and unfortunately it seems to need to begin with the implication that person A is educated, and person B is not. It need never be brought up, except that, in this case person B seems to be claiming, even if not overtly, to be "educated" about haiku, when in fact that's demonstrably not the case. I'm interested in deghettoizing haiku here, and that means, I think, some education for those outside the haik

But Dan, how would you *know* whether a *poet* knows "the history of
the poem, its implications" etc.? -- unless of course you feel you
can glean same from a reading of (e.g.) the poem itself?

Stephen Vincent makes the proper point, in any case, even against
MDW's reasoned argument in favor of such knowledge.

This is, after all, a list devoted to discussing "those directions in
poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and
investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of
received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible." (I quote from  the Poetics List Welcome Message.)

The question before us is a typical question, really, applicable to
haiku or to any rec'd form:  at what point is taking liberties deemed
acceptable, or unacceptable, and why?

There are surely histories of poetry, in the U.S. (e.g.), in the 20th
century (e.g.) -- a history of resistance to received forms -- to
suggest that some (of us) will be inclined to mess with rec'd forms,
with (or without) the possession of such knowledge. Whether the
results are successful, well -- they're not not successful simply b/c
they've deviated from the norm. If you think you can read a given
example and suss out whether the poet has *not* acted with sufficient
knowledge, very well then. But that's a mite tougher to do, and to
argue, than simply to compare and contrast with what the formal rules
might say such items ought to attempt. Pardon me, but simple
deviation from the norm does not (as I see it) an unsuccessful poem
make, haiku or otherwise, nor does it suggest a lack of associated
knowledge.

That said, I opt for as much knowledge of the formal rules as one has
a stomach for.

At any rate, I daresay it will require a much more sophisticated
approach to form generally to persuade most on this list not to mess
with rec'd form. Where I part company with MDW is in my assertion
that haiku are no different, finally, than sonnets (or any other
poetic form) insofar as the inherent legitimacy of altering
associated constraints. Again, how is one to *prove* that one has the
knowledge sufficient to being granted license (poetic license) to
alter form? Or, again, are we saying that all such knowledge will be
evident in the poetry itself? One way to almost guarantee that nobody
messes with form is to argue that a given poem must exhibit evidence
of such knowledge.

I hope you all see the conundrum at work here. So, I'd like someone
to explain to me -- seriously now -- why some of the haiku posted
here DON'T work when understood as "questioning of received forms and
styles" (see above). Or even better, how it is that some of the haiku
posted here, lionized or no, do *not* reveal sufficient knowledge of
haiku.

Unless the problem is simply one of naming -- i.e., that we ought not
to call a haiku that which merely resembles same -- then a judgment
is being made as to how best to approach this matter of poetic form,
and resistance thereto.  That's not pertinent simply to haiku -- that
strikes at the heart of what a list like this is supposed to be about.

Best,

Joe

I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but anyone who knows haiku will
tell you Violli's "poem" would never be seen as even a minimally passable
haiku--it's got way too much narrative--haiku is not a mini-story in 3
lines. sorry, but that's how it is.

you can still like that work as a 3 line poem if you like--but do you
really like it as a poem or do you think it's a terribly clever way to do
a bit of flash fiction in 3 lines.  Poetry leaves room for the reader's
imagination.

One good thing about poetry is that we have countless editors out there
with different taste so that someone who has no use for our work can be
quickly forgotten as we forge onward looking for the editor who
appreciates it.

I was no fan of Anna Nicole Smith. I could never really figure out what she
was famous *for* and saw her as more of the trend of people who are famous
for being famous (not unlike Paris Hilton).  But it seems that of late she
had turned very quickly into something of a tragic figure and her death has
made me rethink maybe how *long* she might have been a tragic figure without
many people really knowing or recognizing it.  So I do feel this sadness
about it without knowing really why and at the same time I feel that to find
out somehow perpetuates something about her and about our culture that I'm
not sure I want to participate in further.

Does that make any sense at all???

She always fascinated me. Like Michael Jackson she broke a lot of taboos,
she couldn't be placed. Her reality show was time slowed, almost milky.
Howard K. Stern talked Ivy League, she murmured. Her son was there. I
never knew what I was watching. I was constantly thrown off, in a way that
her son's death was thrown off, and her death, now, is thrown off.

She couldn't be placed: just as soon as you had it figured out, it
transformed. I did guess that she and Howard were lovers; it was an odd
subtext to the show. The photographs were sexy but meta-sexed; they didn't
register properly, there was always something else going on. On another
list people rave Anita Berber; there's a relationship.

So poetics? Yes because this doesn't fit, it fractures, it breaks the
discourse of the Law, however you want to define it. It's not only
semantics, it's syntax that's broken down, just as reporters couldn't get
"hold" of Michael Jackson.

Then again, her life and death say something about our notions of beauty,
a kind of inconceivable sexuality associated with it, the body can't keep
up. What's incarnate falls apart; it's always already fallen apart.

Finally, there are very real class (economic, geographic, educational)
issues here; like Tonya Harding, she couldn't keep up (I remember TH's
mother saying she couldn't raise an ice princess), or she kept up, on
her own track, in her own way, which is something few of us get to do.

This really was upsetting.

Our culture is perpetuated in any case, of course; what's important is
what one does in relation to it; at best perhaps, one can take a critical
and/or empathetic stand. I've heard the 'famous for being famous' in
relation to a number of people, and I think in a way it begs the question.
How can one open this short-circuit? For me, it's related to causation;
one always looks for cause and effect - we're brought up to believe this.
But causality is problematic, and the questions that Anna Nicole Smith
raises may literally be unanswerable, and at the same time 'eternally'
vulnerable (or susceptible) to theory - the descriptions, analyses, go on
and on, just as Tonya Harding appeared in scholarly works as well as
innumerable pop venues.

One element of interest is that such analyses can be applied anywhere,
anywhen; from Anna Nicole Smith to far more 'important' matters such as
world conflicts, issues of fundamentalism, etc., (for me) to realize just
how fragile causality (and its accompanying enunciation of specific
effect/affect) is. In other words, I think it's fine not to have answers,
ethical structures, etc., in one's life.

I hope this makes sense - it's late at night. I do want to add that if you
watched the reality show, the tragedy came through rather starkly; there
were times literally couldn't watch.

Finally, I really don't know what she's perpetuating (or was used to
perpetuate); there are many other models for exaggerated sexuality for
example.

Subject:      Real-time file access and organization - suggestions?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Real-time file access and organization -

Here is the problem, as anyone following my work can attest - there's too
much of it. I'll be at the Openport festival in Chicago the end of the
month, doing a symposium, talk, two performances. So I'm attempting to
organize files for the last, and it's difficult. I narrowed the video/
audio work to 900 files - and these are edited from the mass of my video/
audio work in general, running I think around 2500. I've placed the files
in two folders, Performance 1 / 2. The names (titles) of the files convey
nothing. I'm still naming from the film years when one produced "pieces"
with such. So there are 900 names, and I forget what most of these things
are. It's not even easy to tell by extension - there are sound files for
example ending as .mp4, and some of the .mov are set for no framework and
loop; these are most often converted .mp4 in disguise. The problem with
.mp4 in performance - the compression uses a lot of CPU cycles; the result
is that it's actually more difficult to run a number of parallel .mp4
files (which are quite small) than to run the same from the original very
large .mov or .avi files.

Thumbnails won't do - they would be too difficult to manage, would clutter
up the screen, wouldn't handle audio. I think of code - G for Geneva, D
for dance, GG for Gruyere, GA for Aletsch glacier work - but then the
individual pieces are still left behind. I've tried brief 2-3 word
descriptions in the titles, but that doesn't seem to help; there are
variations, some of the work is indescribable in terms of a few words, and
so forth. In any case, the directories have to be on the screen when I'm
performing - that's the whole point of it - the ability to choose video/
audio on the fly. I'm not sure where to take this - memorizing indices,
mnemonics ... The total number of still images that I work with (i.e. not
family) is about 10000. The total of everything is probably around 14000.

I swim in these. I need a directory structure for everything, coupled with
a search engine; I need keywords and a way to delimit and present files
during performance; I need a system which is easily understandable on the
fly. I'm speaking of approximately 200 gigabytes of material here. I've
been sitting going through file after file; it's a real impossibility! If
the equipment holds up (I've been having difficulties with Quicktime
retaining its preferences which are critical), things should run smoothly
- they'll be more out of control than ever, the semantics of the perform-
ance trying to keep up. But the presentation will, internally, be somewhat
scattershot. I work with laser scan, motion capture, dancers, mappings and
remappings of the human body, landscape, very low frequency and shortwave
radio, filtered and unfiltered recordings of various musical instruments,
images from the problematic of 'wilderness,' video and audio bounced and
transformed across the country, material from Second Life performance,
materials from programs like Netstumbler (tracking wireless), modified
travel footage, local histories and architectures of early mass transit,
sexuality, the 'edges' of languages, choreographies, interactivities,
codework and codework software, Mathematica, and video/audio noise across
the Net, offline as well. All of these areas are subsetted; they spread
like tentacles across my workspace, (in)(co)herent, lost and found; now
when I perform, I'm part audience, seeing the (re)presentation for the
first time, trying more desperately than ever to hold everything together.
This is a world of the forgotten, unorganized in relation to 'the clean
and proper body,' inert to deconstruction (which is collapsed by error,
circles of confusion, exhaustion, loss), open to Levinas' existence and
existents. Never do I know where this has gone, will go. But I still need
something of a system, something of a path through the dark woods. (And of
course any suggestions greatly appreciated.)

At least in the case of Paul's poem, I don't think that's true at all. It is quite funny, but not satirical. For me, it is profound expression of the human condition, if you don't mind me putting it like that. (I know that sounds a bit old-fashioned.) Also, contrary to what someone else said, I don't see any real narrative in it. It conjures an image with which one is familiar from narratives (movies, tv) about bank robberies, but nothing is narrated, there is no before or after, no chain of events: just a moment in which one is suddenly faced with something.

  Regarding Ron's poem, with which I was previously unfamiliar, I also doubt that the intention behind it is mainly satirical. It's pretty dry for that, after all. It seems more to be about pure formalism and its paradoxes, in a manner reminiscent of certain early '70s conceptual art, such as some of Dan Graham's text works. But as I said, this is just a first impression as far as Ron's poem goes.

  Finally, I have to say to the person who used the childish gesture of putting scare quotes around the word "poem" when writing about these efforts--whether one find them successful or not is another thing: the reactionary attitude this betrays is its own counterargument.

Alan,

I do think it makes sense. (Perhaps the assumption that the original
comments were derisive is because they seemed to come so quickly out of the
gate- at least I think that's why I jerked to that kind of reading).


"One element of interest is that such analyses can be applied anywhere,
anywhen; from Anna Nicole Smith to far more 'important' matters such as
world conflicts, issues of fundamentalism, etc., (for me) to realize just
how fragile causality (and its accompanying enunciation of specific
effect/affect) is. In other words, I think it's fine not to have answers,
ethical structures, etc., in one's life."

I am not at all sure that this is where you were going, but I wonder if
social ethical structures are descriptive and not determining structures-
the way zoologists classify animals. What do you do with the platypus?

Now, that probably makes no sense.

I heard an interview with Edward Albee regarding the revival of Who's
Afraid. . . he said, "there comes a point when a play is famous for being
famous".

And I don't think it's a new phenomenon.

I think Joe's point is well taken. While this discussion has been very instructive in many ways, we should not forget that this is list whose topic is innovative poetics. I'm sure there are other lists available for the promulgation of traditionalist poetics, and some of the same people might even be on both lists, since there is no reason not to be interested in both. But to the extent that we are not, at some point we just have to respectfully agree to disagree, letting the discussions of traditionalist poetics continue in whatever space is devoted to that and the discussions of innovative poetics, whatever that turns out to be, move forward in this one.

  As for myself, I think that a good deal of that heat that's been generated here hasto do with the "ownership" of the name "haiku." Although it would be useful to me to have recourse to this name at certain times, it doesn't really mean as much to me as it obviously does to some others, and therefore I'd just as soon cede it to them. I don't know why, but somehow this all reminds me of the dispute between Greece and one of the former Yugoslav republics over the name "Macedonia." United Nations intervention has still not resolved this issue. But when I lived in Italy, "macedonia" (small m) was the word for "fruit salad"--an association with very positive connotations as far as I'm concerned. So from now on I am going to avoid the use of the h-word to refer to any poem using a 5-7-5 structure or any other similar short poem whatsoever, except where this is unavoidable, such as when citing something that someone else said. From now on, I promise to refer to all such poems as
 "macedonia."




This is, after all, a list devoted to discussing "those directions in
poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and
investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of
received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible." (I quote from the Poetics List Welcome Message.)

Alex,
I am frequently struck by a psychological melee, I think it a wonderful =
feeling and a lot of my best writing is in fact a result of it; I've had =
prostate cancer as well, but have good relations with my students and =
women. I learned quite recently that Duchamp had prostate problems =
relatively early. Intentional phallacies aside, I don't think these =
matters are talked about enough and I suspect that many male artists =
have suffered from prostate, and erectile disfunction, and that the =
notions of 'late style' may have to be revised in the light of this.=20

An anecdote:

In a class on cross cultural criticism, discussing
some of Picasso's later work. A student begins by
stating the images studied are an example of the
objectification of women, that such images of a woman
exposed with legs drawn can only be constructed by
another woman and indicates, which is more interesting
to me, that Picasso's work is bad - malicious, even. I
understand that these are tools for examining culture,
etc - and it's all old for me - but for me what was
more interesting was what it indicated about the
author, Picasso, who in later years was stricken by a
kind of psychological melee related to his declining
health and prostate cancer. What do you think? And
back-channel if deemed safer.
Certainly there is no universality of thought with
regards to these issues of representation, but I'm
trying to gage where some of us are.

Causality will be as fragile or robust as proximity allows. 'Our' =
culture is
for me 'your' culture, and all the posts on this subject have proceeded
from 'you', her 'fellow Americans.'  You are  seemingly (at your best)=20

Our culture is perpetuated in any case, of course; what's important is
what one does in relation to it; at best perhaps, one can take a =
critical
and/or empathetic stand. I've heard the 'famous for being famous' in
relation to a number of people, and I think in a way it begs the =
question.
How can one open this short-circuit? For me, it's related to causation;
one always looks for cause and effect - we're brought up to believe =
this.
But causality is problematic, and the questions that Anna Nicole Smith
raises may literally be unanswerable, and at the same time 'eternally'
vulnerable (or susceptible) to theory - the descriptions, analyses, go =
on
and on, just as Tonya Harding appeared in scholarly works as well as
innumerable pop venues.

One element of interest is that such analyses can be applied anywhere,
anywhen; from Anna Nicole Smith to far more 'important' matters such as
world conflicts, issues of fundamentalism, etc., (for me) to realize =
just
how fragile causality (and its accompanying enunciation of specific
effect/affect) is. In other words, I think it's fine not to have =
answers,
ethical structures, etc., in one's life.

I hope this makes sense - it's late at night. I do want to add that if =
you
watched the reality show, the tragedy came through rather starkly; there
were times literally couldn't watch.

Finally, I really don't know what she's perpetuating (or was used to
perpetuate); there are many other models for exaggerated sexuality for
example.

Please.

I have never seen the reality series, because it isn't on the free stations
in my country. But unless you are living on the moon, your culture is most
certainly touched by American mass media. 60 minutes is popular in Iraq.
Afghan children know who Brittany Spears is. ANS was all over billboards in
Scandinavia a few years ago- as model for H&M.

If you even know who Anne Nicole Smith is, yet claim a kind of superior
distance to American pop culture (am I interpreting you correctly?)- this
strikes me as absurd and self-deceiving.

One would hope that your comment simply means you believe we Americans are
more inclined to explore the cultural context of an individual tragedy
rather than believing that somehow we Americans uniquely identify with the
kind of celebrity foibles and worse.

Causality will be as fragile or robust as proximity allows. 'Our' culture is
for me 'your' culture, and all the posts on this subject have proceeded
from 'you', her 'fellow Americans.'  You are  seemingly (at your best)

Our culture is perpetuated in any case, of course; what's important is
what one does in relation to it; at best perhaps, one can take a critical
and/or empathetic stand. I've heard the 'famous for being famous' in
relation to a number of people, and I think in a way it begs the question.
How can one open this short-circuit? For me, it's related to causation;
one always looks for cause and effect - we're brought up to believe this.
But causality is problematic, and the questions that Anna Nicole Smith
raises may literally be unanswerable, and at the same time 'eternally'
vulnerable (or susceptible) to theory - the descriptions, analyses, go on
and on, just as Tonya Harding appeared in scholarly works as well as
innumerable pop venues.

One element of interest is that such analyses can be applied anywhere,
anywhen; from Anna Nicole Smith to far more 'important' matters such as
world conflicts, issues of fundamentalism, etc., (for me) to realize just
how fragile causality (and its accompanying enunciation of specific
effect/affect) is. In other words, I think it's fine not to have answers,
ethical structures, etc., in one's life.

I hope this makes sense - it's late at night. I do want to add that if you
watched the reality show, the tragedy came through rather starkly; there
were times literally couldn't watch.

Finally, I really don't know what she's perpetuating (or was used to
perpetuate); there are many other models for exaggerated sexuality for
example.

Ren, I think, perhaps presumptively, that Wystan is reacting to that
inclusive "our" rather than placing himself above mass culture. Being
touched or even colonised by a culture does not, after all, make it
one's own. American culture is, for me as well, "your" culture. Of
course this doesn't mean at all that exchange isn't possible, but on
the whole it's preferable if it's mutual exchange, rather than all one
way. And people do get tired of having their differences expunged,
even if it's well meaning.

All best

Alison,



It wouldn't surprise me if I am the one being presumptive. I have been
lately. I apologize.



I do also have an overdeveloped defence response to stereotypes regarding
the tabloid mentality associated with Americans.



A lot of things assumed to be Americanization are actually not. Like reality
television.



Seeing that this listserv is Buffalo.edu, it seems to me unnecessary for
anyone posting "our" to be compelled to preface it with "as Americans".

So, reading a posting which objects to this, which expresses a dissociation
from ANS based on national cultural identity. . . I do (perhaps mistakenly)
draw a conclusion regarding the person's motivation to do so.



And now I'm going to keep my fingers still and go back to reading what
everyone has to say about poetry.



Apologies again,



Ren

All,
All this Anna Nicole Smith talk is fine by me one way
or the other, but shouldn't we be talking about Frank
Sherlock, who's apparently very ill? Seems like the
time for talking about dear fellow-poets, rather than
celebrities.
Cheers to Aaron for his caring, though, and others,
still.
Amicalement,
Alex

To borrow a word someone used in an offline message regarding my
statement, I will defer to your rebuttal, Joe. I didn't mean to speak
in absolutes, nor to imply that anyone except the poet should have to
be aware of their knowledge of form, history, etc. Speaking only of
the haiku form, it seems to have gotten a particularly bad,
trivializing, rap. There are so many haikus out there that are
atrocious, and rather than see the atrociousness of the poem as a
singular (repeated many times over) occurrence, the form itself gets
triviailized, Hallmarkized.

To all, I'm sorry if my statement was at odds with the guiding
principles of the Poetics list. I should have thought it through
further before posting. I certainly am not one to prescribe any
quantified amount of poetic knowledge, or proscribe any
experimentation or subversion of form. But I always hope it will be
done thoughtfully, and with purpose.

Dan, you didn't say nuthin wrong!

And atrocious poetry of any stripe ought to be called out for what it is.

In all, it seems to me that it's beneficial to examine publicly what
the commitment to form (or formalism) might be on a list such as this
one, and we can expect, and should tolerate, a range of responses to
same.

At any rate, I certainly feel I've learned from this exchange.

Best,

Joe

As I understand it, Japanese is not accented the way English or Latin  is.
Thus each "syllable" of a multisyllable word is generally  pronounced evenly
in
Japanese. The Japanese word for a species of  cuckoo, hototogisu, has  each
syllable pronounced evenly,  which  is part of its music. As a more  common
example, the word for cherry  blossom, sakura, has each of  its syllables at
about
the same pitch and  length. It's *not* sa-KU-ra. Nor is it  SA-ku-ra (like
the
beginning of  "saccharine"). And of course it's also not  "sa-ku-RA." On the
other  hand, some Japanese people drop or greatly minimize the  last syllable
in
some words when speaking (even though they would still count  that  sound in
haiku). Thus I've often heard a Japanese person speak of  "haik"  (with an
extremely subtle "u" after the "k") when they mean  "haiku" -- or they  might
say
"hototogeese" (though with a very quick  "geese") and barely say  the "oo"
sound
that normally follows in  "hototogisu." If you ask the question  "Desu ka,"
it
typically sounds  like "Des-ka." Otherwise, though, I think  the sounds are
fairly
even.  I know other words and phrases are commonly  shortened or combined,
but
that's more of a colloquial compression of language  than a variance in
pronunciation.

Not sure what you're after when you ask for "an  example of how a haiku
*should* read."

Again, "Haiku" doesn't need to be treated with a capital. It's not a proper
noun.

If I'm static and humourless, well, shucks, I'll try to let my hair down  for
you when I can. If I seem static, that's because I'm advocating for a
position out of years of study, and positing that against some serious
misunderstandings. What you say of Violi's poems is all true, but true of the  poem as a
POEM, not as a haiku. Yup, that's "static" -- or "rigid," you might  say. Look,
a rose is not a chrysanthemum. That's all I'm trying to say. Why  assert that
the poem is a haiku, when it clearly lacks understanding of haiku's  history,
aesthetics, and various other understandings? Why persist with what I  might
guess is a misunderstanding of the genre, indicated, among other things,  by
something as simple as treating the name of the genre as a proper noun when  it
isn't? I hesitate to say there's some arrogant ignorance going on here, but
there does seem to be some resistance to the serious research that Charlie and
I  have encouraged. Sure, the poem is haiku-like, if you want to say that.
But  that's an important distinction from claiming it as a haiku, and a far cry
from  claiming it to be about the best haiku ever.

I'm a lot less static as you might think, except that from your perspective
it may look that way. But over the years, as I've learned different things
about  haiku (and still have much to learn), I've definitely evolved and changed
my  ideas on things. I used to think of haiku as a Zen art (a long time ago).
I know  better now. I used to think haiku was a nature poem. Well, actually,
it's a  *seasonal* reference that haiku is generally after, and nature just
comes along  for the ride (though of course it's true, therefore, that it IS
mostly a nature  poem, but not always). And I could list a few more changed
understandings. But  because the location of where my perspective is evolving is
down the track from  where it seems you are, the distance between our
perspectives probably makes my  stance seem static. The movement of my train seems so
slight to you because I'm  probably at a different place on the haiku track from
where you are, and the  distance between us flatens your ability to detect my
movement. I assure  you my stance is not static, because even your claiming
that I'm static  encourages me to re-examine my perspectives to see if that's
true, and to try to  be responsive to that thought.

Believe me, I find it really boring and imitative to write the "branches,
leaves, blossoms and bird" forms of haiku. I'm not advocxzating that at all
(perhaps you thought I was?!?). No, I'm advocating a deeper understanding of
haiku as a subset of "poetry," which thereby distinguishes Violi's poem from
haiku. Most of the time, such a distinction wouldn't matter (how's that for  a
bit of not being static?), except for the fact that you claimed the poem as
haiku -- and not just haiku, but a really darn good one. Not only is it not a
darn good one, but it's not even a haiku at all. At most, it's hit just one of
the many targets for haiku (brevity), but that single overlap with haiku
should  not be confused with it's being haiku, which necessitates hitting quite a
few  more haiku targets than that. It's a great little poem, but I see
startling and  fresh little poems like that all the time in the best haiku journals
(and some  of "branches, leaves, blossoms and bird" poems -- and they can still
have their  appeal to some folks, or have mild variations that can make them
succeed). You  try writing a cherry blossom haiku -- it's very hard to do with
originality and  freshness.

I appreciate that you're seeing my advocation for a formally true haiku,  yet
seeing that I don't mean a 5-7-5 formalism (I hope). If my perspective is
claustrophobic to you (or others), I suppose that may be true. But believe me, I
 appreciate all sorts of short poems for what they are, without needing to
apply  a label to them (as with Violi's poem). My feeling is that you can't
fling  poetry labels around willy-nilly based on a limited understanding of the
label.  Doing so without sufficient understanding of the history and aesthetics
of  haiku, for example, dilutes the notion of what haiku is. If poets try to
speak  carefully, you'd think they'd speak not only with care in their words,
but with  a responsibility towards the words that takes ownership for
understanding their  meaning. In the case of haiku, there's a serious disconnect
between popular  perceptions and reality. In Japan, at your assertion that Violi's
poem is a  haiku, they would do one of two things: immediately and politely
agree with you  to your face (perhaps like saying to a child, yes dear, the sun
is purple --  what a lovely drawing), or they would dismiss it without a
thought.

I can hear you saying that there can be purple suns in haiku. I'm all for
creativity and poetic license -- believe it or not. But only when it comes from
a position of understanding, not ignorance, about haiku and its history and
aesthetics. Basho said to learn the rules and then forget them (meaning, to
internalize them so thoroughly that you no longer have to think about them). In
 your case, meaning to be as polite as I say this, it seems you haven't
learned  the rules yet.

Consider the following throughts on mastery and understanding, thoughts  that
probably apply to any literature, or any art or craft. I think most people
progress through the following steps with their art, including poetry:


1. Unconscious incompetence (the person doesn't know that he isn't  competent
or doesn't understand).
2. Conscious incompetence (the person realizes that he isn't competent --
the door is now open to learning).
3. Conscious competence (the person has to consciously work at being
competent -- it doesn't yet come naturally).
4. Unconscious competence (the person has internalized effective techniques
so well that he no longer has to think about it, the way a quarterback doesn't
 have to think about how to throw a good spiral -- this is what I think Basho
 meant by "learn the rules and then forget them").


Since you urge morphing, why is it you resist morphing your understanding  of
haiku? The question here isn't adherence to any kind of orthodox behaviour,
but that too many people proceed with behaviour they think is orthodox
(thinking  they know what a haiku is) when it isn't. See the difference?

As for being humourless, well, I've always known I can't tell a joke to  save
the queen. I am in earnest, obviously. But you won't find me as inflexible
as you seem to think.

Good wishes,

Michael

Maybe  with my good Protestant origins, I have never been at home with
adherence  to any kind of orthodox system of behavior, but I find your
insistences  about Haiku (origins and form) static and humorless.
Occasionally I work  among elderly Chinese emigrants here in San Francisco,
and indeed, for  example, in making watercolors, many of them continue to
adhere  unwaveringly to 'branches, leaves, blossoms and bird' forms -
sometimes  attractive but boring, boring, rigid, etc. At best you want to
tear up the  pages and introduce students to the fresh experience of montage,
collage,  etc.
Such as with Violi's haiku - the juxtaposition of what he has done  against
conventional content is startling, refreshing - a response that I  find with
what I can only sense to be  'good' translations of  'ancient' haiku. Much of
which I suspect Paul Violi and many of us have  been variably interested
readers - whether via Pound, Rexroth, Waley &  on.

Your argument for a formally true Haiku, seems as claustrophobic to  me as
someone who might argue - with similar orthodox leanings - that  Coltrane,
Rollins, etc., etc. are not making authentic  "ballads".   Morph, my friend,
morph - it is, from my experience,  at least, a mutable, non-static universe
of which the contemporary spirit  and practice of haiku is inextricably
involved.

Barry,

Actually, both Paul's and Ron's poems reflect their sensibilities and styles
as poets: Paul's up your face clarity, Ron's understating, ant-heroic ethos,
for instance, a wonderful poem about how to sweep the floor. They are Paul
and Ron poems before they are haiku. In English, Haiku does imply brevity, a
certain sudden cut in point of view, which can be ironic or in rare
successful cases metaphysical. Does any one rememberthe wonderful haiku in
the movie Miami Blues where the Alec Baldwin character is robbing a house
(breaking and entering...)?

Ciao,

Re the impact of haiku & ways of perception shaped by Buddhist and other
Asian (Indian) religious forms of meditation and literature on the making of
modernism (Pound, etc.)  I strongly recommend Eliot Weinberger's essay on
Vorticism in a recent Chicago Review (#5?? - the also good Lisa Robertson
issue) - the introduction of Yoga and Yogis at the Columbia Exposition in
1892 in Chicago and the subsequent publishing craze and influence, etc., I
find real interesting. A must read.

Which is also to say that David B-C's recent post about the relationship of
Haiku to a manner of perceiving (regardless of arguments with the haiku
formalists here) is an important contribution  -  a contemporary one that
bears a strong relationship to the work of Kyger, Eigner, Whalen, Snyder,
Welch and Grenier among many, many others.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Thank you so much for your letter Anny Ballardini!
Anna Nicole Smith is non-stop on cable news--and here at buffalo list,
too--(though is the discussion here "innovative" and "questioning recieved
forms and styles" and so actually superior to the tablod and news
reporting?--the analysis by alan sondheim for example is given within abt
first ten seconds by the tabloids, and then contually surpassed in as Anny
writes, "talk talk talk talk"--

actually very much the talk talk talk and barrage of images interviews
quotes--is the creation via Tragedy, of a Saint--being elevated into the
Heavens of the Spectacle--the allusions which media makes and Anna Nicole
continaully made to Mailyn --link her immediately to that Sainted image and
sacrifical Tragedy--yet there are also many background murmruings of the
ever onging Sanctification of Princess Di--and lost in the depths Jayne
Mansfield as well, though she is a Lesser Saint than Marilyn and Di and Anna
Nicole--(whose name also conjures resomating imagery of the tragic tall
blonde Nicole Simpson Brown--)--

the Tragedy of the lowly  little girl's frairy tale princess' dream and
attainment of real Princess fame and fortune via beauty and wealthy,
powerful men--(Jayne Mansfield married literally a "Strong Man"--famous body
builder--and Jayne, like Anne Boleyn--decapitated though not by any King's
decree other than those of the  women who are the Fates)--and treacheries
along the way of those who don't want to allow the princess to become a
Queen--so that they die tragically, experience martyrdoms--and become
beloved above all among "the people"--their loyal subjects as it were--and
then transformed into Saints for the Adoration--
talk tlak tlak tlak and images images images--with scandal always
attendent--mysteries of fathers, of children, courts of law--social barriers
transgressed--the manipulation by media and media manipulation by "star"--it
is an endless pagentry and each new princess/Saint contributes her own
unique variations on the theme, on the relics, on the forms of Adoration and
memorialization--each contributes to the enhancement of the others--for the
glory of the firmaments where the Stars are existing in Eternal Light--
for secular fallen worlds, a new form of religion/opiate of the masses--and
for the masters and mistreeses in charge, more pagentry, bread and circuses
to keep "the people" from wanting to pay attention to the Bad news which is
being jettisoned in all the pomp and glory, all the mysteries of fatherhood,
of legal ranglings over Gold--posseions--and the mysterious
deaths--natural/suicidal/murder by conspiracy--the triumph of the female
Saint over the male desire to dominate and condemn and destroy them--the
lovers who along the way adored or betrayed-Saint Joan and her
Inquistors--burning at the stake and like Artaud's victim, signalling
through the flames--before the Ascension--
so many powerful forces unleashed in the tabloid world's energies--
in the drug store the other night going from magazine cover to magaine
cover, tabloid sheet to tabloid sheet cover--a whole procession of images of
the Saints and martyrs among the Stars--their sufferings, weight, child,
man, money, career dramas rising and falling in the melodramtic rhythms of a
word/music/image ritualized ceremonial Stations of the Cross in a serial
form--not just the imagery, but the use of words, their typogrpahies in the
immense visual/sound serial feuillton poem/drama--
and who is still with one--stil going strong--LIZ!!!--since childhood LIZ
has been there--ruling the living heavens--a kind of Patron Saint of the
Tabloids--endlessly dy8ing almost and being reborn--endless finding husbands
and lovers--and moving on to another one--so as never to be dull or boring
by having tthe same againg companion--for her eteranl youth--Madonna has
made a career out of running her own tabloids to go laong withthose that
surround her--Demi--Katie--Barbara Mandrell (back with her stolen tour bus
in the front page news--on cable----straight out of country
song--)--Hillary--(lately joining the ones who seem destinied for their
stops in rehab--according to some of the Tabloid
iconogrpahy--)--Halle--Venus--Whitney--Oprah--Visitations by Mary, Our Lady
of Guadalupe, Serena, Shakira--a long gallery of icons one passes by in the
altar area of the cash register-alongside the little boxes for donations to
various organizations for children's diseases--
and now Anna Nicole will for a while be the one whose Adoration will burn
with the finest flame--for some months to come-- as she becomes a permanent
part of the Spectacle of Stardom Sainthood--her Ascension attained--into
that Eternal Company

The Tabloids are really the Living Presence of ancient energies which
negentropically regenerate--rther than run down--and continually gather more
Saints, more intensity with each new form of media--icons of the Goddesses
since times immemorial--Cleopatra--Helen of Troy--

in one of his autobriographical novels Blaise Cendrars writes of the forms
of Tabloids and feuilleton photo-novels he finds in the farthest reaches of
Brazil--and writes of how these--with the Stars, the monsters (aliens, Big
Foot, etc--), the horoscopes and predictions of Nostradums, Book of
revelations--how al these anceint "interprepations of dreams", love potions,
methods of Better Health and Beauty--al of it, the belief in the stars of
the Screen and of the Horoscopes--are al truly signs of the ancient world
which have never been expunged for all the "progress" in history--but have
only  made uses of progress and progress made uses of them--to burn ever
brighter, be ever more proliferating, ever more Glora in Excelsus --

re the discussion of haiku--
Joe--(message below)--
there is something rather paradoxically humorous about invoking the Words of
the Welcome Message--
a number of writers have presented themselves as poets who are
anti-the-rules and anti-the -forms  --by inclination and style--of form in
their own senses of form--renovators and innovators--in both the Spirit and
Letter of the Law--of the List--
which actually if you think of it is a bit oxymoronic--
that is--the Rules of the List demand innovation, renovation, investigation
questioning, creation possibly of the unimagined, untried, unexpected,
impossible, improbale--

the Rules of the lLst--now arent some of the same people who invoke all
sorts of rule breaking--the ones who are insisting on referrring back to the
Rules?!--
i can't help it, i find this very funny--

for if one were a rule breaker in such Rules' context--wouldn't a way of
breaking these rules be to consider seriously the rules of a form "untried,
unimagined" by oneself??--let alone by the type of innovative poetry that is
intended by the Rules--
(when there are rules re innovation, let alone renovation, investigation,
--one knows implicity that this means only certain kinds of innovation will
be recognized--leading to domination, denomination, demonization and many
other forms of debilitation)--

if one is so opposed to rules, forms and classifications--why then quote a
set of rules, and use said rules to as it were silence the claims of other
forms of rules--?--

i mean if one is truly a rule breaker--wouldn't one also just chuck these
rules, too?--
and listen to other rules of form,  other forms of rules--rather simply One
Form of Rlues, The Rule of One Form?--One Form Rules? (i .e. the
"innovative, rneovative, investigative" one--yet--innovative, renovative,
investigative--according to Whom--in the words of M. Foucault--to invoke a
Voice of Authority so as to be a good Rule follower for the nonce as it
were--, "Who Speaks?"--through the Message and Rules--whose innovation is
one engaging with?--
what if one truly engaged in innovations which were of some other sort
entirely?--truly being a rule breaker breaking rules?

or is there fear of such "chaos" being introdced into the system, or fear of
other rules than that of the Message--

why is it one cites these rules in order to turn a deaf ear as it were to a
set of rules existing in an other form of poetry?
does not the kind of innovation being asked for here consist of its own sets
of rules?

you see, if someone  sends the Message to question, to investigate--Rules,
Forms, Authorities--
does this not also entail a questioning of the authority, of the
Rules--which are making this Call?--becuase one must, truly, if being
embarked on quesdtoning, question who it is that is asking for
investigations, innovations, questionings--
other swise one is still truly a follower of the Law, in spirit and
letter--and not an independent questioner, but one doing so at the behest of
others, for purposes which must be indeed perhaps for their benefit?

i am writing this both very humourously and very seriously--

remember the period  of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" in China?--
a brillaint bit of work by Chairman Mao and company--
a Welcome Message as it were was sent out to al the people of China--
"Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom"--a new openness!
everyone was encourgaed to come forward with their questionings, suggestions
for innovations and renovations and investigations--for al voices to be
rasied in order to have a great conversation, a great exchange openly of
ideas--on how to renovate and innovative and redecorate and investigate the
way things were being run by the sytem, by the great Chairman Welcomer Mao
himself--each person who brought forward something of use for improving the
existing sytem would be a great contributor to the cause, to the nation--

the excietment and joy with which this edict was met was incredible--people
came forward with literally millions of suggestions, new ideas, things
learned on how to improve this and that glitch--
and once they had al come out in the open, O Hundred Blooming Flowers-
whack whack whack!!!
off with their heads!!
and a Hundred Flowers Doomed--

this is a true story, the life and death parable, which i always think of
when i hear that there are rules for innovations--
because--look what happens--a person writing of an other form of poetry and
trying to make clear its form, and advocate for a study of its history,
examples, in order to understand it and to attempt a beginning of its
practice--
is told--basically to stuff it--becuase the rule here is we don't have any
uses for rules--
("other than our own")--
so isn't one advocating that as  the Rules say there are no other rules to
be bothered about--than the Rule here--
isn't one becoming a kind of cop or soldier in the service of the Rule of
the Rules--and so--ready and willing to chop off the heads of anything with
other rules, and --one feels it is implied--with innovations which aren'
t in the spirit of the kind of innovations being asked  for by the Rules and
its followers citiing them?

do you see why i find this both very humourous and also a serious question?

to really be questioning and investigating--one needs to be open to
lsiten--to a great many forms and their sets of rules, to have an interest
in learning and understandig what is different--just as one needs to
question and investigate also what it means to be a rule breaker and yet a
follower of Rules--how this might affect one's ability to have a questionng
which leads to understanding--
rather than a questioning which leads to silencing, ridicule or willful
ignorance and arrogance--

Yeats wrote that poetry comes from the struggle with oneself, rhetoric and
politics of the argument with others--

the questioning and invetsigation--one needs to begin with oneself--am i
really a rule breaker?--do i really believe in sometimes following the rules
and sometimes not--and what helps me make these decisisons?--why do i reject
the rules of form--yet advocate strongly the Rules of a list telling me to
question them?-- do i question another's  authority because it was one i am
not familiar or interested in one? do i question the authority by which i
claim authority to question the rules followed by others?
if i am questionng the authority of others to set certain rules and abide by
them--
why then do i not question myself for followng certain rules and abiding by
them?
is my authority to question others rules and authorities higher than their
power to believe in them abide by them and create by them?
and is my authority to question only based on a belief in the authority
which allows me this form of questioning? what proofs do i have to make me
believe my authority of rules is higher than that of others and their
follwing theirs while i follow mine? am i nothing more than a blindly
obediant follower of Rules when i say that others are?

"some things are so serious that all one can do is laugh"--werner
heisenberg--he of the Uncertainty Principle--

as the song says

still i wonder
still i wonder
who'll stop the rain

or as the old saying goes:
"remember the first time you were ripped off by a head?"
"question authority"--means al authorities--including the one telling you to
question other's authority
it means questining one's own authority

so once i send this i am going to question my authority  in sending this

which isn't authority at all--other than experience in many coiuntries and
situations--of many auhtorites of al forms --controlling one's existence or
trying to convince one of one's freedoms--
auhtorites and rules exist--even when asking one to ask questions--
for purposes of their own

just as charity is said to begin at home, so questioning is best begun at
home--in oneself--and with the rules one is following on someone's authority
in order to questions rules--
(i.e.--don't listen to me either!!)(remember the wise Russian Proverb
President Reagan used to love to endlessly repeat and mispronounce?--"Trust,
but Verify"!!!)
you see--there are no free rides at the carnival--
if you think that there are--
then perhaps you have listened to a cunning old carnie con--
in the guise of something looking like a Benevolent Authority
for all you may know--
without question and investigating=-
and truly --remeber tohave some good laughs at all one finds in the funhouse
mirror distortions within and without oneself-!!!
in the sense of affectionate community-
(and as the creator at one time of a series of zollage (xeroxed collage)
zines called "NO ACCIDENT: The Journal of Extra-Sensory Paranoia")

David, yes, of course, to all that! There are=20
"rules" (having to do with poetry, for some) and=20
"rules" (in this case, having to do with context,=20
for anyone subbed to this list). I was=20
reproducing the context "rules" not to enforce=20
them, but to give some idea of why some people=20
around here might resist the notion that the=20
"rules" (having to do with poetry) are to be=20
rather scrupulously adhered to.

=46or me, then, the "rules" of context explain in=20
part the dynamics of the list. I sense some=20
dismay hereabouts on the part of some that others=20
might not wish to follow the "rules" of poetry.=20
Well, but have a look at what this list is=20
presumed to be about.

That said, I for one enjoy hearing about, and=20
being educated in, formalities, formalisms incl.=20
But this doesn't mean that I'm inclined to forgo=20
my own creative impulses, which -- if I do say so=20
-- have generally been at least somewhat informed=20
by the "rules." So perhaps the approach ought to=20
be more like, "I'm not sure you're prepared to=20
accept these rules [of haiku], but here they are,=20
and please know that some regard same with=20
considerable gravity." That would at least=20
acknowledge the legitimacy of others who conduct=20
their poetic practice w/o deference to such=20
"rules."

Anyway, there's a paradox at work here,=20
certainly. On my office door is taped a little=20
cartoon that depicts two guys, both in suits, one=20
sitting behind a desk, and the other standing=20
before him, saying, "I'll be happy to do=20
innovative thinking. What are the guidelines?"

That about sums it up, no? And it certainly sums=20
up my experience at times teaching creative=20
writing, along with most else.

Best,

Joe

at the moment, there is no english version of the site, so i am sending a
short description of this alternative educational project, which is situated
in the totaly anti-intelectual approches to poetry, we developed highly
intelectual approach, and i think it is unique work in poetry in the region,
as far as i have information. i hope that something of this work will be in
some moment available in english!

AWIN's school for poetry and theory was established in  1997 first as summer
school within the Belgrade Center for Womes Studies and communication, and
then within  Association for Woemn's Initiative.

The program of the work implies:

- knowledge of poetry and poetics by 20th century poets from French
simbolists, Italian futurists, Russian cubofuturists,  Chech   poetists,
American beat poets and language poets to Sought Slavic poets;

- developing of artistic self-consciousness and self-reflection (writing of
poetics);

- thinking of poetry at the level of the models of poetry;

- lectures and representing guests;

- consideration of relations between contemporary relation between poetry
and contemporary theories (deconstruction, feminism,  technoaestetics, etc);

- discussing the relation contemporary media cultures *movie, advertising,
photographies) and  poetry;

 - discussing the relationship between contemporary poetry and visual art
and theatre;

- working on poetry as performing art...

Hi Dubravka,

The description of your school sounds great. As far as getting the
work from it out there, I'd encourage you and members of the school to
submit to our experimental magazine, Tarpaulin Sky.
(hhtp://www.tarpaulinsky.com).  We're always looking for new writers
and I have a sort of special interest in postSoviet life...especially
since we here too in the US are quite affected by this strange world
that has lost it's two poles.  It's a question of global interest, I
think.

 >>Golf Haiku

Thanks to MDW for taking the time to write such a thoughtful critique of
my haiku. Though you missed my intention -- which was merely to knock
off something silly -- your criticism was excellent. It helped me to
understand the form and tradition of a proper haiku. Honest criticism is
rare enough, but honest and extensive criticism is both rare and rewarding.

That is all right. But it is what haiku demands.
So you can write something else just as satisfying.

I love it, some macedonia for the list:

"Idyll Thoughts"

I don't wrote haiku.
to count syllables is fun.
Fucked your mom last night.

"Talk About Stuff"

Blah blah he said blah
blah natter guffaw she said
back. I got off the bus.

both by me. Here's a favorite macedonia by Jack McCarthy:

"The Super Polydent commercial I wish that Wilfred Brimley would do:"

There's nothing worse
when yer down on the muffin than
a loose upper palate.

I'm off now to add a "macedonia" entry to the wikipedia list of poetic forms.

Semi-seriously though, my roommate my first year at berklee was a greek named athanasios. Across the hall from us lived a fellow who claimed he was
from macedonia, but who thanos insisted was a Skopian and that the republic of macedonia was a lie cooked up by Tito to legitimize bulgarian holdings
in historically greek territory. it struck me at the time that the whole thing was a little bit silly, and that the worry about the skopian land grab
had very little to do with whether the slavs in the southeast of the former yugoslavia called themselves macedonians or skopians or bulgarians or
whatever. i think, as such, the analogy to haiku is highly apropos.

I'm sure there are other lists available for the promulgation of traditionalist poetics, and some of the same people might even be on both lists, since there is no reason not to be interested in both. But to the extent that we are not, at some point we just have to respectfully agree to disagree, letting the discussions of traditionalist poetics continue in whatever space is devoted to that and the discussions of innovative poetics, whatever that turns out to be, move forward in this one.

Although it would be useful to me to have recourse to this name at certain times, it doesn't really mean as much to me as it obviously does to some others, and therefore I'd just as soon cede it to them. I don't know why, but somehow this all reminds me of the dispute between Greece and one of the former Yugoslav republics over the name "Macedonia." United Nations intervention has still not resolved this issue. But when I lived in Italy, "macedonia" (small m) was the word for "fruit salad"--an association with very positive connotations as far as I'm concerned. So from now on I am going to avoid the use of the h-word to refer to any poem using a 5-7-5 structure or any other similar short poem whatsoever, except where this is unavoidable, such as when citing something that someone else said. From now on, I promise to refer to all such poems as

I just happened to turn on C-Span and found myself listening to the Grand
Jury/Fitzgerald questioning of "Scooter Libby." An 8 hour affair.
Absolutely fascinating - the machinations of Cheney and his Under-Lord re
the media, Judith Miller et al, revealing classified documents (National
Intelligence Estimate), etc.  Madly trying to cover their arses re Joe
Wilson's revelations.

Good Theater Spooky Reality.

If you miss it,I suspect C-Span will replay a few times over the next week.

I took Japanese for three years in highschool, and while i'm far from fluent, I do have some recall of of the issues revolving around this because
it's some of the hardest stuff involving correct pronunciation, and my drill instructor japanese teacher ground them into our heads. I think she was
more concerned with our pronouncing the language properly than understanding it. Basically, japanese syllable weight is determined by the onji, and
accents happen in pitch rather than in syllable weight. So what you get often times is syllables getting shortened or lengthened so that the on fit
the timing, because they shorten vowels that we normally hear as double vowels, because English is stress-timed and so syllable length isn't something
that we contemplate a lot it just sort of happens by convention. Not so in japanese, the on are all the same length, so syllables will vary in length
depending on how many on are in it. So for example in "ikimasho" (japanese for "let us go"), there are four syllables i-ki-ma-sho, but there are five
on i-ki-ma-shy-o, all of which get the same amount of time. similarly with desu and the irregular verb form masu, the [u] vowel is generally a long
vowel in English, whereas with japanese all vowels have long and short versions and so their terminal u's sound really chopped to western ears because
they have to be distinguished from a longer vowel and a different meaning (i don't know if desoo or masoo are other words or if it would just sound
like nonsense to a native speaker.) Once i got used to listening to it, it became apparent that the shortening of "su" that i thought i was hearing,
while it doesn't happen, it wasn't nearly as pronounced as i thought it was because it was very similar to the su that one finds in the beginning of a
word like "sushi" as it is pronounced in japanese (a slight but noticable difference from its English Cognate), or the shortened version in "sukoshi"
(a small quantity, from which the English Scosh is derived). the [u] is always still there, but i think as English speakers what happens is that we
mutate the foreign sounding vowels that we don't generally use into to consonant codas and our ears then turn something like "sukoshi" or "sukiyaki"
into "scoshii" or "skyaki." Most japanese speakers can hear the difference and the dropped syllables, but English speakers have to learn to listen for
it. I even vaguely remember my teacher saying that one of the signs of an american accent when speaking japanese is either dropping vowels or making
vowels too long. so an american might render "kore wa usagi deshitaka" (was that a rabbit) as "Cord wa oozagy deshtaka" writing phonetically. The
difference of course beign that where we are listening for syllables, the japanese are listening for mora, or onji, and the syllable is a slightly
larger unit than a mora.

I'm surprised i remember that many words, but i'm starting to think maybe i should go take a night class in japanese since so much of the fundamentals
still seem to be there.

 ***ABOUT OBERIU***

 It was a movement so artfully anarchic, and so quickly suppressed,
that  readers only began to discover its strange and singular
brilliance three decades after it was extinguished-and then only in
samizdat and emigre publications. Some called it the last of the
Russian avant-garde, and others called it the first (and last)
instance of Absurdism in
 Russia; however difficult to classify, it was OBERIU (from an acronym
standing for The Union  of Real Art), and the pleasures of its poetry
and prose are, with  this  volume, at long last fully open to
English-speaking readers.


 "OBERIU, sometimes called Russia's last avant-garde, is one of the most
intriguing--and little known--movements of the years before World
 War II. The absurdist poets at its center--Alexander Vvedensky,
Daniil Kharms, and
 Nikolai Zabolotsky--belonged to the first generation of writers to come of
 age after the October Revolution and hence stand apart from their Futurist
 predecessors. Less interested in coining neologisms than in destroying the
protocols of semantic coherence and linguistic realism, these poets
have  produced a series of inventive, free-wheeling, and often hilarious po=
etic
texts in a variety of forms and genres.This anthology, the first large-scal=
e
English translation of OBERIU poetry, has been superbly edited and
translated by the Russo-American poet Eugene Ostashevsky and his
colleagues.  In avant-garde annals, this is a milestone."
 --Marjorie Perloff

"The OBERIU writers are a revelation, an aspect of Russian modernism in the
early Soviet period that has been largely invisible to readers in English,
and these translations are brilliant, as nervy and funny and demotic as if
the work were written in an inspired English in the first place." =96Robert=
 Hass

"OBERIU is as relevant today as ever." --Book Forum

As far as my comments goes about perpetuating something, it wasn't =
really
about sexuality or femininity.  It was more the idea that for me to find =
out
more about her life at this point would be to perpetuate -- I just lost =
the
perfect phrase I had -- this gaze into her life, this public voyeurism =
that
reality tv and people "famous for being famous" has encouraged.

I don't buy that Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is famous for being =
famous.
There was something in the first place that led people to know about the
piece.  A film, a play, etc.  I realize it is a phrase that gets bandied
about a lot, but I think that says something about the condition of =
things.
I had a professor once who said things become clich=E9s for a reason.

That said, I'm still sorry for her tragedies.

It warms my heart that the haiku discussion has prompted thought about
what we're here for.

I don't care what the rules say, I'm here to get whatever I can to write
better poems of any type.

And by the way, if anyone out there cares to get diverted for a bit I
think the virelay is way under-appreciated and under-noticed.

Dear friends--

Tinfish Press is proud to announce the sewing, stamping, and publication
of the following;



    L A N G U A G E _ A S _ R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y
by Leonard Schwartz â€¢ 2006 â€¢ $12
Design by Lian Litvin

This hand-sewn chapbook contains three parts:
1) in which the Israel poet Aharon Shabtai offers witness.
2) in which a publishing vision emerges from the rich sources mingling
in Jerusalem.
3) a verse essay on poetic form in America by Leonard Schwartz that
argues responsibility is the ability to respond.
Language as Responsibility is something of a departure for Tinfish
Press, as its context is the Middle East, not the Pacific. But its
author, who now lives in Washington State, argues forcefully for a
poetics of publishing that crosses boundaries of language and difference
(in this instance Arabic and Hebrew, Palestine and Israel). Such
crossings fit Tinfishâ€™s philosophy, hence this beautiful chapbook.

See http://tinfishpress.com/chapbooks.html

for more details and to order copies.  Tinfish books are also available
through Small Press Distrubution, http://spdbooks.org


Aloha, Susan

Subject:      CALLING ALL DUSIE POETS
Comments: To: british-poets@jiscmail.ac.uk, wryting-l@listserv.wvu.edu

I'm forwarding this invitation from Susana Gardner to join the dusi/e-chap kollektiv for the second annual chap making/swapping collective with several dozen other poets.

The kollektiv is coming together once again and if you have had your work in Dusie or it is forthcoming (this includes all aspects of Dusie) she says consider yourself invited. Write to her at dusieli@yahoo.com to be signed up for the listserv.

She stresses that, unless invited by her, you must have been published in Dusie or have work forthcoming in it.

Some of the things you will be expected to take part in are:

* Being a part of a group-project (group dialogue via post and email)
* Getting daily emails via the listserv (and hopefully contributing when possible)
* Receiving mail nearly everyday for 2 months from other poets
* Publishing your chap the way you imagine it.
* Sending your chap out to ALL of the participants within the specified time-frame given doing the sufficient print run (and to send them out to reviewers too)

If you are interested, please reply to Susana and not me as I have nothing to do with this and am merely passing the message on.

You can contact her at: editor@dusie.org

Funny you should mention that. I had just been thinking it might be an interesting project to translate some h.... -- excuse, some macedonia into limericks or vice versa. (Or perhaps it would be better to refer to them as senryu than macedonia? I defer to the experts.)

  For instance, I found this macedonia by Basho online:


   Old pond
   Frog jump-in
   Water sound
      and that might turn into a limerick like:

            There once was a Japanese frog
            Who jumped into a watery bog
                 he made such a splash
                 But that watery crash
             Went unheard by the Japanese frog.


  On the other hand, there is this limerick by Edward Lear:

  There was an Old Person of Buda,
Whose conduct grew ruder and ruder;
Till at last, with a hammer,
They silenced his clamour,
By smashing that Person of Buda.

  I could imagine that being translated into something like this:

  Raucous old person
  watch out for a hammer
  next time you're smashed

Limericks? Hey, why not? . . .



when swallowing pride, rest assured:
the morsel may not leave you cured;
you may never pas
the concomitant gas,
but you will, in the end, have endured.

Nice. I appreciate the clarity of focus: present just a few things, in such a way that each one can be savored. The opposite of journals that present vast amounts of material by great numbers of people so that it becomes very difficult for anything in particular to stand out. Here, with just one poem and one interview per poet, I already feel like I've been properly "introduced" to each one. A dinner party, not a disco. Thank you!

There once was a list of poetics
abuzz with political frenetics,
then haiku came to town
and calmed them all down
and now they discuss ... poetics.

Last words are important. Here I was
hoping for, not "poetics," but maybe
a last word like . . . oh, "diuretics."

Thanks, Hal! I was thinking of kinetics then decided to go with the
anticlimactic poetics, emphasizing its self-evident nature with the
ellipsis. But maybe you're right ...

Puh-lease!

I find the term "hoohaa" much more offensive.

Please feel free to pass this on if you know of interested folks.

Here's the description of the reading from the store's calendar:

REBECCA LOUDON & RON STARR // Tuesday, February 13, at 7:30 PM  We are happy
to host two poets with books recently published by Edmonds-based Ravenna
Press. Ron Starr's inventive book, _A Map by a Dim Lamp_ ($12.95), flows
from the belief held by Oulipo, the French experimental writing group, that
form is freeing, and that new forms must constantly be created. Mr. Starr,
in "Luther's Narrow Road," replaces some of the words in Basho's classic
haiku with those from a Martin Luther essay, resulting in poems such as, "An
offense / has settled on a bare Christ -- / autumn evening." Sharp
intelligence, humor, close attention to the details of rhythm and sense, and
a fascination with religious texts allow his writing to spark on various
levels, including the baroque/modern oddness of its structures. Another
example: one section of his "Creation Myths of the Latter Urbanites" starts,
"In the beginning green grass created happiness and envy. The expressways
were without Fords and Volvos, and dusk was upon the fences of the
domiciles...."

 _Radish King_ ($13.95) is Rebecca Loudon's deliciously dark and darkly
hilarious collection. Things domestic go seriously wrong -- "She's ready to
go it alone, more than ready / having tired of and tidied her family, /
having sewed her daughter, her son, into waterproof coats." The poems are
dreamily menacing, permeated with a sort of courtship of threat and sex. "I
want to hurt you in a Rock Hudson Doris Day kind of way." And where else
will you find a poem like "Everyone's Favorite Holiday Suicide: A Letter in
which Violet Bick Addresses George Bailey for the Last Time," ending (we're
sorry to give it away, but we're compelled), "I hope more than anything you
just have the courage to jump." She is also the author of the fever-dreamish
book _Navigate, Amelia Earhart's Letters Home_, mentioned in our December
2006 newsletter. This promises to be a quirky and dynamic evening.

Somehow this, one of my favourite limericks, seems strangely appropriate:

There was a young man of Japan
Whose poetry never would scan.
When asked why 'twas so
He replied, "Yes, I know,
But I always try to get as many words in the last line as I possibly can."

Me, too. Furthermore, changing the name for the reasons outlined, just feeds
into what this play is intended to thwart, don't you think?

A good one.

And helps disprove Gershon Legman's contention that limericks are
supposed to be lewd. Legman, probably the greatest folklorist of
filth, edited The Limerick, a collection of 1700 examples, with
scholarly apparatus. It's the locus clasicus, and I think it's still
available in reprint, but there are a lot of very cheap copies
available at AbeBooks. Should be on every bookshelf.

CFP: 'Stanley Cavell and Literary Criticism', conference, May 9-11
2008, Edinburgh University.

Stanley Cavell's work has been influential for the theory and practice
of literary criticism for many years. From his consideration of Beckett
and Shakespeare in his first book, Must We Mean What We Say? (1969) to
the recent collection of writing on Emerson, Emerson's Transcendental
Etudes (2003), Cavell's philosophical concerns have consistently been
grounded in the problems and challenges offered by literary texts. This
conference, the first to consider explicitly the connection between
philosophical practice and literary art in Cavell, will include major
scholars from both sides of the Atlantic. Professor Cavell has agreed to
participate in the event.

An edited volume of specially commissioned essays arising out of papers
given at the conference is also planned.

Possible topics for consideration include: literary ethics; speech act
theory; literary and philosophical romanticism; the idea of America;
Shakespeare; modernism and modernity.

Abstracts of no more than 500 words should be sent to
Andrew.Taylor@ed.ac.uk. The deadline for submissions is May 1, 2007.

James Loxley, Lee Spinks, Andrew Taylor (English Literature, University
of Edinburgh)

Yeah -- too bad the playwright couldn't make some short-notice
additions to the script, to play up the ludicrousness of the name
change.

Hoohaa reminds me of Hee Haw, and now I have this image of people
popping out of the cornfield. Thanks, Atlantic Beach!

The idea that a limerick must be lewd is a common amateur limerick writers mistake, similarly, the need for five lines. Both of these targets are not
nearly as important as the necessity of a slow moving to fast rhyme and the requisite of novelty in the tail of the poem. Aiming at bawdiness and a

Thanks, Jason.
We've certainly 'murdered to dissect' the haiku sufficiently.
Let's hope we don't proctologize the limerick as well.

Legman was hardly an amateur, and he didn't write them, he collected
them as (largely middleclass) folklore. That was a couple of
generations ago. But we all remember what the young maid from
Nantucket would do with whatever she found. She probably wasn't very
sophisticated either. Me, I don't write limericks. I do, however,
strongly recommend the book.

oh, i'm sure. I was just (gently, i hope) teasing mr welch about his statements about haiku.

I love limericks and i'm looking forward to getting a copy of that book. It looks like there are a number of decent shape hardcovers on ABE. Also, he
did a sequel called "More Limericks" it looks like. Do you have an opinion on that one?

I don't see how Violi's poem is satirical, or how it could ever be meant
that way, at least regarding haiku, but perhaps you can enlighten me? The
Padgett piece seems too trivial and even juvenile in its stance to achieve
meaningful satire. It may seem clever if you're new to "haiku about haiku" like
Padgett's, but HUNDREDS of people have dashed off poems like that. Believe me,
they were stale the instant the first one was written. And most beginners  go
through a stage of writing them.

Re Dan Coffey's comment: "I agree with Vincent that morphing is  necessary,
but MDW makes a good point, one that shouldn't have to be made. Know  the
history of the poem, its implications and subtleties, and THEN subvert it."  In
response, yes, feel free to subvert all you want, but from a position of
knowledge, not ignorance. But also remember that nothing has to be subverted at  all.

Also, I realize that not everyone is wired to care about haiku, which is
fine by me. But I do have a problem with people claiming something as a good
haiku when it sometimes isn't a haiku at all. Making such a claim presumes that
one has at least a basic understanding of the genre -- and hopefully more
knowledge than that.

It is common for folks to refer to E. E. Cummings with just lowercase
letters. However, have you noticed, in at least the last 20+ years, that  Liveright
(Cummings' publisher) has not treated his name that way? If you've not
noticed, please notice now. Despite the popular perception of his name being
lowercased, it is not what he wanted (unlike, say, k.d. lang, who has  specifically
said she wants her name treated in lowercase letters). The  lowercase
treatment of his name was a designer's choice, and not one that  Cummings himself
favoured. Norman Friedman, a friend and leading critic of  Cummings, and also
longtime president of the E. E. Cummings Society, has  written two seminal artic
les on this subject. You can find them online if you  search for "Cummings
capitalization":

Not "e. e. cummings" -- _http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/caps.htm_
(http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/caps.htm)
Not "e. e. cummings REVISITED" --
_http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/caps2.html_ (http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/caps2.html)

In the interests of full disclosure, I'm a contributing editor to  Spring:
The Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society. Just as haiku is  misunderstood in
English as a "5-7-5-syllable" poem, so too does the  capitalization of Cummings'
name suffer from popular misperception.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed

Praise be to the watch which is not responsible for rationalism or the
mechanistic view of being
Whereas I agree that Rene Descartes whose watchmechanism theory of
animals held animals were automata was a jovian ignoramus who
perpetrated a great and lasting evil on the world by furthering the
practice of gratuitous murder of other meat-bearing beings of bone,
chiton, and slime. But those who have attacked wristwatches as harmful
clams, vigil posts of death, totalizing disk engines, pulsing pucks of
Beelzebub, were for the most part British and anglophiles, whereas
Emerson and Whitman found the watch fascinating and an instrument of
sunlight, as did Benjamin Franklin, whereas those who defiled the watch
were Dryden, including Laurence Stern, Wycherley, Ben Jonson, Samuels
Butler and Beckett and Coleridge, tho the Samuel Pepys was proud of his
watch and delighted in it, for it is a thing to delight with, whereas
Allens Ginsberg and Edgar Poe were equal American idiots, the latter
being addicts and American, Alan Poe having written a racist screed
against the Dutch, clocks and cabbage, and tho he deplored the
dissection of animals Alexander Pope and yes the fatuous boneheaded Wm
Blake, even him, tho i know most of you like him, and his melodramatic
and mostly retarded whinging about “infernal cogs” whereas I find no
woman who attacked the watch, being sensible, that these aforementioned
people mostly are idiots operating completely as imbeciles, essentially
scapegoated a mechanism, small at that, masking a complicitous
participation in an increasingly rationalized society by dissing a
collection of nanosprings and small teeth of brass arrayed on circles,
praising, worse, inordinately the word and that betrayal of thought
called Reason while forgoing their fundamental nature, which is called
lovingkindness, can bite my ass. Also can Allen Ginsberg bite my ass he
was an idiot. Whereas Dante put his single horologe into heaven, and had
it run there as a great sun horse, and Rabelais’ dislike stemming mostly
from the the relation between clocks and monks and increasingly
oppressive use of clocks by the religious hierarchy, with which
skepticism I forgive and am down with, for tho prayer like work is a
group activity, the clock itself I argue stood as a taunting analogous
reminder of self-sufficient individuation-—an example of ostensible
self-reliance which ironically served, in my personal theory, as an
inspiration to that at first okay then supremely retarded
anti-rationalist counter-culture called romanticism, which strangely
took to defiling the clock itself when it was the clock that stood, in
their hippy minds, as a replacement of an hierarch sun
Praise to the currently ubiquitous watch, but in 1720 the price of a
watch was equivalent to a servant girl’s wage for ten years. Samuel
Pepys’, thus, love of watch was consonant with his fondling and raping
of his servant girls, including one Deborah Willett, which adultery and
rape he recorded first in Latin then in the cocktail of French,
Portuguese, Latin, and coded English after his wife read his account of
his raping of same and witnessing him w/ his member in Ms Willett
Praise be the man who wrote The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of
Figaro, Beaumarchais, as he was a brilliant watchmaker
Praise be Wm Hogarth an artist who cd paint a portrait in one hour and
depicted consistently time pieces, then new, in his renderings, as with
the rise of the waistcoat in 1675 men ceased to wear watches by chains
on the neck and placed them in pockets, whereas women continued to wear
them on chains, in fact it was the discomfort afforded by the weight of
the watch suspended on the neck that caused Charles II to devise an
expedient sling composed by a light garment for the torso, a “vest,”
upon which small internal purses of cloth, which we call pockets, could
be hung. Tompion who in his life made 6,000 watches and 500 clocks, was
the occasion of much thievery: The personal advertisements of London
papers frequently mentioned rewards for stolen Tompion watches
Praise be Daniel Defoe, born in the horological revolution, who depicts
one Moll Flanders who stole gold watch after gold watch. The best
watches now are made of stainless steel, and sometimes Titanium
Praise be all those who resisted Descartes who in 1619 reports wishing
to construct a mechanical flying pigeon, a dancing dog, and a spaniel
chasing a pheasant
Praise be the watch, it is the amphitheater of all those who are
awaiting the outcome of our present
Praise be the many bugs, more complex than watches. That they have an
energy that has left us. They have the energy of children. That they are
the favorites of God and are but the particles of people with the wills
of children. That insects are my little cousins under the uncle of
heaven. And I am happy of them
Praise that the wristwatch is essentially an astronomical instrument,
which fact we among the houses forget. That what is a watch used for, it
is used for the mimicking of the turning of the sky as the turning of
its hands remembers the turning of the sky, the rolling of the earth
before and under the sun
Praise be the watch by which to constant remember decay, for rather we
would have bolted a dancing fetus to a wall, or something like that
Praise be the minute hand which tho the watches were around since the
early 16th century as a personal vademecum, the minute hand did not
arise on a watch until 1660
Praise to the Northern Hemisphere which gave the watch
Praise to Randall Benson who sd “A watch does not respond to force, they
are too small to compete with it.”
Praise to the 4th chronometer of John Harrison which in 1761 erred no
more than 15 seconds in a 5 month journey to the West Indies and back
Praise to the British horological revolution of 1660-1770
Praise to John Harrison, he that built the first sea clock, a clock to
be taken unto the seas w/out losing even a second a week, incredible,
despite buffet by wave, storm, the seamen themselves and sometimes,
which did happen, a fish from the window
And even tho the Industrial Revolution was precipitated by the British
horological revolution, praise to the British horological revolution
Praise to the escapement, a device which through repetitive mechanical
motion regulates the running down of the motive power
Praise to the history of clocks which is to a large extent a history of
the improvement of the technologies of escapement
Praise to the clock which is not a metaphor for the enslavement of
peoples, the enslavement of labor, the abuse of human power, the call of
the factory, nor the bell that tolls as death
Praise to Ikuo Tokunaga-san designer of the Seiko divers 1974-present
who sd “And if your 1000m diver’s watch will be damaged unfortunately in
any case, please contact to the SEIKO Service Center of your country as
soon as possible. And last of all, I would like to say again The watches
are living machines and they wanted to be cared from their lovely owner
with heart-full mind every day. Please love your professional 1000m
diver’s watch for ever. Thanks again. Sincerely yours, Ikuo Tokunaga”
Praise to Richard Leigh, 1695, who wrote of insects, “Like Living
Watches, each of these conceals/ A thousand Springs of Life, and moving
wheels…”
Praise to those in Norway, who are generally Norwegians, that they wear
clocks. That they have rain there. That things are busy there. That they
are busy with Norway. That there are old incomparable fountain pens
there. That all these things are Norway, of Norway, and make Norway.
Praise to weakened insects of Norway, who are happy, being fond of snow,
which burdens them
Praise that wristwatches, like nickels on the sea, are children of the
colossal. That they burden no person, mar no time, and are made of the
sound of the baskets. That Sunlight in Norway is of strained apricot.
That this on my wrist is a celestial theater. That a wristwatch is a
small celestial theater. It is a small sky. A device for the measure of
shadows
Praise be Ikuo Tokunaga-san designer of the Seiko divers 1974-present
who sd “All watches are the noble-minded living machines for which human
beings have created as the mechanical watches and as quartz watches. In
those creatures, there are ‘the culture of the time’ which tells human
beings' history, ‘the law of the time’ which keeps social order,
‘mankind's philosophy’ which tells their feelings, ‘the drama of sports’
with sweat and tears, and also ‘the art of the time’ which charms
people's mind deeply by the ultimate mechanism. Both mechanical watches
and quartz watches have their individuality, and both are alive with you
with respectful character in this world. Although determined by the
style of your life, and TPO, since my selection basis of watches is
summarized in the next table, please make it reference which to be chosen.”
Praise be the wristwatch, small celestial theater
Praise be the first nanotechnology
Praise be the watch, up, and it bring a brave morning
Praise be the watch which is not responsible for the death of spiritual time

Good stuff, Gabe.  Enjoying it.

About a third of the way through, I realised I'd have to print it out and

Will do that now.

For the time being, however, all posts to the list will be sent to the
moderator for approval. As a result, there will be a delay from the
time posts are sent to when they are posted.

I didn't see the Grammies, but I'd say this is a slap in the face to
Ornette, considering how much he's contributed. I'm out of the popular
culture loop and can't imagine Carrie Underwood's accomplishments comparing
to his even remotely.

guess he wouldn't have shown up if he didn't want to, and besides,
it's only the grammys, it's not like it means anything.

Ah, this is one of the most beautiful pieces I've read in a long time;
there's something 17th18th century  running through it, those references
to Pepys for example though I still prefer Johnson they're still
associated in my mind. The incantatory prose itself ticks away, I miss the
digital, though there are slight references; the poem is mechanism, the
digital might as well not be a watch since it is watched itself, clocked
itself, in order that the parts function together. Now we will have
asynchronous computers in the future, what will that be light?

In regard to moderation, I'm not so positive as the two other members who
have written in; poets are an unruly bunch and that seems to be at the
heart of remaking language itself. Here we literally have to have Amy's
approval, and it's unclear where that stands, what is acceptable to her
and what is not. As far as unpleasant posts to a list - there's no reason
at all why posts _should_ be pleasant or etiquette-fulfilled, as long as
there is no outandout racism, name-calling, what have you. For poets are
also a stubborn bunch; it takes courage to write poetry, perhaps the most
courage at all, and it's a shame so little of it appears in this forum.
(The email list I run with Sandy Baldwin, wryting, is filled with it by
the way.)

For my recent work, just check the blog or Youtube at times, although the
accompanying texts are absent; for example

It would be great to see any Bay Area poets, or poets visiting there, at
the CODEX symposium and book fair at UC-Berkeley Feb. 13-15. Chax Press
will be displaying books there. The public "book fair" is Feb. 14 & 15. For
more information, . . .

         http://www.codexfoundation.org/bookfair/index.html

We'll be displaying a new fine art edition of the poem WITNESS by Kathleen
Fraser. The book is also by Nancy Tokar Miller, who made eleven original
(and stunning!) works of art for the book. But we'll also have handmade
books we've done over the last bunch of years, and a smattering of trade
paperback books of poetry. Check out our web site for recent titles . . .

I hope to see some friends in Berkeley!

Who is Carrie Underwood?
  Was he giving the award to her or she to him? If the former, isn't it right that the senior person give the award to the lesser figure? Like if I was getting an award for poetry, it would mean a lot if was being given me by John Ashbery, whereas it would be merely presumptuous if I were to give one to him.

peace,

i am writing in reference to a short writ entitled "do what you like" a
story
about the killing of a girl in my town set the music of blind faith. i
was wonder is you still have a copy of the story since i was the subject
a hate crime which
presented itself in the form of a break in into my flat and my computer,
which contained my writing, was stolen along with my prayer mat.

i am currently attempting to retrieve some of my lost writings


you assistance would be much appreciated

Thanks, Robin. That stuff quoting Ikuo Tokunaga (Tokunaga-san, as he's
affectionately known) is from the Seiko Citizens Watch Forum
(http://www.network54.com/Forum/78440/).

This is just a beginning, written over the last two days. I want to
explore the history of the watch and wristwatch in relation to first
gender and then colonialism. It's a huge field, almost untouched.

Looking at the paintings of Wm Hogarth - was just struck by how many are
of women and watches/clocks. The watch and women have this buried
history that goes weirdly back to people like Pepys and Tompion. I'm not
sure yet what to make of it. Gabe

Good stuff, Gabe. Enjoying it. About a third of the way through, I
realised I'd have to print it out and read the rest more carefully. Will
do that now. Robin

"Ancestors"
by Nathaniel Tarn


"At the exact site of the Lituanica's tragedy, in the forest of
Soldin, Germany, the Aero Club of Lithuania rented for ninety nine
years a . . . circle-shaped area and erected a monument. (The
inscription:) "Here died as heroes the Transatlantic Flyers Darius &
Girenas " (July 15, 1933) . . . After World War II, that part of
Germany was annexed to Poland and Lithuania was occupied by the
Soviets."





Small provincial town
           in "my" fathers' land
at creation's edge -
border post deserted,
a line of lindens,
                       opposite post deserted,
           no crossings anymore
as there once were
between old world and new.

"God's Playground" here
as they used to call it:
what does He play with
what is the message of a life,
what is the information,
what can the play mean
           from bit to life, and back?

Other end of town:
small sunlit graveyard field
edged with small jungles:
hazels, apples, roses, ferns,
nettles, mushrooms, herbs -
loud with warblers,
           storks overhead
birds of my secret childhood.


       Rite of return
elegant orange "bird"
           shines on my memory
flying the sun from west to east
back to its homeland,
the two boys clean
           pure-blooded heroes -
narrative simple
           a nation's testament
torn out of anonymity
           the double fit
thanks X and gentle Y.


When was "our" departure:
before the warning signs
                       were clearly witnessed
or very near the terminus
           of possibility -
by which way forward
under the lindens
           was it to left,
was it to right
they went from east to west
and to what purpose
           to what end in "me"?

Scrabble to read the graves
four hours the heat increasing.
           Small stone book-shape -
third the way down from top -
grips one pointed gravestone
           (like a clown's hat)
perhaps a sign of "us"
whose trade was bookbinding.

When not finding's no matter -
this is community -
"my" people sunk into
"our" people floating here
their stones on the grass sea.
So that it does not matter
           if name sings here or not:
what is a name inside oblivion?


Not enough money
to buy the right equipment
           homed into heroism:
arrival no arrival
a crash short of the goal
in a "great neighbor" country,
the whole scene under glass
shrine in its own museum
when it had been subtracted
           out from the swastikas.
Crowd size at funeral
never yet seen in all of history.


Behind the pointed grave,
thick trees spread darkness,
huge long-house trench:
a thousand hidden there -
           but not by natural
demise - shot in the neck:
it will take lifetimes
           to read those dead.

           Came to the sky
these luftmenschen too early
           against the grain
of their determinations.
           Now I'm at table:
Gorge at my life deep sun!
Take down the charming pilots
           and too "my" ancestors!

In the town,
"they" who are always present
holding a festival
of later generations.
Midway between creations
all ate and drank the same
heard the same blood beat
           of excremental music -
we paid them no attention.
How many of "their" fathers
           might have helped
                       to fill that field?


"Their" flyers:
nothing as infiltrated
as "our" sallow legions
storm troopers in their time
would soon dispose of.
How could a record flight else
           among so many
bring home the corpses
           embalmed,
later, hidden for years
           from various oppressors
until again, an independence.


While it is on record
(those who don't sleep or dream)
                       that in a neighbor town
"they" stood on rooftops
many smiling
           to watch the shooting circus.



from /Crystals/
by Janet Rodney


I.

The time
of which I write

is a memory

of getting back
to Mother Earth, mouth
pressed to hers, desire's
irresistible

curl of lips
when love
for Father Water
is strongest

I look for his eye and hear
a hellish laughter
as from outside

up from the ocean.



II.

Long after all horizons
have proved themselves mortal

I see my rider shadow
galloping along the beach,

it is August, lead-bellied
gulls rise toward the Rock

where Atlantic currents
and Mediterranean mix

wild roses
corrupting on its face,

you are right,
at this time the mind

is a mirror to the sun
the heart a coal
bright in, the wind,

nothing
is mine
but the ride

before the sequence
vanishes like lead

drawn down
thru deep water.


XV. The Androgynous Principle (A)

In a small dream
in a small room
in a small town in New Jersey

I am on the make,
a huntress stepping out
of fathomless woods

her small breasts
are smooth
as riverstones
her own phallus, a knife
hung around her neck
instrument
of delight.

The prey this evening
is elusive:
she would like to be

worthy of her victim
who doesn't appear
to cruise these parts
this hour

would like to give her body
to the victim of her choice
precisely when he, the hunted,
steps out of her

moves in, penetrating, manly,
fucking in blindness
bringing them news
of light.


XVI. The Androgynous Principle (B)

Each day the sun
rises inside her eye
looking

for new fields,
at night drops
like a coin into water, she

is blown back by
darkness, her coat of shells
catching a light

from below
where he is hidden,
shining in water he waits

while she
dangles her clothes on a tree,
descends to the edge,
water rising slowly up

her body
between her thighs
he drinks her.


XVII.

Here we are
and all we see
is more

than ourselves,
the failing leaves
and flowerheads
float on the canal
like scales of carp

downriver
here we are and more,
wind driving thru
the cracks of our windows
bringing on the cold
we know

from our skin
(and over hard ground walk
the circuit of each other)

that winter
has made it
our way again

Ornette actually got more facetime than the other lifetime achievement
grammy award winners--among them The Doors, The Grateful Dead, and Booker T.
& The MG's--who after each of them were talked about for a few seconds from
the stage had a camera focused upon them in the audience. This is the way
it's been for the past few years at the grammy awards with these awards.

As for Flea, he began playing the trumpet at age nine and grew up the
step-son of jazz musician Walter Urban, Jr., and wanted to be a jazz
musician like him. I think he was just honoring Ornette, perceived grammys
slight be damned.

Best,
david

"good luck amy. hopefully this will result in a decline of some of the truly
grotesque hate mail which i for one vote against. susan maurer"

-- yeah -- i agree --

from thich nhat hanh:
--
one day a monk came to tue trung, the most illustrious teacher of Buddhism
in Vietnam in the thirteenth century, a time when Buddhism was flourishing
in Vietnam.  the monk asked him, "what is the pure, immaculate Dharmakaya?"
and Tue Trung pointed to the excrement of a horse.  This was an irreverent
approach to Dharmakaya, because people were using the word immaculate to
describe it.  you cannot use words to describe the Dharmakaya.  Even though
we say it is immaculate, pure, that does not mean it is separate from things
that are impure.  reality, ultimate reality, free from all adjectives,
either pure or impure.  so his response was to shake up the mind of the
monk, for him to cleanse himself of all these adjectives in order to see
into the nature of the dharmakaya...

I've never forgotten Ornette on the phone saying artists don't need to go to
art schools--they need to go to business schools--

it's not called the Entertinment INDUSTRY because it's about "art" and
"artists" you know--it's strictly business--
so of course Ornette wd show up and get his Grammy--it's good for HIS
business, too

are Jazz musicians supposed to always be neglected, poor and "pure" from
money and awards other musicians are given? for the sake of their fans--?

this is about business, not art--
an artist knows they are an artist, a great one, wihout needing to be told
or awarded--
but the award and publicity and cash it brings--that they do need--to
live--for themselves, their family, their work--

I just spoke with staff at the Atlantic Beach Experimental Theater in
Atlantic Beach, FL. It turns out they're not involved in the title fiasco,
but they told me that the theater showing The Vagina Monologues has resumed
using that title instead of The Hoohah Dialogues.



In South Florida, I don't think The Vagina Monologues would pose a problem,
but I'm told northern Florida is much more conservative.



So, I guess the general discussion of hoohahs can continue under a name less
offensive to any hoohah-haters on the List.

All that granted -- and of course I know he got a lot more attention at the part of the ceremonies that was not televised --

Still, I think it good to take note of such things, to make whatever small noise there is to be made -- That, after all, is how the grammies eventually moved out of the &quot;let's give all the awards to Mitch Miler&quot; mode of the past and finally began to acknowledge the existence of more interesting music -- I'm under no illusions -- the jazz awards often go to the most middle of the road performers, as with poetry awards -- in some years, viewers could be excused for thinking Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Arturo Sandoval were members of, say, Jewel's backup band --

and let's not even get started on what they do to classical music --

and it was great to see Ornette (and that suit!) at all -- but it was a lifetime of people complaining about such things that brought the academy to give him a lifetime achievement award -- so, I still say complaining is a good thing -

and bless Flea for wearing his heart on his grille cloth --

During my "six month initiation" to ______________, I became obsessed by
my digital wristwatch.  It seemed always to catch my eye at "crazy
ones", "crazy twos", etc.  (terms I made up much later playing
space-deck home run derby) So, I put it in the street, hoping some car
would smash it.  But after re-situating it a couple times, I began to
feel dumb, so I put it back in my pocket.  I think it wound up as
charity for the mission shelter in El Paso, Texas, along with my
favorite shirt ever.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation. The
current limits of the list are 75 messages per day, and a maximum of
four messages per subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to
change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.


2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal
entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

All posts go out not only to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.


6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 4 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 75 or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be
changed at the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation. The
current limits of the list are 75 messages per day, and a maximum of
four messages per subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to
change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.


2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal
entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

All posts go out not only to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.


6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 4 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 75 or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be
changed at the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

Ah, that confirms it -- I've now got an Unarguable Reason to go to the
Hogarth exhibition on at the Tate at the moment.  I'll keep an eye out for
watches (though they'd all be analogue in his paintings, pace Alan Sondheim,
surely?) and let you know what I notice.

(I only recently came on his [later] paintings, as opposed to all the usual
Progress series of etchings, and they blew my mind.  Reports of the Tate
exhibition that I've read suggest that they're juxtaposing the two periods
in Hogarth's work.)

Subject:      Place & Wertheim at Small Press Traffic Fri 2/16
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present
Vanessa Place & Christine Wertheim

Friday, February 16, 2007 at 7:30 p.m.?

Vanessa Place is the author of a 50,000-word, one-sentence novel, Dies: A
Sentence (2005), and co-founder/editor at Les Figues Press, publisher of the
TrenchArt series of experimental literature. Her work has appeared in Film
Comment, the LA Weekly Literary Supplement, and Five Fingers Review. Of
Dies, the American Book Review has this to say: "... heaven may be no more
than this grace of an extended lucidity in a mind struck brilliant by the
imminent threat of fate.... as one comma leads to another in this delightful
tour de force of a hopelessly grim predicament."

Christine Wertheim writes poetics and aesthetic criticism. Her book
+|'me'S-pace, will be published in 2007 by Les Figues Press. Other work has
appeared in La Petite Zine, Five Fingers Review, Cabinet, Open Letter, Art
History vs Aesthetics and X-tra. With Matias Viegener, she co-organizes an
annual writing conference whose publications are Séance (2006) and

Hi Alex

Don't blame this one on China. I got the same message here in the People's
Democracy of South Florida. And then the message in question appeared a few
minutes later. Go figure.

The Disappearance of Latitude:
Live Presence and Realtime in Contemporary Practices

A two-day symposium
Thursday February 22 & Friday February 23
http://www.openportchicago.com
Chicago, IL
Free

This symposium brings together theorists and
practitioners from a variety of backgrounds to present
lectures and participate in discussions formulated
around the themes of “Live” and “Realtime,” and topics
that arise from this convergence of terms. As with the
OPENPORT performance series, the intention of the
symposium is to group speakers from fields and
backgrounds that, while perhaps not normally exposed
to one another, may share a common vocabulary. This
symposium is presented in collaboration with The
School of the Art Institute of Chicago’s Performance
Department.

ADVANCE REGISTRATION ESSENTIAL:
email mjeffe@saic.edu or write to SAIC, Performance
Department, c/o Mark Jeffery, 280 S. Columbus Drive,
Chicago, IL 60603. Please include name, phone number,
email address, affiliation (if any), number and names
of people you are reserving for.
***Reservation deadline: Monday, February 19.***

Opening Address
Adrian Heathfield (UK) - Impress of Time
Thursday February 22, 6pm
SAIC Auditorium, 280 S. Columbus Drive

Moving away from ideas of performance as a momentary
shattering, a technique of disappearance, Heathfield
explores the way that performance remains in and
through the experience of duration, and how
performance allows a vital space for the lived
understanding of time within the contemporary.

Friday February 23, 9am – 4:30pm
SAIC Performance Space 012 &
Base Space, 280 S. Columbus Drive

Friday’s symposium events consist of talks from two
distinguished visiting scholars, in conjunction with
panel presentations from OPENPORT artists and SAIC
faculty members.

Visiting Scholars:
Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Brown University (US):
Realtime Imagined Networks
N. Katherine Hayles, UCLA (US):
The Time of Electronic Literature

OPENPORT Artists / Panelists:
jonCates (US) – OPENPORT artist/SAIC Faculty
John Cayley (UK) – OPENPORT artist
Lin Hixson (US) – SAIC Faculty
Kirsten Lavers (UK) – OPENPORT artist
Matthew Goulish (US) – SAIC Faculty

Little Red Leaves is a collectively edited online poetry journal. Our first

that this will still ensure an interesting read. We also have a chapbook
press, Dos Press, which will be debuting in May as well.

(In addition to this post, information about the journal can be found at
littleredleavesjournal.blogspot.com )

*General Submissions: Please send 3-5 poems (of any length) as a Word, RTF,
or PDF attachment to littleredleaves@gmail.com. In the subject line include
your name and "general."

*Other Submissions: Each editor might also decide to edit a 'special
section' with more specific guidelines. These will be posted separately as
such.

Simultaneous submissions are accepted as long as you let us know if someone
else has snatched your brilliant poem first.
We do not consider previously published work.

Please allow six to eight weeks for a response. After eight weeks, please
query if you haven't heard a word.

*Queries: Send any questions you might have to
littleredleaves@gmail.com with "Query" as your subject line.

Special Calls :
Currently we have two calls- one for long poems and one for entre-genres.

Part of my issue with the invocation of those 'legitimate' Euro-
American modernist analogies for haiku practice
is because they rely on a notion of 'objective' and 'things' which
still largely operate against a backdrop, or within
an 'understanding,' of a 'subject-object' dichotomy that lopsidedly
favors one side....
They both become such 'reductive' catchphrases, even if ideally they
open the door to a less clamped-down understanding.

I've used both phrases in non-pejorative ways in certain
(pedagogical) situations,
but when people try to separate the "Objective Correlative" (GOOD)
from the "pathetic fallacy" (BAD),
I tend to want to "elevate" the "pathetic fallacy" to acknowledge
that the "objective-subjective matrix" is not a one-way street.
As for "no ideas but in things," what I tend to see in the very same
poems that people often champion for meeting the
non-pejorative standards of exemplary in the "no ideas but in things
vein," is "No Ideas but in relationships"---
so, in that hAIKU you quoted, that's what I saw....a relationship
between things (but at the same time "things" that are
'of' relationship....
      as it seems to me (and I believe you'd have to agree) that the
best haiku involve the relationship between
the 'word' and 'thing,' the word as thing, and has as much of counter-
pull away from the 'thing' as toward it....

Is it really "the emotive power BEHIND things" as you put it?
I can appreciate that you want to be a spokesman for haiku, and I am
not going to claim that I am as learned in it, as you,
and am quite willing, along with Barry Schwabsky and others, to let
you have that word,
but, as an outsider, I am curious as to what role you think what a
contemporary American (or from wherever) would call
'humor' or 'wit' had, or may have had, in that founding impulse to
the haiku.

You've sufficiently established that the traditional haiku form is a
more serious art than many give it credit for,
but I'm curious in what ways you also find that the traiditional
haiku form a more hilarious art form than many give it credit for.
I ask this question with no disrespect to you, or the traditional
haiku form as you understand it,
but more out of a genuine desire to BE CONVINCED by your
understanding of the form,
because, for me (whether rightly or wrongly), there can't be one
(high seriousness) without the other ('hilarity' for lack of a better
word-thing approximation)....

I guess the haiku interests me most of all in the context of haibun,
that prose/poem nexus is a happening thing. From what I understand,
the conventions of seasons &c are all invented by Basho anyway - would
he have wanted slavish copyists?

Hey Chris, you're my kind of guy. Only recently I was rehabilitating
the pathetic fallacy from Ruskin's character assassinations - all that
manly Victorianism caused him a few problems, I think.

I had the privelige of interviewing Ornette Coleman last year at his loft & the impression I came away with was a man who put no walls between categories of music. Is it really such a horror to be asked to be a presenter of an award?  Like many so-called avant-garde jazz musicians, Coleman has always wanted to be present his music to as wide as possible an audience --hence Prime Time, the attempts at using vocalists here and there and the classical music. As early as '62, at his Town Hall concert which was released at ESP, Ornette performed with an r n' b group --which sadly was not released and apparently no longer exists on tape.

Actually amazing that he got the lifetime award!

Dear Stephen--

This is both powerful and touching.  I really liked the originality of your
mother's words, too, both in the poem and in her discussion with you of her
poem -- her connection to the poem.  And -- your blog entry is really an
instance of image and text reinforcing one another.

What she produces, what you facilitate, takes one beyond some of the
dichotomies we often think about here.

I hope that you continue to announce her progress here.

Martha

___Special congratulations to Amy King___

my usual congratulations to Charles Bernstein, the founder, and Nick
Piombino. Due to my ignorance I partly know Lori Emerson whom I would like
to thank for having helped me out patiently when I first subscribed, nor do
I know Julia Bloch or Joel Kuszai. It goes without saying that to manage
such a list you need an ever-present *Good Will.
*
Best wishes,

>
> 6. Cautions
>
> "Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define

> sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
> person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
> critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
> main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
> or criticism of the person.
>
> The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
> discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
> listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.
>
> In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
> competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
> our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.
>
> For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
> subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
> sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
> HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
> individual posts to 1,000 words or less.
>
> Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
> the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
> for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material

>
> All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;

> (http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
> Used by permission of the author.
>
> As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 4 messages per day

> accepts 75 or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be
> changed at the discretion of the list moderator.
>
> Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel

About _The Pictures_:
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Winter/index.html

Sparse, clear, and free of flourishes, the poems in The _Pictures_ examine
war, boredom, death, love, decay, happiness, and worship through a series of
moving and still images. In one poem, from a group of "moving" pictures,
three soldiers bide their time in a barren landscape, awaiting destruction;
in a "still" picture, a group of stones invite us to pay closer attention to
them; in another still picture, a woman stands with her mouth open, fists
clenched, words unimportant. Sight is unmysterious but wondrous in this
book; the poems demonstrate that to look at something or to read it is to
experience it, along with its attendant sadness or joy. The "pictures"
collected here are communicative and profound, quick to read but long to
develop.

New literary twist added to laundry cycle
Tue Feb 13, 2007 9:08am ET

NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters Life!) - Doing the laundry has taken on a
new meaning for New Yorkers who can now watch their wash and spin
cycles while listening to poetry and prose.

Instead of burying their head in a book or heading to the nearest
coffee shop to beat the boredom of laundry, New York writer Emily
Rubin has organised a series of readings called "Dirty Laundry: Loads
of Prose," at laundromats in New York.

"Just mixing laundry and writing seemed completely natural to me
because truly in life and metaphorically as a writer, everyone has
dirty laundry," said the Brooklyn native who started the series last
year.

She contemplated holding the readings in various neighborhood venues
including shops but said a laundromat seemed "a natural fit."

People can wash their dirty laundry while listening to a poem or
short story or just attend the readings. During the first of the 2007
series writer Carolyn Turgeon read some of her work while people
loaded the dryers and washing machines.

"It just makes me feel homey and reading is just sort of part of this
regular thing, if that makes sense," she said, adding that a
laundromat doesn't feel as stuffy or artificial as other venues.

"It feels like you're part of this natural environment," Turgeon
explained.

Author Marie Carter, who moved from Edinburgh, Scotland to New York
in 2000, likes the idea of entertaining people in a laundromat which
is not usually a center of excitement.

Some of the people attending the reading felt a bit odd initially but
got used to the idea.

"It was a little strange, it was kind of wild," said one person.

Rubin, who calls herself "Mistress of Laundry" is planning more
readings at laundromats across New York and is encouraging people to
come along with or without their dirty washing.

The book _Conversations with Steve Lacy_ also has many interesting
discussions of how Lacy related to the poets whose texts he used in
his compositions (Creeley foremost among them, but also Gysin, Taslima
Nasrin, Osip Mandelstam, Anne Waldman, even Herman Melville). Always
wished he would've tackled some of Emily Dickinson's poems. I think
Irene Aebi would be a great person to give voice to them

Besides poems on subways, how else do we share it off the page?


  Poetry, images go public at Louisiana Tech  [http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007702100319]


  Poetry can be hard to find in a public place unless you are at Louisiana Tech University.

  English professor Veronica Schuder's freshmen have taken a unique approach to the concept of service learning by displaying poetry in a major traffic zone.

  The students opened an exhibit of large posters Friday in Tolliver Hall sporting poetry and images compiled by a professional graphic designer. The class posted works by poets Sylvia Plath, Paul Laurence Dunbar, William Blake and Walt Whitman.

  Art education major Allison Reynolds said the project was aimed at trying to get poetry into the minds of people who may not have never given it a chance.

  "We want students to take a minute and reflect on their day," Reynolds said. "We want them to walk by (the exhibit) and stop to think about what is important to them."

  Reynolds said Dunbar's "We Wear the Mask" is one work students should relate to easily.

  "In our day-to-day lives, we put up a fraud," she said. "We go through the motions without making a real connection most days. Reminding people of what can be profound."

  Mechanical engineering major Stephan White said the tendency to think of Shakespeare is one reason poetry can be hard to tackle.

  "It's not just for the upper class," White said. "Poets we study are down-to-earth people that you can relate to."

  Schuder said she hopes the service aspect of the project, showing the work in a public way, will change some students' minds.

  The project also made her students think about poetry in a way that changed how they learned, Schuder said, and the quarter's work left her feeling closer to this class than some previously.

  "My goal was to bring poetry alive for my students — learning poetry shouldn't be about writing down every word that the teacher says," Schuder said. "Having to present this project to people made poetry leap out of the classroom for them."

  The students put in more work than they thought they did, Schuder said. Students had to sort through a list of 50 or more poems to find one they could present, she said.

  "It forced them to be critical of each other in a way they don't normally deal with, as well," Schuder said.

  The posters will hang in Tolliver Hall until mid-March.

i've taped up visual poems and sound scores on telphone poles, trees, mail
boxes, wlls in alleys, sides f dumpeters, inside bathrooms, on backs of
seats in theaters, on friends' cars, pinned or taped up on bulletin boards
any old palce they  have them, at construction sites, just abt any place
someone might find them and enjoy, take home, deface, alter--and let the
weather do its work also--creating new poems in the ongoing processes--

at some sites where boards in dumpsters etc--made paintings on them and left
there--leaning against the sides--

in many places also where exposed patches of ground, made them in the
dirt--and taken found objects and arranged these in grass in parks or
alongside public building areas--as "concrete" "material language" poems,
3-D--shrines, beings--enigmas--

some things are signed--many not --some remian for awhile-days even  few
weeks-many don't--

that way, the poems have lives of their own--freed from any "officially
recognized" framing--

in these lives of their own--they may be found by anyone, or find anyone
themselves--

even on a bus. poems only find themslves among poeple who rides buses--not
walkers, not those who ride only in cars--

and many of the poems don't even need to be "read" in a standardized way
either--so many people who may not read a public poem may be able to
understand them in other ways--visual, tactile--

they may not even some of them be thought of as "poems"--by people not
interested in "poems"--but as something else entirely--yet recognized as a
sign of a communication in their own terms--and understood in all sorts of
myriad other ways--

(much like being a person--maybe known only to onself--"read" in all sorts
of ways during course of a day--may stil know that they are a "poet", the
poems know they are a "poem"--so not worried if "read" myriad other
ways-makes life always much more interesting--)

The voice wants to turn itself into a body.
It can't, though it tries hard--
it brings you flowers, to engender a meaningful
relationship.  It makes you coffee in the morning.
Here, have a cup.
See?  It likes you.  It makes your bed
and shows you this mountain vista out the window
a field of jupiters beard and beyond it
the dying fields.  It shows you things like the sun
going down, and then here it is coming up in the hollyhocks.
Don't look, you'll hurt your eyes.  I want
to be there for you, you never respond
in those moments we touch (but they are not enough).
Let me stroke your hair once more, here,
and again here.  The voice is growing distant
now, it is fading like the sun fades
and explodes in strands of parti-colored fibers
you will never be able to see.

Founded as a reading series at a women¹s radical bookstore in 1999,
Belladonna* is a feminist avant-garde event and publication series that
promotes the work of women writers who are adventurous, politically
involved, multi-form, multicultural, multi-gendered, unpredictable,
dangerous with language (to the death machinery). In its eight year history,
Belladonna* has featured such writers as Julie Patton, kari edwards, Leslie
Scalapino, Alice Notley, Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge,
Cecilia Vicuña, Latasha Natasha Nevada Diggs, Camille Roy, Nicole Brossard,
Abigail Child, Norma Cole, Lydia Davis, Gail Scott, Renee Gladman, Rachel
Blau Duplessis, Marcella Durand and Lila Zemborain along with nearly 100
other experimental and hybrid women writers. The curators promote work that
is explicitly experimental, connects with other art forms, and is
political/critical in content. Alongside the readings, Belladonna* supports
its artists by publishing commemorative chaplets of their work on the night
of the event. Please contact us (Erica Kaufman, Rachel Levitsky, Sina
Queyras et al) at belladonnaseries@yahoo.com to receive a catalog and be
placed on our list.

Dixon Place, a home for performing and literary artists, is dedicated to
supporting the creative process by presenting original works of theater,
dance and literature at various stages of development. An artistic
laboratory with an audience, we serve as a safety net, enabling artists to
present challenging and questioning work that pushes the limits of artistic
expression. With a warm, nurturing atmosphere that encourages and inspires
artists of all stripes and persuasions, we place special emphasis on the
needs of women, people of color, youth, seniors and lesbian/gay artists.
Dixon Place is a local haven for creativity as well as an international
model for the open exploration of the process of creation.  Please visit

Hi all.

  I'm new to this list, so I thought I'd take a moment to introduce myself and then pass along my call for submissions.

  My name is Cati Porter. I live in southern California, and am the mother of two small boys. I'm primarily a poet, though I've also published freelance articles and book reviews. I'm also founder and editor of Poemeleon: A Journal of Poetry (www.poemeleon.org), and contributing editor for Babel, the webzine for the International Cities of Refuge Network (www.ICORN.org). I also belong to Wompo (women's poetry listserv), and as I've been receiving Poetics' e-mails over the past couple of days, I couldn't help but notice that there's some crossover, so some of you might already know me. I probably won't post a whole lot -- my time is pretty divided between the journals and my kids -- but I'm looking forward to joining in the discussion as time permits.

  As for my call for submissions, I'm looking right now for poems in form -- traditional verse forms as well as poems that use form in innovative ways -- for a Poemeleon issue that will launch in June. Previously published is fine as long as you retain all rights and the poems have never before appeared online.

  If you have any questions, feel free to backchannel me.

  Thanks!

  Cati

Swallow & Creeley's "So There" CD is amazing.

Here's an excellent interview with pianist/composer Fred Hersch, regarding
his "Leaves of Grass" project:

The book _Conversations with Steve Lacy_ also has many interesting
discussions of how Lacy related to the poets whose texts he used in
his compositions (Creeley foremost among them, but also Gysin, Taslima
Nasrin, Osip Mandelstam, Anne Waldman, even Herman Melville). Always
wished he would've tackled some of Emily Dickinson's poems. I think
Irene Aebi would be a great person to give voice to them

I used to organize poetry readings at a little run down laundro at 24th &
Lyndale next to Muddy Waters in Minneapolis.  We called in Coin Op Poetry.
The acoustics in that place were great.

I told people to wear their "laundry clothes" -- those beat up old things,
sweats, housedresses, etc. that you only wear while you're doing laundry.
When I got on the bus with my big duffle bag and in my "laundry clothes" I
think people thought I was homeless.  But it does keep people from sitting
by you.

But I digress.

It was hilariously fun, but we only did about 4 months I think and then the
place shut down.  Now it's a consignment/used/hipster clothing store.  Damn.
I need to start that back up.

New literary twist added to laundry cycle
Tue Feb 13, 2007 9:08am ET

NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters Life!) - Doing the laundry has taken on a
new meaning for New Yorkers who can now watch their wash and spin
cycles while listening to poetry and prose.

Instead of burying their head in a book or heading to the nearest
coffee shop to beat the boredom of laundry, New York writer Emily
Rubin has organised a series of readings called "Dirty Laundry: Loads
of Prose," at laundromats in New York.

"Just mixing laundry and writing seemed completely natural to me
because truly in life and metaphorically as a writer, everyone has
dirty laundry," said the Brooklyn native who started the series last
year.

She contemplated holding the readings in various neighborhood venues
including shops but said a laundromat seemed "a natural fit."

People can wash their dirty laundry while listening to a poem or
short story or just attend the readings. During the first of the 2007
series writer Carolyn Turgeon read some of her work while people
loaded the dryers and washing machines.

"It just makes me feel homey and reading is just sort of part of this
regular thing, if that makes sense," she said, adding that a
laundromat doesn't feel as stuffy or artificial as other venues.

"It feels like you're part of this natural environment," Turgeon
explained.

Author Marie Carter, who moved from Edinburgh, Scotland to New York
in 2000, likes the idea of entertaining people in a laundromat which
is not usually a center of excitement.

Some of the people attending the reading felt a bit odd initially but
got used to the idea.

"It was a little strange, it was kind of wild," said one person.

Rubin, who calls herself "Mistress of Laundry" is planning more
readings at laundromats across New York and is encouraging people to
come along with or without their dirty washing.

CALLER AND OTHER PIECES

by Tom Raworth

48 pgs, perfectbound, cover by the author

Caller and Other Pieces is Raworth's first collection since his
Collected Poems of 2003. Comprised of 14 pieces with the long
poem "Caller" at its center, this book evinces a striking
formal and tonal variety-- from the classic Raworth rhythmic
and roving perceptual matrix, to the comedic one-liner, to the
parodic end-rhyme, the visual, and even a bit of nouveau-zaum.
Caller and Other Pieces again demonstrates that Tom Raworth's
accomplishment is essential to the poetry of our time.

*Daouets
http://www.myspace.com/daouets
DAOUETS is a mini-supergroup devised by three musicians who, as tireless
collaborators in New York, wanted a little space for their solo material to
breathe. Switching off instruments, songwriters, and moods with ease, the
group draws on its diverse musical heritage and the diverse talents of its
members.
=20
*The Domestics
http://www.thedomestics.com/
During a brief stint as an A&R assistant, Alina Moscovitz (ex-Bionic Finger=
)
spent her days listening to piles of less-than-stellar demos. She decided
she could do better, so she left the corporate world and returned to
songwriting. She then hooked up with music supervisor and drummer Eric Shaw
(fresh from the break-up of Conquistador which featured Sam Endicott of The
Bravery). They soon lured Evan Silverman (ex-Rosenbergs) away from his jazz
bass lessons in Paris and gigs at the Rainbow Room back to the world of
rock.=20

As a trio, The Domestics morphed into a potent combination of blazing
pop-punk energy, sickeningly catchy hooks, and lyrics that have a sharp wit
and intelligence seldom heard inside of a three-minute song. If Debbie Harr=
y
shoved her way onstage during a Green Day show, the result might sound
something like this.

Besides constantly playing live shows, the Brooklyn-based band wrote the
closing credits song, "Girl I Never Kissed" for the film The D Word,
"Anorexic Love Song" appears on the X-Girls DVD and "Fire Hazard" was
included in the "Say It Don't Spray It" compilation CD packaged with the
Warped Tour DVD. The band has participated in MEANY Fest, International Pop
Overthrow and LadyfestEast festivals. The Domestics are currently recording
a full-length album.
=20
*Dibson T. Hoffweiler
http://dibson.net/
http://www.myspace.com/dibson/
The latest in a long line of quirky anti-folk ingenues, including Beck, Ada=
m
Green and Jeffrey Lewis, Dibs applies that time-honored tradition of
off-beat songwriting to his own private world of sugar factories, laundry
baskets and ducks. With a low voice, both sweet and deadpan, and a
guitar-style both virtuosic and sloppy, Dibson Hoffweiler carves out a spac=
e
of compassion and intelligence in a landscape of boring love songs and
thinly-veiled songwriterly misogyny.
=20
Known for his work in anti-folk flagship bands Cheese On Bread,
Huggabroomstik and Urban Barnyard, Dibs began his cultural life as an
anonymous Moldy Peaches fan. But, after a stint working the soundboard at
the Sidewalk Cafe, and two years generating buzz with his old band, Dibs &
Sara, this Jersey boy established himself as a musical force in his own
right. After several months touring Europe and North America, Dibs has
proved (to himself, and to others) that his bizarre, ramshackle aesthetic i=
s
palatable outside the freaky comfort zone of New York anti-folk.
=20
*Jeffrey Lewis
http://www.thejeffreylewissite.com/
Jeffrey Lewis is a New York City born-and-bred comic book artist as well as
being a local antifolk staple; with or without his band he performs his
unique mix of lo-fi folk, sci-fi punk & hand-illustrated "low-budget videos=
"
regularly around the United States and Europe. As of 2007 he has three
albums out on the venerable indie label Rough Trade and his most recent
comic book series "Fuff" is up to issue #5.
=20
*Limp Richard
http://www.breedingground.com/
Limp Richard (tonight without his backing band, The Disappointments) is
wrapping up  recording of a new LP at Olive Juice.  By the time it's
released, however, it's probably going to have a completely different name.
Just feeling ornery.
=20
*Marianne Pillsbury and The Song Hoes
http://www.mariannepillsbury.com/
Maine native Marianne Pillsbury writes pop-rock songs with cleverly-crafted=
,
hook-laden melodies and brash, witty, tongue-in-cheek lyrics. Released in
2004, her debut album The Wrong Marianne has received enthusiastic reviews
from The New York Times, Time Out New York, The Boston Herald and The San
Francisco Chronicle and elicited comparisons to the best work of Liz Phair,
Juliana Hatfield and Jill Sobule. The album was named a Top 12 DIY Pick in
Performing Songwriter Magazine. The song "Boo Hoo" won Best Alt/Rock Song i=
n
The Great American Song Contest 2004 and was also selected for inclusion on
ROCKRGRL magazine's Discoveries 2005 compilation CD.
=20
*The Olga Gogolas
The itinerant and magisterial Olga Gogolas feature Wayne Waverly on guitar
and vocals, and James Keepnews on bass-synth-noise watch. For this set, the
OG's plan to completely demolish Cobain's original arrangements on six
tracks from Bleach, only to resurrect them like so many false grunge deitie=
s
who stank of junk.
=20
*Renminbi
http://www.renminbinyc.com/
http://www.myspace.com/renminbi
Definitely not for the faint-hearted, we combine stripped-down punk basics
with ass-shaking keyboard grooves and apocalyptic build-ups. Someone else
said it best: "Imagine Polvo fronted by Kim Gordon and you might have a
sense of NYC trio Renminbi's sound. =8A Pitting frenetic drumbeats against
postrock keyboards and angular guitar, Renminbi retain all the concision
without losing an ounce of urgency.=B2
=20
*Schwervon!
http://www.olivejuicemusic.com/schwervon.html
http://www.myspace.com/schwervon
Schwervon! Is a two-piece rock band. Nan and Matt have been a couple longer
than they have been a band. Their relationship influences their art. Their
art influences their relationship. They are two birds of a different
feather. You might say one flies and one rolls and they meet in the middle
with two halves of the worm. They are a collaboration. Is one Sonny and one
Cher? Is one a pop lover and one a noise lover? Why do they both love food
so much? Why are they obsessed with their cat Gummo?
=20
*The Sparrows
http://myspace.com/rachelandrew
Andrew Phillip Tipton met Rachel Talentino in Savannah while working at The
Gap.  A common love for catchy melodies, Carole King, and boys led them to
Brooklyn.  As The Sparrows, Andrew and Rachel make up the cutest anti-folk
duo around! Simple and lovely.
=20
*The Trouble Dolls
http://www.troubledolls.net/
Trouble Dolls are Cheri, Matty, and Chris. They play pop music. They are
from Brooklyn. They do not smoke. Their album "Sticky" is available on Half
a Cow Records. They thank you for coming to see them play.

dear list

the magazine in which Stephen's mom's poem was published - "Everyone's Cup
of Tea #1" - is issue 5 of the Bad Press Serials. If you don't know about
the Serials, then u must familiarize yourself. It's an excellent emerging
run of a journal - not only because the poems in them are brilliant - but
because of the Miscellany at the back of each issue. The Miscellany is a
chronological record of what's happening in poetry and politics, providing
an Essential History of information regarding readings / book releases /
deaths / births / continuations / news items. But more importantly, it
collects discourse from blogs, lists and the editors on particularly
significant events or texts. It's a really useful gathering of discourse and
poetry information.

if you'd like copies, the best way is probably to write Jow Lindsay, one of
the editors:  <franciscrot@gmail.com>. the journal's co-edited by Marianne
Morris and Jonathan Stevenson. PDFs of the 1st and 2nd issues are available
at http://badpress.infinology.net/

Also - each issue of the Serials is a nominal first issue of a 'new
journal', so in order they go like this:

- Bad Press Serials Version 1: He's Asked For Size Ten Arial On This One &
It Goes Over the Edge A Bit BUt If It's Size Ten Arial He Wnats It's Size
Ten Arial He's Getting - #1
- Bad Press Serials Version 2: Verfassungspatriotisthmus - #1
- Bad Press Serials Version 3: Can We Have Our Bell Back - #1
- Bad Press Serials Version 4: Eyes Monthly - #1
- Bad Press Serials Version 5: Everyone's Cup of Tea - #1

the provocation is perhaps that different editorial collectives should edit
these journals' 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc issues. and i'm intending this email as
an invitation for someone to actually do that. such an action would be
exciting and easily recognizable as Responsible.

Bad Press Serials! Subscribe to this journal! Somebody publish an issue 2!

women & bring those words to a larger world. Hope it is greeted warmly.
Women & Children is a great place to begin. Wish you success on your readin=

has been updated with 6 pieces by Jenny Sampirisi.

Poetry rewires brains. This makes it the ideal tool to use for
effecting cultural, social, and political change. Poetry built for the
eye has the added benefit of the slow burn on the retina to help
ensure it really sticks.

Enjoy,

Gabe - very glad to read your piece too and in fact I began something =
with a similar premise last year, but - pardon the pun - never had the =
time to finish it. It's fascinating that something as apparently =
transparent as the passage and recording of time is in fact deeply =
politicized and constitutive of consciousness. Am including the piece I =
was working on, which is fragmentary and incomplete in nature, but rubs =
up nicely against yours I think.

-Ravi=20

Timekeeping  =20

Interrogate the role of the clock in the maintenance of empire.=20

Take the 1884 Prime Meridian Conference. The =93universal=94 hour, =
Greenwich Mean, favors industry to agriculture, punching in to the =
peripatetic, plugged and debugged to poaching like an egg in the =
turbulence of a brass kettle.=20

Nothing nearer than fin de siecle.=20

Spaces gravid with teleological forms. Silences and elisions. Swathes of =
season that know no second hand. Attempts to articulate sanitized =
versions of nomadic culture in corporeal form, as perfected bodies =
strapped to the wrist are subtle acts of terrorism. =20

Scratch marks on bones or sticks with a stone, count the interval =
between phases of the moon, or like the Egyptians watch for Canis Major, =
the Dog Star, to rise approximately when the inundation of the Nile =
begins.=20

Anything with moving hands both disables and enables a spectatorial =
position that cannot be graphed on axes.=20

Gnomons, shadow-casters, combined with scales to produce sundials, =
specially made for different latitudes, status symbols when miniaturized =
during the reign of Augustus Caesar,=20

Drip-drop a precursor to tick-tock a precursor to beep-beep-beep.

Water through a siphon turns a wheel to set a drum marked with lines the =
floating pointer of the clepsydra indicates to show elapse.=20

The moment of marigold feeling elongated into an outer fringe pulled =
taut as a shawl over the eyes, a crouching in a trench where footfall =
had been grown over green and withered to appear again, briefly =
luminescent, not yours but more you than your own embodiment, though all =
desire to possess it vanished, all desire vanished, a stillness where =
motion ceased and you began, where you began with tentative strokes, to =
recollect what in retrospect could not be recreated, was in fact and =
would remain without semblance, what could not be, but was, in fact is.

Astrolabe, star-grasper, instrument of the devil, set of movable plates =
showing ecliptic and meridian, modeled on Hipparchus=92 map that =
imagined a perpendicular line connecting each celestial body to the =
plane of the Earth=92s equator, so location and distance and time were =
discernable.=20
=20
Dram is to scruple is to grain is to fraction of a gram is to measurable =
duration.=20

On the Spanish slave schooner, the Amistad, the ship=92s passengers, =
snatched from Sierra Leone, revolted, sparing only the navigator for his =
sextant, but instead of being returned home, ended up seized by the =
United States Navy, interred in a New Haven jail, were argued over by =
abolitionists and federal courts, were marked Cuban merchandise by the =
Spanish, until, a few years later, accompanied by Christian =
missionaries, they were returned to their village. What would you call =
the passage of time for them contrasted with the lives of those who had =
been left behind?  =20

King Alfred the Great of England credited =93officially=94 with =
inventing graduated candles to divide his day into duties, though for =
centuries previous and into the Sung dynasty, the Chinese calibrated =
sticks of incense to measure time, using sticks of different scents at =
different intervals, so that hours were manifest by shifting fragrance. =
Sandalwood sunrises, jasmine at noon, juniper evenings, myrrh presaging =
dusk, the threads unraveling and dropping into a sounding plate, the air =
charged with passages to read in the nose.

Noon in New York. 				7:00 PM, Cape Town, South Africa=20
1:00 PM, La Paz, Bolivia			8:00 PM in Baghdad, Iraq.
2:00 PM, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil		10:30 PM in Bombay, India=20
5:00 PM, Casablanca, Morocco 		Midnight in Bangkok, Thailand=20
4:00 PM, Reykjavik, Iceland 		1:00 AM, next day, Shanghai, China
6:00 PM, Oslo, Norway 			3:00 AM, next day Melbourne, Australia

Standardization is to make uniform. Uniforms when worn show coherence. =
Are a means of identification. Are markers of a lack of variation, =
diversity or changes in degree. Standardization and uniforms go hand in =
hand. Uniforms and force go hand in hand. Standardization, uniforms and =
force go hand in hand. Commerce trails not far behind.=20

How time slows under intense gravity and increased velocity. The faster =
one goes, the less time passes. Approach the speed of light and live =
forever.=20

I wait for nothing, for nothing will come to pass.=20

Shifting grains in an hourglass, powdered eggshell, marble dust or sand =
slipping away, metaphoric, flowing from one bulb of a glass vessel to =
the other, through a passageway ten times the size of any single =
particle. An hourglass to measure cooking times, municipal meetings, =
speeds at sea, periods of torture.=20

In a verge-and-foliot escapement, gravity is mediated. A weighted rope =
turns a toothed wheel. Controlling the movement of the wheel is a verge =
with pallets at each end. When the wheel turns, the foliot oscillates =
with weights until stopped by the pallets. Back forth, back forth, back =
forth. Nothing measured but movement.=20

Because time is out there, eaten by light. (Norma Cole). The essence of =
nowness runs like fire along the fuse of time (George Santayana).

In the movies, time is abetted by edits. Cut from a plane taking off to =
a plane landing in the same airport. A voyage has been taken, time has =
passed. Cut from a zoom in of a door handle, to the interior of a room: =
space has been moved through, time has passed. Use a montage of images =
to depict passing time; use voiceover to move the action forwards, =
backwards, into the leading edge of the narrative.  Cinematic time, save =
the two hours in a dark theater, is the elaborate construction of a =
fiction. Yet take the projectionist in his dark booth, running a reel =
backwards, so the coffee flows back into the pot, the butter smoothed =
off the toast, the sizzling eggs liquefying then leaping from the pan =
back into eggshells.=20

Time is a form of becoming. Becoming the form of time.=20

Quartz crystals possess piezoelectric charge, vibrate millions of time a =
second when exposed to alternating electrical fields, yet over time, the =
oscillations, due to temperature change, impurity, or decay, lose their =
accuracy, drift, misquote the hour.=20

Between any two instants, there is a third, and between them, another, =
an unquantifiable infinity of them, strung along a linear continuum like =
shrinking beads on an invisible string. =20

Bio:

Sterling Plumpp was born in Clinton, Mississippi. Educated in public and
religious schools, he graduated from high school in 1960 and went on to
attend Roosevelt University in Chicago. Growing up poor in rural
Mississippi, Plumpp worked in the cotton and cornfields and by the time he
was eleven, he was expected to grow up to be a field hand. A bootlegger aunt
had other plans for him, however, and paid for him to attend Holy Ghost High
School in Jackson, Mississippi. Earning a scholarship to a small local
college, Plumpp began his college education, but the scholarship money ran
out, so he hitchhiked to Chicago in 1962. He worked in a post office until
1964, and during that time, he began writing his poetry.

Plumpp saw his first poems published in 1971 in Negro Digest and was hired
to teach English and later African American studies at the University of
Illinois, Chicago. His poetry, often based on blues and jazz rhythms, has
won him numerous awards, including the Richard Wright Literary Excellence
Award, the Carl Sandburg Literary Award for poetry, and three Illinois Arts
Council awards. He has published twelve volumes of his work.

Although it is of course questionable to judge a poet on the basis of one poem, it would seem that if this poem is representative of the style of the whole book, Mr. Jones has been vastly overpaid by the people who gave him one hundred thousand dollars.  I could think of ten living poets right away who deserve this money more.  Many fine poets have barely made $10,000 from their poetry after a lifetime of labor.  Of course that labor is its own reward, but it would be nice if the money landed where it was deserved, for a change.  Regards, Tom Savage

From Potscrubber Lullabies

Potscrubber Lullabies

I

The Potscrubber completes a cycle
so vigorous the knives were rattling,
and pauses, waking Evan Michael,
who finds all silences unsettling.

There's no resemblance. It's too early.
Everything is still so round.
But we've occurred to him as surely
as silence has occurred to sound,

and when he's finished sharpening
into himself, and when we've blurred,
we're going to go on happening
in silence like he's never heard.


II

I wore him like a broken arm
all summer, slung
from my right shoulder in a paisley hammock
so deep the sides closed over him.
When I walked he swung, and slept,
lulled by the time his body kept
against my stomach.
When I stopped I had to sing.







Bird Plays to a Cow


A Swedish musician remembers a drive through farm country in a car
full of musicians, one of whom told Bird that cows love music. Bird
asked the driver to pull over ..." =96 Gary Giddins, Celebrating Bird:
The Triumph of Charlie Parker


Fifty years from now
a writer, writing about me
playing to this cow,
will call the cow "he."
There's her udder, plain
as an udder, and yet . . .
something about what people want
a cow, or an audience, to be.

Some painters haze the foreground
and render something in the middle-distance
unnaturally sharp, to remind the idiot looker
that this is a painting, not a pasture.

The writer will probably do
something self-referential, too,
and will almost certainly call the cow "bewildered."

"Bewildered." As though
I strode out here expecting her to nod
in time or stand on two hooves and applaud.
As though cows stand around waiting for something,
and not just anything, to come along.
Come on. What I do might confuse
you, but this cow was wildered when I got here.

To this cow there is only the plain fact =96


hot fence, sharp fence, shit,
puddle, tuft of grass, golden horn
in the hands of the brown man
who wasn't here this morning and is here now,

and notes, too =96
after so much noise,
the plain fact of song.

My friend,
the bewildered one who's still in the car,
told me that cows dig music.
I choose to believe that. That's what I'm doing here.
She chews. That's what she's doing here.

Hello poetics list,

I'm writing because I am conducting some research on NYC-based poet and
filmmaker Frank Kuenstler (1928-1996). Anthology Film Archives recently
acquired film elements produced by Kuenstler, and we're at a point now
where we're trying to get a sense of the historical context, his
role in the poetry community, and so on.

I understand he was one of the founders of the Eventorium, a poetry and
performance venue in the Upper East Side, that operated in the mid-60's.
Those involved in this scene also produced a short-lived journal called
the "Eventorium Muse." Kuenstler published numerous volumes of poetry,
including LENS through Film Culture, and many others.

Titles by Kuenstler would be especially helpful, as are any
recollections of screenings of his work, or if you may have worked with
him- please let me know, on- or off-list.

If anyone has any information to share, I would greatly appreciate it.
Library research is turning up very little, so any anecdotal information
is especially useful.

Thanks so much.

best,
Lauren Sorensen

Livingstone now lies buried at Westminster Abbey because he “discovered” and
explored Africa, turning what had been “burning solitudes, bleak, and
barren, heated by poisonous winds, infested by snakes and only roamed over
by a few scattered tribes of untameable barbarians” into “a high country,
full of fruit trees, abounding inshade, eatered by a perfect network of
rivers.”*

Jason, et al,

I've been away from email, but want to respond to some of the comments about haiku recently.

To start with, I regard haiku as a genre of poetry, not a form. Form is only one aspect of many aspects of the genre. If you're snide towards form in general, to use your characterization of yourself, then perhaps you don't understand where I'm coming from regarding haiku, because I don't promote any set syllabic form for haiku. So I'm glad to hear that I've persuaded you, at least a little bit, that there's something you're missing out on with haiku. Perhaps others are missing it, too.

Perhaps too, Jason, you've missed my insistence that a poem is a poem first, and a haiku (or not) only secondarily. If a poem moves me, I couldn't give a flying fig for whether it's a haiku or not. So the problem lies with *claiming* something is a haiku when it clearly misses some of haiku's predominant targets. You say "All manner of people have told me that that's not really haiku, to which my only response can be, okay, so what? so what if they're not haiku?" You seem to think I don't agree with you. Yes indeed, so what? Something can be really effective as a short poem, without regard to whether it's a haiku, even if it happens to be 5-7-5 syllables (which I think is irrrelevant to haiku in English, though some people think it IS relevant). This openness (poetry first, labels later, if at all) is one of my guiding priniciples in editing Tundra: The Journal of the Short Poem, whose contributors have included the following (some of these are forthcoming): Francisco X. Alar
con, Art Beck, Robert Bly, John Brandi, Billy Collins, Ruth Daigon, Doc Dachtler, Dick Davis, Diane di Prima, Tom Disch, Jack Foley, Dana Gioia, Jonathan Greene, Jane Hirshfield, H. L. Hix, Ted Kooser, Richard Kostelanetz, Gerald Locklin, Leza Lowitz, Stefanie Marlis, Samuel Menashe, Paul Nelson, Charles Rossiter, Steve Sanfield, Barry Spacks, Robert Spiess, Robert Sward, Susan Terris, Mike Tuggle, Cor van den Heuvel, Ken Waldman, and many others. I provide this list to lend credence, I hope, to the quality of the short poetry I appreciate. Only two or three of the poets I've just listed are haiku writers, and you will also see a wide spectrum of formalists and experimentalists as well. Poetry first.

Indeed, so what if a poem isn't a haiku? The *only* problem is when people claim that such poems ARE haiku if they're not. That's all. So if a person doesn't value haiku much, that's something I'm perfectly fine with. It's just that claiming something as haiku if it's very wide of the mark seems sloppy, and even naive in the extreme, like complaining that one's doggerel isn't accepted for publication at the leading poetry journals, yet insisting that one's doggerel is high art. It's *that* disconnect that strikes me as problematic, for both readers and the writer. I'm simply trying to point out that certain people, even if they're not claiming to be emperors, have no clothes on, yet seem to think they're wearing haiku clothes. At one level, who cares? I would like to hope, though, that POETS care, that EDUCATORS care. To think that something is a haiku when it's not can indeed be problematic. In one sense, it's a delusion. In another sense, it perpetuates misunderstandings fo
r those who might be inclined to take the genre more seriously. I am perfectly happy to respect a lack of interest in haiku, but that's distinct from asserting something is haiku (out of naivete?) when it's not. At the very least, as you say, it's simply using the wrong word to call it haiku, but in my experience I've found that there is sometimes a deeper naivete than just using the wrong word because many people are so adamant and think that haiku is 5-7-5 (which is misguided in English), and nothing more (which is also misguided). It's more than just semantics, at least for many people.

Your experience with learning haiku in school as a 5-7-5 poem is exactly the problem that needs to be corrected. I had the same experience, except it was in high school. The problem lies with the teachers, the curriculum guides, and the textbooks. You are apparently a victim of the problem, and may unwittingly contribute to the perpetuation of the problem. If you hardly cared about haiku, fine, but at least I hope you are now more aware of the issue.

Where you get to a more valuable point is where you say "instead of convincing, all i seem to get from people like you who do think there is that kind of value in this particular set of conventions is a sort of arrogant browbeating." You may indeed be right there, so the difference may lie in my seeing value, and you not. The truth is that I see great value in it for its own sake, as well as great benefit of haiku techniques to other kinds of writing. You don't need haiku to learn these techniques, but haiku isolates and emphasizes certain techniques of clarity, image, implication, and objective/subjective control, so that's why it can be so helpful. But on its own terms, a haiku can be transcendent, producing a spiritual wholeness for many readers. A haiku may not change the world any more than a good joke gives momentary satisfaction, but there is something THERE, and I do think it gives many people more than just the short diversion of a joke. If you're not wired for haiku
, fine (I repeat, that's fine). But for many people, a good haiku lifts the tops of their heads off. There's obviously value in it for a lot of people (hence societies, the many journals, and the 4,000+ haiku books in my library, which are but a portion of what's out there). I appreciate that you're not trying to be adversarial, but neither am I. Yet I'm stuck with observing what really is a great disconnect between the reality and perception of haiku poetry. And of course, I presume on this discussion list that people do care about poetics, and I would like to hope that that can include the poetics of haiku.

Your most excellent point is where you say, "What i'd really like to see is for defenders of the form to make a concerted effort to talk about what it is that they like about it." However, your comment presumes that they haven't done this, whereas I believe they have done this in spades. Consider the five volumes of books that H. F. Noyes has published called "Favorite Haiku," where he does exactly that. By talking about the specific successes of individual poems, the overall gestalt of each of his books is one of why haiku as a genre is successful and appealing. And consider books such as Higginson's *Haiku Handbook* or Gurga's *Haiku: A Poet's Guide*, and several other similar books. This effort is beyond concerted -- it's masterful. The haiku journals regularly include similar commentary as to why haiku is appealing, to the point that it has become old news to those who have been writing in the genre for decades. Yet always there is a new crop for whom it is fresh news, so
 the commentary remains useful. As for me, take a look at my "Becoming a Haiku Poet" essay (http://www.haikuworld.org/begin/mdwelch.apr2003.html) and tell me if that doesn't begin to answer the question for you. Or another essay of interest may be "Haiku and the Japanese Garden," online at http://hometown.aol.com/welchm/Haiku-and-the-Japanese-Garden.html. And speaking of Lee Gurga, he has a fine essay on haiku aesthetics at http://www.baymoon.com/~ariadne/form/haiku/haiku.aesthetics.gurga.htm (scroll down a bit). He begins by asking a very sensible question of those who have been writing haiku: "It is unavoidable that we should have some idea of what haiku is. The question then becomes what kind of an idea should it be?"

What is it I like about haiku? There are so many ways to answer that question, but for me haiku is an approach to infinity, in the way it creates a sense of wholeness and rightness by the careful emotive pairing of juxtaposed elements. The seasonal context adds archetypal meaning and a setting to the poem, but the main technique of implication -- somehow saying the unsaid -- allows reader engagement more than some other types of poetry, or at least in a more concentrated way. No wonder, for good reason, haiku is called an "unfinished poem." I've not heard that said of other genres of poetry. The world of allusion that goes on in good haiku is also an appeal. This is no different from other poetry, of course, but it's a richness that many casual readers of haiku (or those who read only pseudo-haiku) often don't notice.

A selection of my haiku (with photographs) is online at http://www.brooksbookshaiku.com/welch/. Many of these poems are among my favourites (at least up until about 2000, when this online collection was published).

It is not my preference to refer to "fake" haiku, versus "real" haiku, though I do like to paraphrase Robert Creeley: "Is that a real haiku, or did you write it yourself?" But I agree that it would be better to spend more attention on what makes the best haiku succeed, rather than dwell on what makes other things fail as haiku. However, I believe the conversation with many poets often has to start with unlearning. They have to back up from the wrong path they've taken, or at least be open to the possibility that they're on the wrong path. Perhaps only then does talking about what makes a good haiku work become more plausible. At least, that's my speculation. But I think it's accurate. The assumptions some people have about haiku are so deeply ingrained that it's hard for them to even begin to appreciate attempts to promote successful haiku.

Ultimately, Jason, I'm delighted that you've ordered Lee Gurga's book. If that's the limit of your exploration of haiku, that's fine by me. But you are going a world farther than most people. I'm just trying to open the door, even if just a little bit.

Subject: Re: Haiku dumbness / snobbishness
Well, i think the real issue is one of investment and value. You're a person who has devoted a considerable amount of time and energy into a poetic
form, and as such that form has a value for you that it simply doesn't for me, as a person who generally is a little bit snide towards the idea of
form from the get go. I think where the disconnect takes place is that you're mistaking a lack of interest in the minutiae of something that you say
is complex (i'm not saying it's not complex, just that i don't know enough about it to be able to affirm or deny) for naivete, which is a little bit
insulting. I can maybe illustrate with my own experience writing haiku. Like most people at some point in the third or fourth grade, my language arts
teacher introduced the idea of syllables, as well as the idea of poems that don't possess end rhyme, by talking about these short little japanese
poems called haiku that have a 5-7-5 syllable pattern. I think for most people that's the beginning and end of the interest in the form. I know that
it has been largely for me. I've written all manner of poems in a 5-7-5 formula, and all manner of people have told me that that's not really haiku,
to which my only response can be, okay, so what? so what if they're not haiku? if i don't know what the real purpose of a haiku is, and what the real
goal is, and am in fact trying to achieve some other goal and mistakenly calling it haiku, i'm not being naive, i'm just using the wrong word. So i
stop calling it haiku, and we can go about our lives happily enough never discussing it again. However, there's something very peculiar about in
particular the haiku booster that really rubs me the wrong way. almost like some people take a sort of obscene pleasure in "correcting" the mistake of
the less informed. at some point it becaomes as trivial a matter as whether kirk or picard were a superior starship captain.

so what i'm saying is, i think what in your messages has gotten my back up a bit is the way it's expressed in such an accusatory and aloof manner, as
if haiku is the only way to write a short poem, and that if one is working at the length of haiku there can't possibly be a goal higher than in
realizing the conventions of haiku. being mainly an anti formalist and against the idea of poetic form that can't be expressed in a number of words
fewer than the form permits the poem, i'm skeptical of such claims from the outset. So it takes some convincing for me to buy in to the idea that
there really is something in this constructed form which genuinely warrants societies being dedicated to it, magazines devoted to it, and books
written exploring teh depth of it. But instead of convincing, all i seem to get from people like you who do think there is that kind of value in this
particular set of conventions is a sort of arrogant browbeating about how i don't know anything about the subject and that if i want to talk about it,
i really need to do my homework.

Well fine, i say, i hate homework so lets just not talk about it. Let teh haiku snob wallow in his penny-ante beat, and i'll roll my eyes and move on
to something that i think genuinely is of value.

If that makes sense, and I promise you i'm not trying to be adversarial, just trying to sort through the array of emotions and their instigations in
the thread about haiku to date that prompted me to dispatch a snarky email. If you really want my opinion, this last email has gone a longer way
towards getting me interested in haiku than your previous emails which seemed largely concerned with showing how some poems claiming to be haiku are
not in fact.

What i'd really like to see is for defenders of the form to make a concerted effort to talk about what it is that they like about it. What is it about
the seasonal words and juxtapositions that you find in haiku that make them so essential and raises this above other forms like, for example, an
aubade? I think maybe you'd get farther with snide jackasses like me if you focussed more on the positive argument for real haiku rather than the
negative argument against fake haiku. Because i generally don't find things that are defined primarily by contrast to things which they are not to be
particularly interesting. birds are cool because they have wings, not because they don't have gills, y'know?

All of that having been said, i want to let you know that I really appreciate the sincerity and tone of your last email, and I want you to know that
by it, you've aroused a curiosity in me about the form that did not exist when i snarkily suggest that haiku be relegated to mystery cults. There's
very little as effective as the sincere expression of passion for a topic to make another person sympathetic to investigating it. I've ordered Gurga's
book, and am looking forward to reading it. I don't know if i'll become a haiku fanatic, or even if i'll ever try to write a haiku, but you've swayed
me to thinking that maybe there's something i'm missing out on, and that's a tactic that is very effective with me.

Barry, I don't consider myself a formalist with haiku, except in the sense of being aware of valuable techniques (not forms) that are effective to use -- if you want to consider that "formal." I have been labeled a traditionalist by the more avant-garde, and a nontraditionalist by the deeply traditional. But whatever the case may be, I myself don't think of my approach as formalist, especially since I don't count syllables with the bulk of my haiku.

In fact, I encourage a great deal of innovation in haiku. And I preach that "no one owns haiku." Innovation for its own sake doesn't have a great lot of appeal to me (in the extreme, it can devolve into purely having shock value, or having little substance, though sometimes it can make you think or shake you out of habits), but innovation from a perspective is a grander thing, at least for me. What the sumo wrestler or a boxer can do within the ring is the art of the fight. It's the art of any sport to be creative within the confines of the rules. A sport without rules is no longer a sport. And yet what freedom most sports have. And all poetry has *some* sorts of rules imposed on it (by the writer, if not someone else), and these can be as fundamental as writing in lines, in English, with generally normal spelling. Basic rules may or may not include these (but will probably include others), but out of it comes great variety and creativity. I'm all for it.

As soon as you get into a genre, though, at what point is a poem a haiku, and when is it not? Let the haiku pundits worry about the exact point of divergence if you will. But there is at least a difference. There is a point where a haiku is not a haiku, and a sonnet is not a sonnet, where free verse is not free (no verse is ever really free, as we know), and where experimental poetry is rooted in tradition, and so on. (Cummings typographical experiments masked a great many poems that were fairly traditional sonnets, for example.)

I have no problem with altering a form's constraints (whether haiku or sonnet), to use Joe Amato's words. But this is an act of *altering* the constraints, not being ignorant of them. It is harsh to suppose that someone is ignorant of them. But let us suppose that some people are, and offer "haiku" to the world. They are not "altering" the constraints at all. To paraphrase Basho, only when you know the rules can you begin to alter them.

Dan, I appreciate your comment: "Speaking only of the haiku form, it seems to have gotten a particularly bad,
trivializing, rap. There are so many haikus out there that are atrocious, and rather than see the atrociousness of the poem as a singular (repeated many times over) occurrence, the form itself gets triviailized, Hallmarkized." I would only add that there are equally many atrocious poems out there in other forms (or no particular form). Or as Joe said, "atrocious poetry of any stripe ought to be called out for what it is." It's just that the atrociousness of those particular attempts at haiku has gotten associated with the genre itself, thus giving the genre an unfair rap. By the way, in the haiku community, it's a no-no to write a "Hallmark" haiku. No disparagement of Hallmark meant, naturally, but there's a difference between poetry and sentiment.

Regarding my critique of "Golf Haiku," Eric wrote "Thanks to MDW for taking the time to write such a thoughtful critique of my haiku. Though you missed my intention -- which was merely to knock off something silly -- your criticism was excellent. It helped me to understand the form and tradition of a proper haiku. Honest criticism is rare enough, but honest and extensive criticism is both rare and rewarding." I appreciate the kind words. I wish that people weren't so intent at "knocking off something silly," which seems to happen so often with haiku. I don't mean to pick on you with this comment, Eric. Just making a general statement that your poem and comment has prompted.

Dan Zimmerman offered three new haiku, each of which have strong, essentially objective images, and the first one has a juxtapositional structure:

fog on the river / docked boats jostle / on the changing tide
after the blizzard / shovelers pitch snow / only so high
my newspaper / too wet from the snowbank / to read today

There is such a difference between these, as haiku, than some of the previous poems posted here, that are not haiku. That does NOT mean the above three are better poems, though. That's a separate matter.

Thanks, too, Jason, for your comments on Japanese. My understanding is that "onji" isn't quite the right word ("on" is apparently more accurate, pronounced something like "own" but quicker), but thanks for emphasizing the difference between syllables and on. (See "Stalking the Wild Onji" for Richard Gilbert's exploration of the term "onji" and its problems -- online at http://www.iyume.com/research/onji/onji1.html.) "Haiku" has two syllables, but three on. "Basho" too. As you say, Jason, "where we are listening for syllables, the japanese are listening for mora, or onji [on], and the syllable is a slightly larger unit than a mora." Koji Kawamoto, as I think I've mentioned before, has a definitive essay on this subject in the appendix to his book *The Poetics of Japanese Verse* (University of Tokyo Press). (By the way, Jason, since you quoted one of Jack McCarthy's haiku, Jack and I have discussed haiku together here in Seattle, where I was featured poet (but not a competitor)
 for the 2005 and 2006 haiku slams. Jack won the 2005 Seattle haiku slam, and was second last year. I think he knows how his poems differ from the traditional aesthetics of haiku. I also recognize what he is doing, which, to some degree, is responding to what people THINK a haiku should be, for better or worse. Jack will also be a featured reader next month in the SoulFood Poetry Night series that I curate in Redmond, Washington. I hope that says something.)

Subject: Re: haiku
I think Joe's point is well taken. While this discussion has been very instructive in many ways, we should not forget that this is list whose topic is innovative poetics. I'm sure there are other lists available for the promulgation of traditionalist poetics, and some of the same people might even be on both lists, since there is no reason not to be interested in both. But to the extent that we are not, at some point we just have to respectfully agree to disagree, letting the discussions of traditionalist poetics continue in whatever space is devoted to that and the discussions of innovative poetics, whatever that turns out to be, move forward in this one.

  As for myself, I think that a good deal of that heat that's been generated here hasto do with the "ownership" of the name "haiku." Although it would be useful to me to have recourse to this name at certain times, it doesn't really mean as much to me as it obviously does to some others, and therefore I'd just as soon cede it to them. I don't know why, but somehow this all reminds me of the dispute between Greece and one of the former Yugoslav republics over the name "Macedonia." United Nations intervention has still not resolved this issue. But when I lived in Italy, "macedonia" (small m) was the word for "fruit salad"--an association with very positive connotations as far as I'm concerned. So from now on I am going to avoid the use of the h-word to refer to any poem using a 5-7-5 structure or any other similar short poem whatsoever, except where this is unavoidable, such as when citing something that someone else said. From now on, I promise to refer to all such poems as  "
macedonia."

I took Japanese for three years in highschool, and while i'm far from fluent, I do have some recall of of the issues revolving around this because it's some of the hardest stuff involving correct pronunciation, and my drill instructor japanese teacher ground them into our heads. I think she was more concerned with our pronouncing the language properly than understanding it. Basically, japanese syllable weight is determined by the onji, and accents happen in pitch rather than in syllable weight. So what you get often times is syllables getting shortened or lengthened so that the on fit the timing, because they shorten vowels that we normally hear as double vowels, because English is stress-timed and so syllable length isn't something that we contemplate a lot it just sort of happens by convention. Not so in japanese, the on are all the same length, so syllables will vary in length depending on how many on are in it. So for example in "ikimasho" (japanese for "let us go"), ther
e are four syllables i-ki-ma-sho, but there are five on i-ki-ma-shy-o, all of which get the same amount of time. similarly with desu and the irregular verb form masu, the [u] vowel is generally a long vowel in English, whereas with japanese all vowels have long and short versions and so their terminal u's sound really chopped to western ears because they have to be distinguished from a longer vowel and a different meaning (i don't know if desoo or masoo are other words or if it would just sound like nonsense to a native speaker.) Once i got used to listening to it, it became apparent that the shortening of "su" that i thought i was hearing, while it doesn't happen, it wasn't nearly as pronounced as i thought it was because it was very similar to the su that one finds in the beginning of a word like "sushi" as it is pronounced in japanese (a slight but noticable difference from its English Cognate), or the shortened version in "sukoshi" (a small quantity, from which the Englis
h Scosh is derived). the [u] is always still there, but i think as English speakers what happens is that we mutate the foreign sounding vowels that we don't generally use into to consonant codas and our ears then turn something like "sukoshi" or "sukiyaki" into "scoshii" or "skyaki." Most japanese speakers can hear the difference and the dropped syllables, but English speakers have to learn to listen for it. I even vaguely remember my teacher saying that one of the signs of an american accent when speaking japanese is either dropping vowels or making vowels too long. so an american might render "kore wa usagi deshitaka" (was that a rabbit) as "Cord wa oozagy deshtaka" writing phonetically. The difference of course beign that where we are listening for syllables, the japanese are listening for mora, or onji, and the syllable is a slightly larger unit than a mora.

I'm surprised i remember that many words, but i'm starting to think maybe i should go take a night class in japanese since so much of the fundamentals still seem to be there.

Thanks Murat and Ravi.

And, Ravi, thanks for forwarding yr v cool musings about the watch.

The gender politics of time are kinda fascinating and have a lot to do,
I think, with the gender politics of pockets. EG, the wristwatch,
invented 1868, was at first seen as a woman's accessory. It wasn't
really until WWI, when the wristwatch was used in the trenches (easier
to look at the wrist than to root around for one's pocket watch). Later
it was used by trench officers and artillery officers to coordinate
attacks and troop movements -- at which point all European armies began
mass producing them. The troops, at war's end, took the watches home
with them. In many ways, the popularity of the wristwatch among men owes
something to trench warfare and to the expediency of not busying a hand
by dipping i  into a pocket.

Men and women first wore watches around their necks. Then men began
putting them in vest pockets (in 1675), while women kept them on their
necks or on waist belts (see paintings of Wm Hogarth). Then women put
them on their wrists (1868) while men kept them in their pockets. I
don't know what the deal is with women's fashion and the "no pocket"
custom, but it's kind of fascinating how even now women's clothing has
far fewer pockets than men's.

The gender politics of the pocket is really fascinating: has something,
i guess, to do with forced domestication of women: keeping them at home,
pretending that they have no life of real "utility" (are pockets
construed as utilitarian?). Time was fashioned/coded as utilitarian
concept?

Hi Gabriel,
There's an incredible section of Jamaica Kinkaid's A Small Island on tourism
in the Caribbean, specifically her native Antigua, in which she speaks of

Curious to remember in the sixties when many of us stopped wearing watches,
at all. As in who wanted to march to the corporate drum, it's terrible,
regimented, soul killing clock. (I don't know if that has changed!) And, in
light of Gabriel's militarismo connection, who wanted to go to Vietnam and
wear a watch in a trench or, to go on a "well-timed" bombing mission. The
wrist watch seemed synchronized with death on all levels (public, personal
and spiritual). (There was the late sixties, Chamber's Brother's song,
"Time Has Come Today, young hearts can go their way
 Can't put it off another day I don't care what others say ...
 with the haunting refrain:  'Time' 'Time', 'Time'.  Which seemed to be much
more than about romance, and more about beating back the clock)

But the reference, too, to the pocket, the lack of them on women's
vestments. The pocket book was first created by Aldus in Venice -who created
italic type to fit the format - in the sixteenth century. (I believe his
first pocketbooks were for the works of Virgil and Horace.)  But clearly -
through the whole history of the "pocketbook", the pocketbooks have never
fit into women's clothes (that I know of). Women had to, and probably still
have to, be in male drag to put a book in a pocket - say a trench coat,
popular among young women in the sixties . (woops, "trenchcoat" = military
connection, again). Well, certain larger purses and backpacks do
accommodate.

As Gloria Frym brings up, the history of the Europe and the west altering
concepts of time in the colonies is also interesting. The Igbos in Nigeria,
for example, had a four day week - one that coincided with market days, I
believe.  Europe and Christianity and capitalism brought the 7 day week. I
think this scenario of expanding days played out across Latin America as
well.

The clock is capitalism's bazooka -  someone said that. And religion's  -
Christ and his cathedral bells.

Course, inevitably, in terms of poetry, this all plays into arguments around
the tick-tock yoke of formalism, and related repressive political
formations. (John Cage and Steve Reich, for examples, seem to be all about
breaching that western formal sense of time).

Actually - to indulge a contradiction here - a well-used clock may liberate
much interesting work and play, and poems, too.

Go, Gabriel - fourth down and ten to goal and 15 seconds left on the clock.

hrm, i want to understand. you're getting close to me getting it with your talk of genre. but still you're a little too vague for me. genre to me
implies that some things can be more haiku like, that there are some things that might be borderline cases of haiku, and THAT strikes me as very
interesting.

So I'm curious, are any of these four things haiku?

rain on
march flush
on the student body

warm santa
ana crumples silver
paper

a cotton lycra weave lifts
from plants it catches

green
colors
wax

  i'd like to know what you would consider a fringe case, because such things really interest me and thinking of haiku as genre rather than form feels
a bit epiphanic. so thanks.

oh, and as for the point about making a concerted effort to praise haiku rather than say what it isn't, i was referring more to comments in these
threads. I'm sure there are all manner of excellent books, i just thought that the tone of the conversation on the poetics list seemed overly focussed
on why some things aren't haiku rather than why other things are.

> To start with, I regard haiku as a genre of poetry, not a form. Form is only one aspect of many aspects of the genre. If you're snide towards form in general, to use your characterization of yourself, then perhaps you don't understand where I'm coming from regarding haiku, because I don't promote any set syllabic form for haiku. So I'm glad to hear that I've persuaded you, at least a little bit, that there's something you're missing out on with haiku. Perhaps others are missing it, too.
>
> Perhaps too, Jason, you've missed my insistence that a poem is a poem first, and a haiku (or not) only secondarily. If a poem moves me, I couldn't give a flying fig for whether it's a haiku or not. So the problem lies with *claiming* something is a haiku when it clearly misses some of haiku's predominant targets. You say "All manner of people have told me that that's not really haiku, to which my only response can be, okay, so what? so what if they're not haiku?" You seem to think I don't agree with you. Yes indeed, so what? Something can be really effective as a short poem, without regard to whether it's a haiku, even if it happens to be 5-7-5 syllables (which I think is irrrelevant to haiku in English, though some people think it IS relevant). This openness (poetry first, labels later, if at all) is one of my guiding priniciples in editing Tundra: The Journal of the Short Poem, whose contributors have included the following (some of these are forthcoming): Francisco X.

I provide this list to lend credence, I hope, to the quality of the short poetry I appreciate. Only two or three of the poets I've just listed are haiku writers, and you will also see a wide spectrum of formalists and experimentalists as well. Poetry first.
>
> Indeed, so what if a poem isn't a haiku? The *only* problem is when people claim that such poems ARE haiku if they're not. That's all. So if a person doesn't value haiku much, that's something I'm perfectly fine with. It's just that claiming something as haiku if it's very wide of the mark seems sloppy, and even naive in the extreme, like complaining that one's doggerel isn't accepted for publication at the leading poetry journals, yet insisting that one's doggerel is high art. It's *that* disconnect that strikes me as problematic, for both readers and the writer. I'm simply trying to point out that certain people, even if they're not claiming to be emperors, have no clothes on, yet seem to think they're wearing haiku clothes. At one level, who cares? I would like to hope, though, that POETS care, that EDUCATORS care. To think that something is a haiku when it's not can indeed be problematic. In one sense, it's a delusion. In another sense, it perpetuates misunderstandings
 fo
> r those who might be inclined to take the genre more seriously. I am perfectly happy to respect a lack of interest in haiku, but that's distinct from asserting something is haiku (out of naivete?) when it's not. At the very least, as you say, it's simply using the wrong word to call it haiku, but in my experience I've found that there is sometimes a deeper naivete than just using the wrong word because many people are so adamant and think that haiku is 5-7-5 (which is misguided in English), and nothing more (which is also misguided). It's more than just semantics, at least for many people.
>
> Your experience with learning haiku in school as a 5-7-5 poem is exactly the problem that needs to be corrected. I had the same experience, except it was in high school. The problem lies with the teachers, the curriculum guides, and the textbooks. You are apparently a victim of the problem, and may unwittingly contribute to the perpetuation of the problem. If you hardly cared about haiku, fine, but at least I hope you are now more aware of the issue.
>
> Where you get to a more valuable point is where you say "instead of convincing, all i seem to get from people like you who do think there is that kind of value in this particular set of conventions is a sort of arrogant browbeating." You may indeed be right there, so the difference may lie in my seeing value, and you not. The truth is that I see great value in it for its own sake, as well as great benefit of haiku techniques to other kinds of writing. You don't need haiku to learn these techniques, but haiku isolates and emphasizes certain techniques of clarity, image, implication, and objective/subjective control, so that's why it can be so helpful. But on its own terms, a haiku can be transcendent, producing a spiritual wholeness for many readers. A haiku may not change the world any more than a good joke gives momentary satisfaction, but there is something THERE, and I do think it gives many people more than just the short diversion of a joke. If you're not wired for ha
iku
> , fine (I repeat, that's fine). But for many people, a good haiku lifts the tops of their heads off. There's obviously value in it for a lot of people (hence societies, the many journals, and the 4,000+ haiku books in my library, which are but a portion of what's out there). I appreciate that you're not trying to be adversarial, but neither am I. Yet I'm stuck with observing what really is a great disconnect between the reality and perception of haiku poetry. And of course, I presume on this discussion list that people do care about poetics, and I would like to hope that that can include the poetics of haiku.
>
> Your most excellent point is where you say, "What i'd really like to see is for defenders of the form to make a concerted effort to talk about what it is that they like about it." However, your comment presumes that they haven't done this, whereas I believe they have done this in spades. Consider the five volumes of books that H. F. Noyes has published called "Favorite Haiku," where he does exactly that. By talking about the specific successes of individual poems, the overall gestalt of each of his books is one of why haiku as a genre is successful and appealing. And consider books such as Higginson's *Haiku Handbook* or Gurga's *Haiku: A Poet's Guide*, and several other similar books. This effort is beyond concerted -- it's masterful. The haiku journals regularly include similar commentary as to why haiku is appealing, to the point that it has become old news to those who have been writing in the genre for decades. Yet always there is a new crop for whom it is fresh news,
 so
>  the commentary remains useful. As for me, take a look at my "Becoming a Haiku Poet" essay (http://www.haikuworld.org/begin/mdwelch.apr2003.html) and tell me if that doesn't begin to answer the question for you. Or another essay of interest may be "Haiku and the Japanese Garden," online at http://hometown.aol.com/welchm/Haiku-and-the-Japanese-Garden.html. And speaking of Lee Gurga, he has a fine essay on haiku aesthetics at http://www.baymoon.com/~ariadne/form/haiku/haiku.aesthetics.gurga.htm (scroll down a bit). He begins by asking a very sensible question of those who have been writing haiku: "It is unavoidable that we should have some idea of what haiku is. The question then becomes what kind of an idea should it be?"
>
> What is it I like about haiku? There are so many ways to answer that question, but for me haiku is an approach to infinity, in the way it creates a sense of wholeness and rightness by the careful emotive pairing of juxtaposed elements. The seasonal context adds archetypal meaning and a setting to the poem, but the main technique of implication -- somehow saying the unsaid -- allows reader engagement more than some other types of poetry, or at least in a more concentrated way. No wonder, for good reason, haiku is called an "unfinished poem." I've not heard that said of other genres of poetry. The world of allusion that goes on in good haiku is also an appeal. This is no different from other poetry, of course, but it's a richness that many casual readers of haiku (or those who read only pseudo-haiku) often don't notice.
>
> A selection of my haiku (with photographs) is online at http://www.brooksbookshaiku.com/welch/. Many of these poems are among my favourites (at least up until about 2000, when this online collection was published).
>
> It is not my preference to refer to "fake" haiku, versus "real" haiku, though I do like to paraphrase Robert Creeley: "Is that a real haiku, or did you write it yourself?" But I agree that it would be better to spend more attention on what makes the best haiku succeed, rather than dwell on what makes other things fail as haiku. However, I believe the conversation with many poets often has to start with unlearning. They have to back up from the wrong path they've taken, or at least be open to the possibility that they're on the wrong path. Perhaps only then does talking about what makes a good haiku work become more plausible. At least, that's my speculation. But I think it's accurate. The assumptions some people have about haiku are so deeply ingrained that it's hard for them to even begin to appreciate attempts to promote successful haiku.
>
> Ultimately, Jason, I'm delighted that you've ordered Lee Gurga's book. If that's the limit of your exploration of haiku, that's fine by me. But you are going a world farther than most people. I'm just trying to open the door, even if just a little bit.

Furthermore, I want to thank you for linking to that essay by Gurga. While I think i disagree with a lot of what he says, being generally skeptical of
  ideas like "poetic truth" etc., there's certainly a lot to think about. More importantly though, I think that in his treatment of "zappai" we have a
possible resolution for the issue of "fake haiku" that's been the focus of the discussion on the list over the last couple of weeks.

Particularly his statement here:
"While the term zappai is unfamiliar to most American students of haiku, I believe its adoption will provide us with a useful category to help us
understand that while much of what is being written today under the name of haiku is not genuine haiku, it is still a legitimate part of the haikai
tradition. Those who object to the introduction of this term might simply want to use the term "pseudo-haiku" to categorize the poems I am describing
here."

makes a lot of sense to me. Certainly calling a poem like this:

Worker bees can leave,
Even drones can fly away.
The Queen is their slave.

a haiku is a mistake. But still, i don't think chuck palahniuks little doggerel would exist if haiku didn't, and the idea of seeing a seventeen
syllable quip like that as part of a larger haiku tradition makes sense. I wonder if whether or not some of the american confusion about what a haiku
is doesn't have something to do with what Gurga says was a popular form of poetic entertainment in late Edo Japan, particularly since the late Edo
period marks the first really extensive cultural cross pollinaztion between japan and the west.

then again, i do like the idea of calling them macedonia too. no reason, of course, they can't be both.

If you're snide towards form in general, to use your characterization of yourself, then perhaps you don't understand where I'm coming from regarding haiku, because I don't promote any set syllabic form for haiku. So I'm glad to hear that I've persuaded you, at least a little bit, that there's something you're missing out on with haiku. Perhaps others are missing it, too.
>
> Perhaps too, Jason, you've missed my insistence that a poem is a poem first, and a haiku (or not) only secondarily. If a poem moves me, I couldn't give a flying fig for whether it's a haiku or not. So the problem lies with *claiming* something is a haiku when it clearly misses some of haiku's predominant targets. You say "All manner of people have told me that that's not really haiku, to which my only response can be, okay, so what? so what if they're not haiku?" You seem to think I don't agree with you. Yes indeed, so what? Something can be really effective as a short poem, without regard to whether it's a haiku, even if it happens to be 5-7-5 syllables (which I think is irrrelevant to haiku in English, though some people think it IS relevant). This openness (poetry first, labels later, if at all) is one of my guiding priniciples in editing Tundra: The Journal of the Short Poem, whose contributors have included the following (some of these are forthcoming): Francisco X.

I provide this list to lend credence, I hope, to the quality of the short poetry I appreciate. Only two or three of the poets I've just listed are haiku writers, and you will also see a wide spectrum of formalists and experimentalists as well. Poetry first.
>
> Indeed, so what if a poem isn't a haiku? The *only* problem is when people claim that such poems ARE haiku if they're not. That's all. So if a person doesn't value haiku much, that's something I'm perfectly fine with. It's just that claiming something as haiku if it's very wide of the mark seems sloppy, and even naive in the extreme, like complaining that one's doggerel isn't accepted for publication at the leading poetry journals, yet insisting that one's doggerel is high art. It's *that* disconnect that strikes me as problematic, for both readers and the writer. I'm simply trying to point out that certain people, even if they're not claiming to be emperors, have no clothes on, yet seem to think they're wearing haiku clothes. At one level, who cares? I would like to hope, though, that POETS care, that EDUCATORS care. To think that something is a haiku when it's not can indeed be problematic. In one sense, it's a delusion. In another sense, it perpetuates misunderstandings
 fo
> r those who might be inclined to take the genre more seriously. I am perfectly happy to respect a lack of interest in haiku, but that's distinct from asserting something is haiku (out of naivete?) when it's not. At the very least, as you say, it's simply using the wrong word to call it haiku, but in my experience I've found that there is sometimes a deeper naivete than just using the wrong word because many people are so adamant and think that haiku is 5-7-5 (which is misguided in English), and nothing more (which is also misguided). It's more than just semantics, at least for many people.
>
> Your experience with learning haiku in school as a 5-7-5 poem is exactly the problem that needs to be corrected. I had the same experience, except it was in high school. The problem lies with the teachers, the curriculum guides, and the textbooks. You are apparently a victim of the problem, and may unwittingly contribute to the perpetuation of the problem. If you hardly cared about haiku, fine, but at least I hope you are now more aware of the issue.
>
> Where you get to a more valuable point is where you say "instead of convincing, all i seem to get from people like you who do think there is that kind of value in this particular set of conventions is a sort of arrogant browbeating." You may indeed be right there, so the difference may lie in my seeing value, and you not. The truth is that I see great value in it for its own sake, as well as great benefit of haiku techniques to other kinds of writing. You don't need haiku to learn these techniques, but haiku isolates and emphasizes certain techniques of clarity, image, implication, and objective/subjective control, so that's why it can be so helpful. But on its own terms, a haiku can be transcendent, producing a spiritual wholeness for many readers. A haiku may not change the world any more than a good joke gives momentary satisfaction, but there is something THERE, and I do think it gives many people more than just the short diversion of a joke. If you're not wired for ha
iku
> , fine (I repeat, that's fine). But for many people, a good haiku lifts the tops of their heads off. There's obviously value in it for a lot of people (hence societies, the many journals, and the 4,000+ haiku books in my library, which are but a portion of what's out there). I appreciate that you're not trying to be adversarial, but neither am I. Yet I'm stuck with observing what really is a great disconnect between the reality and perception of haiku poetry. And of course, I presume on this discussion list that people do care about poetics, and I would like to hope that that can include the poetics of haiku.
>
> Your most excellent point is where you say, "What i'd really like to see is for defenders of the form to make a concerted effort to talk about what it is that they like about it." However, your comment presumes that they haven't done this, whereas I believe they have done this in spades. Consider the five volumes of books that H. F. Noyes has published called "Favorite Haiku," where he does exactly that. By talking about the specific successes of individual poems, the overall gestalt of each of his books is one of why haiku as a genre is successful and appealing. And consider books such as Higginson's *Haiku Handbook* or Gurga's *Haiku: A Poet's Guide*, and several other similar books. This effort is beyond concerted -- it's masterful. The haiku journals regularly include similar commentary as to why haiku is appealing, to the point that it has become old news to those who have been writing in the genre for decades. Yet always there is a new crop for whom it is fresh news,
 so
>  the commentary remains useful. As for me, take a look at my "Becoming a Haiku Poet" essay (http://www.haikuworld.org/begin/mdwelch.apr2003.html) and tell me if that doesn't begin to answer the question for you. Or another essay of interest may be "Haiku and the Japanese Garden," online at http://hometown.aol.com/welchm/Haiku-and-the-Japanese-Garden.html. And speaking of Lee Gurga, he has a fine essay on haiku aesthetics at http://www.baymoon.com/~ariadne/form/haiku/haiku.aesthetics.gurga.htm (scroll down a bit). He begins by asking a very sensible question of those who have been writing haiku: "It is unavoidable that we should have some idea of what haiku is. The question then becomes what kind of an idea should it be?"
>
> What is it I like about haiku? There are so many ways to answer that question, but for me haiku is an approach to infinity, in the way it creates a sense of wholeness and rightness by the careful emotive pairing of juxtaposed elements. The seasonal context adds archetypal meaning and a setting to the poem, but the main technique of implication -- somehow saying the unsaid -- allows reader engagement more than some other types of poetry, or at least in a more concentrated way. No wonder, for good reason, haiku is called an "unfinished poem." I've not heard that said of other genres of poetry. The world of allusion that goes on in good haiku is also an appeal. This is no different from other poetry, of course, but it's a richness that many casual readers of haiku (or those who read only pseudo-haiku) often don't notice.
>
> A selection of my haiku (with photographs) is online at http://www.brooksbookshaiku.com/welch/. Many of these poems are among my favourites (at least up until about 2000, when this online collection was published).
>
> It is not my preference to refer to "fake" haiku, versus "real" haiku, though I do like to paraphrase Robert Creeley: "Is that a real haiku, or did you write it yourself?" But I agree that it would be better to spend more attention on what makes the best haiku succeed, rather than dwell on what makes other things fail as haiku. However, I believe the conversation with many poets often has to start with unlearning. They have to back up from the wrong path they've taken, or at least be open to the possibility that they're on the wrong path. Perhaps only then does talking about what makes a good haiku work become more plausible. At least, that's my speculation. But I think it's accurate. The assumptions some people have about haiku are so deeply ingrained that it's hard for them to even begin to appreciate attempts to promote successful haiku.
>
> Ultimately, Jason, I'm delighted that you've ordered Lee Gurga's book. If that's the limit of your exploration of haiku, that's fine by me. But you are going a world farther than most people. I'm just trying to open the door, even if just a little bit.

Ana Verse is the new title for my blog, still located at
_http://annbogle.blogspot.com_ (http://annbogle.blogspot.com) .  I  changed the name to evade the
stargazers who were after Ann-Margret,  the actress.  It was interesting, for
a year, to note on site meter what  their interests in her is: things about
her father, whether she has children,  and to see her naked.
Visitors, do feel free to poke around and comment.  I am intent on  solving
puzzles of genre, especially of short forms.  There are flaws, and  it is
proceeding, and always changing.  Two designations I barely mention  in all my
categorizations are "narrative" and "essay."  I use different  tags on a list; I
am trying to isolate impulse.  Audience is a stealthier  topic, one of the main
ones I am considering -- how to know them.

As usual, gender distinctions are a lot more complicated. My books
are still in storage, so I'll have to wing it a bit--for instance, I
have no idea when pockets began to be sewn in clothes (did Romans
have them?), but I think rather late in Europe, say 16th or 17th
century. And there are class distinctions: Pepys had pockets, but
also carried a purse, because the pockets didn't hold much. Did the
mass of men, whose pants were made at home, routinely have pockets sewn in?

Women did have pockets, in the form of small bags called, of all
things, pockets, that were tied around the waist instead of sewn into
the skirt, and in which, if they were literate, they often carried
books. They were worn among the petticoats, under the skirt, which
had a slit for easy access.They were usually cloth, unlike, say, the
leather sporran that men in kilts wear. They fell out of fashion when
women started wearing less clothes. It's modern women who are
deprived of pockets.

On the continent at least working women (almost all women were
working women) often wore an apron tied around their waists. The
apron had pockets sewn in.

"The gender politics of the pocket is really fascinating: has
something, i guess, to do with forced domestication of women: keeping
them at home, pretending that they have no life of real "utility"
(are pockets construed as utilitarian?)." What women are we talking
about? Certainly not the vast majority, who slaved on farms no less
than their mates, and when a farming economy could no longer support
them slaved in factories.

On timepieces--I hate wearing anything on my wrists, so for years I
used a pocket watch. Until I noticed that in New York I was never
very far from a public clock. Now my cellphone display tells me the
time, as my computer, stove, microwave, and alarm clock do at home.
There seems less and less reason to carry a watch. except for scuba
diving, when small amounts of time are a matter of life and death.

Hello,

-- for an hour of radio, i'm putting together a series of poems on
martyrdom/scapegoats/terrorists/radical othering -- this will have an
activist bent, i hope -- but am open to your suggestions and thank you for
the enlightening discussion on the previous thread -- specific details and a
featured link will be sent to the list when they are available

-- poems on Lincoln, MLK, Nazim Hikmet, and many others sought -- i am also
going through the list of previous suggestions and will include those --

-- if list members have poems they'd like to submit, published, or
unpublished, please send them along in the body of an e-mail -- i will
review things as they come in -- i'd like to get a sense of the number of
subs from the list as soon as possible -- either sending subs to the entire
list or just to me is ok --

-- i have a background working in academic publishing -- if you'd like
current details on this specific project, contact me offlist --

best to all,

In the sixteenth century when Aldus - with his italic type - was able to
design portable books (most likely for the traveling educated merchant,
barrister and so forth - I am not sure that they were actually carried in
pockets, or in a satchel or male purse of some sort.
Women, as Mark suggests here, could carry the small books in a bag about
their waist, in a flat leather purse that could hang by a strap either
around the neck, or safely hid inside, if necessary, as part of the woman's
bustle, and probably under a man's vest, as well. By the sixteenth century
religious books that might identify one as Protestant, or of an offending
sect, they could be designed to be purposively tiny to fit and be carried,
hidden below the neck (where, assumedly, jewels and other valuables could
also be carried. (Talk about "clothes' horses").

Yes, Mark is right, the cell phone and computer are now the principal
instruments of dictating time, as well as time's costs and dictates.

This thread--reminding me suddenly of a joke told me by a Serbian
friend years ago and having to do with watches and their related
lingo.

1st speaker:  "Which watch?"
2nd speaker (looking at his/her wristwatch): "Six watch."
1st speaker (aghast): "Ah, such much watch."

At the Turn of the Centuries: The Influence of Early
20th Century Book Arts
on Contemporary Artists' Books

The Yale University Library, the Whitney Humanities
Center, the Yale
University Art Gallery and the Yale Center for British
Art invite
historians, literary scholars, artists, and book arts
enthusiasts to
participate in At the Turn of the Centuries: The

Speakers will include Marcia Reed, Head of Collection
Development, Getty
Research Institute; Stephen Bury, Head of European and
American
Collections, British Library; and Angela Lorenz,
acclaimed American book
artist and book arts scholar. The conference will
consider the work of
various innovative and avant-garde artists and writers
working in the years
following the turn of the twentieth century, including
the Dadaists and
Surrealists, and its influence on post-war artists and
writers, including
those associated with OULIPO and Fluxus, and
contemporary inheritors of
these traditions in art, literature, and bookwork.

Additionally, the conference will highlight strengths
of the Yale Arts of
the Book Collection, the modern European and American
collections at the
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, the Prints,
Drawings, and
Photographs Department at the Yale University Art
Gallery, and the Rare
Books and Manuscripts Department at the Yale Center
for British Art. At the
Turn of the Centuries will also honor the late Tony
Zwicker's life-long
commitment to the inventive and original in modern and
contemporary book arts.

New from Tarpaulin Sky Press: Max Winter’s _The Pictures_, and Sandy
Florian’s _32 Pedals and 47 Stops_.

THE PICTURES, Max Winter.
ISBN: 978-0-9779019-2-0
Poetry. 5" x 7", 76 pages, perfectbound.
$12 list / $10 direct order includes US shipping:
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Winter/index.html
* Also available in a limited, hand-bound, hardcover edition.

Sparse, clear, and free of flourishes, the poems in _The Pictures_ examine
war, boredom, death, love, decay, happiness, and worship through a series of
moving and still images. In one poem, from a group of “moving” pictures,
three soldiers bide their time in a barren landscape, awaiting destruction;
in a “still” picture, a group of stones invite us to pay closer attention to
them; in another still picture, a woman stands with her mouth open, fists
clenched, words unimportant. Sight is unmysterious but wondrous in this
book; the poems demonstrate that to look at something or to read it is to
experience it, along with its attendant sadness or joy. The "pictures"
collected here are communicative and profound, quick to read but long to
develop.

Winner of the Fifth Annual Boston Review Poetry Contest, Max Winter has
poems appearing recently in Free Verse, New American Writing, Ploughshares,
The Paris Review, Colorado Review, Volt, The Yale Review, The Canary, Denver
Quarterly, First Intensity, GutCult, TYPO, and New Young American Poets
(Southern Illinois, 2000). He has published reviews in The New York Times,
The Washington Post, The San Francisco Chronicle, Newsday, and BOMB, and is
a Poetry Editor of Fence.

32 PEDALS & 47 STOPS, Sandy Florian.
Chapbook. Poetry/Fiction. 7" x 8.25", 36 pages, saddle-sewn.
$12 list / $10 direct order includes US shipping:
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Florian/index.html

What's new in _32 Pedals & 47_ Stops is not the rendering of time past, but
the experience of time itself passing. Florian’s mode of measurement is a
template of sentence structures, paragraph breaks, and tones through which
each of her characters pass. Each scene, each moment in time is affected by
a shapeshifting personality intent on disruption. As characters and objects
appear, disappear, and reappear, one experiences both the evanescence of
things and the ghostly accretion of memory, a sense of déjà vu, a sense that
something you have experienced is somewhere just out of your mind’s grasp.
Throughout these prose poems, Florian “makes strange” the mundane moment by
revealing its artificial measurement—and by revealing that there is always
something strange happening—in moments that are playful, sad, jolting,
pick-pocketing, surprising, puzzling, and beautifully disorienting.

Sandy Florian's first book, _Telescope_, is published by Action Books. Her
poetry and prose appears in over 30 national and international journals
including Slope, bird dog, Parthenon West Review, Indiana Review, Bombay
Gin, and Shampoo.

Reel Histrionic


In Eloquent Gestures, The Transformation of Performance Style in the
Griffith Biograph films, Roberta E. Pearson describes 'histrionic' and
'verisimilar' codes of acting - a transformation from a melodramatic locus
to incipient realism. She considers them in relation to 'analogical' and
'digital' communication: "Though most gestural communication systems are
unsegmented and analogic, the histrionic code, with its emphasis on the
isolation of gesture, does resemble segmented, digital communications such
as speech. Actors deliberately struck attitudes, holding each gesture and
abstracting it from the flow of motion until the audience had 'read it.'"
[...] "Not only were aspiring actors told to 'rest long enough in a
gesture,' they were urged to avoid excessive movement, which might detract
from attitude-striking." [...] "The elimination of the small gestures
brings about the physical equivalent of silence between the grand, posed
gestures, resulting in the 'discrete, discontinuous elements and gaps' of
digital communication." In contrast, the analogical references the uncoded
real, motions and emotions of daily life.

The digital is catastrophic, fold-catastrophic; it consists of jumps
between gestures or stances, between emotions and their concretion as
attitude. The histrionic is dependent upon the diegetic - it as acted
action of the unfolding interpreted world. The histrionic is therefore
always stylized and responsive, within and up to thresholding. A threshold
is constituted by an increased differentiation between gesture and the
diegetic real; this itself is stylized. In other words, there are two
levels of code, stylization at work: the semantic contents of individuated
gestures, and the syntactic divisions between them. The gestures are
individuated (not individual); as with other linguistic formation, they
are constituted by difference, differance, the playing among gestures
'down the line of the unfolding of the diegetic.' So histrionic gestures
bridge from one moment to another in the form <------<----<----- - they
are held positions until anomaly (threshold) defers them.

Gestures are concretions operating within time's arrow, objectifying the
body in a sequence of irreversible positions. The body constitutes the
proffering of desire - it is held for the viewer, much as the display of
the (sexualized) body operated in some elements of Weimar dance/cabaret
culture. This holding is reminiscent of the still pornographic image,
which is presented to the (mostly male) viewer; the viewer is aware that
the histrionic is there for his or her pleasure. In the pornographic
photograph, the erogenous zones function as 'strange attractors'; the
diegetic is constructed by the viewer who creates a narratology resulting
in masturbation, the cessation of (that) pleasure. The zones, however, are
grounded in the analogical, the abject; the viewer is without the gesture
of the histrionic (in both silent film and pornography).

Stylized gestures reference a repertoire, of course; they must be under-
stood by both the actor (in re/presentation) and viewer (as indexical
within the diegetic). And repertoires are always stylized, enumerations of
entities that play, one way or another, within specified cultural milieus.
In this sense, all repertoires are accumulations of conventions and genre;
in the case of the histrionic, they are a rough set of mappings into (and
constituting) the diegesis, in order that the photoplay 'move forward' for
both actor and spectator. (This moving is literally self-centered within
the pornographic, which plays within the (transitive and transitional)
body of the viewer in both (interrelated) psychoanalytical and biophysical
registers.)

(But pornography as well as photoplay is never fully reductive; defuge
creates another deferral, from image to image, film to film. This is what
might be considered the 'repressed of the analogical,' the referencing of
the clean and proper body and life-story in relation to the messiness and
decathection of everyday life. The analogical is always excessive and
irreducible; digital mappings are mappings from one-to-many, mappings into
the analogical (body and) real. Digital mappings are not only stylized;
they are undergoing continuous transformations, splittings, decathecting,
disinvestment, as the surplus of the analog has moved elsewhere. What
constitutes pornography or photoplay, fashion or convention, at one
synchronic instant, is constituted elsewhere at the next. The repression
constructed by the diegesis itself (which leaves out so many things in the
world) returns in so many different forms which become increasingly
mutually unreadable.)

"The name _sensuality_ seems to be taken from the sensual movement, of
which Augustine speaks, just as the name of a power is taken from its act,
for instance, sight from seeing. Now the sensual movement is an appetite
following sensible apprehension. For the act of the apprehensive power is
not so properly called a movement as the act of appetite; since the
operation of the apprehensive power is completed in the very fact that the
thing apprehended is in the one that apprehends, while the operation of
the appetitive power is completed in the fact that he who desires is borne
towards the desirable thing. Hence it is that the operation of the appre-
hensive power is likened to rest; whereas the operation of the appetitive
power is rather likened to movement. Therefore by sensual movement we
understand the operation of the appetitive power. Thus, sensuality is the
name of the sensitive appetitive." (From Aquinas, Summa Theologica, trans-
lated by Anton C. Pegis, Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas, Modern
Library, 1948.)

What's Halley up to these days....for years it was "yellow cell green
ground, blue cell on yellow ground, orange cell with blue ground,
purple cell with orange ground, etc"----Oh yes, and then the twist,
"red cell with orange conduit and green background."
I remember he had a waiting list; people having paid up front for
works he hadn't even done yet.
He was a fast taker, but was able to confine his talk into the cell
(with conduit) of a meta-theory....
His theatre of words became as much the 'thing' as the paintings, but
the minimalist conceptual vocabulary
at times made him seem a little dogmatic in his anti-expressionism,
and frankly I didn't keep up,
but I have to admit I was somewhat hooked by the mere fact of his
intellectualizings and verbal agility--
like the bespectacled bookish post-Warhol-axis bureaucratic 80s-style
artist notion of 'charisma'
still lent a glamour to contemporary theory (and vice versa), and
doesn't seem so much of a 'tepid rehashing'
of earlier 20th century concept-conscious art as it did at the time
and it'd be interesting to see how his thought-art, or art-thought
has developed...
If anyone wants to talk about it here,....

Following on the success of the 2006 NYC Flarf Festival,
they're taking it on the road! Launched in May of 2001 by six
poets, the Flarflist Collective is dedicated to the exploration
of "the inappropriate" in all of its guises. Poets mine the
internet with odd search terms then distill the results into
often hilarious and sometimes disturbing poetry, theatre,
music, and film.

The District of Columbia Arts Center is located between the
Dupont Circle and Woodley Park metro stations. For directions,
see http://www.dcartscenter.org/location.htm

Note: the FlarfOrchestra will only be performing in DC.

Alan,

I have a sensual desire to apprehend your distinction between analogic and
digital. Is in the digital what is apprehended a series of islands? Is the
trip to the islands, that journey, analogic? By that, things are reversed.
The humdrum of our lives, the process, is our truth. What we arrive at is
elusive, contemplative and only static, non sensual. Is that not sad?

Ciao,

Murat

* Also available in a limited, hand-bound, hardcover edition.

Sparse, clear, and free of flourishes, the poems in _The Pictures_ =
examine
war, boredom, death, love, decay, happiness, and worship through a =
series of
moving and still images. In one poem, from a group of =93moving=94 =
pictures,
three soldiers bide their time in a barren landscape, awaiting =
destruction;
in a =93still=94 picture, a group of stones invite us to pay closer =
attention to
them; in another still picture, a woman stands with her mouth open, =
fists
clenched, words unimportant. Sight is unmysterious but wondrous in this
book; the poems demonstrate that to look at something or to read it is =
to
experience it, along with its attendant sadness or joy. The "pictures"
collected here are communicative and profound, quick to read but long to
develop.

Winner of the Fifth Annual Boston Review Poetry Contest, Max Winter has
poems appearing recently in Free Verse, New American Writing, =
Ploughshares,
The Paris Review, Colorado Review, Volt, The Yale Review, The Canary, =
Denver
Quarterly, First Intensity, GutCult, TYPO, and New Young American Poets
(Southern Illinois, 2000). He has published reviews in The New York =
Times,
The Washington Post, The San Francisco Chronicle, Newsday, and BOMB, and =
is

What's new in _32 Pedals & 47_ Stops is not the rendering of time past, =
but
the experience of time itself passing. Florian=92s mode of measurement =
is a
template of sentence structures, paragraph breaks, and tones through =
which
each of her characters pass. Each scene, each moment in time is affected =
by
a shapeshifting personality intent on disruption. As characters and =
objects
appear, disappear, and reappear, one experiences both the evanescence of
things and the ghostly accretion of memory, a sense of d=E9j=E0 vu, a =
sense that
something you have experienced is somewhere just out of your mind=92s =
grasp.
Throughout these prose poems, Florian =93makes strange=94 the mundane =
moment by
revealing its artificial measurement=97and by revealing that there is =
always
something strange happening=97in moments that are playful, sad, jolting,
pick-pocketing, surprising, puzzling, and beautifully disorienting.

Sandy Florian's first book, _Telescope_, is published by Action Books. =
Her
poetry and prose appears in over 30 national and international journals
including Slope, bird dog, Parthenon West Review, Indiana Review, Bombay
Gin, and Shampoo.

Using the model of silent film performance, the digital is not only the
series of islands, but the performance of the journey itself. The analogic
is the abject which cannot be contained, curtailed, the shores of the
islands, their sad susceptibility to global warming.

At this point, and it's my depression speaking, I can't help but fore-
ground everything cultural against the ravaging of the planet, the
slaughter of human and wild animal populations, the furious violence of
our government, governments everywhere. The silent films seem innocent but
speak otherwise of innocence; the seeds of destruction are already there.

Islands have moved to Second Life, and everyone and everything is buying
an island - universities, security agencies, art groups, cultural insti-
tutions of all sorts. It's this I'm thinking about at the moment, because
performance and gesture in SL parallels silent film in terms of phenom-
enology and histrionic. Sound in SL seems third-person, an add-on; later,
it will become more integrated of course, and the use of prosthetics will
eliminate the need for pre-programmed gestures - first-life and second-
life will appear equally analogic, equally 'smooth.' On one hand the rest
of the world (what passes past for the real) will seem distant and somehow
safer; on the other, the rest of the world, left to its own devices, will
continue the killing beyond any reason or proportion. We are living in
massacre; repertoire is symptom. What is the poetics of the dead poached
elephant, with its face cut off, whose photograph appears in the current
National Geographic? What is the poetics?

Regarding "zappai," Dr. Gurga has been criticized for his use of the term. Richard Gilbert, for example, has written about this in an essay at http://www.poetrylives.com/SimplyHaiku/SHv3n1/features/Gilbert_Rollingstone.html, which calls for the removal of the term from the recent Haiku Society of America definition of haiku (Gurga served on the definition committee). Indeed, though, many so-called haiku ("fake" haiku?) are more akin to what may be zappai, or more akin to senryu. Or, in many cases, they are simply short poems. Nothing wrong with that. I have not been comfortable with the term "zappai" as equivalent to pseudo-haiku, as Gurga seems to suggest, especially in the light of Gilbert's article. But the fact remains that many short poems that are not haiku exist *because* of haiku, and there is no useful term for them. Pseudo-haiku is useful to some degree, but is unnecessarily disparaging of poems that are perfectly fine on their own terms (separate from haiku, whethe
r the author thought of them as haiku or not). Zappai, though, even if it were the correct term, is too esoteric for common use. There remains "haiku" and "not haiku," and a grey area in between. At the very least, I hope this discussion draws out some of the issues involved. Most folks won't care, but I would urge at least a little more care lest idle comments about haiku contribute to misunderstandings of the genre.

I don't think the early Edo period has had any influence on the misunderstandings of haiku in the West. Haiku's influence on Western poetry has been carefully traced. Brett Bodemer has written probably the definitive article on this subject (but it doesn't seem to be online). Charles Trumbull, the current editor of Modern Haiku, has two excellent articles that focus on early as well as more recent haiku history, online at http://www.modernhaiku.org/essays/AmHaikuMovement1.html and http://www.modernhaiku.org/essays/AmHaikuMovement2.html. I have quibbles with bits and pieces of what he says (some of his interpretations, and an occasional fact or two), but generally these are reliable and comprehensive essays.

In the interests of full disclosure, my press, Press Here, published two of Lee Gurga's haiku books (*The Measure of Emptiness* in 1991, and *In and Out of Fog* in 1997, which won first place in the Haiku Society of America's annual Merit Book Awards). Lee and I also edited and introduced *The Nick of Time: Essays on Haiku Aesthetics* by Paul O. Williams (he of science fiction fame) -- there's a review at http://www.modernhaiku.org/bookreviews/williams2001.html. We also co-edited the 1999 Haiku North America conference haiku anthology, *Too Busy for Spring*, and have collaborated on other projects.

Furthermore, I want to thank you for linking to that essay by Gurga. While I
think i disagree with a lot of what he says, being generally skeptical of
  ideas like "poetic truth" etc., there's certainly a lot to think about. More
importantly though, I think that in his treatment of "zappai" we have a
possible resolution for the issue of "fake haiku" that's been the focus of the
discussion on the list over the last couple of weeks.

Particularly his statement here:
"While the term zappai is unfamiliar to most American students of haiku, I
believe its adoption will provide us with a useful category to help us
understand that while much of what is being written today under the name of
haiku is not genuine haiku, it is still a legitimate part of the haikai
tradition. Those who object to the introduction of this term might simply want
to use the term "pseudo-haiku" to categorize the poems I am describing
here."

makes a lot of sense to me. Certainly calling a poem like this:

Worker bees can leave,
Even drones can fly away.
The Queen is their slave.

a haiku is a mistake. But still, i don't think chuck palahniuks little doggerel
would exist if haiku didn't, and the idea of seeing a seventeen
syllable quip like that as part of a larger haiku tradition makes sense. I
wonder if whether or not some of the american confusion about what a haiku
is doesn't have something to do with what Gurga says was a popular form of
poetic entertainment in late Edo Japan, particularly since the late Edo
period marks the first really extensive cultural cross pollinaztion between
japan and the west.

then again, i do like the idea of calling them macedonia too. no reason, of
course, they can't be both.

Alan,

The poetics of death, dying, as in your nightmare piece a few weeks ago.

Each of these posts is an island, separated by the passage of time/thought
in between, which may only be a silence. I am very interested in the
threshhold you are talking about. Can you elaborate? It appears that the
threshold, the gasp/death in between is what is the most potent.

How do silence and death become a song? Is it not through silence? the gaps?

I suppose it's possible, if one thinks of haiku as a "genre" of poetry, rather than merely a form, that pseudo-haiku, zappai, "haiku-like," and other variants could be part of the "haiku" genre. There's certainly an influence and connection. For years I used to think that haiku was merely anything I wrote in a 5-7-5-syllable pattern. But when I read the second edition of Cor van den Heuvel's *The Haiku Anthology* (1986), where 85+ percent of the poems are not 5-7-5, it confronted me with what makes them haiku, because, for most of them, it certainly wasn't 5-7-5 (and those that were 5-7-5 were generally much older; the third edition of his book has much fewer 5-7-5 poems). So what happened for me, on reading Cor's book, was a dramatic shift -- from focusing on form to focusing on content. This was an epiphany for me, just as thinking of haiku as a genre rather than a form seems to be an epiphany for you, Jason. My epiphany made a world of difference to me, and subsequently my
 own haiku dramatically improved in quality (and so, too, I think, did my other poetry, because I began writing from a more internal than external place, if that makes sense, a place of trying to say something from myself rather than letting form say something for me).

What this may mean for others who write haiku (or dabble in it) could be similar. Over and over I have seen beginner haiku where the poet's focus is predominantly on form, with minimal thought being given to content, or to the other techniques that literary haiku tends to require (kigo, kireji, and so on). Or in some cases (such as most haiku by Sonia Sanchez), there's a co-opting of the form (and I do mean just the perceived "form") for personal purposes, in her case to project vernacular voice (which she does well, but it still has relatively little to do with haiku). A similar trick is done by Paul Muldoon in his haiku -- a co-opting of the form for his own needs. And by co-opting primarily just the form (and again, not necessarily the right form in English, at that), such poems tend to ignore the larger requirements of the genre. A shift to think of haiku as a genre greatly broadens not only what's possible within the genre, but also what is necessary.

So, are the following poems haiku? Some comments below. Obviously, these are personal and off-the-cuff reactions, and someone else might point out additional virtues or weaknesses (indeed, such is the nature of very short poetry that interpretation typically becames more personal as the poems get shorter).

rain on
march flush
on the student body

I don't get it. I have trouble parsing the syntax here, so to me I don't get it at all, and this has nothing to do with whether it's a haiku or not. What's a "march flush"? I could possibly see the flush of cold on the cheeks of people if it's cold, but to say the entire student body is much too diffuse. But how this connects with the poem as a whole is confusing to me, at least syntactically. Is "rain on" a declaration, like "party on!," or should I expect it to be followed by a noun or noun phrase, as in, the rain is falling on something? If the former, it seems an odd declaration. If the latter, then neither "march" nor "flush" follow logically/gramatically, so I'm confused. Nor does the middle line even interrupt the first and second line, which is apparent from the use of "on" again in the third line. So I'm merely baffled here, even while I'm stretching to try to get something. Haiku tend to rely on concrete images, so the rain and the student body (though rather genera
l) are the best examples of that here. The best haiku also tend to rely on believable (authentic?) personal experience, so the oddities of syntax here take it away from my experience, or even an experience I could imagine. In fact, to some degree, it defies experience entirely, as if trying to do something else, yet what that might be still eludes me, and if it eludes readers that much, it's probably too intellectual or imaginative a construct to have the immediacy of the best haiku. If poetry is meant to communicate something (whether facts or feeling or something else), perhaps this poem doesn't work, because I'm left more confused (for no apparent reason) than with any feeling of understanding.

warm santa
ana crumples silver
paper

I would take "Ana" to be the name of a little girl, and she's crushing silver paper, though we don't know why. This is juxtaposed with "warm santa," so the leap between these two elements is something in common with haiku. But why is the Santa warm? I don't get that -- and it's both unresolved and probably unresolvable. Sure, the mention of Santa and and silver paper suggests Christmas, but so what? This fulfills a seasonal expectation for haiku, but that in itself is not enough, even for the best haiku. There is often something connected TO a season that carries additional meaning in some way, rather than merely giving you a sense of the season. But what's the overall message or feeling here? I feel a bit too confused by it to know, or to feel enough from it. I think of the bilingual haiku journal Ginyu, in Japan, edited by Ban'ya Natsuishi, that might be attracted to this poem for its avant-garde or slightly tantalizing (unresolved) psychological effect (I mean "avant-garde
" in terms of haiku, of which Natsuishi is a leading proponent). But I would still bet that most haiku readers would be puzzled by it, in an unresovable way, nor would they find any meta-resolution in realizing that it's unresolvable, because even *that* effect is achieved with more control than I see in these words. It seems too confusing in its whole effect, even while I like the image of a girl crumpling silver paper. I can suspend my disbelief on reading about a girl crumpling silver paper, but I have trouble suspending disbelief when offered the incomplete image of whatever a "warm santa" is. (Also not keen on the word "paper" being a line by itself.) Is this a haiku? I think it comes closer than any of the other pieces offered here. On the other hand, folks like Hiroaki Sato have said that haiku is whatever a person wants to call a haiku. That's a bit too liberal for me, or a way of dodging any discussion of the matter, for clearly even he himself has a notion that make
s a haiku different from, say, a novel.

a cotton lycra weave lifts
from plants it catches

I don't quite get this, either, whether haiku or not. I don't quite understand what is happening, or why it is happening. Why would a weave of something "catch" plants? And why plants? And why is it important to say that the weave is made of cotton lycra? And why would that weave then "lift" from the plants it catches? And if it caught the plants, wouldn't it take the plants with it if it lifts, and thus not lift *from* the plants? How can it lift from *and* catch the plants? And what on earth for? I don't mind something being illogical, to some degree, but I do want there still to be a discernable reason for the illogic, and that's missing here, at least for me. Haiku is oftentimes considered an unfinished poem, but this poem is TOO incomplete, and a good haiku provides just a little bit more information than this. More importantly, I don't understand what intuition or feeling I'm supposed to get from this. As a result, I feel detached from it rather than engaged by it, and
engagement is a key thing that helps distinguish a haiku, or at least its effect. And of course, something may "be" a haiku, but it's a separate matter as to whether it's a weak or strong haiku.

green
colors
wax

Again, what am I supposed to feel here? There's also no clarity of location or context. It's too ambiguous or general for me to know what to do with it. I have no problem with the minimalism, though, and I immediately think of a prize-winning minimalist haiku by the late Jerry Kilbride:

mime
lifting
fog

Here, by the use of the word "fog," we know we are outside, and so it's easy to see a mime in a city or park setting, like any other street performer. So, despite the minimalism, there's enough information here to ground the poem in common personal experience, and it's not obscure or excessively ambiguous. And what an interesting image to see the mime in the fog. White-faced and white-gloved, too! And then to see the mime's actions: Instead of being trapped in an invisible box or miming some other scenario, we see him physically lifting the fog, or trying to. To some, this poem is probably on the fringe of haiku. However, I would argue that it's closer to traditional haiku than they might think. Fog is a season word, for example (at least I'm pretty sure it is, without looking it up in a saijiki -- season-word almanac). And the poem has a curious property of being readable in two ways, employing what is called a kakekatoba in Japanese, or a pivot word (somewhat like the zeugm
a in Western literature). One can read this as mime (period), and then you see "lifting fog" (where it's lifting by itself, perhaps to reveal that there's a mime there). Or it can be read as the mime lifting the fog, in the inimitable way of mimes everywhere. Is the mime lifting the fog, or is the fog lifting by itself in the presence of a mime? It's this oscillation between two possible readings or meanings that shows the poem to be akin to haiku, at least for me. And of course the immediate objective imagery is almost so fundamental as to be easy not to mention, yet that too is important. Kilbride's poem, in contrast to "green / colors / wax," shows what can be done with minimalism under the haiku rubric. Here, too, is a similarly minimalist poem of mine, that I think functions in ways similar to Kilbride's poem

night
falling
snow

I believe this offering can be read in several different ways, depending whether you put a pause or break after the first or the second line, or have no break and read it all of a piece, or perhaps even have two breaks. All variations are possible. Will such poems change the world? No, of course not. But by their sharp focus, I believe poems like this -- indeed, all the best haiku -- can make you appreciate the world around you. Rachel Carson has written about the value of noticing nature, to have a sense of wonder. Haiku, perhaps more than any other poem, embodies this sense of wonder, and seeks to share it from writer to reader.

Subject: Re: Haiku dumbness / snobbishness

hrm, i want to understand. you're getting close to me getting it with your talk
of genre. but still you're a little too vague for me. genre to me
implies that some things can be more haiku like, that there are some things that
might be borderline cases of haiku, and THAT strikes me as very
interesting.

So I'm curious, are any of these four things haiku?

rain on
march flush
on the student body

warm santa
ana crumples silver
paper

a cotton lycra weave lifts
from plants it catches

green
colors
wax

  i'd like to know what you would consider a fringe case, because such things
really interest me and thinking of haiku as genre rather than form feels
a bit epiphanic. so thanks.

oh, and as for the point about making a concerted effort to praise haiku rather
than say what it isn't, i was referring more to comments in these
threads. I'm sure there are all manner of excellent books, i just thought that
the tone of the conversation on the poetics list seemed overly focussed
on why some things aren't haiku rather than why other things are.

We're off to the presses and have a ship date of 3/14 for the forthcoming H=
annah Weiner selected from Kenning Editions.  For those interested in pre-o=
rdering, see below.

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s Open House, by Hannah Weiner. Edited and with an in=
troduction by Patrick F. Durgin. POETRY/ART/PERFORMANCE ISBN 0-9767364-1-1 =
$14.95

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s influence extends from the sixties New York avant-g=
arde, where she was part of an unprecedented confluence of poets, performan=
ce and visual artists including Phillip Glass, Andy Warhol, Carolee Schneem=
an, John Perrault, David Antin, and Bernadette Mayer. Like fellow-traveler =
Jackson Mac Low, she became an important part of the L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=
=3DG=3DE movement of the 70s and 80s, and her influence can be seen today i=
n the so-called =E2=80=9CNew Narrative=E2=80=9D work stemming from the San =
Francisco Bay Area. With other posthumous publications of late, her work is=
 being discussed by scholars in feminist studies, poetics, and disability s=
tudies. But there does not yet exist a representative selection spanning he=
r decades of poetic output. Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s Open House aims to reme=
dy this with previously uncollected (and mostly never-published) work, incl=
uding performance texts, early New York School influenced lyric poems, odes=
 and remembrances to / of Mac Low and Ted Berrigan, and later =E2=80=9Cclai=
r-style=E2=80=9D works.

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s Open House beckons us into a realm of poetry that b=
ends consciousness in order to open the doors of perception. Weiner is one =
of the great American linguistic inventors of the last thirty years of the =
20th century. She created an alchemical poetry that transforms the material=
s of everyday life into a dimension beyond sensory perception. The pieces c=
ollected here are as much conceptual art as sprung prose, experimental myst=
icism as social realism, autobiography as egoless alyric. Patrick Durgin ha=
s brought together touchstone works, some familiar and some never before pu=
blished. Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s Open House provides the only single volume=
 introduction to the full range of Weiner=E2=80=99s vibrant, enthralling, a=
nd unique contribution to the poetry of the Americas.
--Charles Bernstein

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s syncopated patterning uncovers a conversation so th=
rilling that I never want it to end. As Frank O=E2=80=99Hara had earlier sh=
ifted the stable lyric self into a multiplicity of positions (=E2=80=9CI do=
n=E2=80=99t know what blood=E2=80=99s in me=E2=80=9D), Weiner began in over=
drive and rocketed outward, inhabiting texts and communities with the same =
skill with which she herself was inhabited. =E2=80=9CI was also a pillow/ c=
ase,=E2=80=9D she wrote, in Spoke (1984). =E2=80=9C I was in the closet I w=
as an iron [ . . .] I was also sentence.=E2=80=9D Weiner makes haunting bot=
h spooky and hilarious. Messages billboard across the page, words bleed, le=
ap and wilt. Superscription and subscription join forces to destroy the heg=
emony of the poetic line, opening it up to pure energy.
--Dodie Bellamy

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s work, so lovingly presented here, brought her into =
the exploration of new ways & means for making poetry =E2=80=93 a process b=
y which she would have left her mark under any circumstances on avant-garde=
 poetics & practice. The still more remarkable change in her later work cam=
e, spontaneously, with the onset of an experience, an ongoing alteration of=
 perception in which visible words entered her field of vision =E2=80=93 as=
 cause of wonder & as =E2=80=9Cmessages=E2=80=9D to be included in the poem=
s that followed. If her art both early & late insures her standing within t=
he twentieth-century avant-garde, it connects her as well to the experience=
 & writings of many traditional poet-mystics (clairvoyants in her word for =
them & for herself). It is, when taken as a whole, an achievement without p=
recedent or comparison among her sometimes better-known contemporaries.
--Jerome Rothenberg

Poet and visionary, Hannah Weiner knit together the worlds of post New York=
 School poetry, performance and art. In the early 70s, she went on a three-=
week fast and let go of everything, resurfacing with a newly visceral, and =
visual, relation to letters and words. Exploring the joins between art and =
life, language and politics, she sought to "work in poetic forms that thems=
elves alter consciousness." For Weiner, poetry became a way to intertwine h=
er own experience with that of others, to let more of the world into her ar=
t: "I continue writing as a collaboration with WORDS I SEE." Rich with prev=
iously unpublished works and samples of key works, Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s =
Open House restores a crucial figure to the present.

Jesse Seldess is a Chicago-based poet and literary activist currently resid=

Chicago Review and Kenning. He was a founding curator of the acclaimed Chic=

editor and publisher, is internationally recognized for publishing cutting =
edge music, poetry, and performance texts. Who Opens is his first full-leng=
th collection.

In Jesse Seldess=E2=80=99 poetry, words require a certain elasticity to per=
form an attentive music of formation. The manner in which phrasal units arr=
ive, depart and recombine creates a movement like a flock of birds making a=
 wide turn=E2=80=94there is a harmony of ever-shifting participants. The =
=E2=80=9Cwho=E2=80=9D of Who Opens is a similarly mobile designation=E2=80=
=94it is =E2=80=9Cwho you have continually overheard=E2=80=9D and what is i=
tself being overheard. With great compassion and precision, this book retur=
ns language to the habitat of sound from which poetry has been away far too=
 long.
--Kerri Sonnenberg

These seven poems fit together with a perfect weave, three sets of twins (i=
n each set, you might read the first as the sounding of themes, the second =
as a rhetorical raga exploring them) followed by a coda, as sweet as it is =
final. It is impossible not to read these poems aloud &, sounded, they are =
magnificent. Jesse Seldess has written a wonderful book.

Michael,

"a cotton lycra weave lifts/ from plants it catches" seems to the in terms
of spirit, rather than strict form, the closest to Haiku. It is about
perception. A piece of cloth is caught/snagged (during walk?) by a plant
(with thorns). The continuing motion pulls the plant for a moment, but  then
the plant is detached. It is this moment between catching and detaching (the
puill of motion and counter pull of the static) which the poem catches,
which is wonderful, and it seems to me exactly in the spirit of haiku.

The chairs, in half
beings buried in
snow,
are
pigeons

in the park.


I am enjoying your posts.

Ciao,

Murat

Speaking of genre...

I've written one haiku in my life. It was for a fantasy novel, which
is fun because I get to play around with forms I don't usually play
with, and of course make up my own forms and traditions. This one is
actually called an enryu (ancient Suderain form) and of course
smarties among you will notice the syllabic count goes 7-5-7

Drunk with beauty, I tore down
armfuls of blossom.
How desolate the marred sky!

By Associated Press
Feb 16, 2007 - 06:31:47 am PST

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An 84-year-old woman accused of
attempted rape involving an 11-year-old boy in her
foster care has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge
after confessing to having sex with the child,
prosecutors said Thursday.

Georgie Audean Buoy, of The Dalles, a Columbia River
town about 90 miles east of Portland, will serve 36
months in prison, said Leslie Wolf, chief deputy
district attorney for Wasco County.

Buoy originally faced six separate charges but reached
a plea agreement on a single charge, Wolf said.

She noted that Buoy had faced eight years in prison on
the original charges but her "age and lack of prior
criminal convictions had a significant impact with the
resolution of this case."

In a taped confession, Buoy admitted having sex with
the boy while he was in her care in 2004, Wolf said.

"Obviously, with this case, there is going to be a lot
of disbelief so we wanted make sure people knew it was
a confession," Wolf said.

She said that Buoy was a longtime member of the
community and her church, and volunteered at the
county jail. Church officials were not immediately
available for comment. Buoy's attorney, Andrew Carter,
also was not immediately available.

Buoy pleaded guilty Thursday to attempted sex abuse in
Wasco County Circuit Court in The Dalles. She must
register as a sex offender after serving her sentence
at the Coffee Creek women's prison in Wilsonville.

Buoy also must pay $5,000 to the victim, as well as up
to $7,500 in restitution for counseling.

Buoy will be the oldest female inmate in the Oregon
corrections system, according to the Oregon Department
of Corrections.

But there is a 93-year-old male inmate in the prison
system, and a 72-year-old female inmate at Coffee
Creek, officials said.

District Attorney Eric Nisley said it was the only
case in his memory involving sexual abuse of a boy by
an elderly woman -- but it was handled like any other
case.

"When an adult victimizes a child, the sex of either
partner is irrelevant -- the damage is done and it's
permanent," Nisley said.

Thanks for your comments michael, I think your comments are interesting. I got some b/c comments about them from charles rossiter too, and I wanted to
clarify something, and loathe as I am to do reads of my own poems, i do want to explain what i was trying to do with these because i composed them
with the intention of trying to create "borderline" cases of haiku, that is, poems that fit uncomfortably within the genre. It's a sort of experiment,
and one i'll probably pursue, but in response to your comments i'd like to shed a little light to see if maybe your greater experience with haiku
might help me with my next foray into this kind of thing.

so, basically, the task I set myself was to compose several poems that had the following features:

1.) some reference to nature
2.) some reference to seasonality
3.) a juxtaposition of elements
4.) a sense of a single experience or immediacy

all the while remaining true to my own personal poetic commitments which involve among other things a certain ambiguity of syntax and the forcing of
multivalence through the use of glued together sentence fragments and the resistance to the received form that most people know as The Complete
Sentence. So I dashed off those poems to try to see just where the borders of the haiku might lie. as experiments, i'm not particularly concerned with
how good they are, but i am interested in whether or not you think they're haiku, and if not, why not? I'll admit that i have a suspicion you have an
so far undiscussed normative element that is in some way prescriptive and laudatory, that is, i get the impression from some of your statements that
for you "haiku" is as much a name of a genre of poetry as it is a form of encomium. So there's a second question i have that i haven't yet asked: can
a poem be bad (as is most certainly the case with my fourth example, by far the weakest of the four in my opinion but also one that i think is very
haiku-like given my understanding of the genre) and still be a haiku? and to that point, what makes a bad haiku bad while allowing it to remain a haiku?

toward that end:

rain on
march flush
on the student body

relies on several puns, the first the fact that march is a verb, a noun, and a Month (and from that seasonality); that "the student body" can be
either a group of students or the body of a particular student; and finally that flush can either mean against and adjacent to (self-referencing the
juxtaposition of the outdoors of a rain on a group of marching students) and the very intimate image of a young persons body that is "flushed" for
some reason.

warm santa
ana crumples silver
paper

is meant to turn on any number of things, but the primary turn is the one that you seem to have missed that while ana is a female name, and santa is a
bearded guy who brings presents, 'santa ana' is the name of a kind of warm wind that happens in the autumn and spring in southern california. other
things i tried to pack in there is the traditional. so this one was really playing with the idea of genre by attempting to juxtapose seasons (autumn
winter spring) while the other images juxtapose age (the bearded old man with the young girl exuberantly ripping paper).

a cotton lycra weave lifts
from plants it catches

I won't comment any further on this one, Murat gave it precisely the reading i'd intended and i'd like to thank him for it, except to point out that
part of the "juxtaposition" is the fact that cotton is a "natural" material derived from a low growing shrub that has sticks that could easily catch a
garment, and lycra which is one of that is wholly synthetic made out of chains of polymers. both are the most widely used fibers in textiles of their
respective types (synthetic or natural) and a large portion of garments worn in north america are made out a cotton/lycra fabrics. Also, while i went
looking for pictures to show you, i found out that lycra is actually a brand name, and the etymology of cotton is from the arabic al qutun, which
while neither here nor there poetically, might reveal more meaning if delved into more deeply.

finally the last, and I think weakest, of the four i posted. It's interesting that you mentioned
mime
lifting
fog

because my
green
colors
wax

is a semi-procedural, aleatorical poem derived from kilbride's poem (which i like an awful lot, btw).

what i did was move all the vowels in kilbrides poem back in the mouth

so from the dipthong in mime /aI/, i got the dipthong /iu/. I couldn't think of a word for that, so i cheated and shortened it to /i/
from the /I/ in lifting, i got to the /uh/ of colors
and from the ah in fog, i got the the aaa in wax. (there really ought to be an easy way to type IPA characters).

so from there it was just a matter of fitting consonants around the vowels until I got a sequence of words that i liked. my problem with this one is
that it stinks of the sort of cleverness that i generally don't like in poetry and that seems to be the stock in trade of writers like Billy Collins
for example, but that was done well (thanks to the heavy injection of humanity) by Ted Berrigan, so I let this one live.

basically, it all turns on the double meaning of "grean" "colors" and "wax" if green is a noun, colors is a verb and wax is a noun, you have an image
of a crayon being made. if colors is the noun, green is an adjective, and wax is the verb, you have the image of flowering plants as the green of
spring spreads. alternately, you could have green and wax as nouns, and colors as the verb, but read wax as the subject and green as the object, which
is an image of someone using a crayon. all of which connote young life and growth. but again, i think this one is mostly crap primarily because there
isn't much of an image in it, and i generally prefer short poems with strong images that aren't as necessary in longer pieces.

ugh. even though i had a reason to do it, that's still not fun to do. sorry to inflict you all with my explanations. Basically none of these are
great, but i would like to know michael, seeing how i read them from my standpoint on reading poetry, are they haiku do you think? are they the
borderline cases i intended them to be? and if they aren't, do you think you could point me at some borderline cases, or perhaps some people who push
at what haiku can and write haiku that might be of questionable pedigree?

also, to my earlier point, i would LOVE to see an example of something you think is a BAD haiku that is still successfully haiku.

thanks again for the comments on my four macedonia/zappai/maybe-haiku/

There's certainly an influence and connection. For years I used to think that haiku was merely anything I wrote in a 5-7-5-syllable pattern. But when I read the second edition of Cor van den Heuvel's *The Haiku Anthology* (1986), where 85+ percent of the poems are not 5-7-5, it confronted me with what makes them haiku, because, for most of them, it certainly wasn't 5-7-5 (and those that were 5-7-5 were generally much older; the third edition of his book has much fewer 5-7-5 poems). So what happened for me, on reading Cor's book, was a dramatic shift -- from focusing on form to focusing on content. This was an epiphany for me, just as thinking of haiku as a genre rather than a form seems to be an epiphany for you, Jason. My epiphany made a world of difference to me, and subsequently

Over and over I have seen beginner haiku where the poet's focus is predominantly on form, with minimal thought being given to content, or to the other techniques that literary haiku tends to require (kigo, kireji, and so on). Or in some cases (such as most haiku by Sonia Sanchez), there's a co-opting of the form (and I do mean just the perceived "form") for personal purposes, in her case to project vernacular voice (which she does well, but it still has relatively little to do with haiku). A similar trick is done by Paul Muldoon in his haiku -- a co-opting of the form for his own needs. And by co-opting primarily just the form (and again, not necessarily the right form in English, at that), such poems tend to ignore the larger requirements of the genre. A shift to think of haiku as a genre greatly broadens not only what's possible within the genre, but also what is necessary.

>
> I don't get it. I have trouble parsing the syntax here, so to me I don't get it at all, and this has nothing to do with whether it's a haiku or not. What's a "march flush"? I could possibly see the flush of cold on the cheeks of people if it's cold, but to say the entire student body is much too diffuse. But how this connects with the poem as a whole is confusing to me, at least syntactically. Is "rain on" a declaration, like "party on!," or should I expect it to be followed by a noun or noun phrase, as in, the rain is falling on something? If the former, it seems an odd declaration. If the latter, then neither "march" nor "flush" follow logically/gramatically, so I'm confused. Nor does the middle line even interrupt the first and second line, which is apparent from the use of "on" again in the third line. So I'm merely baffled here, even while I'm stretching to try to get something. Haiku tend to rely on concrete images, so the rain and the student body (though rather gen

The best haiku also tend to rely on believable (authentic?) personal experience, so the oddities of syntax here take it away from my experience, or even an experience I could imagine. In fact, to some degree, it defies experience entirely, as if trying to do something else, yet what that might be still eludes me, and if it eludes readers that much, it's probably too intellectual or imaginative a construct to have the immediacy of the best haiku. If poetry is meant to communicate something (whether facts or feeling or something else), perhaps this poem doesn't work, because I'm left more confused (for no apparent reason) than with any feeling of understanding.

>
> I would take "Ana" to be the name of a little girl, and she's crushing silver paper, though we don't know why. This is juxtaposed with "warm santa," so the leap between these two elements is something in common with haiku. But why is the Santa warm? I don't get that -- and it's both unresolved and probably unresolvable. Sure, the mention of Santa and and silver paper suggests Christmas, but so what? This fulfills a seasonal expectation for haiku, but that in itself is not enough, even for the best haiku. There is often something connected TO a season that carries additional meaning in some way, rather than merely giving you a sense of the season. But what's the overall message or feeling here? I feel a bit too confused by it to know, or to feel enough from it. I think of the bilingual haiku journal Ginyu, in Japan, edited by Ban'ya Natsuishi, that might be attracted to this poem for its avant-garde or slightly tantalizing (unresolved) psychological effect (I mean "avant-ga
rde

But I would still bet that most haiku readers would be puzzled by it, in an unresovable way, nor would they find any meta-resolution in realizing that it's unresolvable, because even *that* effect is achieved with more control than I see in these words. It seems too confusing in its whole effect, even while I like the image of a girl crumpling silver paper. I can suspend my disbelief on reading about a girl crumpling silver paper, but I have trouble suspending disbelief when offered the incomplete image of whatever a "warm santa" is. (Also not keen on the word "paper" being a line by itself.) Is this a haiku? I think it comes closer than any of the other pieces offered here. On the other hand, folks like Hiroaki Sato have said that haiku is whatever a person wants to call a haiku. That's a bit too liberal for me, or a way of dodging any discussion of the matter, for clearly even he himself has a notion that m

And why is it important to say that the weave is made of cotton lycra? And why would that weave then "lift" from the plants it catches? And if it caught the plants, wouldn't it take the plants with it if it lifts, and thus not lift *from* the plants? How can it lift from *and* catch the plants? And what on earth for? I don't mind something being illogical, to some degree, but I do want there still to be a discernable reason for the illogic, and that's missing here, at least for me. Haiku is oftentimes considered an unfinished poem, but this poem is TOO incomplete, and a good haiku provides just a little bit more information than this. More importantly, I don't understand what intuition or feeling I'm supposed to get from this. As a result, I feel detached from it rather than engaged by it, a

>
> Here, by the use of the word "fog," we know we are outside, and so it's easy to see a mime in a city or park setting, like any other street performer. So, despite the minimalism, there's enough information here to ground the poem in common personal experience, and it's not obscure or excessively ambiguous. And what an interesting image to see the mime in the fog. White-faced and white-gloved, too! And then to see the mime's actions: Instead of being trapped in an invisible box or miming some other scenario, we see him physically lifting the fog, or trying to. To some, this poem is probably on the fringe of haiku. However, I would argue that it's closer to traditional haiku than they might think. Fog is a season word, for example (at least I'm pretty sure it is, without looking it up in a saijiki -- season-word almanac). And the poem has a curious property of being readable in two ways, employing what is called a kakekatoba in Japanese, or a pivot word (somewhat like the ze
ugm

Or it can be read as the mime lifting the fog, in the inimitable way of mimes everywhere. Is the mime lifting the fog, or is the fog lifting by itself in the presence of a mime? It's this oscillation between two possible readings or meanings that shows the poem to be akin to haiku, at least for me. And of course the immediate objective imagery is almost so fundamental as to be easy not to mention, yet that too is important. Kilbride's poem, in contrast to "green / colors / wax," shows what can be done with minimalism under the haiku rubric. Here, too, is a similarly minimalist poem of mine, that I think functions in ways similar to Kilbride's poem

All variations are possible. Will such poems change the world? No, of course not. But by their sharp focus, I believe poems like this -- indeed, all the best haiku -- can make you appreciate the world around you. Rachel Carson has written about the value of noticing nature, to have a sense of wonder. Haiku, perhaps more than any other poem, embodies this sense of wonder, and seeks to share it from writer to reader.

Thank you so much murat! i can't think of a better compliment than for somebody to read something i've written and to get from it what i wanted to put
in it.

Qbico #56
LP
=C2=A312.99

Poet, metalinguist, cultural theorist and musician Alan Sondheim is
best-loved by consumers of sub-underground fare for the stellar sides he
recorded for ESP-Disk in the late-60s. But prior to that he was already
active as an improviser in Rhode Island working with Ritual All 770, a
multi-disciplinary group that combined brass, vocals, tranced hand
percussion, bass and drums with a great up-ending attitude to avant garde
sources that was reminiscent of the way that the Los Angeles Free Music
Society would later use a goofy strategy of provocative art prank as a
cover to allow non-initiates to work on serious formal breakthroughs. The
Songs - an early collaboration between the two - was originally issued on
Riverboat Records in 1967 and has remained fairly unknown outside of All
770's appearance on the legendary Nurse With Wound list that appeared in
copies of that group's first album, Chance Meeting On A Dissecting Table
Of A Sewing Machine And An Umbrella. 56 represents his first new LP in 35
years. Here Sondheim is solo, using guitar, alpine zither, electronics and
field recordings. The guitar material orbits a bunch of singular
hemispheres that would seem to locate the arc of his melodic thought
somewhere between the odd, baroque constructions of Sandy Bull and the
knotty dissonance of John Fahey - or even at points Derek Bailey - while
the electronics and field recordings are full of subtle concentric rings
of melodic suggestion and feel almost like close-ups on organic events,
full of refracted slow-motion pulses and coronas of phantom tone. The
whole set is perfectly assembled, with tracks short enough not to be too
gruelling and long enough to reveal their full transportational
properties. Indeed, I'd go so far as to say it was Sondheim's most
accomplished work to date. A classic of avant extension and highly
recommended.

Death doesn't become a song; the song is prior to death. The threshold
which lays poetics to rest perhaps, something Auschwitz clearly didn't do,
is that - at least for me - of everything we might hold dear - that is,
the wild, the compassionate, survival with grace. It's hard to visualize
the catastrophe around the corner, when we associate catastrophe literally
with sudden transformation, war, trauma - not this slow rise of tempera-
ture, or the picking off of animals one by one. We react as if it were
another turn or fear of the apocalypse, i.e. 'we've heard it all before' -
as if this means it's not there now, we're in a permanent state of crying
wolf. But animals literally on their last legs have heard it as well, time
and time again, and still it comes. I'm at a loss for the poetics here,
just as in I think Parmenides, Socrates was at a loss when muck, mud, was
brought to the foreground in the discussion of ideal forms.

Within the digital, within the idealized digital, there is no in-between -
either here/there, or 0/1, or whateverx/whatevery - the rest of the world
is held at bay behind the walls of a potential well sufficient to permit
communication in the small - i.e. to permit communication. One might say:

within the liminal, the digital doesn't exist -
the analogic exists only within the liminal.

Aphoristic, but accurate, perhaps nothing more needs to be said, or what
else might be said might be of or within an/other register.

Well the way a realistic digital world works, seems to prove your
corollary conversely. "Digital Data",the entire amount of digital data
the world handles today, has place for every single type, you name it.
It just doesn't hold integers used for performing boolean math, it houses
reals,
floats, doubles, unsigned numbers, complex numbers, alphanumeric
and beyond.

The representation is, however, boolean like. So, it really hands out
to us a grain of rice that has the village's history imprinted in
miniature...
(and this by the way, this is no metaphor, but hard reality....I know
several village artists in India who write folklores in ink on a solitary
grain
of rice).......

So, can't it be read conversely ? Couldn't we see the "digital age" as
one where the pearly, empty symbol suddenly weighs like iron, where
the metaphor works as a singular closet used to store all the masks
a mardi gras needs?

Yes, I agree of course - which is why I spoke about the ideal, not the
real. When the real enters the picture, economics, protocols, tolerances,
and the like are all critical.

I'm not sure what you mean here. The representation isn't boolean-like; it
_is_ Boolean, although the possibility of quantum computing in the future
might cloud the issue (literally). On the other hand, writing systems are
just that, systems, and are inherently digital in the broader sense - the
sense of the repertoire/histrionic; they divvy up the real. The analogic
is the liminal (above); it's the surplus, the unaccountable, uncontained;
it's the 'idiocy of the real' (Rosset's phrase) and so forth.

The symbols have always weighted like iron; they're interpreted - look at
the history of national symbols or the cross, etc. I'm not sure where the
leap to metaphor comes into play, except that a metaphor is dependent upon
that surplus in order to make any sense. Language is clearer than lang-
uaging, parole; the dictionary reels words in, poetics spills them out.
But I think the 'digital age' has many more implications than this - for
example it is also this period in which the symbol becomes meaningless,
in which one's world might float, as in SL, without the sense of repercus-
sions in the real. If we think for example, even on the insipid level of
underpaid labor producing these machines, keyboards, routers, and so forth
- what do we do about it? We are somewhat safe in SL which is why the
cases say of child pornography that do come up, rattle the bones.

In other words, I think that first symbols always already were/are digital
- the Unicode book is interesting in this regard; second, that their
employment by organisms implies analogical surpluses; third, the digital
as ideal/binary eliminates the liminal (which is found elsewhere, one
might say the return of the repressed); and fourth, the background to all
of this is the increased abjection of the planetary environment, cultural
and natural, pollution and organism, if these distinctions still have any
meaning at all.

I am very happy about the connection also.

Murat

P.S. In his last book, What He Ought To Know, Ed Foster has a poem dedicated
to me, entitled "The Lady Dressed in Lycra and What She Did To Him." At that
time I did not know what lycra was, and Ed had to explain it to me (material
for a bathing suit). Now I think I know enough, if not more. Ciao.

Gloria, thanks for the heads-up on Kinkaid's disquisition in the context
of British attitudes toward timing "time" and about the watch on
tourists in Antigua.  Stephen and Mark, too, thx also for the historical
stuff re pockets and pocketbooks and the anecdotal stuff about refusing
the wristwatch in the '60s. Yr comment, Mark, about choosing the
cellphone as chronometer is consonant with this:
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17189064/from/ET/

Have been thinking about Jacques Ellul. As a tool in the Taylorist
project, in colonialism, in the disenchantment of the workplace, the
watch has a distinct history. My sense, however, is that the clock, the
watch, began as a (in the parlance of Jacques Ellul) magical technology.
Its initial purpose was not to call us to work or coordinate artillery
attacks but to represent the heavens, our time-place in them, under
them. As Ellul warns, tho: wherever there is a spiritual technique,
there is the "technique of Homo faber," and the latter always wins out--
because the latter is about progress and the former concerns "endless
beginnings."

I've been musing about Nietzsche's insistence on "untimeliness," which
is something I'm down with. There is a curious way in which the
mechanical analog watch (dependent on winding, either by hand or rotor
that turns iwth the movement of the wearer's body) is for me precisely
about untimeliness and Ellul's conception of spiritual technique as
beginningbeginningbeginning without ending. There is a way, in other
words, where the resistance to the standardization of time falls upon
wristwatches and pocketwatches in opposition to church bells, the
square's clocktower, and, now, the rise of U.S. Govt Official Atomic
Time via the cellphone.

The analog watch retains somehow the grosser features of its birth as a
small celestial theater, arising from the astrolabe. When I realized
that the sweep direction of a clock's hands basically follows, arising
from, the sweep of a shadow on a sundial, my world changed in this
little but big way.

Too (and finally) I feel Alan's worry that the digital clock is left out
of this. I like the analog's closeness to the astrolabe, so just can't
feel,Alan, that deep tone of appreciation for a digital watch (tho i
recall fondly my old Casio from the early geek highschooly days.

I still haven't gotten my head around the last one! Here's some info
on it, from the Forced Exposure new releases weekly email:

BLUE 017CD
	
GRUBBS/SUSAN HOWE, DAVID: Souls of the Labadie Tract CD (BLUE 017CD) 13.50
"Souls of the Labadie Tract is the second collaboration between
musician David Grubbs and poet Susan Howe. Susan Howe's and David
Grubbs' collaboration is largely without precedent. (Cage and Tudor?
Robert Creeley and Steve Lacy?) Souls of the Labadie Tract takes as
its starting point a substantial new poem by Howe that will appear in
a collection bearing the same title, to be published in 2007 by New
Directions. The Labadists were a Utopian Quietest sect that moved from
the Netherlands to Cecil County, Maryland in 1684. The community
dissolved in 1722. All that was to remain of it was the 'labadie
poplar.' Thiefth, beginning with its title, is a glittering assemblage
of shards. By contrast, Souls of the Labadie Tract sustains a sound
world of buzzing reeds and electronics. After a prose introduction,
individual poems occur as regularly as grave markers. Howe's reading
is a marvel of hushed intensity. Grubbs' chosen instruments for this
piece include two species of khaen, Laotian free-reed mouth organs
that at signal moments fluoresce into a full ensemble. A distant VCS3
synthesizer slowly moves to the foreground with what becomes a
full-circuited roar.

Jennifer writes this; she adds nothing to my security. She is thinking
about space and about tragedy.
She decides that length has no absolute meaning in kyberspace.
That leaves topology. She decides there are bendings and gatherings and
loosenings and disappearances but pretty much multiply-connected graphs.
She says people don't realize how _exact_ everything is here, because
their emotions are in turmoil.
She says the _exactness_ is critical, turning everyday life inside-out or
upside-down.
Tragedy is always a flaw that floods and flows, and there's usually a
deed, she reassured herself. She'd read Aristotle and beyond.
She was writing this in an editor, knowing the system clock was just a
keystroke or two away. That the time would always be there for her.
Then there were the programs, email, voices coming in out of the dark.
She felt like a spy who came in from the cold, because the cold was exact.
She looked at her hand for a long time. She looked again and again.

THE MONEYED MUSE

What can two hundred million dollars do for poetry?

by DANA GOODYEAR

Issue of 2007-02-19
Posted 2007-02-12

Michael Lewis, a journalist and the author of “Liar’s Poker” and
 “Moneyball,” appeared in the magazine Poetry for the first time in the
summer of 2005, with a satirical piece called “How to Make a Killing from
Poetry: A Six Point Plan of Attack.” It offered its advice in bullet-point
businessese: “1) Think Positive. Nobody likes a whiner. And poets always
seem to be harping on the negative. . . . 2) Take Your New Positive Attitude
and Direct It Towards the Paying Customer. The customer is your friend. Your
typical poem really doesn’t seem to pay much attention to the living retail
customer. . . . 3) Think About Your Core Message. Your average reader might
like a bit of fancy writing, but at the end of the day he will always ask
himself: what’s my takeaway?” So it was slightly odd, and unintentionally
comical, when, last September, Poetry published a manifesto, “American
Poetry in the New Century,” recapitulating Lewis’s lampoon as a serious
position. The author was John Barr, a former Wall Street executive and the
president of the Poetry Foundation, an entity created after the Indianapolis
heiress Ruth Lilly gave some two hundred million dollars to Poetry, in 2002.
The foundation, which “exists to discover and celebrate the best poetry and
to place it before the largest possible audience,” also publishes the
magazine.

In the essay, Barr declared, “American poetry is ready for something new
because our poets have been writing in the same way for a long time now.
There is fatigue, something stagnant about the poetry being written today.”
Poetry, largely absent from public life—from classrooms, bookstores,
newspapers, mainstream media—“has a morale problem,” he said; it is in “a
bad mood.” Poems are written only with other poets in mind, and therefore do
not sell. (Two thousand copies is the industry standard.) He argued that the
effect of M.F.A. programs, increasingly prevalent since the
nineteen-seventies, has been “to increase the abundance of poetry, but to
limit its variety. The result is a poetry that is neither robust, resonant,
nor—and I stress this quality—entertaining.” In a section titled “Live
Broadly, Write Boldly,” he urged poets to do as Hemingway did, and seek
experience outside the academy—take a safari, go marlin fishing, run with
the bulls. “The human mind is a marketplace, especially when it comes to
selecting one’s entertainment,” he wrote. “If you look at drama in
Shakespeare’s day, or the novel in the last century, or the movie today, it
suggests that an art enters its golden age when it is addressed to and
energized by the general audiences of its time.”

Barr grew up outside Chicago and says that, as an outgoing Midwesterner, he
“survived” Harvard, which he attended on a Navy scholarship. He is
sixty-four, small and bluff, with a warm, chuckling affect. In 1985, he
started an energy-marketing company now called Dynegy, and, after retiring
from a managing directorship at Morgan Stanley, co-founded an
investment-banking boutique, Barr Devlin; he is also the author of six books
of poems, several of them published in limited editions by a letterpress
printer. He commutes between Chicago, where he and his wife, Penny, live in
a hotel condominium on Michigan Avenue with a Shih Tzu and a miniature
Yorkie, and three other homes, including a twenty-five-acre estate in
Greenwich, Connecticut, which serves as a weekend place. (The Barrs have
three grown children.) He is a big-game hunter—slightly deaf in his right
ear—and a sailor, with a tan in all seasons. For years, he avoided talking
about his poetry with business colleagues. “I was afraid that they thought
of poets as hippies, and might have viewed it slightly askance,” he says.
Barr’s latest book, “Grace: An Epic Poem,” is told in an invented Caribbean
dialect inspired by family sailing trips around the Windwards and the
British Virgin Islands. It is anything but shy. (The narrator, a gardener,
describes seeing the mistress of the house caught by her husband in
flagrante delicto—“De gentleman, he produce his próduce / like a corporate
salami, and she hers, / like a surgery scar still angry red wid healing. /
Den he settle his equipment in de lady’s outback / an’ he spud de well”—a
predicament that leads to murder and nearly a hundred and fifty pages of
poem.)

Barr’s call for something new was, in a narrow sense, consistent with the
magazine’s radical origins. Harriet Monroe, who founded Poetry in Chicago in
1912, reflected in a memoir that at the turn of the century “the well of
American poetry seemed to be thinning out and drying up, and the worst of it
was that nobody seemed to care. It was this indifference that I started out
to combat, this dry conservatism that I wished to refresh with living waters
from a new spring.” But, whereas Barr aspires to reunite poetry with the
current of popular entertainment, Monroe, herself a frustrated poet, was
motivated by distaste for the mainstream. The circular she sent to poets
offered “First, a chance to be heard in their own place, without the
limitations imposed by the popular magazine. In other words, while the
ordinary magazines must minister to a large public little interested in
poetry, this magazine will appeal to, and it may be hoped, will develop, a
public primarily interested in poetry as an art, as the highest, most
complete expression of truth and beauty.” The earliest issues contained
poems by Ezra Pound (living in London and from the start the magazine’s
foreign correspondent), as well as H. D. and Wallace Stevens, both unknowns.
In 1915, Monroe published a poem by T. S. Eliot, then in his mid-twenties:
“The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.” These poets, she wrote, “swept away
Victorian excesses and weaknesses—all the overemphasis on trite sentiment
with its repetitions and clichés, and on archaic formalities of diction and
technique.” East Coast newspapers made fun of the idea of “Poetry in
Porkopolis,” but nevertheless Poetry became an emblem of high modernism, and
Monroe its chief propagandist.

“The histories of modern poetry in America and of Poetry in America are
almost interchangeable, certainly inseparable,” the poet A. R. Ammons once
said. (Among the magazine’s discoveries were Gwendolyn Brooks, James
Merrill, and John Ashbery.) Barr understandably relishes this glamorous
past, but he is openly hostile to its legacy in poetry today. “For all its
schools and experiments, contemporary poetry is still written in the rain
shadow thrown by Modernism,” he wrote. “It is the engine that drives what is
written today. And it is a tired engine.” Barr envisions a poetry more
engaged, public-minded, and audience-beloved than modernism—intellectual,
personal, and sometimes even willfully obscure—could ever be. “American
poetry has yet to produce its Mark Twain,” he wrote. As an incentive, he has
established a new foundation prize, with a twenty-five-thousand-dollar
purse: the Mark Twain Award for humor. The inaugural winner was Billy
Collins, an affable, self-deprecating former Poet Laureate who has
demonstrated a remarkable ability to connect with an audience (according to
his publisher, he has sold more than five hundred thousand books), and who
in many ways embodies Barr’s ideal.

The most recent photograph I have seen of Ruth Lilly shows an elderly woman
with pretty, heavy-lidded blue eyes, a blond bouffant, and red lipstick,
wearing big pearl earrings and a pink suit with zebra trim, and sitting
before a red poinsettia. The picture is reproduced in “A Little Book: The
Poems and Selected Writings of Ruth Lilly,” a gray cloth hardcover with gold
embossed lettering, edited by Penny Barr and privately printed by the Poetry
Foundation. It was presented to Mrs. Lilly in August, 2005, on her ninetieth
birthday. The poems are formal, sighing, adorned with exclamation points,
and often poignant in their wish for simple things (a little cottage, an
erstwhile companion). Some appear under the pseudonym Joan March; others,
including one published in the Times in the late nineteen-thirties, are
signed “R. Lyly.”

Ruth, the last surviving great-grandchild of Colonel Eli Lilly, who started
the pharmaceutical company, and one of the two children of J. K. Lilly, Jr.,
and Ruth Brinkmeyer Lilly, was a delicate girl born into a famous family in
a small town. According to the Indianapolis Star, depression, which ran in
the family, caused her to miss part of high school. Already sheltered—she
was driven around by armed Pinkerton guards, who changed their routes from
day to day—she receded further after the Lindbergh kidnapping and a threat
against her cousin. When Ruth was seventeen, the family moved into
Oldfields, a twenty-two-room French-château-style mansion, where the meals
were nonetheless, in the words of one visitor, “Hoosier homebody”: French
onion soup, lamb chops, strawberries and cream. Her bedroom overlooked a
ravine designed by the Olmsted brothers’s firm. Ruth’s father, a major
collector of rare books, added a library, and in 1954 founded the Lilly
Library, at Indiana University, when he donated his twenty thousand volumes
and seventeen thousand manuscripts. (He also collected toy soldiers, wooden
ships, and stamps, and had a six-thousand-piece gold-coin collection, which
now belongs to the Smithsonian.) According to the audio tour at Oldfields,
which Ruth and her brother, Joe, gave to the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the
thick curtains in the loggia were often drawn, for privacy.

At twenty-five, Ruth married Guernsey van Riper, Jr., who became an editor
at Bobbs-Merrill, the publishing house, and the author of several
biographies for children (Babe Ruth, Knute Rockne), though they had none.
Ruth spent the forty years they were together in and out of hospitals,
undergoing psychiatric treatment. She is so reclusive that sightings have
occasioned newspaper stories. One tale, possibly apocryphal, holds that
department-store owners in Indianapolis dressed the mannequins in outfits
they thought she would like, and left the display lights on, so that Ruth,
driven past the windows by her chauffeur late at night, could pick out new
clothes. For many years, she was afraid to fly, and didn’t leave the country
until after she was eighty. An article in the Star credits Prozac, a Lilly
drug, with improving her condition. She now travels once or twice a year,
with an entourage of several dozen doctors, nurses, relatives, attendants,
and, sometimes, a chef. Her house, Twin Oaks, which belonged to her father,
is in a prosperous neighborhood, a few miles from Oldfields. It is protected
by a screen of tall pine trees and a thread of wire fence. Through the bare
woods, you can glimpse a whitewashed brick house with blue shutters, and an
attending squad car.

In the absence of real information about Lilly’s motivation for giving such
a fortune to Poetry, a myth took hold. When it came out that Lilly, as Mrs.
Guernsey van Riper, Jr., had submitted poems to Poetry in the seventies and
that the poems had been turned down with a personal note, that colorful
detail became a substitute for narrative logic. In the exuberant newspaper
stories at the time, Lilly emerged as an almost fantastical benefactor—a
Greek deity, disguised as a common traveller, who rewards kindness with
riches and immortality. What did not emerge was that Lilly may not have
intended to be so generous.

In 1981, Ruth and Guernsey were divorced and her brother, Joe, placed her
under the supervision of the court, which named Merchants National Bank,
later acquired by National City, as the conservator of her estate. At that
point, the estate was worth about fifty million dollars—almost entirely in
the form of Lilly stock—and her will stipulated that, after providing for
her six nieces and nephews, the money would be divided among Poetry, a
Washington-based arts-education and lobbying group that is now called
Americans for the Arts, and the Lilly Endowment, a foundation whose
resources are mostly directed toward Indianapolis. In the next twenty years,
Lilly stock did well, and Mrs. Lilly’s estate grew to be worth roughly a
billion dollars. In the late nineties, her lawyer drafted a series of wills,
codicils, and testamentary documents that shifted the bulk of the estate to
a new entity, over which the lawyer, along with Lilly’s nieces and nephews,
would preside, to benefit Indianapolis in her name. Lilly’s health was
precarious, and the bank, when it learned of the alterations, worried that
if she died the “old charities,” as they came to be called, might sue.

The bank, with permission from the court, drew up a plan restoring the money
to the old charities, only now the pot was much richer. Poetry learned of
its stake in the fall of 2001, but waited a year before announcing the gift.
In the meantime, the old board of Poetry—Chicago arts patrons, mostly, whose
role was fund-raising—began to be reconfigured into the Poetry Foundation.
During that year, Lilly stock dropped from around seventy-five dollars a
share to as low as forty-eight—significantly reducing the value of the
Poetry Foundation’s portion—and the foundation, along with Americans for the
Arts, sued the bank for failing to diversify the holdings in spite of what
it says was an obligation to do so. In a summary judgment, the court ruled
against the foundation; this past October, an appeals court, after warning
the charities, “If you have a gift horse, keep your mouth shut,” upheld that
judgment; and in December the foundation requested an appeal with the
Indiana Supreme Court.

Joseph Parisi, who had been the magazine’s editor for twenty years at the
time of the gift, volunteered to take charge of the foundation and named
Christian Wiman, a young poet and critic, as his successor. (Parisi quit the
foundation after only a few months.) The board used a headhunter to find
John Barr, who was working for Société Générale, to whom he had sold Barr
Devlin, as the head of its global power-utility business. Barr had been on
the boards of the Poetry Society of America, Bennington College, and Yaddo,
and had taught for three terms in the M.F.A. program at Sarah Lawrence. When
he met with the board, he told them, quoting a Richard Wilbur poem, “If what
you want is a ‘good, gray guardian of art,’ you’ve got the wrong person.”
The job, he says, is the bully pulpit he’s been waiting for these many
years.

One morning in mid-November, in Chicago, Barr, wearing a windbreaker and
loafers, stood on the pavement across the street from two small office
buildings, just a few blocks from the Newberry Library, which, before the
Lilly gift, gave Poetry an eight-hundred-and-fifty-square-foot space in its
stacks building to use as an office. (For the time being, the magazine and
the foundation share a large suite in a tower across from the Tribune.) The
foundation is negotiating to buy the double lot, which is on the market for
seven million dollars, and, if the deal goes through, will house a
twenty-five-thousand-square-foot building that should be ready in several
years. There will be room for a library, offices for the magazine and the
foundation, and a lecture hall. (The foundation already has an excellent
series; this fall, there were readings by Mark Strand, Robert Hass, and Gary
Snyder, as well as a staged reading of Richard Wilbur’s verse translation of
“Tartuffe.”) “The building won’t be palatial, but it will have an identity
as a national home for poetry,” Barr said. It will also have space for the
foundation’s new project: the Poetry Institute, a think tank modelled on the
Aspen Institute, for researching issues in contemporary poetry and
organizing symposia to disseminate the findings. Its first effort was a
survey completed last spring by the National Opinion Research Center, at the
University of Chicago, which cost seven hundred thousand dollars, and
revealed, along with a great deal of other data, that ninety per cent of
American readers value poetry.

The Poetry Foundation functions as an operating foundation, spending most of
its money on its own activities rather than on grants. As Ethel Kaplan, a
lawyer at a wealth-management firm and the chair of the board, put it,
“Nobody wanted to sit back and read grant proposals—especially from poets.”
By January, the foundation had received eighty-eight million dollars. After
all the money has been distributed, the foundation’s budget will be about
ten million dollars a year.

In an editorial in Poetry in 1922, Monroe bemoaned the quality of newspaper
verse: “These syndicated rhymers, like the movie-producers, are learning
that ‘it pays to be good,’ that one ‘gets by by giving the people the
emotions of virtue, simplicity and goodness, with this program paying at the
box-office.’ ” She wanted to create a place apart for poetry; the foundation
wants to take the genre big—right back into the magazines and newspapers
that, a century ago, rejected all but the softest pap. To this end, the
foundation is offering its services as an external poetry editor. Over the
past year, it has sent a dozen magazine editors mockups with poems
superimposed on actual layouts from those magazines (a Basho haiku in a Good
Housekeeping spread showing how to “pair old china with fresh blooms”;
Lucille Clifton’s “Homage to My Hips” on a fitness page called “Love Your
Curves”). To Details, the foundation suggested an essay by Jim Harrison: “If
Jim Harrison, poet, novelist (Legends of the Fall) and walking vat of
testosterone, needs a daily shot of poetry, it must not be for sissies. . .
. A good hed for the piece might be ‘Don’t Be Afraid of Poetry.’ A better
one might be ‘Read Poetry. Get Laid.’ ” Some poets work better for this
purpose than others. “It’s just common sense that we would not take language
poetry and put it in a mockup magazine for Better Homes & Gardens,” Barr
said. “They’d say, ‘What the hell is this? My readers would never understand
it.’ ” The foundation also pays for a syndicated newspaper column by Ted
Kooser, the former Nebraska life-insurance executive who was Poet Laureate
from 2004 to 2006. The column, which features poems on comforting American
themes (neighbors, chores, raking), runs mostly in regional papers in the
Midwest and the South.

The annual budget for the foundation’s Web site, which débuted a year ago,
is more than a million dollars. The site has newsy items, blogs, a poetry
best-seller list, and an archive of poems from a wide range of poets,
helpfully indexed by subject matter. It is a boon to poets—whose publishers
get paid for the use of the work—and to best men. Emily Warn, the editor of
the site, has published two collections of poems with Copper Canyon Press (a
third is forthcoming) and used to work at Microsoft, where she helped launch
early versions of Internet Explorer. “We exist at the intersection of the
great poems in our archive and this very broad public,” she said. She would
like the site to become the Billboard or the Entertainment Weekly of the
poetry world, reflecting everything that’s happening without a dogmatic
point of view. She consults both with academics (what are the best and most
representative poems of Czeslaw Milosz?) and with those whose sensibilities
are a bit more pop. The site’s associate editor, Emily White, lives in
Seattle and for five years edited the alternative paper The Stranger. (Warn
says that she never would have come up with the headline “Herbert Sucks.
Donne Is a Pimp” if not for the influence of White.) Jeff Gordinier, an
editor-at-large at Details who writes a column called “The Philistine” for
the site, told me that he has suggested introducing more humor and
irreverence—“charts and quizzes and time lines and very attitudinal columns
and reaching out for a dash more celebrity presence.”

In September, the foundation announced the latest of a group of prizes
intended, Barr says, “to throw a spotlight of recognition on
underilluminated corners of the poetry world,” and named Jack Prelutsky
America’s first Children’s Poet Laureate. Prelutsky, who has published more
than forty books of children’s poems, is, you might say, the ultimate
example of a poet who keeps his audience in mind. “I Have a Pet Tomato,”
from “It’s Raining Pigs and Noodles,” reads:

I have a pet tomato,
it doesn’t have a stem.
My friends have pet asparagus—
why can’t I be like them?


The Children’s Laureate was Penny Barr’s idea. “I’m not a poet,” she told
me. “I’m not versed in poetry, but I am versed in bringing up children. It’s
a natural for me. The adult poets have never heard of Jack Prelutsky. The
big secret is that these people are making a lot of money!” Prelutsky has
donated to the foundation a collection of five thousand children’s books,
which will be stored in the building.

The cumulative effect, John Barr hopes, will be conspicuous.“You probably
haven’t heard much humility out of me,” he said. “But many years from now,
when people are looking back, my first hope would be that the course of the
river of American poetry would have been altered by a few degrees—or maybe
more—by the Poetry Foundation. If less than that happens, but there’s
something discernible enough to be called the Chicago Movement, that wouldn’
t disappoint me, either. I don’t know what the Chicago Movement is. I have
no idea. It’s not poets or a kind of poetry. But it implies a departure from
the status quo today. If there’s an effect on the art form, I hope it would
be a bigger audience and a poetry that is deriving energy from a general
audience. You know that line of Ezra Pound’s about Walt Whitman, ‘Let there
be commerce between us’? I hope there’s more commerce, in that sense, the
poetic sense, between the mainstream general readers and contemporary
 poets.”

I wrote before about why "a cotton lycra weave lifts/ from plants it
catches" doesn't work, at least for me, as haiku. However, you raise an
interpretation that would lead me to suggest changing "plants it catches" to  "plants it
catches on," which would be much clearer to me. But I am still left  with
having no reason for the fabric to be having any relationship with plants  in the
first place, so to be the verse is still problematic. You make a good  point
that it presents a moment (a catch, and then release), which many haiku  also
do, but that is not enough, especially when there are other problems.

Also, Murat, you refer to "strict form." But do you mean 5-7-5? Remember, I
reject 5-7-5 for English-language haiku, at least as a target (it can  be okay
if it's by accident, and avoids many of the padding/chopping and  awkward
line break problems that many 5-7-5 haiku have). The strictness that I  would
look for is more in terms of clarity of sensory images (these aren't clear
enough), using a season word (nope), and a two-part juxtapositional structure,
equivalent to a kireji (again, nope), plus an overall gestalt. As I mentioned,
the other verse about ana crumpling silver paper is much closer to haiku -- for
 starters, the central image is immediate and clear (crumpling silver paper),
 there's a seasonal reference (santa), and a juxtaposition of the two parts.
The  whole did not work for me in that case, however.

Alison, your 7-5-7 "enryu" seems like it must have been a lot of fun to
create.

Michael,

"a cotton lycra weave lifts/ from plants it  catches" seems to the in terms
of spirit, rather than strict form, the  closest to Haiku. It is about
perception. A piece of cloth is  caught/snagged (during walk?) by a plant
(with thorns). The continuing  motion pulls the plant for a moment, but  then
the plant is detached.  It is this moment between catching and detaching (the
puill of motion and  counter pull of the static) which the poem catches,
which is wonderful, and  it seems to me exactly in the spirit of haiku.

I am enjoying your  posts.

Yikes, did I ever miss that! Yes, of course, the Santa Ana winds are warm
(been too long since I lived in Southern California -- 19 years). That makes a
lot of difference to the poem. Which goes to show you the power of line
breaks,  which in this case completely confused me (and, ahem, thus I'd change
them). I'm  still puzzled by why the wind would crumple silver paper, though, and
still  seems to be insufficient for a haiku, plus it also loses the seasonal
reference  I wondered about (Santa). Thanks for pointing the Santa Anas, Barry.

But I had a different wrong interpretation of Santa Ana--as suggested by my call to "remember the Alamo." General Santa Ana was the Mexican general (and later, president) who led the siege against the Alamo.

Michael Dylan Welch <WelchM@AOL.COM> wrote:
Yikes, did I ever miss that! Yes, of course, the Santa Ana winds are warm
(been too long since I lived in Southern California -- 19 years). That makes a
lot of difference to the poem. Which goes to show you the power of line
breaks, which in this case completely confused me (and, ahem, thus I'd change
them). I'm still puzzled by why the wind would crumple silver paper, though, and
still seems to be insufficient for a haiku, plus it also loses the seasonal
reference I wondered about (Santa). Thanks for pointing the Santa Anas, Barry.

Here's a heads-up about two events next week that are part of an
ongoing exhibition at the Miami University Art Museum--please see the
department website for details and biographies: http://
www.units.muohio.edu/english/events.html#imageworks.

The schedule you'll find there with other information:

Tuesday, February 20
12 p.m.
Miami University Art Museum
Marjorie Welish will discuss the conceptual and theoretical
relationship of word and image in a lecture entitled "Read Red:
Between Reading and Seeing."
Free and open to the public

Thursday, February 22
7 p.m.
Miami University Art Museum
Readings by Norma Cole, Tom Raworth, and Marjorie Welish
with introductory remarks on IMAGEworks/WORDworks by Keith Tuma
Free and open to the public


The biographies linked from the site above should tell you what you
need to know, but maybe I should add here that Marjorie Welish is not
only a fine poet and painter but also a very smart writer about
literature, art, and aesthetic theory--she moves easily between
Continental and Anglo-American philosophy. I hope that a few of you
who might not otherwise turn out for a poetry reading might turn out
to hear her talk about text and image at the museum on Tuesday at noon.

Please feel free to forward the link to faculty and students in other
departments and to others who might be interested. Several of the
writer/artists will be visiting a range of classes in the department
next week.

Of course, but their literature doesn't survive (there are
inscriptions) and their language, as far as I know, is largely
undeciphered. Which would limit the ways in which modernists could
use it. Or maybe not. People do write in Klingon.

Michael,

I do believe "catches on" will weaken the piece a lot and make it, as I see
it, neither poem nor haiku. Why this is so requires an elaborate explanation
which finally may not be too useful.

Along with the rules of haiku, are you not using your range of sensibility
as a reader also as a standard? To me there is nothing unclear about
"catches." "Catches on" is the "correct" expression if you can not accept
"lycra," as an active and even ominous agent. The poem obviously does.

Ciao,

Murat

DAVE KRESS

Wednesday, February 21
8:00pm

of God, will be published in 2007. He is an Assistant Professor of =
English at the University of Maine, Orono, where he teaches creative =
writing and contemporary literature.

"Dave Kress's first novel reminds us how intelligent a form the novel =

written with articulate zest and a voracious appetite for the things of =
everyday life seen in consummate detail. Mr. Kress has begun what =
promises to be a sparkling career as a novelist. Yes, Virginia, there =
are still some stylists on the Rialto."=20

Just find a nice lawn with a couple big, old shade trees.
Then stretch out in the shade and go to it. Uh, maybe
it would be best to wait until it warms up a bit there.

You're welcome. It sounds quite good, doesn't it, coming from someone whose
book is in its sixth printing. Many have been saying the same for years.

OPEN TEXT READING SERIES #1
Sponsored by the Canada Council for the Arts
& the Creative Writing Program at Capilano College
http://capilanocreativewriting.blogspot.com

The Spring 2007 OPEN TEXT series at Capilano College begins on March 1st
2007 with a reading by Nanaimo poet Peter Culley, who will be reading from
his new work, "The Age of Briggs & Stratton".

12:30
Cedar 136
Capilano College
2055 Purcell Way
North Vancouver

Peter Culley, poet and art critic, has published Twenty-one (Oolican
1980), Fruit Dots (Tsunami 1985), Natural History (Fissure 1986) The
Climax Forest (Leech, 1995) and Hammertown (New Star, 2003). The untitled
second installment of Hammertown is due from New Star in the fall of '08.
His writing on artists such as Stan Douglas, Roy Arden, Kelly Wood and
Geoffrey Farmer has appeared in numerous catalogues and journals. Culley
resides in South Wellington, near Nanaimo, on Vancouver Island, BC.

L'Orphee

So much of L' Orphee
plays in the grim middle-aged way
poor Spicer never lived to see
that its like I know better;
ie Jean Marais is how we're
supposed to look on the inside
& those hoopleheads at the Cafe
rioting over Johnny Ray
as Mrs. Mills tinkles at 78
& the Hugo Boss bike cops drop their mitts--
what Martian could have predicted an Elvis
emerging from their thin Hugenot gruel?
Why do the youngsters blame me?
Don't their radios get the CBC?

  To Topos is an international poetry journal that features poetry in translation, oftentimes the original appears together with its English translation. The following is excerpted from our Poet's Market entry:

"To Topos is committed to fostering human rights on an environmentally fragile planet. Its focus is altermondialist, recognizing that the causes of poverty and injustice are often related to race, gender, nationality, and the effacement of earth-given resources. Most issues are thematically focused.

  "Previous themes include Incarceration, Peace and the Sea, Forests, and North African Voices.  Winona LaDuke (White Earth Land Recovery Project) and Dr. William F. Schulz (Amnesty International) have prefaced recent issues. The journal is open to both aspiring and recognized poets. The journal particularly invites submissions from refugees and the borderless. The journal is primarily interested in living poets who believe words carry the gift of positive social change.

"The mission of this journal is to reveal the human face of poetry as a statement of urgency in today's world. The journal is open to all aesthetic and stylistic orientations, but submissions should be a seed for social change along humanist principles without indulging in political or nationalist rhetoric."

  In May 2006, Ms. Hedge Coke addressed the United Nations regarding the effect of publication impact on Indigenous Human Rights.

  We are in the process of reading the 250+ submissions for the forthcoming issue on Poetry and Poverty.  Decisions to be made soon.  Guest edited by Dr. Karen Holmberg of Oregon State University, our tenth volume will feature an introduction by Michael Parenti.


Our issue dedicated to Contemporary Hungarian Poetry, guest edited by Eniko Bollobas of Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest was presented to the Hungarian Prime Minister.

    Future themes include Water, Contemporary Turkish Poetry (postponed) and Contemporary Poetry from Wallonia.

Our 2004 issue on Forests features an introduction by Winona LaDuke and was given a favorable review in the prominent French poetry journal, Friches. The 2005 issue on North African Voices was featured on www.babelmed.net.

We just received an Oregon Literary Arts Fellowship for Publishers grant in 2006. Our pages include works by the likes of academics, asylum inmates, Nobel and Pulitzer candidates, scholars, and farmers.

Dear Friends and Colleagues:

Do you know or use the Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics in
any or all of its three editions (1965, 1974, 1993)? Have you found
something useful in it? Do you wish it contained something it lacks?
If you don't spend much time with poetry, do you know someone
elsewhere who does?

Preparation of a fourth edition has begun, and both Roland Greene, who
is Editor-in-Chief, and I, as General Editor, would welcome any and
all suggestions and thoughts about which entries to keep, which to
drop, which to add. We have begun working our way through the 1700

Dixie Chicks Among Esteemed Outlaws
by Ashley Sayeau

Philadelphia Inquirer - February 16, 2007

http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/editorial/16709871.htm

On Sunday night at the 49th annual Grammy awards, the
Dixie Chicks took home five awards, including best
album, record and song of the year.

It was a long road, indeed, for the Chicks, whose
enormous fan base and ticket sales famously plummeted
in 2003 after lead singer Natalie Maines remarked on
the eve of the Iraq war that the group was "ashamed the president of the
United States is from Texas." Within days, radio stations were refusing
to play their music, and fans were demanding refunds. Death threats were
later issued.

Throughout the ordeal, the group remained admirably unapologetic,
insisting that dissent is (or at least should be) a vital liberty in
America. They further maintained this position in their album Taking the
Long Way (which won the Grammy for best album) and especially in the
song "Not Ready To Make Nice," in which they directly addressed their
critics: "It's too late to make it right/ I probably wouldn't if I
could/ Cause I'm mad as hell/ Can't bring myself to do what it is/ You
think I should."

Despite the group's successes, the grudge has held, particularly among
the Nashville music establishment. The Country Music Association
completely snubbed the Chicks at its awards ceremony in May.

Such an affront on the part of country music is not
only cowardly, but also quite antithetical to the
genre's history. For, while country music today is
often equated with pickup trucks, rebel flags, and men
with mullets, it also has a brave and, dare I say,
liberal streak in its closet.

Take Johnny Cash, for instance. Not only did many of
his most famous lyrics center on "the poor and the
beaten down," including a poignant attack on this
country's treatment of American Indians, but also Cash
was a vocal critic of the Vietnam War, as in his famous
song "Man in Black": "I wear the black in mourning for
the lives that could have been/ Each week we lose a
hundred fine young men."

And then there is Willie Nelson, who on Valentine's Day
2006 released a love song about gay cowboys, titled,
"Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly (Fond of Each
Other)." Perhaps more seriously, he has been an avid
supporter of presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich, who,
while arguing for universal health care and a swift
withdrawal from Iraq, is probably the furthest left of
any Democratic candidate.

Women in country music - like the Dixie Chicks - have a
long tradition of being particularly bold in speaking
out against some of the very conventions their record
labels and conservative fan base celebrate. Back in
1933, the Carter Family, which consisted of A.P.
Carter; his wife, Sara Doughtery Carter; and her
cousin, the groundbreaking guitar player Maybelle
Addington Carter, sang about a young woman who chose to
commit suicide rather than marry. In Sara's sorrowful
croon, we hear her say, "I never will marry/ I'll be no
man's wife/ I expect to live single all the days of my
life." Needless to say, she later divorced A.P.

Perhaps most memorable are some of Loretta Lynn's
lyrics, particularly from the 1960s and 1970s. Released
in 1966, her song "Dear Uncle Sam" was an early anti-
Vietnam protest song. And though she once feigned
dozing off while listening to feminist advocate Betty
Friedan speak as a fellow guest on The David Frost
Show, Lynn was a pretty controversial women's advocate.
In "I Wanna Be Free," she wrote of the liberating
effect of divorce: "I'm gonna take this chain from
around my finger/ And throw it just as far as I can
sling 'er." She did the same thing for birth control in
"The Pill": "The feelin' good comes easy now/ Since
I've got the pill."

As daring as some outlaw artists have been, the country
music establishment has often proved even more dogged
in its conservative views. Lynn has purportedly had
more songs banned than any other country music singer.
And Cash, never completely at home in the country music
world, once said that "the very idea of unconventional
or even original ideas ending up on 'country' radio"
was "absurd." No wonder, then, that in his gay cowboy
song, Willie Nelson lamented that "you won't hear this
song on the radio/ Not on your local TV."

With the November election, particularly with strong
Democratic gains in Virginia and Missouri, Republican politicians may
have to rethink their long-standing Southern strategy. Similarly, with
last Sunday night's awards, country music should embrace the fact that
its greatest assets have never been scared of controversy or doing the
right thing.

To quote the great Dolly Parton - who has sung a few
feminist, antiwar, and progressive anthems herself -
"You'll never do a whole lot unless you're brave enough
to try."

Wild And Blue: The Politics Of Country
By Sandy Carter

Z Magazine - September 1994

http://zena.secureforum.com/znet/zmag/articles/sept94carter.htm

Some of the fondest memories of my west Texas childhood
are linked to the lonesome moan of the pedal steel
guitar and the soulful honky tonk voices of Hank
Williams, Lefty Frizzell, and Ernest Tubb. In the
1950s, as I was entering grade school and gaining some awareness of the
world around me, these sounds served up essential clues to my sense of
time and place.

A few years later, however, I perceived that some
considered country music inferior to other forms of
popular music. Southern accents, nasal voices, and bad
grammar, I learned, were the most visible signs of this inferiority. So
I became self conscious about my drawl and with some vigilance and
discipline began modifying my twang according to standards I took to be
more enlightened.

But the full arsenal of Southern stereotypes was not so
easy to escape. In my 20s, as I began living and
working in other parts of the country, I came to
realize that people outside the South, particularly
politically progressive people outside the South,
judged white Southerners and nearly all aspects of
their cultural heritage as backward. And this snobbery
often found its most candid expression in mocking and ridiculing country
music.

The elitist views that define popular prejudices about
the country tradition greeted the music at its
commercial birth. In the 1920s, when country music
first felt the pressures of commercialization, rural
traditions of all kinds were experiencing tensions and challenges
brought on by industrialization. Country sounds suggesting older and
more settled ways seemed inherently at odds with rapid social and
technological change. The music expressed a longing for stability and
order and deep-seated fears of the temptations of the modern world. At
the same time, the music could not help but reflect hopes of escaping
the hardships associated with traditional rural life.

Conflicted feelings also derived from the Southerness
of the music. While the music of Stephen Foster and the writings of Mark
Twain fueled romantic notions of the South as an exotic land of
enchantment, the region also evoked images of slavery and the Civil War,
the Scopes monkey trial, and the Klan. Thus for many, country music,
regardless of its subject matter, was nothing more than the sound of
ignorance and racism. Retaining a stubborn self-consciousness of its
white, rural, Southern, working class origins, country music today
continues to attract and repulse listeners by stirring the same opposing
images. Nonetheless, in a span of 70 years, country music has grown from
regional to national and international popularity. And presently, the
music is cresting at a commercial high-water mark justifying marketing
claims that country is now "America's pop music."

With mass popularity, however, some of the most
distinctive qualities of country music have been
diluted. Listening to the musical styles dominating
country radio, one hears a generic McDonald's styled
product so stripped of "hayseed" connotations that it
virtually erases the line between country and various
forms of easy listening white pop and bland 1970s
styled corporate rock. While harder and more
traditional country sounds have not disappeared, the
market driven industry bias toward an urban-suburban contemporary sound
has certainly muddled the definition and origins of the musical idioms
known as country.

Like other music forms of our culture, country music is
an amalgam of influences. Its sound, song structure,
and lyrical text reveal a heavy debt to African
American musical styles, particularly blues and gospel. Rhythmically,
country draws most on the dance meters of English and European country
dance tunes. As to lyrics and narrative style, country storytelling has
roots in Southern Protestant sermonizing, barroom banter, front porch
story swapping, and the general character of regional oral traditions.
Other distinctive characteristics relate to the way the music is
performed. Unlike many pop performers, country singers write much of
their material bringing a subjective, direct voice to their performance.
Like blues singers, they aim for intimacy more than technical
sophistication. In the singer's voice and story lay the central appeal
of country music.

Though country music is a vocal music above all else,
its instrumental sound is unique and immediately
identifiable. It begins with the guitar and is filled
out with fiddle, banjo, mandolin, dobro, bass, pedal
steel guitar, and harmonica. The distinctive country
sound comes from the way the musicians play these
instruments with flat picks, finger picks, bottlenecks,
and bow. In contrast to the smooth, melodic approach of
pop and classical music, country players, again showing
an African American influence, favor a rough-edged
attack with strings popped, scraped, hammered, and
frailed. Mirroring the unadorned vocal sound,
instrumental solos and fills are deliberately
"unrefined." The emphasis is on sounds that
counterpoint the social and emotional realism conveyed
by the singer and the song. Accordingly, country sounds
are harsh, rowdy, romantic, humorous, and rousing. Most
of all, they are mournful.

Did you ever see a robin weep When leaves begin to die

That means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I
could cry

--Hank Williams

Historically the most dominant and unmistakable quality
of the country sound is sadness. One of the great
stereotypes plaguing country music is the cry-in-the-
beer loser drowning the pain of romantic loss in some
dark tavern. But the heartbreak in country music runs
deeper than cheating, drinking, and divorce. The sad
tale country music has to tell goes back to the
devastation the region suffered during the Civil War,
the loss of rural identity, and the great migration of Southerners to
urban centers in the Midwest and West during the 1940s and 1950s.
Understandably, country music is homesick music, permanently colored by
feelings of longing and lost innocence.

The loss at the heart of the country song has been
expressed through two divergent impulses. When the
Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers came to Bristol,
Tennessee in August 1927 to perform before record scout
Ralph Peer and a Victor Talking Machine, they brought
with them distinct bodies of material representing
seemingly contradictory themes and values. In the
Carter Family's huge repertoire of traditional songs
resided the morally decent old-time virtues of work,
family, humility, and Christian fellowship. By
contrast, Rodgers, an ex-railroad brakeman from
Meridian, Mississippi, wrote tunes with roots in blues
and jazz, folk and cowboy songs, work gang hollers and
pop. Though Rodgers wrote his share of songs glorifying
the home and family, his work also celebrated the lives
of hell-raisers, hoboes, wayward lovers, criminals,
rounders, and ramblers.

Both approaches proved immediately popular. By 1933,
the year of his death from tuberculosis, Jimmie Rodgers
had become country's first crossover success and in the
South his status was near mythic. And by the time the
Carter Family disbanded in 1943, their music was well-
known throughout the United States, as well as parts of
Canada, Mexico, England, Ireland, and Australia. Aside
from establishing the commercial viability of country
music, the breakthroughs of Rodgers and the Carter
Family gave the shared musical culture of the white
South coherence. Though commercialization accelerated
the homogenization of sounds, by documenting the
diversity of local and regional styles it also helped Southerners gain a
fuller sense of their common cultural heritage. The music labeled
"hillbilly" dramatized what they suffered, survived, and left behind. It
offered solace and understanding, realism and escape. But most of all,
it was music that responded to change with a reassertion of tradition.
The Carter Family's religious tunes and sentimental ballads and Jimmie
Rodgers' chronicles of the rambling man, in different ways, mapped the
boundaries of tradition and the dire consequences of its breakdown.

Because of this emphasis on Southerness and tradition,
country music has long been associated with all that is reactionary.
However, while country music generally expresses a conservative outlook,
the view of country as an exclusively white, male-dominated, right-wing
tradition is unfair and one-dimensional. At no point in its history has
country music expressed a consistent political ideology. Although
performers such as W. Lee O'Daniel, Jimmie Davis, and Roy Acuff have run
for political office and many country musicians have endorsed candidates
and aired opinions in public, the music resists easy ideological
labeling. Every hard- headed patriotic diatribe like "Okie From
Muskogee" can be matched by songs like Waylon Jennings's multicultural,
egalitarian anthem "America" and James Talley's ode to populist
rebellion "Are They Gonna Make Us Outlaws Again?":

Now there's always been a bottom

And there's always been a top

And someone took the orders

And someone called the shots

And someone took the beatin', Lord

And someone got the prize

Well, that may be the way its been

But that don't mean its right

More importantly, since country music has always been a
voice for small farmers, factory hands, day laborers,
the displaced and unemployed, its harsh portraits of
work and everyday life carry an implicit critique of capitalism. Instead
of overt political protest, country songs prefer to deliver social
criticism through poignant descriptions of economic hardship and family
sacrifice. Some of the best examples of this style of protest are Merle
Haggard's "Mama's Hungry Eyes," Dolly Parton's "Coat Of Many Colors,"
and Loretta Lynn's "Coal Miner's Daughter."

As to the issue of race, country music's sentimental
attachment to Dixie is often taken as an endorsement of
white supremacy and slavery. Country music's
glorification of the South, however, derives mostly
from an idealized notion of working the land and the
real life movement of millions off the land during the
years of the Great Depression and World War II. Not surprisingly,
hundreds of country tunes plead the case of the farmer and celebrate the
beauty of Southern landscapes. By contrast, since the birth of the
country music industry in the 1920s, very few country songs have offered
direct commentary on race relations in the South, and certainly no
popular song has advocated a return to the slave system. This doesn't
mean, of course, that white Southerners or the country music industry
are free of racism. Rather, it suggests that the homesickness in country
music is based primarily on the erosion of rural identity.

Still, it is obvious that "whiteness" is dominant in
country music. Despite the tradition's enormous debt to
African American music and other ethnic music cultures, non-white
performers are still exceedingly rare in country music. When voices of
color have gained popularity in the country field, it has generally been
through songs and styles evidencing only traces of their racial origins.
Nonetheless, in recent decades Mexican-Americans such as Johnny
Rodriguez, Freddy Fender, Tish Hinojosa, and Flaco Jiminez and African
Americans such as Charlie Pride, Stoney Edwards, and Big Al Downing have
won acceptance with country audiences. And occasionally, there are tunes
like Bobby Braddock's "I Believe The South Is Gonna Rise Again" that
break the mold:

The Jacksons down the road were black like we were

But our skins were white and theirs was black

I believe the South's gonna rise again

But not the way we thought it would back then

Some of the strongest stereotypes attached to country
music revolve around the social and sexual roles of
women. To many people Tammy Wynette's 1968 hit "Stand
By Your Man" typifies the passive, long suffering
mentality of the unliberated country woman. In truth,
the female perspective in country music is much broader
and far more assertive than this superficial stereotype
can allow. The richest and most authoritative evidence
of this reality can be found in Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann's
Finding Her Voice: The Saga Of Women In Country Music(Crown Publishers
Inc., New York). This 541 page narrative tracing the lives and music of
country women from the late 19th century up to the present, shows how
country music has encouraged white working class women in their
struggles to survive and resist "economic exploitation, sexual
subjugation, and limited opportunities."

Exploring the folk origins of country music, Bufwack
and Oermann argue that women were the primary
folklorists for early rural music, memorizing the tunes
and lyrics that provided the basic entertainment for
the family and community. And in their own original
ballads, women expressed sexual fantasies and
discontents in songs loaded with images of romantic
longing, promiscuity, violence, and death. Bufwack and
Oermann also reveal more active and socially oriented resistance in the
depression era songs of Sarah Gunning, the composer of "I Hate The
Capitalist System," and Aunt Molly Jackson, who began making up class
conscious songs and walking picket lines before she was ten.

It was not until the 1950s, however, that women in
country music began to gain commercial equality with
men. Following Kitty Well's surprising 1952 hit "It
Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"--a woman's
retort to Hank Thompson's "The Wild Side Of Life--women
singers such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly
Parton, and Tammy Wynette started achieving record
sales and stardom rivaling country men. The appeal of
the modern country female star, Bufwack and Oermann
note, in many ways mirrored general trends in country
music. Country tunes of the 1950s and 1960s still
focused on subjects of work, family, and religion. But reflecting an
audience that was now struggling to come to grips with the realities of
urban life and wage labor, the music increasingly dealt with alcoholism,
infidelity, and divorce. Reacting to these problems from a distinctly
female point of view, country women stepped forward with songs
displaying tougher attitudes. Sad songs of betrayal prevailed, but women
now would sing also of sexual freedom and nights on the town. And in
love songs, women would voice a straightforward demand for relationships
based on fair play and an end to double standards.

Some of the purest samples of this new toughness came
in a string of popular tunes by Loretta Lynn. With a
basic hard country sound and a writing style favoring down-to-earth blue
collar bluntness, Lynn laid down the law to men in songs such as "Fist
City" and "Don't Come Home A-Drinking (With Loving On Your Mind)." With
her singles "The Pill" and "One's On The Way," Lynn also became the
first popular country singer to publicly advocate for birth control.
These attitudes and Lynn's reputation for gearing her shows to women,
earned her a legion of devoted, fanatical fans, including a large
lesbian following.

Although few country music women of the 1950s and 1960s
made music as self-consciously for women as Lynn, the
emergence of country women superstars put "the woman's perspective" on
substantially more equal terms with that of the working man. By 1984
about one-fourth of the top country singles and albums were by women.
And today's country and pop charts are overflowing with country
women--Reba McEntire, Wynonna Judd, Mary Chapin-Carpenter, Trisha
Yearwood, Suzy Bogguss, Kathy Mattea, Patty Loveless, Pam Tillis, and
K.T. Oslin, to mention only a few. Most significantly, the commercial
appeal of the current generation of country women seems directly linked
to a feminist oriented lyric. Lorrie Morgan, for instance, takes clear
control of her relationships in "What Part Of No," "Watch Me," and "5
Minutes." Michelle Wright shows off a similar attitude on "Take It Like
A Man." And Martina McBride rebels against an abusive husband on
"Independence Day." As these examples suggest (and many others could be
given), the most progressive and defiant strains of contemporary country
music are being created by women.

While the politics of country music eludes many popular prejudices and
neat categories of left and right, the fundamental conservatism of the
message cannot be denied. Country's conservatism, however, comes not
from taking a particular stand on particular issues, but in the way it
reads and resolves conflict. Country music may be one of the truest
forms of popular music in giving voice to the bitter realities of class
and the sorry state of male-female relations. But in offering few
avenues of escape and rebellion, country music tends to settle struggle
in favor of the powers that be. Change in country music comes mostly
from individual hard work and sacrifice, luck, and God. The music's
vision of community is insular and backward looking. And as a result,
failure breeds feelings of self-blame and resignation.

Nonetheless, country's stoic acceptance of things as
they are cannot be taken as an unqualified endorsement
of the status quo. The great strength of country music
has been its ability to capture white working class
life as it really is and without the projection of
false hope. Country music knows you can't always get
what you want or what you need no matter how hard you
try. In this realistic assessment of limits, the music contradicts
capitalist ideals of progress, fairness, and happiness through
consumption. Accordingly, throughout most of its commercial history,
country music has been dismissed as something beneath and apart from
mainstream culture.

Fully aware of country music's "negatives," the
Nashville music establishment has periodically
regroomed the sound and image of the tradition with
hopes of winning respectability and crossover appeal.
In the 1950s and 1960s, it was the smooth, urbane
"Nashville Sound," in the 1970s it was the tasteless
pop country of John Denver and Olivia Newton-John, and
in the 1980s it was Urban Cowboy role playing. Although
all of these trends gave country a temporary commercial
boost, hard-core country fans and musicians reacted to
each with a purist backlash (bluegrass, the Bakersfield
sound, Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings' "outlaw"
movement, neotraditionalism) that eventually brought
the market back around to traditional sounds.

In the Reagan-Bush-Clinton era, country music has
slowly ascended again to mainstream popularity with
sounds and images revealing few traces of country's
old-time rough edges. This time around country's new
audience seems to come from aging white boomers and
younger middle-income suburbanites who've tired of
classic rock and can't tolerate aggressive youth sounds
(metal, hip-hop, alternative rock) or easy listening
pop. For these listeners, country supplies a guitar
based rock influenced sound, adult subject matter, and
yearning for a more simple and decent way of life.

Unfortunately in meeting this demand, the music
industry has again resorted to formula: muscles in big
hats, starched boot cut Wranglers, choreographed sexy
moves, and pale, twang-free impersonations of
heartbreak. But at the borders of country, in the
progressive new voice of women, left-of-center
hillbilly folk (Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Tom Russell, and
Iris Dement), country rock (Rodney Crowell and Travis
Tritt), traditional bluegrass (the Johnson Mountain
Boys), and tradition conscious hard country (Dwight
Yoakam and Marty Brown), you can still hear the raw
emotions and wild and blue themes of a truly populist
art form. The "old" story country music has to tell is
too real and too rooted to be forgotten.

This little thread goes to show how widely something as simple as a haiku
can be interpreted, which can be both good and bad. That's why it's often called
 an "unfinished poem" -- it requires reader engagement and interpretation. I
wonder, though, if perhaps this poem has too much ambiguity, which could be
controlled just a little bit to prevent unhelpful misreadings. Capping "Santa
Ana" is an option. Not breaking the line after "santa/Santa" would be another
 option. Or perhaps not.

Given the word "warm," I suspect the poem is more likely to do with the  warm
Santa Ana winds than that thar Alamo (which, ahem, I forgot). (I plead
Alamo-ignorance based on the fact that I'm British -- and now also  Canadian.)

But I had a different wrong interpretation of Santa  Ana--as suggested by my
call to "remember the Alamo." General Santa Ana was  the Mexican general (and
later, president) who led the siege against the  Alamo.

still seems to be insufficient for a haiku, plus it  also loses the seasonal

Sure, I can go with what you're saying, Murat. However, a fabric could also
catch something the way a net catches something, which is different, hence the
 possible confusion. But only a minor one, to be sure. This is aside from
whether  it's a haiku or not, and I would still say it's too far removed to work
as  haiku.

Michael,

I do believe "catches on" will weaken the piece a  lot and make it, as I see
it, neither poem nor haiku. Why this is so  requires an elaborate explanation
which finally may not be too  useful.

Along with the rules of haiku, are you not using your range of  sensibility
as a reader also as a standard? To me there is nothing unclear  about
"catches." "Catches on" is the "correct" expression if you can not  accept
"lycra," as an active and even ominous agent. The poem obviously  does.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear all,

If you get a message from "me" with a link asking you to join hi5 or
something, don't click the link!
It's serious viral spam.  I got it from someone I know, so I clicked
it, and now I think it might be sending wack mess to everyone in my
address book.  I'm trying to warn people....and I'm so sorry!

You know how verbose I am, and that I preface my messages with all
kinds of overture, and never send you something without personal
comment of some sort, and a signature...so beware of future messages
from a "me" who isn't me at all.  blah blah crafted blah!

If you get a message saying "Hey" in the subject line, calling you by
your full name, with a winking emoticon after it, trash it!  The bug
has invaded Cynthia Sailers' and Julianna Spallhosz' emails, for all
you literati out there acquainted with these two innocents.

love,

Tisa

*Daouets
http://www.myspace.com/daouets
DAOUETS is a mini-supergroup devised by three musicians who, as tireless
collaborators in New York, wanted a little space for their solo material to
breathe. Switching off instruments, songwriters, and moods with ease, the
group draws on its diverse musical heritage and the diverse talents of its
members.

*The Domestics
http://www.thedomestics.com/
During a brief stint as an A&R assistant, Alina Moscovitz (ex-Bionic Finger=
)
spent her days listening to piles of less-than-stellar demos. She decided
she could do better, so she left the corporate world and returned to
songwriting. She then hooked up with music supervisor and drummer Eric Shaw
(fresh from the break-up of Conquistador which featured Sam Endicott of The
Bravery). They soon lured Evan Silverman (ex-Rosenbergs) away from his jazz
bass lessons in Paris and gigs at the Rainbow Room back to the world of
rock.=20

As a trio, The Domestics morphed into a potent combination of blazing
pop-punk energy, sickeningly catchy hooks, and lyrics that have a sharp wit
and intelligence seldom heard inside of a three-minute song. If Debbie Harr=
y
shoved her way onstage during a Green Day show, the result might sound
something like this.

Besides constantly playing live shows, the Brooklyn-based band wrote the
closing credits song, "Girl I Never Kissed" for the film The D Word,
"Anorexic Love Song" appears on the X-Girls DVD and "Fire Hazard" was
included in the "Say It Don't Spray It" compilation CD packaged with the
Warped Tour DVD. The band has participated in MEANY Fest, International Pop
Overthrow and LadyfestEast festivals. The Domestics are currently recording
a full-length album.

http://dibson.net/
http://www.myspace.com/dibson/
The latest in a long line of quirky anti-folk ingenues, including Beck, Ada=
m
Green and Jeffrey Lewis, Dibs applies that time-honored tradition of
off-beat songwriting to his own private world of sugar factories, laundry
baskets and ducks. With a low voice, both sweet and deadpan, and a
guitar-style both virtuosic and sloppy, Dibson Hoffweiler carves out a spac=
e
of compassion and intelligence in a landscape of boring love songs and
thinly-veiled songwriterly misogyny.
=20
Known for his work in anti-folk flagship bands Cheese On Bread,
Huggabroomstik and Urban Barnyard, Dibs began his cultural life as an
anonymous Moldy Peaches fan. But, after a stint working the soundboard at
the Sidewalk Cafe, and two years generating buzz with his old band, Dibs &
Sara, this Jersey boy established himself as a musical force in his own
right. After several months touring Europe and North America, Dibs has
proved (to himself, and to others) that his bizarre, ramshackle aesthetic i=

palatable outside the freaky comfort zone of New York anti-folk.

hook-laden melodies and brash, witty, tongue-in-cheek lyrics. Released in
2004, her debut album The Wrong Marianne has received enthusiastic reviews
from The New York Times, Time Out New York, The Boston Herald and The San

Juliana Hatfield and Jill Sobule. The album was named a Top 12 DIY Pick in
Performing Songwriter Magazine. The song "Boo Hoo" won Best Alt/Rock Song i=
n
The Great American Song Contest 2004 and was also selected for inclusion on
ROCKRGRL magazine's Discoveries 2005 compilation CD.

art influences their relationship. They are two birds of a different

I really appreciated reading the article on country music.  Although I don't think of myself as a big fan of country music, I do appreciate its place.  Back in the 1990s, I worked with some folks who were ardent country music fans.  I realized then that country music is one of the last places for philosophical thought and reflection by folks who generally shun such intellectualism.  In a sense, it's the last vestige for philosophical thought for many common, working class Americans.

  Some other great contributors to the genre, Ray Charles was country, so were the Grateful Dead, as is Neil Young,  Tom Waits, and many others.  These are folks who evade compartmentalization and who employ many genres into their art, including country.  Even Wyclef Jean incorporates country into his music.


  Hopefully, like many posts I add to this list, this one will also be shot down.

  the one and only,

Dixie Chicks Among Esteemed Outlaws
by Ashley Sayeau

Philadelphia Inquirer - February 16, 2007

http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/editorial/16709871.htm

On Sunday night at the 49th annual Grammy awards, the
Dixie Chicks took home five awards, including best
album, record and song of the year.

It was a long road, indeed, for the Chicks, whose
enormous fan base and ticket sales famously plummeted
in 2003 after lead singer Natalie Maines remarked on
the eve of the Iraq war that the group was "ashamed the president of the
United States is from Texas." Within days, radio stations were refusing
to play their music, and fans were demanding refunds. Death threats were
later issued.

Throughout the ordeal, the group remained admirably unapologetic,
insisting that dissent is (or at least should be) a vital liberty in
America. They further maintained this position in their album Taking the
Long Way (which won the Grammy for best album) and especially in the
song "Not Ready To Make Nice," in which they directly addressed their
critics: "It's too late to make it right/ I probably wouldn't if I
could/ Cause I'm mad as hell/ Can't bring myself to do what it is/ You
think I should."

Despite the group's successes, the grudge has held, particularly among
the Nashville music establishment. The Country Music Association
completely snubbed the Chicks at its awards ceremony in May.

Such an affront on the part of country music is not
only cowardly, but also quite antithetical to the
genre's history. For, while country music today is
often equated with pickup trucks, rebel flags, and men
with mullets, it also has a brave and, dare I say,
liberal streak in its closet.

Take Johnny Cash, for instance. Not only did many of
his most famous lyrics center on "the poor and the
beaten down," including a poignant attack on this
country's treatment of American Indians, but also Cash
was a vocal critic of the Vietnam War, as in his famous
song "Man in Black": "I wear the black in mourning for
the lives that could have been/ Each week we lose a
hundred fine young men."

And then there is Willie Nelson, who on Valentine's Day
2006 released a love song about gay cowboys, titled,
"Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly (Fond of Each
Other)." Perhaps more seriously, he has been an avid
supporter of presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich, who,
while arguing for universal health care and a swift
withdrawal from Iraq, is probably the furthest left of
any Democratic candidate.

Women in country music - like the Dixie Chicks - have a
long tradition of being particularly bold in speaking
out against some of the very conventions their record
labels and conservative fan base celebrate. Back in
1933, the Carter Family, which consisted of A.P.
Carter; his wife, Sara Doughtery Carter; and her
cousin, the groundbreaking guitar player Maybelle
Addington Carter, sang about a young woman who chose to
commit suicide rather than marry. In Sara's sorrowful
croon, we hear her say, "I never will marry/ I'll be no
man's wife/ I expect to live single all the days of my
life." Needless to say, she later divorced A.P.

Perhaps most memorable are some of Loretta Lynn's
lyrics, particularly from the 1960s and 1970s. Released
in 1966, her song "Dear Uncle Sam" was an early anti-
Vietnam protest song. And though she once feigned
dozing off while listening to feminist advocate Betty
Friedan speak as a fellow guest on The David Frost
Show, Lynn was a pretty controversial women's advocate.
In "I Wanna Be Free," she wrote of the liberating
effect of divorce: "I'm gonna take this chain from
around my finger/ And throw it just as far as I can
sling 'er." She did the same thing for birth control in
"The Pill": "The feelin' good comes easy now/ Since
I've got the pill."

As daring as some outlaw artists have been, the country
music establishment has often proved even more dogged
in its conservative views. Lynn has purportedly had
more songs banned than any other country music singer.
And Cash, never completely at home in the country music
world, once said that "the very idea of unconventional
or even original ideas ending up on 'country' radio"
was "absurd." No wonder, then, that in his gay cowboy
song, Willie Nelson lamented that "you won't hear this
song on the radio/ Not on your local TV."

With the November election, particularly with strong
Democratic gains in Virginia and Missouri, Republican politicians may
have to rethink their long-standing Southern strategy. Similarly, with
last Sunday night's awards, country music should embrace the fact that
its greatest assets have never been scared of controversy or doing the
right thing.

To quote the great Dolly Parton - who has sung a few
feminist, antiwar, and progressive anthems herself -
"You'll never do a whole lot unless you're brave enough
to try."

Wild And Blue: The Politics Of Country
By Sandy Carter

Z Magazine - September 1994

http://zena.secureforum.com/znet/zmag/articles/sept94carter.htm

Some of the fondest memories of my west Texas childhood
are linked to the lonesome moan of the pedal steel
guitar and the soulful honky tonk voices of Hank
Williams, Lefty Frizzell, and Ernest Tubb. In the
1950s, as I was entering grade school and gaining some awareness of the
world around me, these sounds served up essential clues to my sense of
time and place.

A few years later, however, I perceived that some
considered country music inferior to other forms of
popular music. Southern accents, nasal voices, and bad
grammar, I learned, were the most visible signs of this inferiority. So
I became self conscious about my drawl and with some vigilance and
discipline began modifying my twang according to standards I took to be
more enlightened.

But the full arsenal of Southern stereotypes was not so
easy to escape. In my 20s, as I began living and
working in other parts of the country, I came to
realize that people outside the South, particularly
politically progressive people outside the South,
judged white Southerners and nearly all aspects of
their cultural heritage as backward. And this snobbery
often found its most candid expression in mocking and ridiculing country
music.

The elitist views that define popular prejudices about
the country tradition greeted the music at its
commercial birth. In the 1920s, when country music
first felt the pressures of commercialization, rural
traditions of all kinds were experiencing tensions and challenges
brought on by industrialization. Country sounds suggesting older and
more settled ways seemed inherently at odds with rapid social and
technological change. The music expressed a longing for stability and
order and deep-seated fears of the temptations of the modern world. At
the same time, the music could not help but reflect hopes of escaping
the hardships associated with traditional rural life.

Conflicted feelings also derived from the Southerness
of the music. While the music of Stephen Foster and the writings of Mark
Twain fueled romantic notions of the South as an exotic land of
enchantment, the region also evoked images of slavery and the Civil War,
the Scopes monkey trial, and the Klan. Thus for many, country music,
regardless of its subject matter, was nothing more than the sound of
ignorance and racism. Retaining a stubborn self-consciousness of its
white, rural, Southern, working class origins, country music today
continues to attract and repulse listeners by stirring the same opposing
images. Nonetheless, in a span of 70 years, country music has grown from
regional to national and international popularity. And presently, the
music is cresting at a commercial high-water mark justifying marketing
claims that country is now "America's pop music."

With mass popularity, however, some of the most
distinctive qualities of country music have been
diluted. Listening to the musical styles dominating
country radio, one hears a generic McDonald's styled
product so stripped of "hayseed" connotations that it
virtually erases the line between country and various
forms of easy listening white pop and bland 1970s
styled corporate rock. While harder and more
traditional country sounds have not disappeared, the
market driven industry bias toward an urban-suburban contemporary sound
has certainly muddled the definition and origins of the musical idioms
known as country.

Like other music forms of our culture, country music is
an amalgam of influences. Its sound, song structure,
and lyrical text reveal a heavy debt to African
American musical styles, particularly blues and gospel. Rhythmically,
country draws most on the dance meters of English and European country
dance tunes. As to lyrics and narrative style, country storytelling has
roots in Southern Protestant sermonizing, barroom banter, front porch
story swapping, and the general character of regional oral traditions.
Other distinctive characteristics relate to the way the music is
performed. Unlike many pop performers, country singers write much of
their material bringing a subjective, direct voice to their performance.
Like blues singers, they aim for intimacy more than technical
sophistication. In the singer's voice and story lay the central appeal
of country music.

Though country music is a vocal music above all else,
its instrumental sound is unique and immediately
identifiable. It begins with the guitar and is filled
out with fiddle, banjo, mandolin, dobro, bass, pedal
steel guitar, and harmonica. The distinctive country
sound comes from the way the musicians play these
instruments with flat picks, finger picks, bottlenecks,
and bow. In contrast to the smooth, melodic approach of
pop and classical music, country players, again showing
an African American influence, favor a rough-edged
attack with strings popped, scraped, hammered, and
frailed. Mirroring the unadorned vocal sound,
instrumental solos and fills are deliberately
"unrefined." The emphasis is on sounds that
counterpoint the social and emotional realism conveyed
by the singer and the song. Accordingly, country sounds
are harsh, rowdy, romantic, humorous, and rousing. Most
of all, they are mournful.

Did you ever see a robin weep When leaves begin to die

That means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I
could cry

--Hank Williams

Historically the most dominant and unmistakable quality
of the country sound is sadness. One of the great
stereotypes plaguing country music is the cry-in-the-
beer loser drowning the pain of romantic loss in some
dark tavern. But the heartbreak in country music runs
deeper than cheating, drinking, and divorce. The sad
tale country music has to tell goes back to the
devastation the region suffered during the Civil War,
the loss of rural identity, and the great migration of Southerners to
urban centers in the Midwest and West during the 1940s and 1950s.
Understandably, country music is homesick music, permanently colored by
feelings of longing and lost innocence.

The loss at the heart of the country song has been
expressed through two divergent impulses. When the
Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers came to Bristol,
Tennessee in August 1927 to perform before record scout
Ralph Peer and a Victor Talking Machine, they brought
with them distinct bodies of material representing
seemingly contradictory themes and values. In the
Carter Family's huge repertoire of traditional songs
resided the morally decent old-time virtues of work,
family, humility, and Christian fellowship. By
contrast, Rodgers, an ex-railroad brakeman from
Meridian, Mississippi, wrote tunes with roots in blues
and jazz, folk and cowboy songs, work gang hollers and
pop. Though Rodgers wrote his share of songs glorifying
the home and family, his work also celebrated the lives
of hell-raisers, hoboes, wayward lovers, criminals,
rounders, and ramblers.

Both approaches proved immediately popular. By 1933,
the year of his death from tuberculosis, Jimmie Rodgers
had become country's first crossover success and in the
South his status was near mythic. And by the time the
Carter Family disbanded in 1943, their music was well-
known throughout the United States, as well as parts of
Canada, Mexico, England, Ireland, and Australia. Aside
from establishing the commercial viability of country
music, the breakthroughs of Rodgers and the Carter
Family gave the shared musical culture of the white
South coherence. Though commercialization accelerated
the homogenization of sounds, by documenting the
diversity of local and regional styles it also helped Southerners gain a
fuller sense of their common cultural heritage. The music labeled
"hillbilly" dramatized what they suffered, survived, and left behind. It
offered solace and understanding, realism and escape. But most of all,
it was music that responded to change with a reassertion of tradition.
The Carter Family's religious tunes and sentimental ballads and Jimmie
Rodgers' chronicles of the rambling man, in different ways, mapped the
boundaries of tradition and the dire consequences of its breakdown.

Because of this emphasis on Southerness and tradition,
country music has long been associated with all that is reactionary.
However, while country music generally expresses a conservative outlook,
the view of country as an exclusively white, male-dominated, right-wing
tradition is unfair and one-dimensional. At no point in its history has
country music expressed a consistent political ideology. Although
performers such as W. Lee O'Daniel, Jimmie Davis, and Roy Acuff have run
for political office and many country musicians have endorsed candidates
and aired opinions in public, the music resists easy ideological
labeling. Every hard- headed patriotic diatribe like "Okie From
Muskogee" can be matched by songs like Waylon Jennings's multicultural,
egalitarian anthem "America" and James Talley's ode to populist
rebellion "Are They Gonna Make Us Outlaws Again?":

Now there's always been a bottom

And there's always been a top

And someone took the orders

And someone called the shots

And someone took the beatin', Lord

And someone got the prize

Well, that may be the way its been

But that don't mean its right

More importantly, since country music has always been a
voice for small farmers, factory hands, day laborers,
the displaced and unemployed, its harsh portraits of
work and everyday life carry an implicit critique of capitalism. Instead
of overt political protest, country songs prefer to deliver social
criticism through poignant descriptions of economic hardship and family
sacrifice. Some of the best examples of this style of protest are Merle
Haggard's "Mama's Hungry Eyes," Dolly Parton's "Coat Of Many Colors,"
and Loretta Lynn's "Coal Miner's Daughter."

As to the issue of race, country music's sentimental
attachment to Dixie is often taken as an endorsement of
white supremacy and slavery. Country music's
glorification of the South, however, derives mostly
from an idealized notion of working the land and the
real life movement of millions off the land during the
years of the Great Depression and World War II. Not surprisingly,
hundreds of country tunes plead the case of the farmer and celebrate the
beauty of Southern landscapes. By contrast, since the birth of the
country music industry in the 1920s, very few country songs have offered
direct commentary on race relations in the South, and certainly no
popular song has advocated a return to the slave system. This doesn't
mean, of course, that white Southerners or the country music industry
are free of racism. Rather, it suggests that the homesickness in country
music is based primarily on the erosion of rural identity.

Still, it is obvious that "whiteness" is dominant in
country music. Despite the tradition's enormous debt to
African American music and other ethnic music cultures, non-white
performers are still exceedingly rare in country music. When voices of
color have gained popularity in the country field, it has generally been
through songs and styles evidencing only traces of their racial origins.
Nonetheless, in recent decades Mexican-Americans such as Johnny
Rodriguez, Freddy Fender, Tish Hinojosa, and Flaco Jiminez and African
Americans such as Charlie Pride, Stoney Edwards, and Big Al Downing have
won acceptance with country audiences. And occasionally, there are tunes
like Bobby Braddock's "I Believe The South Is Gonna Rise Again" that
break the mold:

The Jacksons down the road were black like we were

But our skins were white and theirs was black

I believe the South's gonna rise again

But not the way we thought it would back then

Some of the strongest stereotypes attached to country
music revolve around the social and sexual roles of
women. To many people Tammy Wynette's 1968 hit "Stand
By Your Man" typifies the passive, long suffering
mentality of the unliberated country woman. In truth,
the female perspective in country music is much broader
and far more assertive than this superficial stereotype
can allow. The richest and most authoritative evidence
of this reality can be found in Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann's
Finding Her Voice: The Saga Of Women In Country Music(Crown Publishers
Inc., New York). This 541 page narrative tracing the lives and music of
country women from the late 19th century up to the present, shows how
country music has encouraged white working class women in their
struggles to survive and resist "economic exploitation, sexual
subjugation, and limited opportunities."

Exploring the folk origins of country music, Bufwack
and Oermann argue that women were the primary
folklorists for early rural music, memorizing the tunes
and lyrics that provided the basic entertainment for
the family and community. And in their own original
ballads, women expressed sexual fantasies and
discontents in songs loaded with images of romantic
longing, promiscuity, violence, and death. Bufwack and
Oermann also reveal more active and socially oriented resistance in the
depression era songs of Sarah Gunning, the composer of "I Hate The
Capitalist System," and Aunt Molly Jackson, who began making up class
conscious songs and walking picket lines before she was ten.

It was not until the 1950s, however, that women in
country music began to gain commercial equality with
men. Following Kitty Well's surprising 1952 hit "It
Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"--a woman's
retort to Hank Thompson's "The Wild Side Of Life--women
singers such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly
Parton, and Tammy Wynette started achieving record
sales and stardom rivaling country men. The appeal of
the modern country female star, Bufwack and Oermann
note, in many ways mirrored general trends in country
music. Country tunes of the 1950s and 1960s still
focused on subjects of work, family, and religion. But reflecting an
audience that was now struggling to come to grips with the realities of
urban life and wage labor, the music increasingly dealt with alcoholism,
infidelity, and divorce. Reacting to these problems from a distinctly
female point of view, country women stepped forward with songs
displaying tougher attitudes. Sad songs of betrayal prevailed, but women
now would sing also of sexual freedom and nights on the town. And in
love songs, women would voice a straightforward demand for relationships
based on fair play and an end to double standards.

Some of the purest samples of this new toughness came
in a string of popular tunes by Loretta Lynn. With a
basic hard country sound and a writing style favoring down-to-earth blue
collar bluntness, Lynn laid down the law to men in songs such as "Fist
City" and "Don't Come Home A-Drinking (With Loving On Your Mind)." With
her singles "The Pill" and "One's On The Way," Lynn also became the
first popular country singer to publicly advocate for birth control.
These attitudes and Lynn's reputation for gearing her shows to women,
earned her a legion of devoted, fanatical fans, including a large
lesbian following.

Although few country music women of the 1950s and 1960s
made music as self-consciously for women as Lynn, the
emergence of country women superstars put "the woman's perspective" on
substantially more equal terms with that of the working man. By 1984
about one-fourth of the top country singles and albums were by women.
And today's country and pop charts are overflowing with country
women--Reba McEntire, Wynonna Judd, Mary Chapin-Carpenter, Trisha
Yearwood, Suzy Bogguss, Kathy Mattea, Patty Loveless, Pam Tillis, and
K.T. Oslin, to mention only a few. Most significantly, the commercial
appeal of the current generation of country women seems directly linked
to a feminist oriented lyric. Lorrie Morgan, for instance, takes clear
control of her relationships in "What Part Of No," "Watch Me," and "5
Minutes." Michelle Wright shows off a similar attitude on "Take It Like
A Man." And Martina McBride rebels against an abusive husband on
"Independence Day." As these examples suggest (and many others could be
given), the most progressive and defiant strains of contemporary country
music are being created by women.

While the politics of country music eludes many popular prejudices and
neat categories of left and right, the fundamental conservatism of the
message cannot be denied. Country's conservatism, however, comes not
from taking a particular stand on particular issues, but in the way it
reads and resolves conflict. Country music may be one of the truest
forms of popular music in giving voice to the bitter realities of class
and the sorry state of male-female relations. But in offering few
avenues of escape and rebellion, country music tends to settle struggle
in favor of the powers that be. Change in country music comes mostly
from individual hard work and sacrifice, luck, and God. The music's
vision of community is insular and backward looking. And as a result,
failure breeds feelings of self-blame and resignation.

Nonetheless, country's stoic acceptance of things as
they are cannot be taken as an unqualified endorsement
of the status quo. The great strength of country music
has been its ability to capture white working class
life as it really is and without the projection of
false hope. Country music knows you can't always get
what you want or what you need no matter how hard you
try. In this realistic assessment of limits, the music contradicts
capitalist ideals of progress, fairness, and happiness through
consumption. Accordingly, throughout most of its commercial history,
country music has been dismissed as something beneath and apart from
mainstream culture.

Fully aware of country music's "negatives," the
Nashville music establishment has periodically
regroomed the sound and image of the tradition with
hopes of winning respectability and crossover appeal.
In the 1950s and 1960s, it was the smooth, urbane
"Nashville Sound," in the 1970s it was the tasteless
pop country of John Denver and Olivia Newton-John, and
in the 1980s it was Urban Cowboy role playing. Although
all of these trends gave country a temporary commercial
boost, hard-core country fans and musicians reacted to
each with a purist backlash (bluegrass, the Bakersfield
sound, Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings' "outlaw"
movement, neotraditionalism) that eventually brought
the market back around to traditional sounds.

In the Reagan-Bush-Clinton era, country music has
slowly ascended again to mainstream popularity with
sounds and images revealing few traces of country's
old-time rough edges. This time around country's new
audience seems to come from aging white boomers and
younger middle-income suburbanites who've tired of
classic rock and can't tolerate aggressive youth sounds
(metal, hip-hop, alternative rock) or easy listening
pop. For these listeners, country supplies a guitar
based rock influenced sound, adult subject matter, and
yearning for a more simple and decent way of life.

Unfortunately in meeting this demand, the music
industry has again resorted to formula: muscles in big
hats, starched boot cut Wranglers, choreographed sexy
moves, and pale, twang-free impersonations of
heartbreak. But at the borders of country, in the
progressive new voice of women, left-of-center
hillbilly folk (Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Tom Russell, and
Iris Dement), country rock (Rodney Crowell and Travis
Tritt), traditional bluegrass (the Johnson Mountain
Boys), and tradition conscious hard country (Dwight
Yoakam and Marty Brown), you can still hear the raw
emotions and wild and blue themes of a truly populist
art form. The "old" story country music has to tell is
too real and too rooted to be forgotten.

> ballads, women expressed sexual fantasies and
> discontents in songs loaded with images of romantic
> longing, promiscuity, violence, and death. Bufwack and
> Oermann also reveal more active and socially oriented resistance in the
> depression era songs of Sarah Gunning, the composer of "I Hate The
> Capitalist System," and Aunt Molly Jackson, who began making up class
> conscious songs and walking picket lines before she was ten.
>
> It was not until the 1950s, however, that women in
> country music began to gain commercial equality with
> men. Following Kitty Well's surprising 1952 hit "It
> Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"--a woman's
> retort to Hank Thompson's "The Wild Side Of Life--women
> singers such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly
> Parton, and Tammy Wynette started achieving record
> sales and stardom rivaling country men. The appeal of
> the modern country female star, Bufwack and Oermann
> note, in many ways mirrored general trends in country
> music. Country tunes of the 1950s and 1960s still
> focused on subjects of work, family, and religion. But reflecting an
> audience that was now struggling to come to grips with the realities of
> urban life and wage labor, the music increasingly dealt with alcoholism,
> infidelity, and divorce. Reacting to these problems from a distinctly
> female point of view, country women stepped forward with songs
> displaying tougher attitudes. Sad songs of betrayal prevailed, but women
> now would sing also of sexual freedom and nights on the town. And in
> love songs, women would voice a straightforward demand for relationships
> based on fair play and an end to double standards.
>
> Some of the purest samples of this new toughness came
> in a string of popular tunes by Loretta Lynn. With a
> basic hard country sound and a writing style favoring down-to-earth blue
> collar bluntness, Lynn laid down the law to men in songs such as "Fist
> City" and "Don't Come Home A-Drinking (With Loving On Your Mind)." With
> her singles "The Pill" and "One's On The Way," Lynn also became the
> first popular country singer to publicly advocate for birth control.
> These attitudes and Lynn's reputation for gearing her shows to women,
> earned her a legion of devoted, fanatical fans, including a large
> lesbian following.
>
> Although few country music women of the 1950s and 1960s
> made music as self-consciously for women as Lynn, the
> emergence of country women superstars put "the woman's perspective" on
> substantially more equal terms with that of the working man. By 1984
> about one-fourth of the top country singles and albums were by women.
> And today's country and pop charts are overflowing with country
> women--Reba McEntire, Wynonna Judd, Mary Chapin-Carpenter, Trisha
> Yearwood, Suzy Bogguss, Kathy Mattea, Patty Loveless, Pam Tillis, and
> K.T. Oslin, to mention only a few. Most significantly, the commercial
> appeal of the current generation of country women seems directly linked
> to a feminist oriented lyric. Lorrie Morgan, for instance, takes clear
> control of her relationships in "What Part Of No," "Watch Me," and "5
> Minutes." Michelle Wright shows off a similar attitude on "Take It Like
> A Man." And Martina McBride rebels against an abusive husband on
> "Independence Day." As these examples suggest (and many others could be
> given), the most progressive and defiant strains of contemporary country
> music are being created by women.
>
> While the politics of country music eludes many popular prejudices and
> neat categories of left and right, the fundamental conservatism of the
> message cannot be denied. Country's conservatism, however, comes not
> from taking a particular stand on particular issues, but in the way it
> reads and resolves conflict. Country music may be one of the truest
> forms of popular music in giving voice to the bitter realities of class
> and the sorry state of male-female relations. But in offering few
> avenues of escape and rebellion, country music tends to settle struggle
> in favor of the powers that be. Change in country music comes mostly
> from individual hard work and sacrifice, luck, and God. The music's
> vision of community is insular and backward looking. And as a result,
> failure breeds feelings of self-blame and resignation.
>
> Nonetheless, country's stoic acceptance of things as
> they are cannot be taken as an unqualified endorsement
> of the status quo. The great strength of country music
> has been its ability to capture white working class
> life as it really is and without the projection of
> false hope. Country music knows you can't always get
> what you want or what you need no matter how hard you
> try. In this realistic assessment of limits, the music contradicts
> capitalist ideals of progress, fairness, and happiness through
> consumption. Accordingly, throughout most of its commercial history,
> country music has been dismissed as something beneath and apart from
> mainstream culture.
>
> Fully aware of country music's "negatives," the
> Nashville music establishment has periodically
> regroomed the sound and image of the tradition with
> hopes of winning respectability and crossover appeal.
> In the 1950s and 1960s, it was the smooth, urbane
> "Nashville Sound," in the 1970s it was the tasteless
> pop country of John Denver and Olivia Newton-John, and
> in the 1980s it was Urban Cowboy role playing. Although
> all of these trends gave country a temporary commercial
> boost, hard-core country fans and musicians reacted to
> each with a purist backlash (bluegrass, the Bakersfield
> sound, Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings' "outlaw"
> movement, neotraditionalism) that eventually brought
> the market back around to traditional sounds.
>
> In the Reagan-Bush-Clinton era, country music has
> slowly ascended again to mainstream popularity with
> sounds and images revealing few traces of country's
> old-time rough edges. This time around country's new
> audience seems to come from aging white boomers and
> younger middle-income suburbanites who've tired of
> classic rock and can't tolerate aggressive youth sounds
> (metal, hip-hop, alternative rock) or easy listening
> pop. For these listeners, country supplies a guitar
> based rock influenced sound, adult subject matter, and
> yearning for a more simple and decent way of life.
>
> Unfortunately in meeting this demand, the music
> industry has again resorted to formula: muscles in big
> hats, starched boot cut Wranglers, choreographed sexy
> moves, and pale, twang-free impersonations of
> heartbreak. But at the borders of country, in the
> progressive new voice of women, left-of-center
> hillbilly folk (Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Tom Russell, and
> Iris Dement), country rock (Rodney Crowell and Travis
> Tritt), traditional bluegrass (the Johnson Mountain
> Boys), and tradition conscious hard country (Dwight
> Yoakam and Marty Brown), you can still hear the raw
> emotions and wild and blue themes of a truly populist
> art form. The "old" story country music has to tell is
> too real and too rooted to be forgotten.

Greetings,

  *Kill Poet in association with Lucent Films has recently shot the full-length documentary, The State of Poem, a spotlight on the evolving face of contemporary poetry across America. The film covers 30 states, 50 poets and includes music by John Lurie, Porches on the Autobahn, and several additional musicians and live bands. Keep an eye out for the Fall 2007 release.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present
Friday, February 23, at 7:30
Jill Magi & Jonny Farrow

Jill Magi and Jonny Farrow present: Has anybody seen my social memory??  An
evening investigating the inscribed and incorporated aspects of remembering
-- sound, video, writing, and images that are
personal? and civic responses to place, history, and the body.  Jill Magi
(poet and visual artist) and Jonny Farrow (sound artist and musician) will
perform collaborative works from SLOT / The Exhibitionary Complex, a
work-in-progress of sound and language landscapes in an era of
museums and memorials.  Jill will also present visual work and writing from
Threads (Futurepoem 2007), a book project that explores the fused concerns
of family, storytelling, silence, history, and the book itself.


About Jill Magi's Threads, Ammiel Alcalay writes, "Inflection implicates us
in family language we hardly understand, in old country we are also
responsible for destroying and recreating in a new world and word order
whose mapping remains the task at hand. These Threads work between the
telling of a story and history to inhabit such burdens of belated homecoming
that stay the legacy of conquest."

I've been a really big country fan--a music fan of all sorts----since a
child.  Country from the very earliest recordings to a number of ctonemporar
musicians.  A guy who has gone out on some more controversial limbs than the
Dixie Chicks is the great steve Earle.  Very early during the the triple War
on Poverty-Drugs-Terrorism he shcoked a lot of people with "Ballad of John
Lind"--the accused "American Taliban".  Earle is in the classic mold of the
country singers--drug addicition, alcoholism, prison time, redemptions of
his own finding, controversial stands.  The variety of genres with in
country is very very wide--one of my favorites is "Psycho-country", some of
the most disturbing songs recorded, having their orgins in the old ballads
of tragedy, murder, betrayal which came over from the British Isles.  (The
first fiddle was brought over by a man named, like Johnny Rotten, John
Lydon, in the 17th century.) The original Feminist singer--Lorretta Lynn's
great inspsirtion--was Kitty Wells, recording outpsoen songs in the Fifties.
  Coutry music has handled about every dark side of human nature one can
tink of or think up--the flip side of the powerful gospel sining many
singers expereince gorwing up and which will influemce them to the end, even
a hard core determined sinner like jerry Lee Lewis started off at a minstry
school--expleed for playing boogie woogie music during the
services--couldn't help himself.  (His cousin is Jimmy Swaggart and his
first wife was a second cousin, 13 when they amarried--he was on his second
marriage and 18.)
It's always saddned me how much great music and some of the greatest
musicians an singers and song writers in american history--that people miss
with their prejudices against country for reasons they would find
contemptible in others if they were prejudiced against musics on the basis
of class, regional background, accents and the like.
Country and r & b coming togetehr to make the early rock and roll and
rockaabilly changed the nation for good and opened the door to lot of the
achievments of the various progressive movements of the times.  Yes, a lot
of country can be jingositic to say the least, but the hard core country is
one of the great american musics with Jazz and blues, R & B and Hip Hop Hard
Core etc--you can find country music in Conjunto for example and mixed with
other forms of Latin Music--and lot of country influence i reggae, too--esp
with buildingoff of thelyrics and melodies by DJs and Toasters--and in some
Dub pieces--a friend who went to Reaggae Sunsplash one year told me the
biggest hit of the events was Skeeter Davis--("I Forgot More Than You'll
Ever Know (about him)""The End of the World").  There have been tons of
Reaggae country covers--
And wa a continual exhcnage back and fort between coutnry and soul music in
the Sixties and early Seveneties.  Freddy fender is and Immortal God--the
first Lartin and Indian mixed Superstar--AmericanIndian Marvin Rainwater had
hits in the fifties--when I was married into the Mowack tribe via m first
wife --(is a matriarchal society)--countr was what everybody listened to al
the time.
     No need to mention all the country rock musicians of last almost fourty
years now--or great singer/songwriters like Townes van Zandt.
   One of the greatest musical experiences i have had was t o see/hear live
two of my musical gods on consecutive nights--George Jones outdoors in a
pasture setting at a county Fair--and next night Fela Ransome Kuti from
Nigeria in downtown Milwaukee.
Geroge Jones is kind of the country male equivalent i singing of Oum
Kalsoum, one of the great singers of the world in their musics.
      So it's always made me sad people miss so much with the easy
prejudices against the music--based on their stereotypes of the people.
Other fans of country wil bring this up from time to time.  Some of the
great country covers have been done by Social Distortion--"Ring of fire" and
"Makin Believe" esp.
         Listening to really early country on Harry Smith's classic
compilation of Anthology of American Folk Music and early Johnny
paycheck--"Pardon Me, I've Got Someone to Kill" and the heartbreakin' "Apt
#9" made famous by Tammy Wynette.
     In the immortal lines from the George Jones song--"Time Don't Mean a
Thing To Me (I've got Life to Go")(life in an East Texas Prison--song
inspired by prisoner who came up and spoke to George after a show there--)--
      Check out Lucinda Williams for some truly great songwriting and
music--

>
>And then there is Willie Nelson, who on Valentine's Day

>while arguing for universal health care and a swift

>
>Women in country music - like the Dixie Chicks - have a

>
>Perhaps most memorable are some of Loretta Lynn's

>Vietnam protest song. And though she once feigned
>dozing off while listening to feminist advocate Betty
>Friedan speak as a fellow guest on The David Frost
>Show, Lynn was a pretty controversial women's advocate.
>In "I Wanna Be Free," she wrote of the liberating

>around my finger/ And throw it just as far as I can
>sling 'er." She did the same thing for birth control in
>"The Pill": "The feelin' good comes easy now/ Since

>
>As daring as some outlaw artists have been, the country
>music establishment has often proved even more dogged

>And Cash, never completely at home in the country music

>
>Some of the fondest memories of my west Texas childhood

>Williams, Lefty Frizzell, and Ernest Tubb. In the
>1950s, as I was entering grade school and gaining some awareness of the
>world around me, these sounds served up essential clues to my sense of
>time and place.
>
>A few years later, however, I perceived that some

>popular music. Southern accents, nasal voices, and bad
>grammar, I learned, were the most visible signs of this inferiority. So
>I became self conscious about my drawl and with some vigilance and
>discipline began modifying my twang according to standards I took to be
>more enlightened.
>
>But the full arsenal of Southern stereotypes was not so
>easy to escape. In my 20s, as I began living and
>working in other parts of the country, I came to
>realize that people outside the South, particularly
>politically progressive people outside the South,
>judged white Southerners and nearly all aspects of
>their cultural heritage as backward. And this snobbery
>often found its most candid expression in mocking and ridiculing country
>music.
>
>The elitist views that define popular prejudices about
>the country tradition greeted the music at its
>commercial birth. In the 1920s, when country music
>first felt the pressures of commercialization, rural
>traditions of all kinds were experiencing tensions and challenges
>brought on by industrialization. Country sounds suggesting older and
>more settled ways seemed inherently at odds with rapid social and
>technological change. The music expressed a longing for stability and
>order and deep-seated fears of the temptations of the modern world. At
>the same time, the music could not help but reflect hopes of escaping
>the hardships associated with traditional rural life.
>
>Conflicted feelings also derived from the Southerness
>of the music. While the music of Stephen Foster and the writings of Mark
>Twain fueled romantic notions of the South as an exotic land of
>enchantment, the region also evoked images of slavery and the Civil War,
>the Scopes monkey trial, and the Klan. Thus for many, country music,
>regardless of its subject matter, was nothing more than the sound of
>ignorance and racism. Retaining a stubborn self-consciousness of its
>white, rural, Southern, working class origins, country music today
>continues to attract and repulse listeners by stirring the same opposing
>images. Nonetheless, in a span of 70 years, country music has grown from
>regional to national and international popularity. And presently, the
>music is cresting at a commercial high-water mark justifying marketing
>claims that country is now "America's pop music."
>
>With mass popularity, however, some of the most
>distinctive qualities of country music have been
>diluted. Listening to the musical styles dominating
>country radio, one hears a generic McDonald's styled
>product so stripped of "hayseed" connotations that it
>virtually erases the line between country and various
>forms of easy listening white pop and bland 1970s
>styled corporate rock. While harder and more
>traditional country sounds have not disappeared, the
>market driven industry bias toward an urban-suburban contemporary sound
>has certainly muddled the definition and origins of the musical idioms
>known as country.
>
>Like other music forms of our culture, country music is
>an amalgam of influences. Its sound, song structure,
>and lyrical text reveal a heavy debt to African
>American musical styles, particularly blues and gospel. Rhythmically,
>country draws most on the dance meters of English and European country
>dance tunes. As to lyrics and narrative style, country storytelling has
>roots in Southern Protestant sermonizing, barroom banter, front porch
>story swapping, and the general character of regional oral traditions.
>Other distinctive characteristics relate to the way the music is
>performed. Unlike many pop performers, country singers write much of
>their material bringing a subjective, direct voice to their performance.
>Like blues singers, they aim for intimacy more than technical
>sophistication. In the singer's voice and story lay the central appeal
>of country music.
>
>Though country music is a vocal music above all else,
>its instrumental sound is unique and immediately
>identifiable. It begins with the guitar and is filled
>out with fiddle, banjo, mandolin, dobro, bass, pedal
>steel guitar, and harmonica. The distinctive country
>sound comes from the way the musicians play these
>instruments with flat picks, finger picks, bottlenecks,
>and bow. In contrast to the smooth, melodic approach of
>pop and classical music, country players, again showing
>an African American influence, favor a rough-edged
>attack with strings popped, scraped, hammered, and
>frailed. Mirroring the unadorned vocal sound,
>instrumental solos and fills are deliberately
>"unrefined." The emphasis is on sounds that
>counterpoint the social and emotional realism conveyed
>by the singer and the song. Accordingly, country sounds
>are harsh, rowdy, romantic, humorous, and rousing. Most
>of all, they are mournful.
>
>Did you ever see a robin weep When leaves begin to die
>
>That means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I
>could cry
>
>--Hank Williams
>
>Historically the most dominant and unmistakable quality
>of the country sound is sadness. One of the great
>stereotypes plaguing country music is the cry-in-the-
>beer loser drowning the pain of romantic loss in some
>dark tavern. But the heartbreak in country music runs
>deeper than cheating, drinking, and divorce. The sad
>tale country music has to tell goes back to the
>devastation the region suffered during the Civil War,
>the loss of rural identity, and the great migration of Southerners to
>urban centers in the Midwest and West during the 1940s and 1950s.
>Understandably, country music is homesick music, permanently colored by
>feelings of longing and lost innocence.
>
>The loss at the heart of the country song has been
>expressed through two divergent impulses. When the
>Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers came to Bristol,
>Tennessee in August 1927 to perform before record scout
>Ralph Peer and a Victor Talking Machine, they brought
>with them distinct bodies of material representing
>seemingly contradictory themes and values. In the
>Carter Family's huge repertoire of traditional songs
>resided the morally decent old-time virtues of work,
>family, humility, and Christian fellowship. By
>contrast, Rodgers, an ex-railroad brakeman from
>Meridian, Mississippi, wrote tunes with roots in blues
>and jazz, folk and cowboy songs, work gang hollers and
>pop. Though Rodgers wrote his share of songs glorifying
>the home and family, his work also celebrated the lives
>of hell-raisers, hoboes, wayward lovers, criminals,
>rounders, and ramblers.
>
>Both approaches proved immediately popular. By 1933,
>the year of his death from tuberculosis, Jimmie Rodgers
>had become country's first crossover success and in the
>South his status was near mythic. And by the time the
>Carter Family disbanded in 1943, their music was well-
>known throughout the United States, as well as parts of
>Canada, Mexico, England, Ireland, and Australia. Aside
>from establishing the commercial viability of country
>music, the breakthroughs of Rodgers and the Carter
>Family gave the shared musical culture of the white
>South coherence. Though commercialization accelerated
>the homogenization of sounds, by documenting the
>diversity of local and regional styles it also helped Southerners gain a
>fuller sense of their common cultural heritage. The music labeled
>"hillbilly" dramatized what they suffered, survived, and left behind. It
>offered solace and understanding, realism and escape. But most of all,
>it was music that responded to change with a reassertion of tradition.
>The Carter Family's religious tunes and sentimental ballads and Jimmie
>Rodgers' chronicles of the rambling man, in different ways, mapped the
>boundaries of tradition and the dire consequences of its breakdown.
>
>Because of this emphasis on Southerness and tradition,
>country music has long been associated with all that is reactionary.
>However, while country music generally expresses a conservative outlook,
>the view of country as an exclusively white, male-dominated, right-wing
>tradition is unfair and one-dimensional. At no point in its history has
>country music expressed a consistent political ideology. Although
>performers such as W. Lee O'Daniel, Jimmie Davis, and Roy Acuff have run
>for political office and many country musicians have endorsed candidates
>and aired opinions in public, the music resists easy ideological
>labeling. Every hard- headed patriotic diatribe like "Okie From
>Muskogee" can be matched by songs like Waylon Jennings's multicultural,
>egalitarian anthem "America" and James Talley's ode to populist
>rebellion "Are They Gonna Make Us Outlaws Again?":

>And someone took the beatin', Lord
>
>And someone got the prize
>
>Well, that may be the way its been
>
>But that don't mean its right
>
>More importantly, since country music has always been a
>voice for small farmers, factory hands, day laborers,
>the displaced and unemployed, its harsh portraits of
>work and everyday life carry an implicit critique of capitalism. Instead
>of overt political protest, country songs prefer to deliver social
>criticism through poignant descriptions of economic hardship and family
>sacrifice. Some of the best examples of this style of protest are Merle
>Haggard's "Mama's Hungry Eyes," Dolly Parton's "Coat Of Many Colors,"
>and Loretta Lynn's "Coal Miner's Daughter."
>
>As to the issue of race, country music's sentimental

>Some of the strongest stereotypes attached to country
>music revolve around the social and sexual roles of
>women. To many people Tammy Wynette's 1968 hit "Stand
>By Your Man" typifies the passive, long suffering
>mentality of the unliberated country woman. In truth,
>the female perspective in country music is much broader
>and far more assertive than this superficial stereotype
>can allow. The richest and most authoritative evidence
>of this reality can be found in Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann's
>Finding Her Voice: The Saga Of Women In Country Music(Crown Publishers
>Inc., New York). This 541 page narrative tracing the lives and music of
>country women from the late 19th century up to the present, shows how
>country music has encouraged white working class women in their
>struggles to survive and resist "economic exploitation, sexual
>subjugation, and limited opportunities."
>
>Exploring the folk origins of country music, Bufwack
>and Oermann argue that women were the primary
>folklorists for early rural music, memorizing the tunes
>and lyrics that provided the basic entertainment for
>the family and community. And in their own original
>ballads, women expressed sexual fantasies and
>discontents in songs loaded with images of romantic
>longing, promiscuity, violence, and death. Bufwack and
>Oermann also reveal more active and socially oriented resistance in the
>depression era songs of Sarah Gunning, the composer of "I Hate The
>Capitalist System," and Aunt Molly Jackson, who began making up class
>conscious songs and walking picket lines before she was ten.
>
>It was not until the 1950s, however, that women in
>country music began to gain commercial equality with
>men. Following Kitty Well's surprising 1952 hit "It
>Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"--a woman's
>retort to Hank Thompson's "The Wild Side Of Life--women
>singers such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly
>Parton, and Tammy Wynette started achieving record
>sales and stardom rivaling country men. The appeal of
>the modern country female star, Bufwack and Oermann
>note, in many ways mirrored general trends in country
>music. Country tunes of the 1950s and 1960s still
>focused on subjects of work, family, and religion. But reflecting an
>audience that was now struggling to come to grips with the realities of
>urban life and wage labor, the music increasingly dealt with alcoholism,
>infidelity, and divorce. Reacting to these problems from a distinctly
>female point of view, country women stepped forward with songs
>displaying tougher attitudes. Sad songs of betrayal prevailed, but women
>now would sing also of sexual freedom and nights on the town. And in
>love songs, women would voice a straightforward demand for relationships
>based on fair play and an end to double standards.
>
>Some of the purest samples of this new toughness came
>in a string of popular tunes by Loretta Lynn. With a
>basic hard country sound and a writing style favoring down-to-earth blue
>collar bluntness, Lynn laid down the law to men in songs such as "Fist
>City" and "Don't Come Home A-Drinking (With Loving On Your Mind)." With
>her singles "The Pill" and "One's On The Way," Lynn also became the
>first popular country singer to publicly advocate for birth control.
>These attitudes and Lynn's reputation for gearing her shows to women,
>earned her a legion of devoted, fanatical fans, including a large
>lesbian following.
>
>Although few country music women of the 1950s and 1960s
>made music as self-consciously for women as Lynn, the
>emergence of country women superstars put "the woman's perspective" on
>substantially more equal terms with that of the working man. By 1984
>about one-fourth of the top country singles and albums were by women.
>And today's country and pop charts are overflowing with country
>women--Reba McEntire, Wynonna Judd, Mary Chapin-Carpenter, Trisha
>Yearwood, Suzy Bogguss, Kathy Mattea, Patty Loveless, Pam Tillis, and
>K.T. Oslin, to mention only a few. Most significantly, the commercial
>appeal of the current generation of country women seems directly linked
>to a feminist oriented lyric. Lorrie Morgan, for instance, takes clear
>control of her relationships in "What Part Of No," "Watch Me," and "5
>Minutes." Michelle Wright shows off a similar attitude on "Take It Like
>A Man." And Martina McBride rebels against an abusive husband on
>"Independence Day." As these examples suggest (and many others could be
>given), the most progressive and defiant strains of contemporary country
>music are being created by women.
>
>While the politics of country music eludes many popular prejudices and
>neat categories of left and right, the fundamental conservatism of the
>message cannot be denied. Country's conservatism, however, comes not
>from taking a particular stand on particular issues, but in the way it
>reads and resolves conflict. Country music may be one of the truest
>forms of popular music in giving voice to the bitter realities of class
>and the sorry state of male-female relations. But in offering few
>avenues of escape and rebellion, country music tends to settle struggle
>in favor of the powers that be. Change in country music comes mostly
>from individual hard work and sacrifice, luck, and God. The music's
>vision of community is insular and backward looking. And as a result,
>failure breeds feelings of self-blame and resignation.
>
>Nonetheless, country's stoic acceptance of things as
>they are cannot be taken as an unqualified endorsement
>of the status quo. The great strength of country music
>has been its ability to capture white working class
>life as it really is and without the projection of
>false hope. Country music knows you can't always get
>what you want or what you need no matter how hard you
>try. In this realistic assessment of limits, the music contradicts
>capitalist ideals of progress, fairness, and happiness through

>country music has been dismissed as something beneath and apart from
>mainstream culture.
>
>Fully aware of country music's "negatives," the

Catching up with old digest messages here. Yes, folks like Seisensui, Santoka, Hosai, and others were wonderful rule-breakers. They're among my favourites, and in my journal Tundra #1 I published a selection of Seisensui translations by Hiroaki Sato. These poets broke the rules from a position of knowledge, though, rather than not being sufficiently aware of the expectations and practices of literary haiku. The movement that some of these "free-meter" haiku poets were part of pretty much died out, however, though Santoka remains particularly loved in Japan, somewhat the way Issa is.

I have several books of haiku by Santoka and Hosai (don't know of any books strictly of Seisensui, though), and also have most of Makoto Ueda's books (Ueda is on the advisory board for my journal Tundra.

Howtodisappear


The disappearance of the branch into hardened rock and occasional
artifacts. The root of the avatar is elsewhere; the avatar itself, the
image-avatar, is ghost. The ghost travels through anything of course; it's
nothing more than coordinates. Howtodisappear.mov, however primitive, is
the beginning of transparency, wizard listening-posts on MOOs for example.

New River Journal ( http://www.cddc.vt.edu/journals/newriver/ ), the
first online journal devoted exclusively to digital writing and art,
is pleased to announce the release of its premier issue for 2007.
After a period of dormancy, New River Journal has been redesigned and
reborn, complete with exciting new works by some of today's leading
digital authors.

New River Journal was founded by Virginia Tech English Professor Ed
Falco in 1996, with the assistance of Len Hatfield, a computer guru
then on the Virginia Tech faculty. The online publication has
consistently tested the boundaries and rules of writing in a digital
age. This new issue marks the first time the journal has been managed
and edited by students participating in the MFA Creative Writing
Program in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences. Managing
editors for the inaugural launch are two graduate students, Laura
Dulaney and Bryon Sabol.

The managing editors, with the help of Brent Jesiek of Virginia
Tech's Center for Digital Discourse and Culture, redesigned the New
River Journal's website to provide a user friendly interface and
easier access to the journal's archive. Beginning with this issue,
the Journal plans to post new issues twice a year, in December and
May.

The current issue includes works by David Herrstrom, Jason Nelson,
and Dan Waber.

David Herrstrom's "The Nicodemus Glyph" is a heady investigation of
the ancient author and teacher, Nicodemus. Herrstrom has constructed
the Glyph to taunt the reader's desire for more definite knowledge of
Nicodemus, while simultaneously signaling that we can never fully
know a historical person or circumstance.

Jason Nelson's work tests the boundary between "game-like" interfaces
and serious poetry. "Poetry Cube" not only allows readers to
reorganize Nelson's words, but it also allows them to enter their own
poetry and, with the click of a button, shuffle the lines into an
array of possibilities. "Between Treacherous Objects" takes a form
reminiscent of a video game flight simulator. Using the mouse,
readers fly through the space of images and poetry, choosing to stop
where they desire.

Dan Waber's "Writing Through Time" examines and challenges the
limitations and constructs of space and time as they traditionally
apply to the written words. Words appear and disappear on the "page,"
creating a layered fabric of text and meaning that can be further
manipulated by the reader.

The Virginia Tech MFA Creative Writing Program was established in
2005. New River Journal's managing editors Dulaney and Sabol are
members of the program's first class. The New River Journal is
currently hosted by the Center for Digital Discourse and Culture.

Jason, some comments in response to your detailed message. Regarding the features you were incorporating into your verses, it seems to me that you suceeded in some cases, but with the following possible exceptions, at least in haiku terms (see the numbered list that follows below). On the other hand, if you were trying to create borderline haiku, you succeeded, I suppose, but perhaps the citizenship of your verses is still foreign to haiku. Since you asked if I thought they were still haiku or not, I would say no. Somehow, Jerry Kilbride's "mine / lifting /fog" is still haiku, but it is certainly on the fringe. Something in your verses takes them across the border.

You also make an interesting comment about a "normative" element that can be prescriptive, which I have to fight in my reactions to some poems I read, as it runs the risk of killing the life of the poem. I also have to guard against the label of "haiku" as meaning "good haiku," so you are right to ask if there can be poems that are bad haiku but still haiku -- to which the answer is of course yes. It can have all the "prescribed" elements, and still lack freshness, or be weakly crafted. Your verses, though clearly crafted and brimming with freshness, depart from the prescribed elements enough that I personally have trouble admitting them as haiku. Someone else might feel differently. However, I doubt they'd ever find a place in most of the haiku journals publishing in North America. Such a claim might say something negative about the sensitivity range of the editors in question, but if they are gatekeepers of haiku, it may also say something about what they think is important
 in haiku. But yes, a poem can be bad but still be a haiku. It can be a haiku if the poet wants to call it that, of course, but discounting that generous approach, it can still be a haiku for other aesthetic reasons (that is, by hitting enough of the "haiku" targets), and fail for not hitting them very well. The haiku journal Haiku Headlines, edited monthly by David Priebe since 1988 until his death last year, is a case in point. The majority of the poems are deathly, as haiku (I've used its poems as examples of "bad haiku" in my workshops -- I have a file folder for large printouts of the poems, even), yet sure, they're still haiku. And even the best haiku journals have "better" or "weaker" poems, though often such rankings are in the eye of the beholder. Then there are the pseudo-haiku poems in books such as *Haikus for Jews* or *Honku*, and so on, which hit the wrong 5-7-5 target, and may have other virtues, but are essentially ignorant of most haiku necessities (or choose
 to ignore them). If haiku is a "genre," and thus broad rather than overly narrow, then these poems are still "haiku," because they try to hit the target(s) that the poet *thinks* a haiku should hit. To me, they have very little to do with haiku, and are more damaging than helpful to haiku as literature for their perpetuation of misunderstandings, though that's really a separate issue. Actually, though, I think it's hard for a haiku to be a "bad" haiku and yet still successfully *be* a haiku, because the more you "prove" the poems haiku-ness, the more you're going to tip it towards being a good haiku, or at least that's my hunch. There's some philosophical danger, there, because the term "haiku shouldn't be a form of encomium, as you say. Most of Sonia Sanchez's poems offered as haiku are what I would consider *good* nonhaiku. Others might think of them as bad haiku, but that isn't fair to what she's trying to do with vernacular voice. And I could start citing all sorts of ot
her poems and talk about whether they're haiku or not, or whether they're good or bad, but it's hard to know where to start. And I would have only one opinion, of course!

Anyway, here are some thoughts in reaction to the four criteria you set for yourself:

1. Nature references. Yes, you had nature references, but, in "warm santa / ana," using an essentially nonnatural term for the wind tends to distance the poem from the only natural element therein (the wind). A lot of readers wouldn't even know that you're referring to wind, which isn't necessarily a problem, but it is a risk you take. And in the lycra verse, the reference to "plant" is so generic as to not conjure up much of a nature image. Similarly, the reference to rain in the "march flush" poem is fairly slight as a nature reference, and might even be read as nonliteral. But again, I actually don't care about haiku having nature references or not. That's not the aim of haiku, as I understand it. Rather, haiku aims at the seasonal reference, and this happens to embrace nature much of the time, but it's really the season word that matters.

2. Seasonality. Again, yes, but not always clearly. The reference to "march" is ambiguous in many ways. Could you mean to march along, as a verb, since you lowercased it? So we don't know for certain if you meant March as the month. More than that, though, March means one season in the northern hemisphere, and an opposite season below the equator, so it's not as seasonally clear or universal as saying "cherry blossoms," for example. I don't sense any season in the lycra verse. I suppose the action of green colors "waxing" (as opposed to waning) could suggest the deepening of summer, but that could be too much of a leap for some readers, especially when the word "wax" is easily interpretted as a noun rather than a verb. And the Santa Ana winds are seasonal, but because they're a regional phenomenon, their function as a seasonal reference not be clear to many readers (and they're not limited to a single season, say, like cherry blossoms, so it has less "sharpness" than other se
asonal references). Also, there's a difference between a seasonal reference and a season word (or kigo). The kigo tradition includes the overtone of allusion to other poems that use the same season word, depending on the season word. This won't happen with every season word, or there can be too many excellent poems for it to be clear which ones you might want to evoke, but in some cases a specific reference can be clear (and of course, allusion can be accomplished outside the season word as well). At the very least, though, the use of specific kigo respectfully invokes the entire tradition of that particular season word, if not a specific poem that has used it before.

3. Juxtaposition. In your "march flush" poem, it's too hard to parse the various possible meanings of the words and lines, thus making it hard to narrow down to the ONE "juxtaposition" that a good haiku usually has. Or, in the case of "warm santa / ana [wind] crumples silver / paper," there's no juxtaposition at all, at least not a grammatical one, because the lines read as a single grammatical unit, despite the line breaks (it's not the dreaded "Complete Sentence" you were trying to avoid, but it's still a single grammatical unit). Same with "a cotton lycra weave lifts / from plants it catches." There's actually no grammatical juxtaposition here at all either. And "green / colors / wax" can also be read as a single grammatical unit. It also becomes so minimalist (which is fine, but:) that it is really seeking to do other things than juxtaposition. The juxtaposition that goes on in haiku happens in various ways. To be closer to the Japanese tradition of the kireji, or cutting
 word, my sense is that the juxtaposition in an English-language haiku needs to be a stronger caesura, or cut. This tends to require the poem to have two grammatically unrelated fragments (not three, and not just one fragment). The juxtaposition is thus grammatical as well as contextual. You have mostly contextual juxtapositions, not grammatical ones. In the extreme, a contextual juxtaposition is like writing about an elephant and a doily, which can be startling and fresh, but there also needs to be a grammatical "juxtaposition" also -- akin to a caesura, but stronger, in the sense of having two fragments that are (most often) grammatically unrelated. For example:

spring breeze--
the pull of her hand
as we near the pet store

4. Single experience/immediacy. This is where I think you achieved the most -- with single experiences. Immediacy in your verses is clouded, at least for me, by line breaks, by ambiguity as to whether certain words are nouns or verbs (too much ambiguity of syntax, I'd say, at least for haiku, but I guess that *was* what you were aiming at), and by other trouble parsing the grammar. Compare the immediacy of your verses to the immediacy of my verse above. Perhaps it's too "simple" for you or other readers, and you think there's no "there" there. Could be. But by focusing on a tactile sensation (haiku is a poetry of the five senses -- hence the title of one of my haiku workshops, "Come to Your Senses"), the poem gains authenticity and immediacy, and pairs it with a fitting seasonal reference (in this case the naming of the season, which may be the cheapest sort of season word). The season references should usually be more than just a weather report, however, but should have an e
motional rightness to it. The preceding verse makes no mention of how old the female in the poem is, but nearly all people who hear or read this poem have told me that they imagine a child. Yet why is that? It's not stated at all. Yet it is suggested, through association with spring, the season of youthful beginnings, by breeze, which is lighter than wind or gale, and by the pet store, where we may easily imagine puppies and kittens. Yet all of this is, hopefully, intuitive, and part of the "immediate" gestalt of the poem. This is the sort of immediacy a good haiku is after, and it's best if it's not cluttered by overly clever wordings. As I think Basho said, haiku is like a finger pointing at the moon, and if the finger is too bejeweled, we no longer see the moon.

Indeed, as Jack Kerouac said, haiku should be as simple as porridge. Though the tone is different, it's like a good joke -- saying only what needs to be said, and nothing more. Like the engine in a car, a haiku should have only necessary parts. And like I say in the haiku workshops I give, a haiku should not be as short as possible, but as short as *necessary*, which makes a world of difference.

Hope these comments are of help to some.

Michael

P.S. Interesting to read that your "green / colors / wax" poem was so directly derived from or inspired by the Kilbride poem. Here's a similar minimalist poem of mine, that may or may not be a haiku (each line is meant to be centered):

Subject: Re: Haiku as a genre

Thanks for your comments michael, I think your comments are interesting. I got
some b/c comments about them from charles rossiter too, and I wanted to
clarify something, and loathe as I am to do reads of my own poems, i do want to
explain what i was trying to do with these because i composed them
with the intention of trying to create "borderline" cases of haiku, that is,
poems that fit uncomfortably within the genre. It's a sort of experiment,
and one i'll probably pursue, but in response to your comments i'd like to shed
a little light to see if maybe your greater experience with haiku
might help me with my next foray into this kind of thing.

so, basically, the task I set myself was to compose several poems that had the
following features:

1.) some reference to nature
2.) some reference to seasonality
3.) a juxtaposition of elements
4.) a sense of a single experience or immediacy

all the while remaining true to my own personal poetic commitments which involve
among other things a certain ambiguity of syntax and the forcing of
multivalence through the use of glued together sentence fragments and the
resistance to the received form that most people know as The Complete
Sentence. So I dashed off those poems to try to see just where the borders of
the haiku might lie. as experiments, i'm not particularly concerned with
how good they are, but i am interested in whether or not you think they're
haiku, and if not, why not? I'll admit that i have a suspicion you have an
so far undiscussed normative element that is in some way prescriptive and
laudatory, that is, i get the impression from some of your statements that
for you "haiku" is as much a name of a genre of poetry as it is a form of
encomium. So there's a second question i have that i haven't yet asked: can
a poem be bad (as is most certainly the case with my fourth example, by far the
weakest of the four in my opinion but also one that i think is very
haiku-like given my understanding of the genre) and still be a haiku? and to
that point, what makes a bad haiku bad while allowing it to remain a haiku?

toward that end:

rain on
march flush
on the student body

relies on several puns, the first the fact that march is a verb, a noun, and a
Month (and from that seasonality); that "the student body" can be
either a group of students or the body of a particular student; and finally that
flush can either mean against and adjacent to (self-referencing the
juxtaposition of the outdoors of a rain on a group of marching students) and the
very intimate image of a young persons body that is "flushed" for
some reason.

warm santa
ana crumples silver
paper

is meant to turn on any number of things, but the primary turn is the one that
you seem to have missed that while ana is a female name, and santa is a
bearded guy who brings presents, 'santa ana' is the name of a kind of warm wind
that happens in the autumn and spring in southern california. other
things i tried to pack in there is the traditional. so this one was really
playing with the idea of genre by attempting to juxtapose seasons (autumn
winter spring) while the other images juxtapose age (the bearded old man with
the young girl exuberantly ripping paper).

a cotton lycra weave lifts
from plants it catches

I won't comment any further on this one, Murat gave it precisely the reading i'd
intended and i'd like to thank him for it, except to point out that
part of the "juxtaposition" is the fact that cotton is a "natural" material
derived from a low growing shrub that has sticks that could easily catch a
garment, and lycra which is one of that is wholly synthetic made out of chains
of polymers. both are the most widely used fibers in textiles of their
respective types (synthetic or natural) and a large portion of garments worn in
north america are made out a cotton/lycra fabrics. Also, while i went
looking for pictures to show you, i found out that lycra is actually a brand
name, and the etymology of cotton is from the arabic al qutun, which
while neither here nor there poetically, might reveal more meaning if delved
into more deeply.

finally the last, and I think weakest, of the four i posted. It's interesting
that you mentioned
mime
lifting
fog

because my
green
colors
wax

is a semi-procedural, aleatorical poem derived from kilbride's poem (which i
like an awful lot, btw).

what i did was move all the vowels in kilbrides poem back in the mouth

so from the dipthong in mime /aI/, i got the dipthong /iu/. I couldn't think of
a word for that, so i cheated and shortened it to /i/
from the /I/ in lifting, i got to the /uh/ of colors
and from the ah in fog, i got the the aaa in wax. (there really ought to be an
easy way to type IPA characters).

so from there it was just a matter of fitting consonants around the vowels until
I got a sequence of words that i liked. my problem with this one is
that it stinks of the sort of cleverness that i generally don't like in poetry
and that seems to be the stock in trade of writers like Billy Collins
for example, but that was done well (thanks to the heavy injection of humanity)
by Ted Berrigan, so I let this one live.

basically, it all turns on the double meaning of "grean" "colors" and "wax" if
green is a noun, colors is a verb and wax is a noun, you have an image
of a crayon being made. if colors is the noun, green is an adjective, and wax is
the verb, you have the image of flowering plants as the green of
spring spreads. alternately, you could have green and wax as nouns, and colors
as the verb, but read wax as the subject and green as the object, which
is an image of someone using a crayon. all of which connote young life and
growth. but again, i think this one is mostly crap primarily because there
isn't much of an image in it, and i generally prefer short poems with strong
images that aren't as necessary in longer pieces.

ugh. even though i had a reason to do it, that's still not fun to do. sorry to
inflict you all with my explanations. Basically none of these are
great, but i would like to know michael, seeing how i read them from my
standpoint on reading poetry, are they haiku do you think? are they the
borderline cases i intended them to be? and if they aren't, do you think you
could point me at some borderline cases, or perhaps some people who push
at what haiku can and write haiku that might be of questionable pedigree?

also, to my earlier point, i would LOVE to see an example of something you think
is a BAD haiku that is still successfully haiku.

thanks again for the comments on my four macedonia/zappai/maybe-haiku/

Today, in MY blog (over a thousand visits in just
three years!) I mention having gotten my Comprepoetica
file of Small Press Review columns up-to-date.  The
latest is about Crag Hill's blog.  I spend most of it
on analyzing a poem Crag composed using first lines
from Charles Olson.  The entry to the files is here:
http://www.geocities.com/Comprepoetica/spr-stuff/index.html.

My columns, by the way, go back to June 1993, so
provide a fairly lengthy record of recent marginal
poetry.

Does anyone know where I can see some of Yuri Kapralov's artwork  online? I'm
currently reading his wonderful book, "Once There Was a Village",  and I knew
him slightly when I lived in the East Village.  I'd very much  like to see
some these "piano constructions" he talks about (art made of found  objects,
esp. old pianos). Any suggestions would be  helpful.   Thanks- Seena Liff

Dear Friends and Colleagues -
I'm writing to say a basic hello, and I hope this message finds you well
and in good spirits. It's been a while!

This is just a quick email about a project I'm really happy about. I've
been a big Yoko Ono fan for years, and this is a mini project we put
together a while ago. Thurston Moore from Sonic Youth plays guitar on the
track, and the whole album has folks like Cat Power, The Flaming Lips,
Peaches, Hank Shocklee (who produced Public Enemy), and others.

The album title is called Yes, I'm a Witch and its Yoko's first full length
album in a while. If you have a moment, the track I did with her is up on
my myspace page, and the full album has just been released on Astralwerks.
It's called "Rising" and its one of Yoko's poems - her voice came out great
in the mixdown!

Check it out!

Subject:      T-Shirt Without Vowels
Comments: cc: amy king <amyhappens@yahoo.com>

=8AOh, that traveling salesman. And, enthused, I bought away from the long
procession of vowels in pajamas=8A from "Where Shall I Wander" by John
Ashberry.

On the street on Sunday I encountered a slightly drunk black man in a black
t-shirt with a grid of twelve variably configured black and white squares.
Each white square contained a black capital, block-shaped consonant (D, N,
P, X, etc). Each of the black squares were empty.

Under the grid - in white scripted letters - was the query:

Can You Sell Me A Vowel?

Presumably, if one could =8Cbuy=B9 the right white vowels, they could fill the
empty black squares. Instead of the sight of edgy, disparate consonants, th=
e
grid would be transformed into =8Creal=B9 words. Without knowing these words in
advance, one might assume, that the grid would reveal a new found harmony, =
a
kind of microcosm, the creation of a clarity, and the shirt would offer a
formal moment - at least - of universal order.

I am not sure if because the man was an African-American - so often
disenfranchised from so much in this country - that the dissonance in the
shirt was made even more striking.

I asked him where got the great shirt. It looked brand new.

=B3I got it at some festival 10 years ago. Finally decided to put it on
today.=B2

I was tempted to ask if I could buy the shirt off his back. But he looked s=
o
great in it. In fact, I liked the idea of him, this sunny afternoon, as he
did, continue to walk down the street and letting the striking shirt - its
grid of no vowels and un-conjoined consonants - give the comfortable
appearing public a certain edge, a particular vision of =8Creality=B9, a glimps=
e
between order and not order, words and not words, provision and not
provision.

A "walking poem", yes, indeed.

I screwed up and posted this as a reply to a post it
had nothing to do with.  Apologies.  So I'm reposting.


Today, in MY blog (over a thousand visits in just
three years!) I mention having gotten my
Comprepoetica file of Small Press Review columns
up-to-date.  The latest is about Crag Hill's blog.  I
spend most of it on analyzing a poem Crag composed
using first lines from Charles Olson.  The entry to

My columns, by the way, go back to June 1993, so
provide a fairly lengthy record of recent marginal
poetry.

The following may be of concern to Buffalo List members. Other reviews
from the current issue of The Rain Review of Books are now online too:
http://www.rainreview.net

Jon Paul Fiorentino & Robert Kroetsch, eds., Post-Prairie: An Anthology of
New Poetry (Vancouver: Talonbooks, 2005)

Derek Beaulieu, Jason Christie & Angela Rawlings, eds., Shift and Switch:
New Canadian Poetry (Toronto: The Mercury Press, 2005)

Reviewed by Michael Barnholden
The Rain 4:2 (Summer-Autumn 2006): 4

On January 24, 1975 a Canadian military passenger plane landed at the
Winnipeg International Airport. It was late at night and cold—forty
below—when approximately one hundred passengers: men, women and
children—most wearing T-shirts and jeans—walked across the tarmac into a
new life. The plane had left Chile many hours before, after the family
members were driven to the airport in Santiago to meet the prisoners who
had arrived separately. They all were transported in military vehicles,
bringing only as much as they could carry. Their excitement was mixed with
dread as aircraft flights in Chile at this time often ended badly for
certain of the passengers. They had been told little or nothing depending
on the mood of their escorts, only that they were going into exile and
they would no longer be welcome in Chile. These men and women were among
the first and perhaps luckiest victims of the roll-out phase of
neo-liberalism, when Augusto Pinochet aided by the CIA at the behest of
large international copper mining interests mounted a coup d’etat against
the democratically elected socialist government of Salvador Allende.

Lucky, because they had not been “disappeared”. Victims, because many of
them had spent the intervening time held in atrocious prisoner of war
conditions without charge or trial. Most had no idea whether their
families were alive or dead. The Canadian government, under enormous
pressure, had hypocritically offered to take a limited number of political
prisoners from Chile. The government feared the refugees, who had
strenuously protested the nationalization of the copper mines owned by
Canadian-based multinationals, would be too far left for Canadian
political culture. 9/11/73, the date Pinochet took over in Chile, was one
of the first major undertakings that demonstrated the reach of
alreadyexisting neo-liberal hegemonies.

Poetry anthologies are notoriously difficult, both for what or who is
included or excluded. Among recent anthologies there is also the shopworn
impulse to anthologize the “new”. Shopworn, because if you are limiting
your collection to Canadian poetry—Canadian publishers are restricted in
their editorial programs by dependence on grant funding from state
agencies—you are pretty much confined to making a case for the new,
whether it makes sense or not. The “old” was either unsuccessful or has
grown irrelevant, so “new” must replace “best” in an attempt to establish
relevance and thus teachability and sales. The poetry anthologies under
consideration, Switch and Shift: New Canadian Poetry and Post-Prairie: An
Anthology of New Poetry, both signal a recognition that something has
already happened and that these are attempts to represent the what of what
has happened. The subtitles extend this understanding and expectation.
However, it is in the introduction that the case for these “news” must be
made.

Neither introduction does it adequately. In fact they are fraught with
contradiction, which of course is reflected in the choice of poems
presented. The three editors in Shift and Switch present three different
and competing rationales for their selections: is it the poetry of the
margins (Beaulieu) or the under-represented (Christie) or the cornucopia
(Rawlings)? The same dynamic is played out in the selections. Because of
the consensus default—it must be assumed that all three editors agreed to
every inclusion, perhaps only one negative vote was needed for
exclusion—you end up with something that is clearly a compromise and not a
happy compromise at that. Perhaps this accounts for Christie’s “sleepless
nights and nail biting”, but he doesn’t tell us.

In Post-Prairie the problem lies with the dual editorship. Although I
don’t really think Kroetsch did much more than have the transcribed
conversation with Fiorentino, reproduced here as the introduction.
Kroetsch seems to contradict his coeditor with statements such as “place
is where it’s at” then later “your stubbornly attentive eye, Jon, makes
this anthology the real and precise news, the underwater trumpet blast,
the lightning-ravaged tree”. These comments sound a lot like the “prairie
poem” this anthology is supposed to be “post-”. I suspect Kroetsch is
having some fun at his colleague’s expense, but it does serve to outline
the problem: the anthology points one way, the poems point other
contradictory ways that negate the intent of the introduction. I would
argue that some of the poems are in fact “prairie poems” with the lyric
“I” outstanding in “his” field, while others, thankfully most, engage with
what is newly apprehended: global(capital)ism.

It is curious to me that three of the five editors are in both
anthologies. I can understand why Kroetsch is not represented in either
anthology, but why Rawlings isn’t in Post Prairie seems weird. I’m sure
she’s been to Calgary. Which of course is the problem with nationalisms
(Canadian) and regionalisms (Prairie): who fits, who doesn’t. Is every
poet born or living on the prairies a prairie poet? Can you write a
prairie poem somewhere else? What is New Canadian Poetry? What constitutes
a Canadian poem? A Canadian? Perhaps instead of bending the poetry to fit
their thesis, such as they are, maybe a closer reading of the actually
existing poetry would help.

There is however, lurking in these two anthologies, another interesting
collection. The little story at the beginning of this piece points to a
previous 9/11 and the beginnings of globalism or neo-liberalism. If the
Writing Class anthology that I coedited back in the nineties can be said
to outline responses and resistances to the roll-back phase of neo-liberal
globalism, the roll-out phase is chronicled in much of the poetry in these
two anthologies. All it needs is a strong introduction and editing. There
is a hint in the publisher’s blurb on Post-Prairie which could serve as a
better organizing principle than what the editors offer. “This change is
marked by the transition of a cultural identity primarily rooted in place
to one that is rooted in a rapidly fragmenting, urbanizing,
technology-based globalization.” Of course there would have to be
decisions made about what constituted a “globalized” poet and that would
probably contradict the “Canadian” poet which, as I have pointed out, is
pretty much all Canadian publishers can publish unless they figure out
ways to break out of the confines of Canadian nationalism.

I think that many of the poets in these anthologies have made those
decisions and are busy producing poems that engage, resist and subvert
globalized capitalism. There are many more not included who have done
likewise. That’s the anthology of the “new” that I’d like to see.

I have long been upset that there are no listing at all from any of the

doesn't cost to list in them . If anyone has any way of encouraging African

Susan--
             It's possible African and other countries might just want to be
for African and other countries' writers, many of whom write in languages
that are not always "international" so need and want their own forums.  Even
writing in "international" languages, perhaps a great many people around the
world feel that their lives are already invaded enough with American
imperialisms in economics/politics/media-- and writing/poetry spaces are
ones that would be areas of freedoms from this.
     "Just what we need!  American writers of "resistant" "radical" poetry
moving in on our areas of resistance! Why do they think their "liberatory"
works will be welcomed where there is Resistance to them imposing themselves
ever deeper into every sphere?"

      (Memories of "Iraqis bearing flowers in Welcome"--and the chasm
between the vision and the reality--a salutory cautionary example to bear in
mind-)

     I imagine--as is this is often the case when it occurs-- that journals
would be interested in American writers--ones who knew of the writing in
other countries-knew the journals and poetry scenes--read them and knew the
langauge and culture---so there is a dialogue--rather than just a one way
street of impositions which would happen by advertising and being flooded by
yet more American products and messages with no interest/connection to a
living poetry and culture essaying its continued creative energies and
survival.

     Just because something is "free"--advertising in Poets' Market for
example--doesn't neccesarily mean that one doesn't pay a price, if not a
very heavy price, not too far down the line.

There are literally *thousands* of books that teach haiku in Japanese. However, I wouldn't know what books to suggest reading, as most of the haiku books I have are in English. Try visiting a bookstore like Kinokuniya (in a few major U.S. cities) or search online at http://www.amazon.co.jp/ (Japan's Amazon.com) or other similar sites, or ask through the Web sites for the Haiku International Association or the World Haiku Association.

A fellow poet Tarre Beach speaks Japanese, and wants to know if there are any
books, ( you might suggest) that teach haiku in Japanese.

Call For Papers: Persian Literature as (a) World Literature

Controlling Question: If Persian literature is not only literature =
written
in Persian, but also literature written by people who, in or way or =
another,
claim a Persian heritage and/or who translate Persian literature into =
other
languages, then Persian literature is being produced right now, all over =
the
world, in many languages other than Persian. Is it fair, then, to call
Persian literature a world literature? If so, what does that label mean =
not
only for Persian literature in itself, but also for the other =
literatures
that interact with it, either by virtue of translation or because =
writers of
Persian descent are producing in the languages of those other =
literatures?
=A0
For a special, Persian literature edition of ArteNews
(www.arteeast.org/artenews/arteeast-artenews.html), the online journal
published by ArteEast (www.arteeast.org), whose mission is "to exhibit =
the
works of artists and filmmakers from the Middle East and its diaspora," =
we
are soliciting submissions in the following categories:
=A0
1. Poetry (3-5 poems): written by Iranians, people of Iranian descent, =
or
people for whom Persian is their language of composition. The poems need =
not
have been written originally in English, but any non-English poems must =
be
accompanied by a strong, literary, English translation.
2. Persian poetry in translation (3-5 poems): from any historical =
period;
the translator must show proof that he or she has the right to publish =
the
translations.
3. Brief essays of no more than 1000 words on any aspect of Persian =
poetry
or literature.
4. Responses of no more than 300-500 words to the controlling question =
at
the top of this call.
=A0
Submission Deadline: March 9, 2007.
Please send submissions to: richardjeffreynewman@verizon.net

Hey Poetics -

I'm excited about the final two readings of the Observable season. They are
going to be SOLID, and if you're anywhere near St. Louis, I hope you'll save
the dates: March 8 (Woodward, Miller, and Gallaher) and April 5 (Chiasson
and Clewell).

For March 8th, we have three readers who all have new books in 2006 or 2007.
And they're really, really good books. Look them up on Amazon, would you?
And forward this, blog this, let people know!

Aaron

March 8, 2007
Observable Readings presents
Jon Woodward, John Gallaher, Wayne Miller
8 PM - Bottleworks in Maplewood - FREE

Jon Woodward:
   A steady hail of ink-columns on mind's face-
   paper: bilaterally symmetrical & small, double
   -taken (from across the room) as
   hiding nothing?

Wayne Miller:
   What I'll allow myself to beleive is admittedly
   not much--the faint mirror of a blank wall,
   the heart ringing with another's words
   like the sympathetic vibration of a bell--.

John Gallaher:
   The children are running across the field, each
   carrying something.
   Each on his or her spindly legs.
   The field's a good field.


More info, of course, is here: http://observable.org/readings/

There Are Words by Burt Kimmelman, published by Dos Madres Press, is now =

"In There Are Words, Kimmelman strives for and often attains 'the simple =

-         Samuel Menashe

"Burt Kimmelman's poems flourish as they pivot from a repertoire of =
reiterated subjects-works of art, natural landscapes, family, the animal =
world-to a transfiguring notion of their properties and possibilities. =
For over twenty-five years, this practice has produced dynamic patterns =
of insight, patterns comprised of recurring figures and forms which =
nevertheless shift in their relations to his poetic witness."

Dear Friends and Colleagues:

Do you know or use the Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics
in any or all of its three editions (1965, 1974, 1993)? Have you
found something useful in it? Do you wish it contained something it
lacks? If you don't spend much time with poetry, do you know
someone elsewhere who does?

Preparation of a fourth edition has begun, and both Roland Greene,
who is Editor-in-Chief, and I, as General Editor, would welcome any
and all suggestions and thoughts about which entries to keep, which
to drop, which to add. We have begun working our way through the
1700 entries of the third edition in order to make these decisions,
and that work should occupy us for the next month or so. If you
have ideas or suggestions, please send them along during this time
(rgreene@stanford.edu or sbc9g@virginia.edu).

And please feel free to forward this message far and wide to
colleagues working with poetry in any language throughout the
United States and in other countries. The Princeton Encyclopedia
has users around the world, and we are trying to cast a world-wide
net.

Gratefully,

Hello all "poetic-al" people.
Recently it has been suggested that there is not enough poetry within =20
POETICS discussions. Let's make up for it. Responses to this post must =20
be in the form of a poem, discussing whatever you wish (remember the =20
moderator) and maybe we can all enjoy a little poetry (in the casual =20
non-serious-criticism sense of the word), rather than the opposite =20
which I often read on POETICS when someone has a need to fight and no =20
one at home to do so with. Exasperation can be remedied by writing it =20
all down, and if it is that bad then please throw it away rather than =20
send it out into the world to spread the dark wings of ugliness. We =20
dont have to all like each other, since respect and communication can =20
go on without "like". But i do like you all. And I hope you have an =20
inspiring weekend, while I am slaving away at my "day job"... staring =20
out my office window at the real world. Ahhhh. Stay warm (hard to do =20
these days in Buffalo and beyond) and remember that we could be in the =20
middle of a hurricane. I dont know about you, but I will gladly take =20
the snow any day over that mess and worry. Goodbye all, for now, T. F. =20
Rice

Here is my poem for the evening: Untitled:

Small pine trees with
               gaping holes in the snow for shadows
whisper their opinions on this
season full of change and uncertainty
in a foreign language
no one wants to hear.

Hey Michael, Thanks for your comments again. I've been interestedly reading Lee Gurga's "Haiku: A Poet's Guide" and i think i'm learning a lot.
There's also a lot a don't agree with in there, at least stuff I don't think I agree with, in that it seems a lot of the time things he reads in his
examples as making for good haiku i sometimes question as to whether they even make for good poetry.

That having been said, there's a lot to work with here, and while i generally shy away from minimalism, I do like the points raised about haiku being
both small and large at the same time that gurga makes.

Something you said did spark a bit of introspection for me, though, about this whole idea of a cutting word. For Gurga, it seems almost synonymous
with caesura, and you suggested as well that it might be required for the sort of juxtaposition that haiku create. I really dislike that idea,
personally. For me, it's a much more natural device to use what I think of as an "internal" grammar to create a syntactic, than to use an "external"
one. A good example would be the "green/colors/wax" which, for me, turns on the fact that wax can be read as a verb or a noun, and gives a different
sort of image depending on how it's read. Now whether it's such a great poem or a haiku or not aside, i'm curious if you think that such devices can
be used in place of caesura. In my reading, Kilbrides "mime/lifting/fog" turns on such a device, and the thing about the poem that for me is so
striking is the fact that there are at least three very complex images that are contained in the fact that "mime" can be read as either a verb or a
noun, one of which, at least, the image of a mime literally picking up a bank of fog, borders on the surreal, and for me at least evokes a very strong
  sense of autumn in San Francisco. I don't know why that is, maybe i associate mimes with San Francisco for some reason... Anyway, you say that you
think English language poems need a caesura to do their juxtaposition, and i think that's interesting. I read caesurae as being a sort of sonic
sledgehammer, and that in itself is a bit of a juxtaposition given the brevity and delicacy--which isn't quite the right word but something close to
it--that are required in haiku.

Michael Dylan Welch wrote:
> Jason, some comments in response to your detailed message. Regarding the features you were incorporating into your verses, it seems to me that you suceeded in some cases, but with the following possible exceptions, at least in haiku terms (see the numbered list that follows below). On the other hand, if you were trying to create borderline haiku, you succeeded, I suppose, but perhaps the citizenship of your verses is still foreign to haiku. Since you asked if I thought they were still haiku or not, I would say no. Somehow, Jerry Kilbride's "mine / lifting /fog" is still haiku, but it is certainly on the fringe. Something in your verses takes them across the border.
>
> You also make an interesting comment about a "normative" element that can be prescriptive, which I have to fight in my reactions to some poems I read, as it runs the risk of killing the life of the poem. I also have to guard against the label of "haiku" as meaning "good haiku," so you are right to ask if there can be poems that are bad haiku but still haiku -- to which the answer is of course yes. It can have all the "prescribed" elements, and still lack freshness, or be weakly crafted. Your verses, though clearly crafted and brimming with freshness, depart from the prescribed elements enough that I personally have trouble admitting them as haiku. Someone else might feel differently. However, I doubt they'd ever find a place in most of the haiku journals publishing in North America. Such a claim might say something negative about the sensitivity range of the editors in question, but if they are gatekeepers of haiku, it may also say something about what they think is import
ant
>  in haiku. But yes, a poem can be bad but still be a haiku. It can be a haiku if the poet wants to call it that, of course, but discounting that generous approach, it can still be a haiku for other aesthetic reasons (that is, by hitting enough of the "haiku" targets), and fail for not hitting them very well. The haiku journal Haiku Headlines, edited monthly by David Priebe since 1988 until his death last year, is a case in point. The majority of the poems are deathly, as haiku (I've used its poems as examples of "bad haiku" in my workshops -- I have a file folder for large printouts of the poems, even), yet sure, they're still haiku. And even the best haiku journals have "better" or "weaker" poems, though often such rankings are in the eye of the beholder. Then there are the pseudo-haiku poems in books such as *Haikus for Jews* or *Honku*, and so on, which hit the wrong 5-7-5 target, and may have other virtues, but are essentially ignorant of most haiku necessities (or cho
ose
>  to ignore them). If haiku is a "genre," and thus broad rather than overly narrow, then these poems are still "haiku," because they try to hit the target(s) that the poet *thinks* a haiku should hit. To me, they have very little to do with haiku, and are more damaging than helpful to haiku as literature for their perpetuation of misunderstandings, though that's really a separate issue. Actually, though, I think it's hard for a haiku to be a "bad" haiku and yet still successfully *be* a haiku, because the more you "prove" the poems haiku-ness, the more you're going to tip it towards being a good haiku, or at least that's my hunch. There's some philosophical danger, there, because the term "haiku shouldn't be a form of encomium, as you say. Most of Sonia Sanchez's poems offered as haiku are what I would consider *good* nonhaiku. Others might think of them as bad haiku, but that isn't fair to what she's trying to do with vernacular voice. And I could start citing all sorts of
 ot
> her poems and talk about whether they're haiku or not, or whether they're good or bad, but it's hard to know where to start. And I would have only one opinion, of course!
>
> Anyway, here are some thoughts in reaction to the four criteria you set for yourself:
>
> 1. Nature references. Yes, you had nature references, but, in "warm santa / ana," using an essentially nonnatural term for the wind tends to distance the poem from the only natural element therein (the wind). A lot of readers wouldn't even know that you're referring to wind, which isn't necessarily a problem, but it is a risk you take. And in the lycra verse, the reference to "plant" is so generic as to not conjure up much of a nature image. Similarly, the reference to rain in the "march flush" poem is fairly slight as a nature reference, and might even be read as nonliteral. But again, I actually don't care about haiku having nature references or not. That's not the aim of haiku, as I understand it. Rather, haiku aims at the seasonal reference, and this happens to embrace nature much of the time, but it's really the season word that matters.
>
> 2. Seasonality. Again, yes, but not always clearly. The reference to "march" is ambiguous in many ways. Could you mean to march along, as a verb, since you lowercased it? So we don't know for certain if you meant March as the month. More than that, though, March means one season in the northern hemisphere, and an opposite season below the equator, so it's not as seasonally clear or universal as saying "cherry blossoms," for example. I don't sense any season in the lycra verse. I suppose the action of green colors "waxing" (as opposed to waning) could suggest the deepening of summer, but that could be too much of a leap for some readers, especially when the word "wax" is easily interpretted as a noun rather than a verb. And the Santa Ana winds are seasonal, but because they're a regional phenomenon, their function as a seasonal reference not be clear to many readers (and they're not limited to a single season, say, like cherry blossoms, so it has less "sharpness" than other
 se
> asonal references). Also, there's a difference between a seasonal reference and a season word (or kigo). The kigo tradition includes the overtone of allusion to other poems that use the same season word, depending on the season word. This won't happen with every season word, or there can be too many excellent poems for it to be clear which ones you might want to evoke, but in some cases a specific reference can be clear (and of course, allusion can be accomplished outside the season word as well). At the very least, though, the use of specific kigo respectfully invokes the entire tradition of that particular season word, if not a specific poem that has used it before.
>
> 3. Juxtaposition. In your "march flush" poem, it's too hard to parse the various possible meanings of the words and lines, thus making it hard to narrow down to the ONE "juxtaposition" that a good haiku usually has. Or, in the case of "warm santa / ana [wind] crumples silver / paper," there's no juxtaposition at all, at least not a grammatical one, because the lines read as a single grammatical unit, despite the line breaks (it's not the dreaded "Complete Sentence" you were trying to avoid, but it's still a single grammatical unit). Same with "a cotton lycra weave lifts / from plants it catches." There's actually no grammatical juxtaposition here at all either. And "green / colors / wax" can also be read as a single grammatical unit. It also becomes so minimalist (which is fine, but:) that it is really seeking to do other things than juxtaposition. The juxtaposition that goes on in haiku happens in various ways. To be closer to the Japanese tradition of the kireji, or cutt
ing
>  word, my sense is that the juxtaposition in an English-language haiku needs to be a stronger caesura, or cut. This tends to require the poem to have two grammatically unrelated fragments (not three, and not just one fragment). The juxtaposition is thus grammatical as well as contextual. You have mostly contextual juxtapositions, not grammatical ones. In the extreme, a contextual juxtaposition is like writing about an elephant and a doily, which can be startling and fresh, but there also needs to be a grammatical "juxtaposition" also -- akin to a caesura, but stronger, in the sense of having two fragments that are (most often) grammatically unrelated. For example:
>
> spring breeze--
> the pull of her hand
> as we near the pet store
>
> 4. Single experience/immediacy. This is where I think you achieved the most -- with single experiences. Immediacy in your verses is clouded, at least for me, by line breaks, by ambiguity as to whether certain words are nouns or verbs (too much ambiguity of syntax, I'd say, at least for haiku, but I guess that *was* what you were aiming at), and by other trouble parsing the grammar. Compare the immediacy of your verses to the immediacy of my verse above. Perhaps it's too "simple" for you or other readers, and you think there's no "there" there. Could be. But by focusing on a tactile sensation (haiku is a poetry of the five senses -- hence the title of one of my haiku workshops, "Come to Your Senses"), the poem gains authenticity and immediacy, and pairs it with a fitting seasonal reference (in this case the naming of the season, which may be the cheapest sort of season word). The season references should usually be more than just a weather report, however, but should have a
n e
> motional rightness to it. The preceding verse makes no mention of how old the female in the poem is, but nearly all people who hear or read this poem have told me that they imagine a child. Yet why is that? It's not stated at all. Yet it is suggested, through association with spring, the season of youthful beginnings, by breeze, which is lighter than wind or gale, and by the pet store, where we may easily imagine puppies and kittens. Yet all of this is, hopefully, intuitive, and part of the "immediate" gestalt of the poem. This is the sort of immediacy a good haiku is after, and it's best if it's not cluttered by overly clever wordings. As I think Basho said, haiku is like a finger pointing at the moon, and if the finger is too bejeweled, we no longer see the moon.

> Indeed, as Jack Kerouac said, haiku should be as simple as porridge. Though the tone is different, it's like a good joke -- saying only what needs to be said, and nothing more. Like the engine in a car, a haiku should have only necessary parts. And like I say in the haiku workshops I give, a haiku should not be as short as possible, but as short as *necessary*, which makes a world of difference.

ANAL CANADIAN HOCKEY STATISTICS POEM
------------------------------------

Below is a definition of what an average NHL team is and how many points it
earns. The conclusion is that if an NHL team has played N games and has y
overtime losses then, were it a perfectly average team, it would have earned
N+y points in the standings.

Overtime games, where the winner gets 2 points and the loser gets 1 point,
introduce some 'inflation' in the standings. The value of the below idea is
that it measures the amount of inflation overtime games introduce and
provides an easy way to calculate whether a team is above or below average
in its play. You add the number of games played to the number of overtime
losses. That tells you how many points an average team would have that's
played that many games and has that many overtime losses.

It used to be that a team playing "five hundred hockey" would have earned N
points after playing N games. Calling it 'five hundred hockey' is kind of
meaningless, given the existence of 3 point games. Calling it 'average
hockey' is better.

----------------------------
WHAT IS AN AVERAGE NHL TEAM?
----------------------------

Definition: An average team wins as many games in regulation time as it
loses in regulation time, and wins as many games in overtime as it loses in
overtime.

Suppose a team is average according to our definition and that it wins x
games in regulation time and wins y games in overtime. Then, since it's
average, it loses x games in regulation time and loses y games in overtime.

How many points did it earn? From its x wins in regulation time, it earns 2x
points. From its y wins in overtime, it earns 2y points. From its y losses
in overtime, it earns y points. So, overall, it earns 2x + 2y + y = 2x + 3y
points.

How many points did it surrender? From its x losses in regulation time, it
surrendered 2x points. From its y losses in overtime, it surrendered 2y
points. From its y wins in overtime, it surrendered y points. So, overall,
it surrendered 2x + 2y + y = 2x + 3y points.

Our definition of an average team implies that it earns as many points as it
surrenders.

-----------------------------------------------------
HOW MANY POINTS DOES AN AVERAGE TEAM EARN IN N GAMES?
-----------------------------------------------------

How many points does an average team earn in N games? Suppose it wins x
games in regulation-time and wins y games in overtime. Then, since it's
average, it loses x games in regulation-time and loses y games in overtime.

x + y + x + y = N

The above equation just counts the number of games. Now we do some algebra
on the equation.

2x + 2y = N
x + y = N/2
x = N/2 - y

We have seen that it earns 2x + 3y points.

Points = 2x + 3y

Now we substitute:

Points = 2(N/2 - y) + 3y
Points = N - 2y + 3y
Points = N + y

KNOX'S PROPHET
Someone's been reading Bern Porter
By CHRIS THOMPSON
February 7, 2007 1:12:27 PM

http://www.thephoenix.com/article_ektid33269.aspx

THINKING AHEAD: Creating Maine, forty years ago.

A Maine native and longtime resident of Belfast, Bern Porter died =20
there in 2004 at the age of 93. His life and its creative output =97 =20
ranging from art, science, and poetry to literature, publishing, and =20
economic planning =97 read like a map for a road nobody else would =20
notice, let alone imagine following. But here we are now, stepping =20
right along it as he imagined.

After college, a budding career in physics got young Porter drafted =20
to work on the Manhattan Project. The Hiroshima bombing made him =20
aware of the fruits of his labors, so he quit. As Cold War minds =20
divided the planet, Porter was at work probing and inventing =20
connections between all manner of creative endeavors, from art and =20
science to the poetry he felt certain would bind them. Many of these =20
pursuits didn=92t have names for themselves yet, but soon would: Mail =20=

Art, Sound Art, Found Poetry, and Concrete Poetry =97 he played a role =20=

in all of them.

He also found time, in 1968, to get himself hired, thanks to his =20
research background, as a consultant to the Knox County Regional =20
Planning Commission to write their master plan for economic development.

But soon, the commission and the State Planning Office in Augusta =20
realized they=92d made a mistake. The idealistic Porter imagined =20
nothing less than the total reinvention of the world, beginning in =20
downeast Maine. His draft came in at 700 pages =97 the commission would =20=

later cut it down substantially and use almost none of it.

But that didn=92t stop Porter from treating it as a magnum opus, =20
laboring over the minute details as well as their overarching =20
arguments. He mailed it to dozens of major libraries throughout =20
America with a note on the title page: =93Written by Bernard H. Porter, =20=

but extensively cut up, mutilated, re-edited to point of uselessness =20
by the Commission members.=94

His plan was prescient and freakish at the same time. It saw that New =20=

England=92s towns were slowly deteriorating as they gradually lost the =20=

ability to govern themselves. Control over local economies, he =20
warned, was drifting away from local businesses and politicians in =20
the direction of larger business chains based in big cities where =20
executives cared only about profits. In addition, he argued, Maine =20
was losing control over itself because of the rising number of =20
wealthy outsiders who were buying property and flocking to the state =20
in the summers but whose financial engagements and investments (apart =20=

from property taxes) remained elsewhere.

This, in Porter=92s view, put a split between money and government and =20=

also dramatically widened the gulf between a smaller group of moneyed =20=

Mainers and a burgeoning =93underclass.=94

Where he really got radical was in his proposed solution. He =20
advocated quick and substantive investment in a range of processed =20
items that Knox County residents and businesses might focus on =20
producing: everything from eggs and sea moss to paper and fabric. His =20=

real insight, and this was no doubt what sunk his plan, was to =20
emphasize =97 remember this is forty years ago =97 massive investment in =
=20
technology here in Maine: =93new ventures in publishing, smelting, =20
cement products, precision machinery, deep-sea terminals, =20
prefabricated houses, electronics, development laboratories, =20
pharmaceutical plants, refineries, and research institutions that =20
[Porter] called =91Think Factories.=92=94 And the state would need a =20
totally revamped educational system to prepare young Mainers for the =20
technological age.

Then, before Philip Morris NaPier would make it possible for such =20
candidacies to be taken seriously, Porter =97 who had published Henry =20=

Miller and Anais Nin, run a gallery in Sausalito that helped catalyze =20=

the emerging Bay Area arts scene, worked as a newsman in Guam, and =20
contributed his two cents to three of the major technological =20
breakthroughs of the 20th century (the atomic bomb, the Saturn moon =20
rocket, and the television) =97 ran for governor.

And =97 this is the best part =97 as a Republican!

But without money ormoneyed connections, he had to drop out. And Knox =20=

County wasn=92t interested in becoming one of the information age=92s =20=

global hubs. So he founded his =93Institute for Advanced Thinking=94 on =20=

the grounds of his home in Belfast =97 a place where, up until the time =20=

he had to move to the Tall Pines Nursing Home in 2003, anyone without =20=

an advanced degree could pitch a tent, use the horizontal orgone =20
platform, and collaborate with other visitors, if there were any, in =20
the advancement of thinking. As long as you stayed out of Bern=92s way.

Any initiative which gets innovative poetry out of the university &
exposes random folks to the possibilities is worth the effort.  It's
one thing to present your work in front of people who are familiar
with such work & quite another to do it in places like laundromats.
I have a friend who did a series of art installations in laundromats
in the midwest & she had fascinating stories to tell.  (Considering
her "installation" was hundreds of pancakes made on site & fastened
to the walls it must have made quite the impression..)

10 Are you a visual poet?

If yes, GOTO line 20
If no, GOTO line 70

20 Would you be interested in having free online gallery space (.gif,
.jpg, .png, .wmv, .mov, .mpeg, .swf, .avi) for your visual poetry?

If yes, GOTO line 30
If no, GOTO line 70

30 Would you find value in a forum for international discourse on
matters related to visual poetry that included message threading, the
ability to include and view attachments (.pdf, .doc, .aiff, .bmp,
.htm, .mp3, .wav, and much much more) within posts, community editable
event calenders, user profiles, private messaging, post filtering,
friend lists, mutual friend identification, etc.?

If yes, GOTO line 40
If no, GOTO line 70

40 Would you be able to add value to a forum for international
discourse on matters related to visual poetry by providing content, by
actively engaging in conversation threads, by moderating a group, by
administrating a sub-forum devoted to a specific area of your
interest/expertise, and/or otherwise being the part of the iceberg of
users who creates rather than consumes?

If yes, GOTO line 50
If no, GOTO line 70

50 Do you have some free time in your schedule over the course of the
next couple of weeks to do some beta testing (creating your profile,
making test postings, just generally trying to break things and learn
the system so you can help explain things to others, invite some
others you think may have missed this invitation but would be good
candidates, low-intensity futzing around and reporting back)?

If yes, GOTO line 60
If no, GOTO line 70

60 Great! Send an email with your interest to your favorite word,
whatever that may be, at logolalia.com and I'll point you to the place
where alpha testing has already begun. Forward this message
freely. GOTO line 80

70 Darn. Oh well, thank you for your time, watch this space for the
announcement of this project going live. Forward freely.

80 END

Where to go, what to do, when you are Bern Porter:
a personal biography
by James Erwin Schevill. Gardiner, Me.:
Tilbury House, 1992.

I have somehow misplaced my copy of this. I expect Jim Schevill explores th=
e
relationship between Porter, Kenneth Rexroth, Georges Varda and other
innovative artists and writers associated with the San Francisco Renaissanc=
e
of the 1940's. (Schevill - poet and playwright, grew up in the Bay Area, wa=
s
head of the SF State Poetry Center in the early sixties, before he moved to
teach at Brown for the rest of his teaching career.  Interestingly, perhaps=
,
another local, Jess, Robert Duncan's partner, also worked on the Manhattan
project. Whether or not Jess and Porter knew each other at all well, I do
not know.    It is also curious how this group of genuinely innovative folk=
s
after the war do get overshadowed by arrival and emergence of the Beats, an=
d
ther publicity bandwagon that followed - of which, say, Duncan never
appeared comfortable, tho a kind of bridge figure.  Curious, but not
surprisingly, the SF Renaissance generation was much more attached to the
European bohemian traditions, where the Beats were much more enthralled wit=
h
the Far East - Buddhist meditation and artistic practice.  Tho someone like
Rexroth was clearly omnivorous in terms of his awareness and incorporation
of multiple, global literary strands.

It would have been interesting - and probably have been of great local valu=
e
- if Porter had stayed in the Bay Area. His world up in Maine - whacky as i=
t
could be - is quite phenomenal.

excellent, I'm with it. POETICS is all about war, politics, book-review,
death-news, blasphemy, anne nicole, poetry-reading, self-promotion,
book-sale, colons stuffed with enormous literary waste leading to
intellectual dysentery, POETICS is also a lot about POETICS but rarely about

p o e t r y   or    p o e m s

lift your trampled face

for the afternoon         gold-plaited hour

that has a cage          feathers with remnant odor

warm breasts, mini red

cut open and pulled out of snow heart



the shepherd's quick, so are his cattle

dust rises




wating for you at a railroad crossing

bogies so    slow      tortuous      sleek     heavy     eternal
repetitive

cold murderer of time

serialized beauty



in the desert     I saw commas after Camel case

calendars chatting with maps

waste papers flying         end up chasing that sandsick lad

a cat's cry fades out with the light

we went so far to sing to the birds

Okay, I'll bite. The poem I have finished most recently:


Reproductive Rights

She said, "I felt invaded by a creature from Mars."

He thought, "Invaded. By a body like mine.
I am not a creature from Mars."

Then he thought, "Maybe she means the fetus."

Perhaps a bit off topic, I'm looking for the source of a sixties interview with Sartre which produced this statment: "nous sommes des animaux sinistre": "we are shipwrecked animals".  Any assistance is of course appreciated. Thank you.

If you're going to be in Atlanta for the AWP, please come to the panel "Poets on Appropriative Writing":

Thursday, March 1, 12:00 p.m.-1:15 p.m
Hilton Atlanta, North Court East, 2nd Floor

R147. Poets on Appropriative Writing. (Laura Mullen, Mairead Byrne, Shin Yu Pai, Gregory Betts, Camille Martin) Raphael Rubinstein says "appropriative writing." Michael Davidson says "palimtexts." Gregory Betts says "plunderverse." Purists say "plagiarism." This panel features poets whose work incorporates source texts, challenging ideas of textual ownership and perhaps also showing a relationship between source and resulting poem. Panelists discuss methods of appropriation from such disparate sources as vintage sports manuals, news coverage of the invasion of Iraq, and "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."

Looks like an interesting conference. Here's the schedule:

Why the moderation? Because some of us are just getting too old to continue
our lives of excess.

I can't speak to the situation with the List because I haven't noticed
anything beyond the usual ebb and flow of posts.

As far as the notice you receive about moderation, it seems to be an
automated response. And then your message gets posted way sooner than the
time frame indicated in the notice.

To anyone attending the AWP, I'd like to let you know about a reading at Clayton State University. It's a bit of a trek (15 miles south of Atlanta), but if you have the transportation, time, and desire, I'd love to see your friendly faces there.

Alas, my new collection _codes of public sleep_ will not appear in time for the reading. It will come out in the fall from Toronto's fabulous BookThug.

Text from 2 Chicago Openport Performances

this is a placemarker for font and size
i learn nothing from my work. my work learns from me.
this is so stupid. this is so stupid. ehllo hello. nathan -
somewhere near the begimning of 'the silent film era'
actresses were accompanied by orchestras or musicians
of their choosing to get into the mood of the otherwise silent
so this is how it's going to be. what i do (here) is try to type,
well at one point someone told me I couldn't type (I'm showing you now
heheh! - anyway I try and TYPE something until you're bored or someonne
pulls me out of here (I mean Chicago, not Links Hall) - anyway so I try
to entertain you - wait, please there's more coming...
this part was videotaped at Rilke's Grave in Raran, SW
we're reading - well, Foofwa d'Imobilite and Maud Liardon - are -
reading the tombstone - and well, I"m playing the organ, that's
somewhere else in the alps -
the sooner a train comes along the sooner I'm saved here. i'd better
explain this
this is a model of a dancer moving through motion capture equipment
that has some broken sensors sending the signals out to infinity where
they collapse, grief stricken, and return, something like the rturn of
the repressed. Now here is the return of the repressed, just a second
here -
ok, it's more or less below freezing out there in the Gruyere
ok, this isn't getting anywhere yet. i'mm not a particularly good
performance artist. I'm cheating, I recorded this stuff beforehand -
look around you - there aren't any naked people in the room at the
moment, nor a waterfall for that matter... this is a deconstruction of
a gun and on the left is someone dancing more or less and disappearing
into the light.
<thinking of content... war, viollence, stupidity, let's all kill
President Bush! - ok, I knw you'rethinking, this is "illeagal," but
what if we do this together?" -> yeah, well, ok, this will happen.
let's back up.
we won't kill bush, we'll just wound him -
so - just in case you wondered, the hum you're hearing isn't from my
laptop, it's in the system here in Links Hall and in fact I tend to
love it -on the left is my avatar disappearing in Second Life because I
programmed it to get away with it so it can go through cliffs and stuff.
now yhou're hearing the hum of the planet, literally - this is very low
frequency radio stuff coming through - the antennas are modified by the
performers - transforming the sound - Maud Liardon atthe end of a
particularly exhausting day.
maud machine - there's a file here called rottate i'll try to find it
hold on the machine aspect is clearer
by the way: the title of this is "The Difference Between the Analog and
the Binary Mode of Relating Real-Time bodies to the world" -
this was shortened from the title "My Partner is My Buddha"
this is literally the Maud Machine - why literrally?
this is Azure generating very low frequency coupling with an antenna
somewhere in Orange County California
these are dead avatars
this is another dead avatar.
ok what you're hearing is an imitation of a 78 record created from an
event in very low frequency radio stuff.
this is really stupid.l i'll whos you what i feel like.
ok that's an assassin bug on the right. now we're looking at the
wilderness.
when we work and we always do and we work together sometimes and we
don't we try to harnass
we try to harness the digital and return it to the real world.
there of course is still a real world, don't believe the theorists.
where is it? it's among the polar bears who are starving and have
turned cannibal
it's among the elephans which have taken to raping as a result of
population pressure.
it among the fifty thousand birds that died at the world trade center
site as a result of the fucked up pillars of light which messed up
migration routes - as a result they died of exhaustion
this is the deconstruction of a tree, a real tree, with a ditial
scanner.
I'm not sure why this is important, but possibly in anotehr fifty years
or so we might not have trees.
well we won't have "we" either
this is my sad ronin in second life -
when I work in second life i go to thebottom of the ocean
then i don't have to deal with cleverness and messy building
and people flying by.
i can just do something maybe there
Cris Cheek should know where this sound is from, the only thing I
didn't do here, the rest for whatever is mine.
this was done after abu gharayb. those blades are from a wind farm in
West Virgina. think aboutg wind farms - like the beams of lightfrom the
world trade center, most of these have been responsible for the deaths
of tens of thousands of birds. they fly into it.
the avatar was takenpart and taken apart and taken apart
this is Azure Carter being scanned while moving - this results in the
disappearance of Azure Carter, any trace of her, in the digital realm.
I'd show this to you if I could remember where it is!
ok, this is the result of that maneuver more or less, you can see the
body sliced -
we're back trying to suture things back together from digital to analog.
if someone can tell me when twenty-five minutes or so are gone I can
wrap this up.
at the moment I'm thinking: abjection/politics
on the left, avatars imitating real-life people
on the right, real-life people imitatin avatars.
notice the people (on the right) we refer to as "The Bobsie Twins"
What coordination!
This took years to perfect
i used to do these things with the idea of a 'moral" or content or
"content" or a "sememe " or something behind what you're seeing on the
screen.
then it occurred to me
there's nothing we can do at this point to save - well, our own selves,
species from extinction, inundations, the stupidies - that's stupdi,
stupidities of fascist presidents - so we might as well just play and
make faces in restaurants
because maybe all we can do is dance
oh that's so stupid again
but it's true!
and it's true I can't dance!
so ...
so it's true that'
that there's a letter maybe beneath this one going somewhere
my partner exploding with the motion capture equipment going into
gunfire -
well I want you to believe this is gunfire
while a vacuum tube is deconstruct simultaneously
well I'd like you to believe it's deconstructed.
what's stupid here is I have only one screen and I want to have
equipment on the floro!
floor!
more and more equipment, something I can disappear into!
I'll have to settle for
for some sort of entertainment
i want to thank everyone here for allowing us to present!
and Foofwa d'Imobilite and Maud Liardon for their brillians
And Azure Carter for her support and brilliance
And President bush for making this possible
and the Swiss Government for funding this in part
and the Alps for just being there.
thank you.

anguish disappears when our world suffers the most
an image weeps. an image does not suffer.
no, an image suffers the most.
dear buddha, i will suffer for you.
thank you, alan sondheim.
nothing is real anymore, is it? is what? is nothing?
i am your electric-onic
i am your electronic buzz bomb
i will kill all of you fuckers. i will kill everyone. don't forget -
when you leave here tonight YOU WILL BE DEAD (honest, I really mean
this more than I mean anything in the world) - signed, Mr. Bush. Let us
[...]
If I can't be Buddha I will kill myself.
Then after I kill myself I will kill you.
Today I thought about the French Empire and the American Empire.
The end.
Alan Sondheim.
ok if you have any questions.
Ok I have a question. What is that stuff moving about.
"Well, I'm glad you asked that,' Susan said. This is really something,
isn't it? (Susan didn't say that.) Well, what this , well, these are
avatars torn apart, By What you May AsK?
maBY by Abu Gharab, he replied lightly.
Christ, he thought (although he didn't believe in God). There are too
many things going on here. That zither is being sent around the usa
coming back to me. That woman is Maud Liardon danceworking performing
in a grange in the Gruyere. We need a cat.
So you think this is funny? I will KILL YOU. This is NOT FUNNY.
StOPPP IT
VLF radio runs around the world. The USA will use VLF radio antennas
to:
1. Disorient and kill whales.
2. Disorient and kill dolphins.
3. Communicate just where and when the BIG ONE will be dropped.
I'm a dope!
Just now, a reveleation:
EVERYONE IS TWITCHING ON THE SCREN
Suddenly he realized: There were people behind himn.
It wasn't paranoia. He was being watched.
Something had to be done, something drastic. Then he remembered:

"He would kill them all."
This is the compassion the Buddha speaks of so eloquently.
Now we're hanging around the Aletsch glacier.
I want to thank the Swiss government for making this possible:
a. Holding on to the Aletsch glacier in this period of global warming.
b. Giving my partner and I some money so we can eat again.
c. Making us stop worrying if we con't have any money for b.
I did this thing last night with different videos. And there I was
thinking, there's just nothing you can do about the world, is there/
so it's not enoght to dance, fuck dance, it's got to be something else.
if we could only just kill ourselves. then everything would be allright
in the worldl
but of cours we're just kidding, nothing like this can happen.
the whole history of the West: we're just kidding ourselves. (Honest.)
don't cry for us argentina.

"This project by cris cheek is a brilliant, light-hearted and stylised
record of live transmissions, spoken circuitries, registered feedback,
rewound conversations and overheard snippets, all recorded during daily
drifts in a small English city. 13 black-and-white photographs show our man
in situ in a really proper suit holding a recorder, which is a black
hand-held machine. The recorder turns out to be a live transmitter, it
interferes with local taxiphone networks. 14 handwritten map sketches lead
nowhere. Location is an insistent point."  =96 Caroline Bergvall

"In THE CHURCH =96 THE SCHOOL =96 THE BEER cheek makes one of his most
impressive and serious efforts to provide a mise en sc=E8ne of the act of
writing as performance. This is an anarcho-utopic struggle for the earthly
commons, where authentic communication is guaranteed under the sign of nois=
e
as radical democracy; it is a form of research into all the joyous
choreographies of the tongue as the supreme organ of capture and escape.
Readers of these texts are treated to a supremely conceptual writing, but
one that also promises moments of lush density as well as a strangely
delicate lyrical iridescence."  =96 Piers Hugill

apparently, it was the Best animated short film - THE DANISH POET=20
=20
I was watching The Departed throughout the Oscars show (which I try to =
miss most years anyway) -- caught Al Gore & co. take it for best =
documentary film, a fluent Ennio Morricone (fluent in Italian) =
introduced by a stumbling Clint Eastwood, and a horrific turn by Celine =
Dion spitting out a cheesy new ballad by Il Maestro... yes, Morricone's =
work is primarily cheese, but I still enjoy it. except for when Celine =
sings it.
=20
anyone see The Lives of Others? it won for best foreign film. there's a =
"power of literature, art, humanity, over totalitarianism" theme running =
throughout.

from foggy and shallow So FL,=20

Sorry this is not a poem.  But, as I understand it, we aren't supposed to post poems on this site, just discussions and announcements relevant to poetry.  There is another excellent site called Wryting-L where poets from this list and, I suspect, from other sources post poems.  It is set up specifically with that intent. If you're interested in doing that, Google Wryting-L and it should give you the relevant information. Regards, Tom Savage

Recently it has been suggested that there is not enough poetry within
POETICS discussions. Let's make up for it. Responses to this post must
be in the form of a poem, discussing whatever you wish (remember the
moderator) and maybe we can all enjoy a little poetry (in the casual
non-serious-criticism sense of the word), rather than the opposite
which I often read on POETICS when someone has a need to fight and no
one at home to do so with. Exasperation can be remedied by writing it
all down, and if it is that bad then please throw it away rather than
send it out into the world to spread the dark wings of ugliness. We
dont have to all like each other, since respect and communication can
go on without "like". But i do like you all. And I hope you have an
inspiring weekend, while I am slaving away at my "day job"... staring
out my office window at the real world. Ahhhh. Stay warm (hard to do
these days in Buffalo and beyond) and remember that we could be in the
middle of a hurricane. I dont know about you, but I will gladly take
the snow any day over that mess and worry. Goodbye all, for now, T. F.
Rice

Here is my poem for the evening: Untitled:

Small pine trees with
gaping holes in the snow for shadows
whisper their opinions on this
season full of change and uncertainty
in a foreign language
no one wants to hear.

Tom is right  --  the Welcome message states, "We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries."

  And earlier, "The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible."


  Should posts written in poetic form/at (broken lines? rhymed? omitting all e's, employing recurring words? etc) that address poetics issues be encouraged?

  Incidentally, the daily message max for the list is 75 messages per day, with a limit of four posts per person.

Escalator

                The escalator
      is a dangerous enemy
who could trip you
                one step at a time.
This is how the mind works,
synthesizing dream with substance.
                     Or as Jung
                     alternates
           with Freud.
      The substitution
of ground for holiness
      claims voice as a reason
      for old tribes locating
                          the sun
                     as figures
in the act, at the window.

           The future derives
from sleep, evolves into gods
                          and animals.
      This is a process
      that F. chilled into
                vintage prose.
           Jung warmed
to the blooded world,
not alone. The human collective
      describes the enormity
of a single voice. How the
                          minotaur
                poses like God
in his mystical cellar.

      Yet F. too brings the good news
that deciphers time
in focus, traveled by a map,
                as if one could say
           there it is! now is as good
                     as anywhere.
      Everything is abstract
           in its origin almost
                     as if Plato
           believed in the verity
of his good republic.

The escalator goes flat by
           steps. It continues
           as breath does:
                two men in blue suits with vests.
      The moving sidewalk is
                     no less.
It slows into watchword, and if F.
           abhorred the occult,
           Jung compared sexuality
      in the psychic order
to a hidden grammar,
           dogma on the harpsichord.

                     Organized
           mystery, lens-defined
                     hyperbole.
A science rises from obsession,
shaped like the Golem of Prague,
but who remembers
                his song?
           Jung catches flies
                instead of fish.
F. hangs his briefs
                on the line.
                     The world is all
                          alone,
                all there is
           to imitate.
Time limps behind
the escalator, F. stands
           with a stopwatch,
      Jung with a camera.
Mind in slow motion, caught in breath.

Progressive Black Masculinities brings together leading black cultural crit=

ack men.

posting actual poems. what is a poetics discussion without poems to discuss?
theory. and only theory. which is not antithetical to poems, but is also
not and

to write responses as poems, why would we post a rule that discourages them

poems that we can use to "discuss poetic issues"? in other words, yes, posts

Subject:      Cox & Kim at SPT this SAT, 3/3
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by
Sarah Anne Cox & Myung Mi Kim
Saturday, March 3, 2007 at 7:30 p.m.?-- note special day


Sarah Anne Cox’s second book, Parcel, is new from O Books. Kevin Killian:
"In Parcel, Cox has written a book that speaks to our time, as though she
had spent the night awake, her palms burning, mind afire. She doesn't stint,
she writes as she thinks, a courageous speaking out in the face of injustice
and some pretty fearsome ancient texts. Which came first, she asks, really
wanting to know--kings, or cheese? Her answers have always surprised me;
never more so than in this new success."

Myung Mi Kim is the author of Under Flag, Dura, The Bounty, and Commons, of
which Publishers Weekly says: "While much poetry has been written out of the
many diasporas that have U.S. outposts, few collections capture the cultural
and linguistic displacement of immigration with as much poise and resonance
as Kim's fourth book, her most outstanding. Articulating our often hidden
and difficult ties to each other without righteous indignation or fanfare,
these poems are profoundly important and affecting." Kim is on the faculty
of the Poetics Program at Buffalo.



Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students. ?

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in?Timken Lecture
Hall,?California College of the Arts ?1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco

I agree. Wholeheartedly. Furthermore, I want to add, not even theory
gets talked about very much here. We only comment...comment and announce
and promote...how dull is it to comment, announce and debate poetry with out
poems ! It is hard to digest the fact that politics, poverty, misogyny, Anne
Nicole etc. can find a place in "POETICS" but not poems. We're in the wrong
boat brother (sister). At times it feels like I'm watching a "gray muscle

Hello,


I hope to see you in Atlanta for AWP. I'll be working the Starcherone Books
table with Ted Pelton! I hear the table is #128 but that might change.
Please stop on by and say hi!




Best, Geoffrey

Thanks for sending the link. No point stirring up the ashes of a dead fire.

I agree. Wholeheartedly. Furthermore, I want to add, not even theory
gets talked about very much here. We only comment...comment and announce
and promote...how dull is it to comment, announce and debate poetry with out
poems ! It is hard to digest the fact that politics, poverty, misogyny, Anne

Hey Poetics -

If you had to make a case that Russell Edson belongs to a particular school
of American poetry, which one would it be?  Language? NY School? My hunch is
neither of those, so what do we call Edson's 'school'?

Just wondering,

Poetry.

Not everything fits into a taxonomy, though taxonomies are
undoubtedly useful for introductory courses and literary bureaucracies.

Dear bListers,

Some sad news to report...Leroy Jenkins has passed away. I think he made
a very beautiful and also very unique contribution to the post jazz
continuum.

PG


Leroy Jenkins: born March 11, 1932 in Chicago, Illinois, died February
24,
2007 in New York City

(from AACM website) http://aacmchicago.org/

...Jenkins was already performing violin at the age of 8 at his local
Ebenezeer Baptist Church. The flavor of spirituals still remains in his
music. He studied music in high school and then attended Florida A&M
University Born in Chicago, Illinois in 1932, Jenkins was already
performing
violin at the age of 8 at his local Ebenezeer Baptist Church. The flavor
of
spirituals still remains in his music. He studied music in high school
and
then attended Florida A&M University where he studied with Bruce Hayden
and
completed his B.S. in music. For the next ten years Jenkins remained in
the
South teaching music.

Jenkins returned to Chicago in 1965 and was drawn into the well spring
of
Chicago s creative music activities. Almost immediately, he joined the
Association for the Advancement of Creative Music (AACM). Jenkins
recalls
that this union marked the first time that as a violin player he was
truly
welcomed into creative music performances. During this time he played
and
recorded with Muhal Richard Abrams , Leo Smith and Anthony Braxton .
In 1969, Jenkins left for Paris with Braxton and Smith. With the
addition of
drummer Steve McCall , they formed the Creative Construction Company .
Their
1970 performance in New York, joined by Richard Davis on bass and Abrams
on
piano, gave New York the first taste of the new music that Chicago
musicians
were creating.

Jenkins continued to work with the finest creative musicians.... Archie
Shepp , Albert Ayler , Alice Coltrane , Mtume , Cal Massey , to name a
few.
But it was the work of the collective Revolutionary Ensemble (co-founded

with bassist Sirone and drummer Jerome Cooper) that gained Jenkins
prominence as the most significant violinist of the modern era. par
Leroy works in a multitude of contexts. His recording on Tomato, Space
Minds, New Worlds, Survival in America has received rave reviews. He is
performing in solo, trio and quintet contexts, and is also performing in
duo
settings with woodwindist Oliver Lake .

This is a pretty interesting question.  I think Jordan's answer was good.  =
Edson is, to some extent, sui generis, though a pervasive influence.  =
Reading Kandinsky's SOUNDS recently, I noticed strong resonances with =
Edson though.  So I like both the "American" and "1st generation" elements =
in Jordan's definition; also, of course, the "prose poet."  Quite a neat =
piece of work!

I think this is sort of a fool's errand too, like cataloging your record collection, but I'd affiliate him with other 60's-70's surrealists like James Tate, Charles Simic, Mark Strand, Bill Knott.

Sentence No. 4;=20

=B3What name one gives or doesn=B9t give to one=B9s writing is far less important
than the work itself. I called my first published books fables, looking,
with the help of this label, for a way to describe the pieces I had been
writing since sexual awareness. But fables are message stories, and I don=B9t
like messages=8AAt that time in my career the term prose poetry seemed more

For me, I think I recall seeing the term =B3pro-genitor of the prose poem=B2
somewhere to decribe Edson, which kind of fits with the oft quirky sexualit=

running through his work.

Yes, master of the prose poem as others here noted but beyond that
Russell Edson is an original mind, sort of the Mr. Natural of
Poetics--so funny, it hurts.

Born in Chicago, composer and violinist Leroy Jenkins was one of the
most important musicians to emerge from the AACM (Association for the
Advancement of Creative Musicians), the legendary collective of which
he was a member until his death in 2007. Like many of the
Association's members, Jenkins studied under the legendary Walter
Dyett at DuSable High School, where he learned the alto saxophone.

He received a music degree (in violin) from Florida A&M University,
where he studied composition and the classical masters of the violin.
Subsequently, he taught music both in Mobile, Alabama (1961-5) and in
the Chicago schools (1965-9). During the latter period, Jenkins joined
the AACM. He made his first recording with Muhal Richard Abrams,
Anthony Braxton, and Leo Smith in the sixties before achieving
international acclaim in Paris along with Braxton, Smith, and the Art
Ensemble of Chicago. In 1970 Jenkins moved to New York, where he
founded the Revolutionary Ensemble, the critically acclaimed ensemble
which recorded 7 albums and toured North America and Europe.

When many of the AACM musicians left during 1969, Jenkins went to
Europe with Anthony Braxton & Leo Smith. There, with drummer Steve
McCall, they were called the Creative Construction Company. He also
played with Ornette Coleman, whose house he & Braxton stayed at when
they subsequently moved to New York City.

Playing with Taylor (1970) and Braxton (1969-72), he also worked with
Albert Ayler, Cal Massey, Alice Coltrane, Archie Shepp & Rahsaan
Roland Kirk. Between 1971-7, he played in his Revolutionary Ensemble,
a trio featuring Sirone (Norris Jones) on bass & trombone, and
drummer/pianist Jerome Cooper. Thereafter, he toured the US & Europe,
led the Mixed Quintet (Jenkins and 4 woodwind players), a blues-based
band called Sting, and again played with Cecil Taylor.

Jenkins continually reinvented his own language in music. His was an
extraordinary bonding of a variety of sounds associated with the black
music tradition, while simultaneously bridging with European styles.
His intermeshing of jazz and classical influences left critics
wondering at his musical identity; however, as one San Francisco
Chronicle critic said, "Jenkins is a master who cuts across all
categories."

Jenkins received a number of major commissions and was in demand for
experimental and theater-based work. Mother of Three Sons, a
dance-opera collaboration with Bill T. Jones, premiered in Aachaen,
Germany and had ten performances. The Rockefeller Foundation, National
Endowment for the Arts, Meet the Composer, and Mutable Music awarded
him numerous commissioning funds and grants to support several new
theater works. Among them are Fresh Faust (a jazz-rap opera), which
was performed in workshops in Boston at the Institute of Contemporary
Arts; The Negro Burial Ground (a cantata), performed at The Kitchen,
New York City; and The Three Willies (a multimedia opera), performed
at the Painted Bride, Philadelphia. He was also commissioned to create
new works for the Brooklyn Philharmonic, the Cleveland Symphony
Orchestra, the Albany Symphony, the Lincoln Center Out of Doors, and
the Kronos Quartet.

Among his recordings are 3 Compositions of New Jazz (1968; Delmark);
Lifelong Ambitions (1977; Black Saint; with Muhal Richard Abrams);
Space Minds, New Worlds, Survival America (1978; Tomato); Live (1992,
Black Saint); Carla Bley's Escalator Over The Hill and Braxton's Three
Compositions Of New Jazz.

Leroy Jenkins died on February 24, 2007, in Brooklyn, NY.

Amy's kinda right about this, I think. I mean, with
all the info we have access to online, why pollute
this list with more than it can digest. This is a
space cafe - not a poetry reading with loads of open
mic. If anything, we should learn better at better

I could be wrong, but it sounds like a hail mary play to me. I know
all of the principals, including Edson, who read for me several times
in the 70s and appeared in my journal Broadway Boogie. As far as I
know he didn't hang out with Jerry or Diane or for that matter Kelly
or Eshleman, and his work and theirs are very different. And Deep
Image lasted as a self-designation for the blink of an eye.

Not that it matters much. They're all sui generis. And the toxonomies
are of limited use. I'll go with "call me what you want except late
for dinner."

Subject: REPRINTING OF "UKANHAVYRFUCKINCITIBAK." by d.a. levy

Dear d.a. levy legend Supporter or Fan:

I will reprint d.a. levy's UKANHAVYRFUCKINCITIBAK. by May 1, 2007.
It has been long out of print and the remaining copies are
collector's items
which sell for from between $100 and $400, maybe more. New readers
must have access to this historic work.

I have found a good price in Santa Ana, California (from the same man
who printed my Descent into Cleveland). The original book was collected
and edited by r.j.s.; published by t.l. kryss, GHOST PRESS CLEVELAND,
in a limited edition of 1,000 copies. To get one of the last original
copies
contact  r.j.s. His address is:

     r.j.s.
     13138 Pond Rd.,
     Burton, OH 44021

There is so much history and good material in this book that it
stands as a
document for freedom of thought and freedom of speech from the exciting
Sixties and the mimeograph revolution in Cleveland, Ohio. New readers
should have access to copies, but it should stay in its original
form. (The
printer assures me he can scan it to look pretty much as it is,
except for
the color silk screens, which when scanned, will be in black and white.)
I will not add anything except maybe a little history paragraph with
names
of Patrons.

I can't fund the entire printing myself, so I am asking Patrons and levy
Supporters to buy a minimum of 100 dollars worth of books, which gives
you 12 copies at $8.33 cents. This should also cover shipping costs by
media mail. If you want only one, look for it at Mac's Backs in
Cleveland,
or contact me later and I will sell you one for $20.

d. a. levy rejected copyright (called it "copyrot") and r.j.s and Tom
Kryss
are in agreement with this project, so going ahead is not a  problem.

If you have mailing lists, please forward this email to them. If you
know
patrons and levy collectors from early days, or from right now, please
send their names so that I may contact them. (I know I have missing
names, such as, Kent Taylor.)

I want to have the book ready by May 1, 2007, so please act fast and
send in your 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, or 1,000 or 10,000 dollars. Example 1:
A class gets together, funds 200 dollars and gets 24 books. Example 2:
If you are a leader in your area, you can round up advanced sales from
your group and get the books at cost. Example 3: You may have libraries
in mind or university libraries to which you may want to give a book.

Thanks for your attention.

Please make checks to:

Though of a different nation and time, I would say the same school as
Daniil Kharms.

This is from Kharms' notebook, 1937:
"There lived a redheaded man who had no eyes or ears. He didn’t have
hair either, so he was called a redhead arbitrarily. He couldn’t talk
because he had no mouth. He had no nose either. He didn’t even have arms
or legs. He had no stomach, he had no back, he had no spine, and he had
no innards at all. He didn’t have anything. So we don’t even know who
we’re talking about. It’s better that we don’t talk about him any more."

- Gabe

Also, see

  http://www.scn.org/realpoetik/Daniil-Kharms03.htm

and more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Kharms

THE LECTURE

Pushkov said:

"What is woman? An engine of love,"--and immediately got punched in the
face.

"What for?" asked Pushkov but, receiving no answer, continued:

"This is what I think: you have to roll up to women from below. Women
love that, they only pretend they don't."

Here Pushkov was again socked in the face.

"What's going on, comrades? Fine, if that's the case, I won't even
talk!" said Pushkov but, after a quarter of a minute, continued:

"Women are arranged in such a way that they are all soft and moist."

Here Pushkov again got socked in the face. Pushkov tried to look as if
he didn't notice anything and continued:

"If you sniff a woman..."

But here Pushkov got smashed in the face so hard that he grabbed his
cheek and said:

"Comrades, it is absolutely impossible to lecture under such conditions.
If this happens again, I won't talk!"

Pushkov waited a quarter of a minute and continued:

"Where were we? Oh--yes! So: Women love to look at themselves. They sit
down in front of the mirror totally naked..."

As he said that word he was punched in the face again.

"Naked," repeated Pushkov.

"Pow!" they whacked him in the face.

"Naked!" shouted Pushkov.

"Pow!" he got punched in the face.

"Naked! Naked everywhere! Tits and ass!" shouted Pushkov.

"Pow! Pow! Pow!" they kept punching him in the face.

"Tits and ass with a washtub!" Pushkov was shouting.

"Pow! Pow!" the punches rained down.

"Tits and ass with a tail!" shouted Pushkov, spinning to avoid the punches.

"Naked nun!"

But then Pushkov was hit with such force that he lost consciousness and
fell, as if mowed down, upon the floor.

Dear Friends:

I have written before, here and on the chaxblog, about the situation facing=
=20
the Steinfeld Warehouse artists, which include Chax Press. In late November=
=20
all tenants of our building were given "evacuation" notices, to be out by=20
Jan. 31, 2007. That evacuation date was soon delayed until March 31. The=20
primary reason given for the notice was that the state of Arizona Dept. of=
=20
Transportation, based on a report from their director of demolitions (who=20
is not a structural engineer), after a cursory walk-through, advised ADOT=20
that the building is not safe. The artists in the building commissioned and=
=20
paid for a full examination by a licensed structural engineer (just=20
completed) that states that there are three necessary safety repairs, but=20
these do not present health and safety concerns, and that there is no=20
reason that the building should be evacuated before or during the=20
accomplishment of these repairs. We know that ADOT is considering our=20
request that the evacuation notice either be rescinded, or that adequate=20
time (1 to 2 years) be given to further study, develop, and implement a=20
plan for our building, and that artists/tenants in the building be allowed=
=20
to remain for that period of one to two years. Many people have asked me if=
=20
they can write in support of Chax Press and the artists at the Steinfeld=20
Warehouse. The answer is "yes" and the time is NOW, as we expect some=20
decision to be made by the State of Arizona very soon.

So if you are so inclined, please write a letter or email in your own=20
words, based on the letter below =97 if you wish to include anything of your=
=20
own experience or benefit from the work of Chax Press or any other=20
artists/tenants of the building, that would be fine. Even a very brief=20
one-sentence letter or email stating "Please let the current artists and=20
tenants remain at the Steinfeld Warehouse for as long as possible," would=20
be greatly appreciated.

Dear Governor Napolitano and the Arizona Department of Transportation:

I am writing to support the continued presence and creative work of the=20
artists and tenants of the Steinfeld Warehouse in Tucson, Arizona. These=20
tenants include Chax Press, Dinnerware Arts, Alamo Woodworkers Collective,=
=20
and six individual artists (Cynthia Miller, Betina Fink, Joe Labate, Laura=
=20
La Fave, Elizabeth Criger, and Mary Theresa Dietz).  The presence of these=
=20
artists in the Steinfeld Warehouse also effects their employees, interns,=20
volunteers, participants in their educational programs, and several other=20
artists who use the building for storage of art works. For more than 20=20
years the Steinfeld artists have contributed to the Tucson community as=20
well as to artistic communities and audiences throughout the United States=
=20
and beyond, through the production of literary books, artists' books, fine=
=20
woodworks, extraordinary visual art exhibitions, and the creation of=20
paintings, sculptures, installations, and other works exhibited throughout=
=20
Arizona as well as the United States, and in London, Paris, Berlin, Mexico=
=20
City, and countless places around the globe. It is difficult to think of a=
=20
more productive and resourceful art center in Arizona than the Steinfeld=20
Warehouse. The individual artists, nonprofit arts organizations, and=20
artists' collective there should be allowed to stay.

I understand that a recent structural engineering report declares that the=
=20
building is in need of minor "shoring and bracing" work, which the artists=
=20
are determined to accomplish if they are given a year or two of continued=20
tenancy in the building. This same report also declares that such repair=20
work does not require evacuation of the building. I know that plans are in=
=20
the works to eventually rehabilitate the building thoroughly, requiring=20
major work that may require temporary building evacuation. However, that=20
work is four or more years away, and the worst thing that could happen to=20
the building in the interim is to have it stand empty, at the mercy of=20
weather, vandals, and entropy, without active tenants, such as the=20
Steinfeld artists have been, in place to maintain and upgrade the building,=
=20
as they have done for twenty years at their own cost with little or no help=
=20
from their landlord.

Please allow the Steinfeld artists to remain in their space for as long as=
=20
possible =97 at least for one to two years, and hopefully in perpetuity. The=
=20
future of the developing Tucson Historic Warehouse Arts District depends on=
=20
the active presence of artists in the Steinfeld Warehouse, a shining light=
=20
for literature and the arts in Tucson. Let it remain so, now and for the=20
future.

"Burt Kimmelman's poems flourish as they pivot from a repertoire of =

the past. And in an ever more virtual world, to the creation of fine =
books pleasing to the eye and hand.

I think the folks did a good job in the recent go-round about haiku of
posting poems in the interest of a discussion of poetics.  I think what
many are saying, and I agree, is we don't want to getting posts of poems
that are posted for no other reason that to say "here's my great new poem,
please tell me I'm clever" or "notice me, notice me" etcetc...

We could also say, if you want to post a poem for the purpose of
discussing poetics--post someone else's poem.

That's not far off from what all the announcements of
publications, far-flung readings, etc. are saying.

I've found I can delete poems I don't care to read just
as quickly as I can delete announcements of poetry
readings in, say, Fairbanks, Alaska.

The city council member's address was written as <nina.trasoff@tucson.gov>

Poetry & Popular Culture

For many people, the terms "popular" and "poetry" seem mutually
exclusive and the term "popular poetry" oxymoronic - a non sequitur in
which the commercial logic of the culture industries and the integrity
of the lyric voice or aesthetic taste are impossibly paired. Yet the
field of Cultural Studies now offers a set of rubrics by which we
might talk productively about the intersection of poetry and popular
culture.  This panel seeks to showcase innovative scholarship at that
intersection and thus invites papers reading and recovering the
history of popular poetry, examining its creation and consumption, and
exploring its various manifestations from periodical to pin-up, radio
to rock and roll, and advertisement to autograph book.

Send 300 word abstracts by April 16 to michael-chasar@uiowa.edu.

I'm finding I can also delete all the messages from
UB Poetics re messages to be posted. Lots more of
them nowadays. I'm wishing they'd include a poem
with each of those I get.

Alexander -

If the list is an open mic if it's populated with poetry, then it's just a
bulletin without it.  I see more self promotions, general announcements, and
death notices than I do thoughtful "poetics" discussions.

I think actual poetry is more interesting than discussions of poetry.  I
have low expectations regarding this list so I'm not disappointed with it's
current state.

I don't think you're wrong, but i think sometimes even an arbitrary grouping is a useful one. For me, as an autodidact born in the late seventies and growing up in the stagnant nineties about as far from the little magazines of the sixties and seventies as you can get, things like Hoover's introduction to the norton postmodern have been very useful at trying to get a structure around which to further my investigations of the poetry of the couple of generations immediately preceding mine which are currently just beginning the process of canonization. Being able to read ashbery and o'hara as somehow related to eachother and also to poets like padgett and berrigan, and as somehow having some distance from creeley or olson while at the same time all of them being somehow connected in a broader field that was itself some distance from poets like plath or collins or maya angelou who are the sorts
of people you associate with american poetry if you walk blindly into a bookstore to look at poets and not knowing anything else.

which is to say, so long as such groupings and schoolings serve a pedagogical purpose and are seen as porous and not absolute, i think they have a place at the table.

      These details and their temporal degradation
 spit stillness and reciprocal snow
 At night, carillons scream like gulls
 streaming through sexually-bruised skies
  and lighting on the relief of faces
 You smile as if this were understanding
 The fire department, slow to respond, hungry
 slide as if on strings down the street
  and reach a conflagration. Somehow
 we're holding hands, maybe
 to ward off the vicious pink of the clouds
 Anyway, we're in love, adjacent
  and content as per this series of treaties

>
>But most of the poems, including the lament by Al Hela which first sparked

>
>The defence department spokesman Jeffrey Gordon is unsurprised that access

>still classified, saying "I haven't read any of these [poems]".
>
>As with prisoners within the American justice system, he argues, there are
>constraints on their first amendment rights. "I don't think these guys are

>

Well laundrymats and "washing"  hands etc. are interesting tropes, right?
like dig them two washerwomen in finnegans wake yapping away on tHe
metaphorical banks of the liffey. a couple years back i and 3 friends did a
recording of select passageS of Fwake the laundryladies gossipaceously
chattering and we did a few quick loops and popped a tape  in the soUnd
system at the local "buanderie" and lo, it was hardly noticed.  but then
again who hears or reads finnegans walke? it was fun.
i figure no matter how ya cut the finnegans wake had to be written so irish
ears can hear it. no matter how innovative or not the building they inhabit.
or how forlorn.
So it goes, eh? as old man Kurt Vonnegut , has it.

I, too, have noticed that many of the discussions/posts have either nothing to do with poetry/poetics or are only peripherally concerned with poetics issues.  I usually can tell which these posts are from the subject line and mostly don't read them.  Are there other subscribers to the list who do the same?  Regards, Tom Savage

If the list is an open mic if it's populated with poetry, then it's just a
bulletin without it. I see more self promotions, general announcements, and
death notices than I do thoughtful "poetics" discussions.

I think actual poetry is more interesting than discussions of poetry. I
have low expectations regarding this list so I'm not disappointed with it's
current state.

I don't think I would attach any one "school" to him,
He is in many ways singular, butif you need one, he
can be counted  among the "American Surrealists" or
"school of the absurd prose poem" or...
