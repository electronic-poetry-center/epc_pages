DEWITT HENRY: PLOUGHSHARES and other =E2=80=98Sweet Dreams=E2=80=99

http://dougholder.blogspot.com  Boston Area Small Press and Poetry Scene

Interview with Doug Holder



DeWitt Henry is an acclaimed essayist, and fiction writer. He is the
founding editor of Ploughshares literary magazine. Ploughshares is perhap=
s
the most influential literary magazine in the country. Henry has a new
memoir out "Sweet Dreams" that covers his youth, his time at Harvard, the=

formation of Ploughshares, and his coming of age as a writer and a man. I=

spoke to him on my Somerville Community Access TV show: "Poet to Poet to
Writer to Writer."





Doug Holder: You are one of the most educated men I know. You have a PhD
from Harvard and an MFA from the Iowa Writer's Workshop.


DeWitt Henry: I wanted to avoid the draft ( Laugh).


DH: You came from a Philadelphia Main Line family, but your childhood was=

far from idyllic. Your dad was an alcoholic, a racist, and he abused your=

mom. Some people would retreat into drug abuse, mental illness, etc... in=

reaction to all this. Do you think literature was the elixir that saved y=
ou?


DWH: I was a child when this was going on--so I had an innocent perceptio=
n
of things. My father was a decent man; he tried to make up for what he di=
d.
I was the baby of the family; my older siblings experienced the brunt of =
it.
But really--I don't think anyone has a so-called totally "happy" backgrou=
nd.

Yes. Literature was a shelter for me. My mother was a writer and artist.
During the trauma caused by my father she had her own nervous background.=
 My
mother hooked up with a prominent psychiatrist--and later on she became a=

sort of psychiatrist's assistant. She helped my father and in a way
protected me. In retrospect I grew up in a protective environment. My sis=
ter
and mother promoted reading. My sister was very literate and a good write=
r.
She encouraged me to read stuff over my head. So in eight grade I was
reading " Crime and Punishment.' I probably didn't understand it!

DH: Your father was a successful candy manufacturer. What did he think of=

your desire to be a writer?

DWH: He wanted me to be a candy maker. I considered it--we all did at one=

point. He himself was second generation. My grandfather started the compa=
ny.
He sent my father to business school. My father got into chemistry which =
was
sort of the high tech of today--very in vogue. This was in the 1920's. He=

worked for DuPont for a year or two. He got a call when my grandfather ha=
d a
heart attack to come home and take care of the business. He essentially l=
eft
a corporate career for the sake of family.

DH: You got your PhD at Harvard and you also attended the Iowa Writers
Workshop where you studied with Richard Yates, author of "Revolutionary
Road" among other novels. Was Yates' background similar to yours?

DWH: Well he was born in Yonkers, N.Y. His mother was socially pretentiou=
s
and ambitious. She appeared in many different guises in his short stories=
.
He was 14 or 15 years older than me--but we both had the drive to rise in=

society. The Main Line Philadelphia society where I grew up was very
socially stratified. It was worse than the Boston's Brahmins. It was the
kind of a place if you went into a dry cleaner or a Woolworth's, within f=
ive
seconds they tried to place you . So we had that common background that
pushed us to succeed in society.

DH : Was there elitism prevalent in the Boston literary scene when you ar=
rived?

DWH: When I arrived there was a literary stratification between the
establishment and the young and unknown writers. The big Boston publishin=
g
houses, Harvard, were not interested in the newer or younger people. They=

did not encourage community. They were just the opposite. It was a Brahmi=
n
culture.

One thing about starting Ploughshares at the Plough and Stars Pub in Cent=
ral
Square, Cambridge, with the co-owner Peter O'Malley--was that it was Iris=
h.
Behind it was tradition of the Irish against the Boston Brahmins, against=

Harvard, against the established order.

DH: Is a pub a good place to birth a magazine?

DWH: I'm not sure I would recommend it, but there is the Irish tradition =
of
the literary pub. It goes way back to William Butler Yeats and the Irish
Renaissance. The literary pub has a tradition of readings and publishing
broadsheets. The tradition was inherent in the presence of Peter O'Malley=
 .
O'Malley is still around--you will probably find him having a drink at th=
e
pub to this day.

DH: The memoirist Malachy McCourt told me that when you write a memoir yo=
u
should not get bogged down with facts.Memoir is more about impressions.

DWH: The kind of memoir I write is more like fiction--rather than literal=

fact. You have to look hard for details for your writing. I tell my stude=
nts
to look for artifacts around their homes that are unexplained ... kind of=

bizarre. In my family we have these bear skin rugs--bear skin rugs--how d=
o
you figure that? You really have to use your imagination to make things c=
ome
alive.


DH: How important was the founding of Ploughshares in your development as=
 a
writer?



DWH: As I say on p. 196 of Sweet Dreams, that the venture of starting
"Ploughshares lent me social identify as a writer...I was taken seriously=
 by
writers my age who had themselves managed to publish books and land teach=
ing
jobs." I needed that because my first novel was such slow going. The
magazine also exposed me to contemporary poetry and fiction, and to the
emerging writers producing it, like colleagues, and I felt both in my
editing and my writing that I was talking back to them in "the cultural
conversation." I think of Tim O'Brien, Andre Dubus, Fanny Howe, Thomas Lu=
x,
James Tate, Jim McPherson, Sue Miller, Frank Bidart, David Gullette, Joyc=
e
Peseroff, the list goes on. The magazine helped to forge my sense of
literary enterprise, combining editing, writing, and teaching. It also
proved to be the credential--more than my PhD--that helped me find my pla=
ce
at Emerson College and the Creative Writing Program there. Of course, in =
the
long view back, I had been writing and producing magazines since my schoo=
l
days with a toy printing press, and later a basement print shop, and then=
 in
college editing the Amherst Literary Magazine. My love of reading, writin=
g,
and publishing had been one love for most of my life.

Elizabeth Genco and Chris Van Patten.



Is the timeless story of Doctor Faustus one about temptation from the devil=
,
or is it about gender conflict, relationship trouble, and anxieties about
technology in the modern age? Count on Gertrude Stein to tease out and
develop the latter threads from the classic tale. In her rendering of the
play, Faustus is not so much magician as modern inventor, and the
implications of the technologies he creates are only the most apparent=97an=
d,
still, highly amusing=97new wrinkles that she adds. While Mephisto remains =
a
diabolical presence throughout the play, her rendering brings forward the
conflict that Faustus=92 megalomania sparks with his love interest, the dou=
bly
named Marguerite Ida and Helena Anabelle, as well as characteristic Steinia=
n
language pyrotechnics involving a chorus and other characters, including a
Dog, a Little Boy, a Country Woman, and a mysterious Man from Over the Seas=
.


The play has been performed numerous times=97including by the Judson Poets=
=92
Group, the Wooster Group, and Robert Wilson=97as its relative accessibility
and discernible narrative line are well balanced with Gertrude Stein=92s
challenging language play. Buffalo Poets Theater, which has previously
performed Eileen Myles=92 libretto *Hell*, excerpts from Jack Spicer=92s *
Troilus*, Carla Harryman=92s *Memory Play*, and Robert Duncan=92s *Origins =
of
Old Son*, is pleased to undertake this production as part of the MSA13

2 new translations from Burning Deck now available from =
www.burningdeck.com, www.spdbooks.org, and in Europe: =
www.audiatur.no/Bokhandel

1. G=E9rard Mac=E9
THE LAST OF THE EGYPTIANS
translated from the French by Brian Evenson
Prose, 80 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-936194-11-7,  original paperback $14
Champollion loved the novels of Fenimore Cooper, in particular THE LAST =
OF THE MOHICANS. Mac=E9 explores Champollion=92s twin interests: Egypt =
and =93America=92s savage nations,=94 his deciphering of the Rosetta =
stone and the Indians=92 deciphering of the forest. He finally follows =
Champollion to the Louvre where he set up the Egyptian galleries and saw =
Indians of the Osage tribe and felt the sadness in their slow song.

     G=E9rard Mac=E9=92s unclassifiable texts cross the lines between =
essay, dream, biography, fiction, history, and poetry. His many honors =
include the Prix France Culture for the present volume (1989), and the =
Grand Prix of the Acad=E9mie fran=E7aise for life achievement (2008).

     Brian Evenson is the author of ten books of fiction, most recently =
the novel LAST DAYS and the story collection FUGUE STATE. He is the =
recipient of three O. Henry Prizes and directs Brown University's =
Literary Arts Program.

=93Though much of the text is replete with intricate details, the story =
maintains a certain dreamy quality=85. The story follows a unique path =
to storytelling that only a genuine poet could master.=94=97 hey small =
press!

2. Monika Rinck
TO REFRAIN FROM EMBRACING
translated from the German by Nicholas Grindell
Poetry, 80 pages, offset, smyth-sewn.                                    =
                =20
ISBN 978-1-936194-07-0, original paperback $14

With linguistic sophistication and a great deal of humor, Rinck sets in =
tension the most disparate ideas =93along with their margins.=94 She is =
equally at home with Kant and Bob Dylan, H=F6lderlin and bar talk. The =
book is indeed a =93tour de trance.=94

   Monika Rinck lives in Berlin and is author of 3 collections of poems =
(VERZ=DCCKTE DISTANZEN (2004), ZUM FERNBLEIBEN DER UMARMUNG (2007), =
HELLE VERWIRRUNG / RINCKS DING- UND TIERLEBEN (2010)) and a book of =
essays, AH, DAS LOVE-DING (2006). Her awards include the Ernst Meister =
and Georg K.Glaser prizes.

    Nicholas Grindell, born in the UK in 1968, has been living in Berlin =
as a translator since 1993. His poetry translations have appeared in =
SHEARSMAN, DICHTEN=3D, CHICAGO REVIEW etc.

=93As adaptable, multifaceted, and aggressively engaged as any voice in =
contemporary German poetry, Monika Rinck is a poet of intellect, =
experimentation and humour. Her work over the last decade has been =
marked by a singular turn of expression, the profound imbedded in a =
poetic discourse that disarms the reader.=94 =97S. J. Fowler, 3:AM =

Women Writers:
In response to Amy Kings assertion that women writers find it hard to get p=
ublished in the media, we done our bit to rectify the percieved wrong. We s=
ent out a special call for women writers, which increased, but so did male =
writer submissions, leaving us a 45-55% breakdown still in favour of male w=
riters, to spite a campaign of emails, facebook and twitter posting and pos=
ts inviting submissions from female writers on this and other listserves. H=
owever, the results were excellent, and we are proud to bring you our selec=
tion of writers.

Celebrating New Titles By Steve Fellner, Paolo Javier, Mary Mackey
and Stephen Paul Miller.

Thursday, October 27, 2011
6:00 PM - 8:00 PM
Ceres Gallery, 547 West 27th St .
Suite201, New York , NY 10001


Steve Fellner: The Weary World Rejoices

"Steve Fellner takes us into the hidden places in this beautiful and fright=
ening collection. Here is testimony to the brave and shameful impulses of t=
he human heart, composed in language that is both familiar and completely o=
riginal.... You will not forget these poems."
-Laura Kasischke


Paolo Javier: The Feeling Is Actual

"Javier hits the big notes: sex, romance, even aging and regret. The poetry=
 often comes in the form of prose ... and of visual poetry in which comics =
collide with sly wit. All this with the multi-cultural vantage we expect fr=
om the poet, which comes to the fore in later sections, abetted by found im=
ages and typography. 'if im like a piece of bok choy / then you are probabl=
y / a piece of broccoli... /its just the communication thing.' Listen to th=
is book, watch it, lap it up." -Vincent Katz


Mary Mackey: Sugar Zone

"Mary Mackey takes you on a fascinating journey to the interior, somewhere =
between Saint Theresa's Inner Castle and the thicket of Eros-but also a pla=
ce of desperate actuality, even if it is 'on the other side of the world.' =
Mackey joins other visionary poets of d=E9paysement-Henri Michaux in Asia, =
John Ash in Anatolia, Sharon Doubiago in Peru , Lorca in Manhattan . But Ma=
ckey really seems to recover a lost part of herself in the edgy lyricism of=
 the tropics, haunted by fado, forro, and death . . . SUGAR ZONE authoritat=
ively creates a language and a culture; but the lines are tense with the vu=
lnerability of lovers, strangers, and travelers with no ticket home."
 - Dennis Nurkse


Stephen Paul Miller: There Is Only One God
and You're Not It

"Stephen Paul Miller has written the most swingin', rockin', jazzy history =
of Judaism, Jews, and our favorite one and only God there is, that you will=
 ever read. In verse. And if you read it you will have to think about it. W=
hile tapping your foot. And is it unbelievably funny to see this maniac of =
a poet wrestling with a disembod=ADied spirit aided by Plato and Irving Ber=
lin? That too. With Hitchcock and John Cage wagging the dog? Enter this boo=
k, you enter Indie Poetry."
-Alicia Ostriker

ALEPH NULL
http://atticusreview.org/aleph-null

Aleph Null is an online interactive work of visual art written in JavaScript
using the new HTML 5 canvas tag. No plugin required.

It's a playful activity, the goal of which is to experience color music (no
audio) and create something you like to look at.

The experience of color music isn't so much about the creation of beautiful
stills as experiencing and modulating/modifying the flow of color and shape
in a pleasing way.

But it's also possible to approach Aleph Null toward the creation of
beautiful stills. See http://vispo.com/aleph/jim for my own attempt at
creating beautiful stills with Aleph Null. These are best experienced at
night. Or at least with the lights off.

Aleph Null is best viewed with Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, though it also
works with other browsers and IE 9. It also runs on smart phones and the
iPad, though it runs more slowly on these devices.

Aleph Null is my first work using the new HTML 5 canvas tag and the first
serious visual work of art I've seen created with the canvas tag.

Hi Everyone,

My interview with the prolific and multitalented Michael Lally is not only =
worth checking out because you might have an interest in his work but also =
because the story he tells is a fascinating piece of literary and more broa=
dly cultural history. Our conversation has just been published in Jacket2.

Well worth a look: http://jacket2.org/


Warm wishes,

Burt

Subject:      rob's first two novels now (apparently,
              only) available via the author,

As part of the winding down of Toronto's long-running The Mercury Press,
the last copies of my first two novels--white (2007) and missing persons
(2009)--are (apparently) now available only through me, with a half-dozen
boxes appearing recently at my front door. If anyone is interested in
either one, they're $20 each (postage included; outside of Canada, $20 US)
either via my paypal on the sidebar, or by sending cheques to me at: 402
McLeod Street #3, Ottawa ON Canada K2P 1A6.

Related links; the Globe & Mail review of white; review/article on white
in Edmonton's Vue weekly; white on the 2008 ReLit Award longlist ; Cassie
Leigh on missing persons ; the short essay I wrote on the geography of
missing persons;

http://robmclennan.blogspot.com/2011/10/robs-first-two-novels-now-apparently.html

It's disappointing to have all my fiction out-of-print. Here's hoping that
I can get that third novel placed, fourth done and out, and/or even that
collection of short short stories finished. Sigh,

at the loft of Connie Crothers
with Crothers on piano and Jemeel Mondoc alto sax
475 Kent Avenue, #410, in S. Williamsburg
3:00-6:00  $10 suggested contribution




Take any subway train to 14th Street, where you can get the L train to
Brooklyn. Get out at the Bedford Ave. stop, the first one in Brooklyn. If
you want to take a bus from the subway, leave the platform at the Driggs
Ave. exit. Take the #62 bus, the only bus that stops there. The bus stop
is in front of the pizza place. The ride usually lasts about 15 minutes.
Get off the bus at Division Ave. and Berry Street. Walk toward the water
on Division Ave. for two blocks to Kent Ave., turn right one block to 475
Kent. It's that big, gray former warehouse building. The number on the
door buzzer is 410. That means fourth floor, tenth unit. The door to the
floor should be locked. Don't worry about it. I'll be right out.


Walking from the L train subway stop: Either walk west on N. 7th St. to
Kent Ave., (3 blocks), then turn left and walk about 19 blocks to 475
Kent, or walk south on Bedford Ave. (walk to the left from the Bedford
Ave. exit), turn right on Broadway, turn left on Kent Ave.


You can also take the J or M train to the Marcy Ave. stop. Take the #62
bus which stops at Roebling St.,corner of S. 8th St. (near Broadway),  to
Division Ave. and Berry Street (see above). If you prefer to walk, turn
left on Havemeyer to Division Ave., turn right and walk seven blocks to
Kent Ave., turn right one block to 475.


By car or by taxi from Manhattan--get on the Williamsburg Bridge from
Delancey St., in the right lane. Exit at the first exit, "Broadway-Staten
Island." Go straight across the intersection. Go two blocks to the next
light (Division Avenue), Turn right. Go to the end of the street and turn
right at Kent Avenue. 475 Kent is at the end of the block.


By car from the BQE: going north, take the Flushing Ave. exit, turn left
on Classon, turn onto Kent Ave., stay on Kent to 475. (watch for Division
Ave. 475 is on the next corner--S. 11th St.); going south, exit at
Metropolitan Ave., take Metropolitan to Wythe Ave., turn left and go to
Division Ave., turn right on Division to Kent. Turn right to 475, one
block. There is parking on Kent Ave.

Tranströmer.I heard him read just once, at one of the early Poets House
venues or NYU where I taught and was immediately taken by the clean
precision, the almost conversational and yet insistent tone of the
translations---I think they were Robin Fulton's---a tone that I could
only intuit as being in the Swedish lines that Tranströmer read.Looking
again at those translations, I sense that the poetry was always
performing some balancing act between the poet's need to get down what
he saw and felt, and a certain almost disbelief about whether literary
composition could ever achieve the rendering of a personal vision.So
many of Tranströmer's poems begin in observable data and end in an odd
swerve into the surreal, almost an escape mechanism into an unplanned
and unforeseen imaginative realm.He remarked to Fulton in an interview
that the release of inner pressure sparked by a "very special kind of
ignition" began the poem. Where it would go, no poet could ever be
sure.Confidence then is an odd thing in poetry, not that the next word
will be right, but that our loyalty to the process is itself a leap into
the unknown.I think this is the nature of Tranströmer's fidelity to the
poem, the willingness to leave (to surrender?) the known spaces of the
world in order to find what is true simultaneously to both that
"ignition" and to language itself:

And the sea wind is in the dry pines further away, hurrying over the
churchyard sand,

past the leaning stones, the pilot's names.

The dry sighing

of great doors opening and great doors closing.

(page 118 from "Baltics" of /Tomas Tranströmer: Selected Poems/
translated by Robin Fulton)

*Bringing the Text Back Home:*

What Alphabets have Made of Us

From Papyrus Fragments to Electronic Screens



By Karl Young



Beginning in the mid 1960s, I started trying to expand the poetic
possibilities of Greek literary fragments. I often used ideas generated by
art forms that ran under such banners as minimalism and multimedia, as well
as models from advertising and accidental characteristics of mimeograph
production, to draw greater significance from fragments. I was interested i=
n
the way the origins of literacy and Western culture related to the present.



In 1975, I changed my source to fragments written in Aramaic and left by a
colony of Jewish exiles in Egypt during the first Diaspora. Many of the
fragments were lists of names based in the Biblical Book of Psalms, implyin=
g
or registering circumstances of birth and social position, the fathers'
pride and the mothers' pain, the fears, hopes, and obligations of
individuals in a precariously situated community. The fragments =96 the old=
est
Jewish writing that survives on anything like paper =96 included the first
mention of a pogrom, and lists used in managing the daily affairs of the
community. This seemed an ideal starting point for a brief and gritty sketc=
h
of some of the basics of Western history. The result was a book, Cried and
Measured, published by David Meltzer's Tree Books in 1977.



I moved on to early fragments of Old Latin. In my workings of the earliest
texts in the alphabet that we now use, I turned to an exploration of readin=
g
practices in relation to poetry in our own time. The Roman alphabet evolved
into a writing system that could be read silently. This reduced or destroye=
d
the sound patterns which had distinguished poetry from other forms of
language art. In working with Old Latin fragments, I used some of the
practices of early writing (inconsistent direction of reading; lack of
separation between words) to create rhythms by differing reading speeds,
replacing such devices as metrics with pacing that didn't depend on
audibility. At a time when literati were talking about "interrogating" the
nature of meaning, it was discouraging to me to see how much trouble they
had with a work like this which experimented with the more basic questions
of the essential mechanics of reading. In this much larger book, frameworks
of stoicism, dread, tranquility, and, despair frame comic and quotidian
trills. bpNichol published the book that resulted, Should Sun Forever Shine=
,
in 1980.



That next step was the translation into contemporary terms by the distant
descendents of the authors of the original documents which survived in
fragments. For Cried and Measured, that would require a contemporary Jew,
who had lost family in the Holocaust, and was, as the Psalms put it, "A
stranger in a strange land," living outside Israel and writing in a languag=
e
other than Hebrew. Marton Koppany, a Hungarian Jew whose very name resemble=
s
those of the fragments, offered to do the job. Since Marton is, in my
opinion, the best literary minimalist I'm familiar with, I could not have
been more fortunate. There were many coincidences in this work: My father, =
a
U.S. Army chaplain, had given primary aid to the survivors of the
concentration camp at Dachau; an event which changed his life and set in
motion aspects of mine before I was born. My father taught at an Army base
in Germany when the Soviets destroyed the Hungarian uprising of 1956. As a
child watching these events unfold at close hand, they had a significant
impact on my worldview.



I had several Italian translators in mind through much of the 90s and early
00s, particularly those belonging to the Inismo group. However, I came into
contact with Anny Ballardini, who worked extensively with internet
publication. She seemed an ideal translator for more reasons than I could
have imagined or hoped for in advance. This completed the basic process of
"bringing the text back home"  - I had first returned to the origins of
western culture in Judaism, from whence the figure Jerome Rothenberg had
called "the first universal Jew" had given the Mediterranean world a nexus
of ideas around which to build a new religion. A modern Jewish exile had
translated it into the language of a hostile nation. The writing system the
Romans used for their evangelical book, like it or not, has held the west
together ever since. Likewise, a modern Italian woman who had made extensiv=
e
use of the Roman alphabet in cyberspace, translated my second fragment book
into Modern Italian, the language into which Old Latin has evolved. Its
alphabet, made transmissible by digital electronics, was the first to make
the internet a force in binding the world's individuals together. I used th=
e
first Roman efforts at writing to suggest a new poetic process, as well as
to transform visual poetry into a more complex and flexible genre.



Although drafts have been on-line for comment since New Year's Day, and
annexes will be added, my birthday, with Yom Kippur starting on its sunset,
seems a good day to make a general announcement of its presence.



At a time of geo-political crisis, and in the midst of revolutions in
communication, we, the distant heirs of the origins of what's best and wors=
t
in western culture, the more immediate heirs of the Holocaust, the gulags,
the country that could unleash nuclear weapons on the world, as well as the
most rapid expanse in human knowledge and human potential, (and perhaps the
last generation to learn to write without the availability of electronic
communication) look back at our origins, and forward with confidence in the
evolution of writing, and at least some examples of adaptability and
survival to make hope seem more than a sentimental joke.

This book explores influence by crossing out or responding to poets who hav=
e
influenced me.  The Whitman and Andrade pieces are cross-outs, and anyone
familiar with the first version of C*alamus* will notice that I did not
respond to the entire collection.  I left out pieces that I did not think
would cut well for my project or pieces that have too much personal meaning
for me.  The response pieces to Leopardi and Neruda are probably even more
telling, for in these pieces, it is sometimes difficult to see how the
pieces directly relate to the original.  Still, the influence is there
reworked through my experience.   =97*William Allegrezza*

with Crothers on piano and Jemeel Mondoc alto sax
475 Kent Avenue, #410, in S. Williamsburg
3:00-6:00  $10 suggested contribution




Take any subway train to 14th Street, where you can get the L train to
Brooklyn. Get out at the Bedford Ave. stop, the first one in Brooklyn. If
you want to take a bus from the subway, leave the platform at the Driggs
Ave. exit. Take the #62 bus, the only bus that stops there. The bus stop
is in front of the pizza place. The ride usually lasts about 15 minutes.
Get off the bus at Division Ave. and Berry Street. Walk toward the water
on Division Ave. for two blocks to Kent Ave., turn right one block to 475
Kent. It's that big, gray former warehouse building. The number on the
door buzzer is 410. That means fourth floor, tenth unit. The door to the
floor should be locked. Don't worry about it. I'll be right out.


Walking from the L train subway stop: Either walk west on N. 7th St. to
Kent Ave., (3 blocks), then turn left and walk about 19 blocks to 475
Kent, or walk south on Bedford Ave. (walk to the left from the Bedford
Ave. exit), turn right on Broadway, turn left on Kent Ave.


You can also take the J or M train to the Marcy Ave. stop. Take the #62
bus which stops at Roebling St.,corner of S. 8th St. (near Broadway),  to
Division Ave. and Berry Street (see above). If you prefer to walk, turn
left on Havemeyer to Division Ave., turn right and walk seven blocks to
Kent Ave., turn right one block to 475.


By car or by taxi from Manhattan--get on the Williamsburg Bridge from
Delancey St., in the right lane. Exit at the first exit, "Broadway-Staten
Island." Go straight across the intersection. Go two blocks to the next
light (Division Avenue), Turn right. Go to the end of the street and turn
right at Kent Avenue. 475 Kent is at the end of the block.


By car from the BQE: going north, take the Flushing Ave. exit, turn left
on Classon, turn onto Kent Ave., stay on Kent to 475. (watch for Division
Ave. 475 is on the next corner--S. 11th St.); going south, exit at
Metropolitan Ave., take Metropolitan to Wythe Ave., turn left and go to
Division Ave., turn right on Division to Kent. Turn right to 475, one
block. There is parking on Kent Ave.

exactly tho is there a place for emotion any longer in poetry? my poetry is
suffused with emotion--old hat? an endless discussion & I am grappling with
it to the degree I can.

&Now Festival of New Writing:
Tomorrowland Forever!

October 13-15, 2011
University of California at San Diego

Full schedule:
http://andnowfestival.com/program

Free featured events:
http://andnowfestival.com/featured-events

&NOW is a festival of fiction, poetry, and staged play readings; literary rituals, performance pieces (digital, sound, and otherwise), electronic and multimedia projects; and intergenre literary work of all kinds, including criti-fictional presentations and creatively critical papers. We particularly encourage pieces that promote linguistic and genre transgressions, along with literary artworks that promote interdisciplinary explorations and conversations with past, present, or future literary concerns and movements.

&NOW 2011: Tomorrowland Forever! is especially interested in literary artistic and literary critical works that circle ideas of innovation, experimentation, newness, and not-yetness; in futurisms of all kinds; in queries about progress, technology, market practices, and identity in relation to them; and in the possibilities of interrelationship between arts and other disciplines and engaged practices.

Someone I was ina poetry group for many years with loved him & was
influenced by his writing. She had been in therapy & had a surreal bent & a
sense of linguistics, all of which she gleaned from the translations of his
poetry, always hard-edged & clear tho wading in murky waters. He remained
psychologically convincing no matter how far from the image he went, as I
remember.

Camille Martin is the author of three collections of poetry: Sonnets,
Codes of Public Sleep , and Sesame Kiosk. Steeped in lyric traditions
and influenced by her training as a pianist, her poetry is known for
its meditative and musical qualities. Yet it also restlessly questions
the assumptions of traditional lyricism, form, and narrative.

Of Sonnets, Rae Armantrout observes that =93in some ways, these poems
are almost traditional," yet "in these taut, fast-paced, self-aware
poems, the lyric meets 21st-century paranoia and sparks fly.=94 Carol
Dorf writes that Martin creates =93a world where science and myth
intersect,=94 a =93world of a mind reflecting on itself, the natural and
built environments, time, and language.=94 And Jordan Scott speaks of
=93the magnificence in these poems, a poetic magnetic, propelling you to
turn the page.=94

One of her current poetry projects is =93Looms,=94 a collection of layered
narratives. She is also working on =93The Evangeline Papers,=94 a poetic
sequence based on her Acadian/Cajun heritage and her participation in
archaeological digs at an eighteenth-century village in Nova Scotia.
Her finds: wine bottles and smoking pipes.

She blogs at Rogue Embryo, and her website is www.camillemartin.ca

Symposium on Irish language blogging


This year IMRAM joins force with City Arts to look at the future of
Irish-language literature on-line. Broadcaster and writer Scott de
Buitl=E9ir will be joined by journalist and author Alex Hijmans; blogger
Aonghus =D3 hAlmahin; poet and blogger Alison N=ED Dhorchaidhe; and Mary
Burns, administrator of Facebook group Gaeilge Amh=E1in.


Is blogging the next step forward for Irish-language literature? Has
the arrival of social websites and Twitter rendered blogging obsolete?
Can minority languages flourish on the internet? These are just some
of the questions that will be discussed in this provocative symposium.

I heard Robert Bly, that John Wayne of poets, read Transtromer translatio=
ns=20
at least five years ago, at the CUNY Grad Center. Bly was big and bluster=

God-damned admirable and really, sorta lovable; so enthusiastic about=20
Transtr=F6mer and in encouraging more translations. That's when I keyed i=
n on=20
Transtr=F6mer (& realized yet again what I'd miss w/o our *great* arm=

translators). I'm half Swedish so always eager to counter native gloomine=

Saorchead isteach/free admission

A towering figure in Scottish literature, Sorley MacLean was a
love poet par excellence. He was also a political poet who bravely
tackled themes of oppression and hardship both in Scotland and
throughout the world. In many ways, his work brought Scottish
Gaelic poetry into the modern world for the first time. But his work
had deep roots in the Gaelic tradition, and the fresh modernism
of his work was founded on the corner stones of that tradition.
In this lecture, M=E1ire N=ED Annrach=E1in will provide a new reading
of some of Maclean=92s best-known poems, illuminating and
celebrating their themes of love, heroism and the very land itself.

Tha tim, am fiadh, an coille Hallaig
Time, the deer, is in the wood of Hallaig.

A new challenge: Avant-rhyme. Avant rhyme is the admixture of
fragmentation and non-narrative discourse and rhyme applied either
systematically (closed avant-rhyme), or non-systematically (open
avant-rhyme). The goal is to instill sonic depth in performance and the
model to follow is parkour.

Hi Folks - this is just to let you know that this Wednesday, October 19,
i'll be featuring at the Unitarian Church on the corner of Pierrepont
St. and Monroe Place in Brooklyn Heights - the reading runs from 7:00
until 9:00 and there will be an open mic as well - it's an intimate
little reading usually held in the wood-panelled Alice White Room - the
entrance is at 50 Monroe Place on the side of the building down several
steps - it's near the Court St. stop on the "R" train and the Borough
Hall stop on the 2, 3, 4, and 5 trains - there's a $3 admission  charge
- i'll be reading poems that tell stories (both linear and more subtle)
including a few in the spirit of the Halloween season

+++++

then on Halloween itself i'll be part of Evie Ivy's Dance of the Word
Halloween Belly Dance & Poetry event at the Cornelia St. Cafe, featuring
Evie Ivy and her dancers (easily worth the price of admission alone)
along with poets Robert Gibbons, Robin Small-McCarthy, Bob Heman, Jack
Tricarico, et al. - it will be a lot of fun and a perfect way to start
your Halloween evening - it will begin right at 6:00 and run until 8:00
- admission is $12 and includes a drink - the Cornelia St. Cafe is at 29
Cornelia St. (just off of Bleecker St.) in Greenwich Village and is near
the West 4th Street Station on  the A, B, C, D, E, F, and M train lines
and the Christopher Street Station on the "1" train - the wearing of
masks & costumes is encouraged - i'll be reading all "spooky" poems

+++++

then on Sunday, November 6th, from 2:00 until 5:00 p.m., i'll be part of
the 8th Annual Brevitas Festival of the Short Poem at the Bowery Poetry
Club - it's a unique event - Brevitas is a group dedicated to the small
poem who twice a month share poems no longer than 14 lines - there will
be over 40 poets participating - and while each poet reads their poems,
the poems will be projected on a screen above their heads - in addition
each person attending will receive a free copy of an anthology of all
the poems being read (and more!) - the anthology is a handsome
professionally-produced perfect-bound book and is easily worth the price
of admission ($7) - so for you a mere $7 you'll get to hear over 40
poets read and see their works projected and get to take home a book
with all those poems (and more that weren't read) - the Bowery Poetry
Club is on Bowery (a.k.a. 3rd avenue) between Bleecker and Houston (just
across from where CBGB's used to be) and is near the Broadway-Lafayette
Station on the "D" and "F" lines, and the Bleecker Street Station on the
"6" train and the Prince Street Station on the "R" - it will be a great
afternoon

+++++

so hopefully you'll mark all of this on your calendars and maybe come to
my feature on Wednesday and to the two great group events (both of them
unique)

see you all soon

- Bob

Excerpt below:
CM: From the very beginning I have always described my writing as literally=
 attempting to empty my head. The thoughts that hounded me and would not go=
 away, I tried to get down on paper. Along with this are the bits of words =
flashing about. To me it=E2=80=99s a troubling process. It is I suppose an =
expression of self. A never-ending sculpture that you can walk around in an=
d explore. No matter how horrific it may be. [...]

JB: My place in the world? Do I have one? If we are defined by what we do t=
hen I am a poet, some of those poems are sung more abstractly than others, =
including visual poetry. I also play musical instruments=E2=80=94the guitar=
 first, but also piano, banjo, mandolin and a little flute. I write the occ=
asional review and bits of prose that might be called philosophical. I draw=
 and paint, work with clay and wood. I have had books and CDs published. I =
don't know if this places me in the world. I don't know if any of it has ha=
d any impact. I try to be a reliable companion to my wife, a reliable human=
 to the cats in our home and tend house=E2=80=94all in what most people wou=
ld consider a very eccentric fashion. I also try to be a good friend and us=
ually fail by anyone's standards, including my own. Where does all this pla=
ce one in relation to the world? [...]

Fabulous, Jesse - reminds me of Doc Drumheller here in New Zealand,

avant-rhyme,
Lisa

The editors of LRL e-editions are thrilled to announce the launch of SIX ne=
w
books! This time around, we=92re changing things up a bit:

In the past, we=92ve only ever charged $2-3 over cost for our print-on-dema=
nd
books. We=92re now ready to commit to making exactly $0 from this series: *=
FROM
NOW ON, ALL PROFITS FROM THE SALE OF PRINT-ON-DEMAND BOOKS IN THIS SERIES
WILL BE DONATED TO A DIFFERENT SMALL PRESS EACH YEAR*. First up: Chax
Press<http://www.chax.org/>.
So, any purchase of a print-on-demand title from this series during
2011-2012 will have the added benefit of helping to support the efforts of
Chax!

Over the next few weeks, we=92ll launch one or two titles at a time, beginn=
ing
with a book-length review of Michael Cross=92s *Haecceities* (Cuneiform,
2010)<http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/catalog/group-review-of-michael-cro=
sss-haecceities>,
which is now available for download/purchase.
Please stay tuned for new books from David Brazil, Sarah Mangold, Hugo
Garc=EDa Manr=EDquez, and Pattie McCarthy=96as well as one monumental repri=
nt from
Beverly Dahlen!

Subject:      Parks & Occupation, Hasty Call for Work
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Dear all:

1. an announcement, that the production of the next full issue (this one
titled =91Lithic=92) has *not *been abandoned. Production has been slow or =
on
hold, but by no means stopped.

2. in the meantime, and in light of the continuing occupation of Zucotti
Park in NYC (along with similar actions everywhere) *Whiskey & Fox* is goin=
g
to take up the torch of its earlier hasty mode of production, making haste
on a series of very short issues in a special series dispatched specificall=
y
for the various radical occupations currently underway. What is meant by
=93for the occupations=94 is not =93in tribute to,=94 perhaps not even =93i=
n
solidarity with,=94 but as a foxing of theory and poetry/poetics into the
occupations/as part of the occupations. See the full call for work at,
Whiskeyandfox.org <http://whiskeyandfox.org>, download the nice-looking PDF
of the call for work here in order to circulate
it<https://sites.google.com/site/whiskeyfoxarchive/Home/parksandoccupation.=
pdf>,
or just see below:

*Parks & Occupation*: a call for work
*Vol. 5, Special series (dedicated to Denise Levertov & Robert Duncan)*

 Writing as the Office for Soft Architecture, Canadian poet Lisa Robertson
asks, =93what shall our new ornaments be? How shall we adorn mortality
now?=94=97insisting that =93this is a serious political question.=94 *Whisk=
ey
& Fox*wishes to provisionally believe this and calls for work that
will function
to ornamentally elaborate the current occupations of parks, squares, etc.

An editorial in the second issue of the *Occupied Wall Street
Journal*states, =93For Wall Street and Washington, the demand is not on
them to give
us something that isn=92t theirs to give. It=92s ours. It=92s on us. We are=
n=92t
going anywhere. We just got here.=94 But where are we; and how are we going=
 to
think, elaborate, and decorate this place? It is no surprise that the space=
s
currently occupied are parks. Park space in particular already ornaments,
articulates the interfaces of our human affects with countless non-human
ecologies. This is not a matter of aesthetic surplus. How we decorate a new
kind of a public space will matter; it will determine the variability of it=
s
surfaces. As we continue to witness capitalism collapse in on itself it wil=
l
become more and more urgent to elaborate parkspace, even in small hasty
bursts; to decorate the spaces we already occupy as parks with/as the
ornaments that will articulate the spaces of a new democracy. But how to
decorate the new park? How does poetry occupy such a park? For example, is
there room for the intimacy of the coterie in the new park, or must the
=91public=92 projects of Duncan and Olson dominate?

*Whiskey & Fox* asks for paragraph-long essays, poems, images, et alia, to
publish in a special series which will return to our short format issues
(roughly 6 pages an issue). For this series the =91Fox again requests hasty
writing and will proceed with hasty publication of very brief issues to
facilitate hard copy distribution. The libraries accumulating at the public
occupations are of increasing importance and in need of, among other
contributions, those pertinent to issues of the queer sexual politics which
inhere in *Whiskey & Fox=92s *function as a journal of poetry, theory, and
queer-heterotopoi.

*Whiskey & Fox *asks you to =91language Language for democratic dwelling,=
=92
Make haste! Decorate the new democracy. Send contributions to
*parksandoccupation
[at] whiskeyandfox [dot] org*.

The fox =93raids the chicken =91coup=92 and snacks on the state.=94

Somatic Engagement: the politics, poetics and publics of embodiment.
A Chain Links book.

Edited by community artist, scholar, and dancer Petra Kuppers, the
book opens with Arnieville, a Californian protest camp of disability,
homelessness, and poverty activists. From there, a series of
enactments welcome trespass and incursion in the name of survival.

Amy Sara Carroll on the Transborder Immigrant Tool, a GPS phone that
uses poetry to lead the disoriented and thirsty to water caches and
safety sites in the US-Mexican borderlands.

Devora Neumark on washing Tali Goodfriend?s hands in Lebanese olive
oil outside the hotel where Colin Powell speaks to the Jewish National
Fund, hands gliding over one another in the middle of an angry public
protest.

Christian Nagler on writing an experimental novel while conducting an
oral history of agricultural labor practices and migration patterns at
the site of the Panamerican Highway in El Salvador.

Georgina Kleege on touch and blindness as she discusses Katherine
Sherwood?s paintings of magic and the human brain, paintings that
Sherwood began after her stroke ten years ago.

Eleni Stecopoulos on the healing quest as research and the
complexities of cultural appropriation.

Amber DiPietra and Denise Leto on the collaborative connections of
breath, body, pause, pain, and form. Somatic Engagement is an

and touch.

Subject:      rob's newest poetry collection: A (short) history of l.
              (BuschekBooks); Ottawa + Toronto launches,

My most recent poetry collection, A (short) history of l. (BuschekBooks)
is now available. To order, check the BuschekBooks website, or drop $20
(outside Canada, $20 US) and I'll mail you a copy. Copies will also be
available at the fall edition of the ottawa small press book fair,
November 5, 2011.

rob mclennans A (short) history of l. is a collection of short, sharp,
tight, lyric love poems, written still under the influence of the Canadian
ghazal (as brought into Canadian literature through British ex-pat John
Thompson), writing evasive and disparate leaps between lines that leave
the connection sometimes thin, and often open-bare. How far can a poem go
when so many seemingly unconnected references are woven through the text,
the idea of the love poem, including science, popular culture, old film
stars, historical characters? A (short) history of l. works to
specifically place these poems firmly in the immediate world, one that
includes the whole world and not just compartmentalizing love away from
all else. When we love, do we lose our interest in the world?

   Challenging but never cryptic, intimate but never insular, these poems
   deftly walk a series of fine lines. mclennan is a master at writing the
   particular details of any mo­ment in such a way that the reader is free to
   imagine the larger structures of feeling and meaning. The results are
   exhilarating!
		Andy Weaver, author of Gangson

   Oh, the stubborn heart. A (short) history of l. read with the urgency of
   an impossible narrative. Hunger, longing, desire, confusion, ache...what
   more did you want? mclen­nan has carved an ancient story new. These are
   poems to fall into without regret.
		Rhonda Douglas, author of Some Days I Think I Know Things

The author of more than twenty trade books of poetry, fiction and
non-fiction in a number of countries, rob mclennan has published work in
over two hundred trade journals in fourteen countries and three languages,
and performed in Ireland, England, Wales, the United States and across
Canada. His most recent titles are the poetry collections Glengarry
(Vancouver: Talon, 2011), kate street (Chicago: Moira, 2011) and 52
flowers (or, a perth edge) (Japan: Obvious Epiphanies, 2010) and a sec­ond
novel, missing persons (Toronto: The Mercury Press, 2009). In 1999, he won
the CAA/Air Canada Prize for most promising writer (in any genre) in
Canada under the age of thirty, and spent the 2007-8 academic year in
Edmonton as writer-in-res­idence at the University of Alberta, and, since
June 2003, has been regularly posting reviews, essays, interviews and
other notices at robmclennan.blogspot.com. rob lives in Ottawa, Ontario.

AUTHOR=E2=80=99S STATEMENT:

=20

This book intends to present both verbal and visual poetries as equal. Thou=
gh notions of poetics have shifted and swerved, what has stayed solid throu=
ghout is that the alphabet, the word =E2=80=93 however arranged =E2=80=93 c=
ontains, within it, dual significance. First, the proto-historic role of th=
e visual conveyance of represented fact. Second, the overriding desire of h=
uman utterance to substantiate existence. In conjoining these two models th=
is book hopes to form a third, blurred value. Thought and experience are fa=
ctors that accrue, while staring and writing help resolve and conclude. Tex=
t itself is an amalgam of units of meaning. As you stare at text you notice=
 the visual aspects of letters. As one stares further, meaning loses its hi=
erarchy and words discorporate and the alphabet itself begins to surface. S=
hapes, spatial relations and visual associations emerge as one delves furth=
er. Alphabetic bits or parts or snippets of letters can create an added vis=
ual vocabulary amidst the very text one is reading. One aim, to this end, i=
s to merge and hinge visual and textual writing into workable forms. This b=
ook collects some of these experiments.

COMMENTS ON TEXT LOSES TIME:=20

=E2=80=9CPart nested Minimalist cubes and part laser light that won't diver=
ge across distance, Nico Vassilakis' poetry seems to ask whether we are pri=
mates at play on a baseball diamond of memory and desire beside mural-lined=
 public structures slipping toward infinite regression.

=20

Richly iterative, these pairings and alphabets escape the mirror to thrill =
us with variation and sting all forms of complacency. Vassilakis extends Ou=
lipian strategies:  Perec references, lamellisections, crystalline build-ou=
ts and transpositions, a scat of nonrepresentational vocables, lettered whi=
rlwinds giving speed for legibility, --  "extracting the gem through layers=
 of gauze" and, other times, lowering a gem into a fold.

=20

Can an argument between a machine that produces texts and "longhand into ti=
ny notebooks" wake us up?  In pain, "the throbbing thumb" makes us "attend =
to the living."

=20

If Vassilakis revises the rock lyric "meet-the-new-boss, same-as-the-old-bo=
ss" to "meet the solipsistic era. same as the old solipsistic era,"  is tre=
atment to be had in a bar, a science lab, or will it reach us over the radi=
o?  Try a road trip, so "you can't afford to blink, to be blind for even a =
second" going through a colander out where dust is breeding and "glass trap=
s lighting" like no scene you've seen in quite this way. Through crevices, =
perforations, punctures, piercings, pinholes, see neighborhoods as "that pl=
ace where organized sleeping happens." So, look for a faceted colony that "=
sometimes congeals."=E2=80=9D

=20

--Deborah Meadows

=20

=E2=80=9CNico Vassilakis' Text Loses Time unhinges the folds of the book an=
d the word; as the 'folded loose leafed sheets whiz past your ears' you can=
 hear the echoes of meaning. The words flake off the page like aged paint l=
eaving a patina of colour and meaning on the surface and a growing heap of =
signification at our feet. Here the means of writing rise up and turn again=
st our expectation, lurching into new spaces. Letters become tactile, meani=
ng becomes rubbery, and both reading and writing become a new collaboration=

AND OTHER POEMS

by Collin Tholl //

The Red Jasper in Dublin :

_____________________________________


Through song, dream-like narrative, and contemplations on imagery both
abstract and concrete, Collin Tholl's debut chapbook, =93It's the Age of
Alligator and Other Poems,=94 urges a fundamental revaluation of our
collective perception as well as the relationship we have with the
forces governing over our everyday lives.  The poems, though seemingly
disparate, are bound by an oscillation between an earnest reflection
on the universality of suffering and a detached, unaffiliated
mysticism yearning to transcend such cynicism.  Underlying Tholl's
meditations and cries for liberation is a language punctuated with a
childlike playfulness that is humorous yet assuredly sincere.  This
voice leads us to the periphery of some forgotten state of primal
innocence =97 a state in which enlightenment may not necessarily be
attained, but is glimpsed at as a taunting possibility, just barely
out of our reach.

Network Archaeology
Conference at Miami University, Oxford OH
April 20-21, 2012
Call for Papers (submissions due November 29, 2011)

This conference will bring together scholars and practitioners to =
explore the resonances between digital networks and =93older=94 (perhaps =
still emergent) systems of circulation; from roads to cables, from =
letter-writing networks to digital ink. Drawing on recent research in =
media archaeology, we see network archaeology as a method for =
re-orienting the temporality and spatiality of network studies. Network =
archaeology might pay attention to the history of distribution =
technologies, location and control of geographical resources, the =
emergence of circulatory models, proximity and morphology, network =
politics and power, and the transmission properties of media. What can =
we learn about contemporary cultural production and circulation from the =
examination of network histories? How can we conceptualize the =
polychronic developments of networks, including their growth, =
adaptation, and resistances? How might the concept of network =
archaeology help to re-envision and forge new paths of interdisciplinary =
research, collaboration, and scholarship?

The conference will trace continuities and disjunctures between a =
variety of networks, including telecommunication networks, distribution =
systems for both digital and non-digital texts, transportation routes, =
media storage (libraries, databases, e-archiving), electrical grids, =
radio and television broadcast networks, the internet, and surveillance =
networks. We seek to address not only the technological, institutional, =
and geopolitical histories of networks, but also their cultural and =
experiential dimensions, extending to encompass the histories of network =
poetics and practice. The proceeds of the conference will form the basis =
for a substantial publication on Network Archaeology.

This conference is organized by the Miami University Humanities Center =
and is the final event in a year-long series entitled =93Networked =
Environments: Interrogating the Democratization of Media.=94 It is a =
companion to our Fall 2011 symposium, =93Networks and Power,=94 on =
November 17-18th featuring panels, interventions, and keynote =
presentations by Wendy Chun (Brown University) and Lisa Parks (UC Santa =
Barbara), that interrogate the interrelationships between networked =
environments, both old and new, and varied forms of power. The =
=93Networked Environments=94 series, involving an interdisciplinary =
group of ten humanities scholars, seeks to show how the network dynamics =
so crucial to contemporary political developments have deep and perhaps =
unexpected roots in the histories of earlier forms of information =
production and circulation.

We welcome presentations of academic research and artistic projects on =
contemporary and historical network studies. Please send abstracts of =
250 words and a short bio to cris cheek (cheekc@muohio.edu) and Nicole =
Starosielski (nicole.starosielski@muohio.edu) by November 29, 2011.

Keynote speakers include:

Lisa Gitelman, Associate Professor of Media and English at New York =
University, and author of Scripts, Grooves, and Writing Machines: =
Representing Technology in the Edison Era (2000), New Media, 1740-1915 =

Friends of the Fox:

To follow up on the hasty call for work in light of the current occupations:
http://www.whiskeyandfox.org/2011/10/parks-occupation-no-1.html

1. The first issue of Whiskey & Fox Vol. 5 Special Series, Parks &
Occupation is out. It can be picked up at the Free Zine Station at Zuccotti
Park in NY; OR you can download the PDF from http://whiskeyandfox.org.

Contributors include: Robin Clarke, David Hadbawnik, michael farrell, Jeff
T. Johnson, Sten Carlson, & Rebecca Mertz. This is set of really incredible
poems. As Spicer writes: "Reading the poem that does not appear when the
magician starts or when the magician finishes. A climbing in-between. Real."

2. The Parks & Occupation series will continue for at very least a couple
more tiny-format issues, and while we have some good material already, we
will consider more submissions.  So please, consider sending work in
accordance with the call for
work,<http://www.whiskeyandfox.org/2011/10/parks-occupation-call-for-work.html>to
parksandoccupation [at] whiskeyandfox [dot] org (please don't sent
back
to this address). We will make an announcement if we can no longer accept
any submissions. We hope to get another hasty tiny-format issue out next
weekend or early next week.

Make haste & Decorate the new democracy!

Dos Madres Press announces: The American Eye by Eric Hoffman
http://www.dosmadres.com/dos-madres-books/american-eye-by-eric-hoffman/


Included in this volume are two poems: the first, Emerson in Europe, a vers=
e
translation of the journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who, just prior to his
Harvard speech, lamenting the death of his wife and having given up the
cloth, tours Europe, meeting with Wordsworth, Coleridge and Carlyle. A
second poem, The Vast Practical Engine, a lyric collage of the philosophy o=
f
pragmatism, utilizes the cadences of Emerson=92s godson William James.
Together, these poems comprise a concise meditation on the immense
transformation in human thought contributed by these two radical thinkers.

Leo Brent Robillards most recent novel is entitled, Drift. Set in South
Africa during the Second Boer War, it raises questions about why and how
we come to fight wars in far flung places  be it in defense of ideals or
in quest for economic gain. These issues  all too relevant today -- are
handled intimately through the journey of two prairie boys, an Australian
nurse, and a South African balloonist, as they drift together in the
blast furnace of the Great Karoo. Robillard is also the author of Leaving
Wyoming and Houdinis Shadow. The former was listed in Bartleys Top Five
in the Globe & Mail for Best First Fiction of 2005. The latter was
eventually translated into Spanish. His work has appeared in numerous
magazines, journals and anthologies at home and abroad, including CV2,
The Fiddlehead, Grain, Prairie Fire, Queens Quarterly, and Verge. He
lives on Lake Eloida in south-eastern Ontario with his wife and two
children. www.leobrentrobillard.blogspot.com

Nicholas Lea published his first book Everything is movies (Chaudiere
Books, Ottawa) to acclaim in 2007. Reviews of his work have appeared in
the Ottawa Xpress, Matrix Magazine,Prairie Fire and The Globe & Mail
Online. He has served as a poetry reader for Bywords.ca as well as The
Fiddlehead. He lives in Ottawa where he is currently working on his
second collection of poetry. He launches a new chapbook with Andrew
Faulkner and Leigh Nash's The Emergency Response Unit.

Lillian Necakov has been writing and publishing for over 30 years. Her
work has appeared in publications in Canada, the United States, China and
Serbia. She is the author of Sickbed of Dogs, Wolsak and Wynn, 1989,
Polaroids, Coach House Books, 1997, Hat Trick, Exile Editions, 1998 and
The Bone Broker, Mansfield Press, 2007. She was the editor of the very
small press Surrealist Poets Gardening Assoc. for a bunch of years.
During the 80s she sold her books on the streets of Toronto and was one
of the subjects of the documentary film Street Writers, Lucky to be Here.
Lillian runs the Boneshaker Reading Series. She lives and works in
Toronto.

Those three read like a Kandinsky painting - especially the first one - and
I absolutely love it.

Thanks for this, Lisa.  Actually the speedily craggy lines of Chapman's
translation of the Iliad suggested the idea.  There is something
deliciously rough and improvisational about his couplets--as if he had
thrown himself from a rooftop and were looking for the next place to
land and somersault to another transition. Jess

THE TICKET THAT EXPLODED
by James Ilgenfritz, Artist-in-Residence, Issue Project Room
An Opera based on William Burroughs’ 1962 dystopian novel about identity
disintegration, oppression of humanity’s collective consciousness through
technological influence, and revolution through the subversion of those
very technologies. Featuring six talented vocalists, an ensemble of
fifteen instrumentalists, and live video projections, the opera is
organized using the same cut-up techniques and emphasis on language that
distinguishes Burroughs’ literary work.

Description:

In =E2=80=9CWoody Alliances Laundered=E2=80=9D Andy Brown and William Words=
worth collaborate on 16 reinterpretations and variations of the most popula=
r of English Romantic poems "I wandered lonely as a cloud". Among other que=
stions, these witty and insightful new poems ask what if Dorothy Wordsworth=
 were the original source of the poem; what if William vanished from the pi=
cture altogether; what does commerce and recession have to do with daffodil=
s; and why is the Reverend Spooner out walking in Grasmere, conversing with=
 rhyming Cockneys, Zen poet-monks, and archaeologists who have just uncover=
ed the Rosetta Stone for Wordsworth=E2=80=99s original poem?

literature and literary politics(the title is a very learn=C3=A9d reference to
Auden=E2=80=99s translation of the Eddas). The essays and columns have been
published in various places in the last five years =E2=80=93 about half of the bo=
ok
consists of material written for The Reykjav=C3=ADk Grapevine, Iceland's englis=
h
speaking magazine, the other half are lectures and longer pieces written fo=
r
various occasions, but all aimed at a foreign audience.

The book is currently available on the poEsia web:

BOOBY BE QUIET Eir=C3=ADkur =C3=96rn Nor=C3=B0dahl
=20
=E2=80=9CThese youthfully exuberant essays on translation, innovation, performanc=
e,
and audience are compelling, delightful, and often funny: illuminating as
Reykjavik white nights and sharp as the skate blade of a North American
racing champion. Eir=C3=ADkur =C3=96rn Nor=C3=B0dahl redefines the issue of poetry and
national language in a brilliant and transformative essay that is the
centerpiece of the collection. His impatience with the tried and true is
infectious. One of the most engaged and enthusiastic works of poetics in
recent years. =E2=80=9C

Charles Bernstein, author of All the Whiskey in Heaven (Farrar, Strauss &
Giroux, 2010), Attack of the Difficult Poems  (University of Chicago Press,
2011) amongst other books.


=E2=80=9CNor=C3=B0dahl's essays are brilliant vivisections of contemporary poetry and=
 its
problems, filtered through the prism of Iceland's 2008 economic collapse =E2=80=
=94 a
close cousin of our own so-called "economic downturn."   The kitschy,
nostalgia-driven "future economies" of both contemporary money culture and
poetry culture are closely linked here (and elsewhere):  " . . . the presen=
t
worships an outdated past, even at the cost of a living present."  As poets
we may be working toward a goal of "fame" in the twilight of imagination =E2=80=
=94
and, as citizens, working toward "affluence" in the twilight of capitalism =
=E2=80=94
but if we identify the importance of the living moment as "the only eternit=
y
that lasts, without pause," at least one of us may yet become that "he or
she who affects . . . the entire critical mass of moments we call eternity"
=E2=80=94  beyond the mirage-like glow of "fame."   Nor=C3=B0dahl's lively essays als=
o
introduce us to (perhaps) heretofore unexplored global poetries old and new
in the most entertaining way, and leave us pondering a few delightful
scenarios: "Imagine a poem so robust and resourceful that it could survive
humanity . . . the nuclear dust finally settles and all that's left of
mankind is poetry."  Considering how long poetry's been around, that's
probably what's going to happen anyway.  But in case you're wondering what =
a
poetry that robust might look like, there may be some presentiments of it
right here.=E2=80=9D=20

recording made with Westinghouse vibration mic fed into mono Marantz
cassette recorder; the result was downloaded into Audacity and edited
in CoolEdit. Different versions above have different filtering.

Analog was used to avoid digital issues between the mic and recorder.
The sound was gathered at a number of sites in Eyebeam, most of them
involving metal grids: stairways, interior fencing, upper-level
flooring. The result was a gathering of resonances between metal,
Eyebeam-body (interior space), and sounds transmitted either in air
or directly through metal. The harmonic structures are strong and
dissonant. The body cries out in murderous delight.

Down the street, an 18-wheeler is gathering up the disassembled
Matthew Barney work. Such heavy metal would have collapsed with a
thud. Elsewhere lighter-than-air work delights the blue-grey sky
and rain is forecast. The Eyebeam building is singing everywhere.
It is singing
