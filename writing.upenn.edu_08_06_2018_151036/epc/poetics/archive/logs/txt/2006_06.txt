Subject:      postmodernisit?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

A fascinating and surprising discussion, as these Poetics discussions,
when they get rolling, often are.  Who would have thought that
"postmodernism" was still a topic for debate?  As much as I like the
ecological turn that the talk has taken, I would like to contribute by
turning back to the more narrow aesthetic/literary question.

I am surprised that no one has yet mentioned Charles Altieri's very
helpful collection of essays "Postmodernisms Now: Essays on
Contemporaneity in the Arts" (Pennsylvania State UP, 1998).  Altieri's
criticism is too nuanced for me to summarize in toto just now, but I
wonder if two short quotations might be appropriate.

The first point is that postmodernism is, for Altieri, both alive and
dead.  On the one hand: "I think postmodernism is now dead as a
theoretical concept, and, more important, as a way of developing cultural
frameworks influencing how we shape theoretical concepts.  With its basic
enabling arguments now sloganized and its efforts to escape binaries
binarized, it is unlikely to generate much significant new work" (23).  On
the other hand: "Perhaps now that the theory has lost much of its power,
it may be possible to recognize how much it appropriated from the arts and
to focus on differences between the two orientations.  It may even be
possible to regain for the arts some of the cultural authority they at
least thought they possessed before 'theory' took over the role of shaping
how imaginations might cultivate alternatives to the ideologies dominating
'official culture'" (23).

The second excerpt concerns a critical tactic to which I am very
sympathetic--namely, reading the imaginative work and allowing it to
invoke the appropriate frame or context, rather than forcing works into
those frames.  (For those following the OlsonNow blog, this rhymes with
looking at the smallest part in order to see the whole.)

"Moreover, the effort to reconstruct the force of these particulars may
make it possible for others to share the pleasures and sense of
possibilities that my generation experienced when we defined ourselves
largely by our fealties to those artistic and critical efforts to
overthrow the hegemony of modernism in the arts." (5)

Of course, at 35 I am not of Altieri's generation, which I mention only
because someone somewhere below brought up generations (I think it was
when folks were discussing certain films, how the kids love them, but the
parents hate them).  Belonging to (or is it inclusion in?--I'm still
pondering this mathematical distinction sharpened for ordinary language by
Badiou in "Being and Event") an aggressively mark(et)ed generation may
make communication across certain gaps difficult, but I think that those
of us who "came of age" in the 80s (ugh) understand these "fealties" very
well.  The question I for one am asking myself--when not lamenting the
state of the biosphere--is what we still owe and to whom.

Anyway.  Altieri.  The particulars of the imaginative act.  Check your
frames at the door.

The psychological dilemma of the Black artist
By Harry Davidson, Ph.D.
-Guest Columnist-
Updated May 31, 2006, 10:38 am

* Spelman women continue to rap about hip hop (FCN, 11-10-2005)
http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_2256.shtml

Outrage over honoring "It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp" with an Academy
Award for Best Original Song has created a dilemma for another
generation of aspiring Black artists. Is the primary allegiance of
artists to their art form, or should they restrict themselves by the
ideals of Black social/political critics?

Just as Hattie McDaniel, Lincoln Perry (Step and Fetchit) and a host of
earlier artists were forced to perform within the racial, political and
social context of their times, today's generation of aspiring artists
create and perform based on their cultural and/or sub-cultural
experience, their unique realities. These young Black artists utilize
their own vernacular, the language they have created, to tell their
stories. We scoff when they tell us they have redefined the 'N' word.
Many of us were offended by the use of the term "Ebonics"; we said we
wanted our youth to speak "good English" so that they would get a job.
But Black youth not only created their own language, they then used that
language to create wealth.

While this generation of Black youth has generated the greatest presence
of Blacks in the media in history, we should rightfully be concerned
about the type of image that they projected. Are artists falsely
creating negative images or simply expressing the realities that exist
for a segment of Black America? We will not be able to change the images
the Black experience has created until we are able to change the
experiences that have influenced them.

Many Black youth have been severely traumatized by the absence of
parents, loss of friends as they face daily fears that they may become
victims of violence at home and at school. Their raps serve a cathartic
release. Their expressions are raw and thus may rub us the wrong way.
Powerless to change their conditions, too many of us further victimize
the victims in the name of our so-called racial pride. And, whose more
proud of who they are than those youth who openly express themselves
without concern about what White people think about them.

"Those other Blacks" offend many of us who find their actions and
behaviors embarrassing. Not only are we offended by their "obscene
behaviors," but also by their relatively trivial acts. We wouldn't dare
be seen in public with rollers in our hair. We would never use the "N"
word around Whites. We would like to suppress the psychological impact
of slavery on us and would prefer that "those other" Blacks become like
Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man."

They, in turn, declare that rap is here to stay--which means they are,
too. Ironically, despite access to better education, the Black upper and
middle-class do not appear to be either as creative or industrious as
Blacks in the "hood." If we want their stories to be told, then they
must tell them with the same zestful vigor that "those other" Blacks are
able to manifest.

The South African movie Tsotsi provides a comparable study of a young
man who bares the psychological, posttraumatic mental and emotional
generational scars of White supremacy, domination and oppression. Like
the Color Purple, the story leaves out the generational effects and
impacts of White supremacy racism and slavery. Despite the fact that
some Blacks are in denial, all of us are the products of a history of
oppression and White domination. It ain't just hard out here for pimps.

Hustle and Flow was about more than pimps and whores. The movie was
about a segment of Black people who exist even without our approval. It
was a love story, a Black prostitute who falls in love with her pimp and
a pimp who, in the end, recognizes his love for her, despite the fact
that she is carrying another man's child. Taraji P. Henson's character
loved her man. She stood by him and felt his pain. It was her character
that was able to emote: "You know it's hard out here for a pimp." It was
her lament, her ode. I was touched by Taraji P. Henson's character's
lyrical, rhythmic expression of both praise and sorrow.

Nevertheless, Hustle and Flow represented a small percentage of a wide
spectrum of Black life. And Black artists are not the only ones who face
ethical and moral dilemmas. Indeed, Black people demonstrate many
contradictions. Is it fair to demand more of Blacks in entertainment
than we do of Blacks in other fields of endeavor? Until we collectively
improve the reality of our condition, our racial psychopathology, we
must temper our judgment of the reality the artist depicts.

Certainly, I am not pleased with the media's impact on Black people,
however, I am equally concerned about how Blacks who have obtained
perceived positions of influence and power respond to the plight of our
people. Ironically, it is because of the exposure that Black athletes
and entertainers have achieved that they are the most vulnerable to our
criticism.

Hi everyone,

Just wanted to let you know that my book MAINSTREAM  -- poems written on an=
d to the Flarf Collective listserv from 2002-2005 -- is now out from BlazeV=
ox books.  You can buy it off the BlazeVox website here:

http://www.blazevox.org

or you can buy a version with a somewhat higher production quality (matte c=
over and nicer paper stock etc) from Small Press Distribution:

 http://www.spdbooks.org

The book includes the poem "Mainstream Poetry" which you can see me reading=
 live at the Flarf Festival here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DeuwlsZT53go&search=3Dflarf

as well as the controversial poem "Their Guys, Their Asian Glittering Guys,=
 Are Gay," which as been hotly debated for the last two weeks around the bl=
ogosphere.

Drew Gardner, author of "Chicks Dig War" says of the books, "Right from the=
 start, Magee=E2=80=99s work bristles with the spirit of improvisation. Eve=
rything about it pops: classic poetry chops, a serious sense of humor, unab=
ashed rawness. Mainstream is thrilling because it can turn in any direction=
 at any time, moving effortlessly from wacked units of thought turning insi=
de out to tender moments of highly focused nonsense and song that get, para=
doxically, straight to the point. The frames we bring to these poems can=E2=
=80=99t remain intact stanza to stanza -- and in this instability there are=
 great poetic pleasures and possibilities."

Anyway, hope this interests...

Several years ago the Danish film maker Niels Plenge made a short
poetry video with me called "The Answer." We've put it up as an mp4
file on PennSound. Plenge, along with Lars Movin, and Thomas Thurah,
made the 2003 documental about O'Hara, Schuyler, and Ashbery,
*Something Wonderful May Happen.*

*

There are four new Close Listening shows now available on PennSound.
These are shows I have been recording in New York for WPS1.Org --
they are streamed on WPS1 and archived at PennSound. Last month I did
two shows with Rae Armantrout -- a reading and a conversation. And
two shows with Thomas McEvilley -- on the first, McEvilley reads
classical Greek poetry -- Homer, Sapho, Aeschylus, and Meleajer; in
the companion show, McEvilley discusses his art criticism and his
scholarly work on ancient (axial-age) cross-cultural connectin
between India and Greece.

One thing that can be said for post modernism that cannot be said for
modernism, any more, is that post modernism has not yet been sucked up
into the great corporate vacuum cleaner.  Whereas modernism has been
propped up for decades by gross corporate funding of the most disgusting
kind [Philip-Morris, Exxon, Enron, etc.], how much of this filthy money
has gone to what we would call post modern venues?

Early modernism was once revolutionary.  Now look at it.

I don't doubt that what has happened to the early modernists will also
happen to the rest of us.  It is all a matter of time and the rare
ability and willingness to resist it -- always feeble.  One measure of
post modernism is that it is still resistent to being co-opted.

Well, if it loses that, then I'll dump this au courant -ism for
something else. It's not the name that matters.  It's the resistence to
the inevitable.

aah boo hoo -- it was close to sounding like her split and near death
and him close to cumming that night in his camper.  It echoed in an
audio caught in the front cab -- jetted out to  bounce off the ashvault,
  along side the kid’s clogged wind pipes, with shure 55 mics clutched
by rockabillies in loose fit wranglers and polished creepers who were
not too shy a  a kin to devland with his tats refined along his arms and
body like an oil based dutch masterpiece which almost shimmied in the
starlight.  he was walking in a  slow 4/4 box step outside the camper,
in the parking lot,  polydirecting the fumes from his marly’s, when the
the ladies popped open the back doors and called him in to see them wrap
  the bundle in clothe and hand him to his sheba, what was only’s mom
now,  and scowled at only’s daddy who was just a boyfriend up until then.


...he had to give up a days fucking mission up island for this and had
to hand it to this woggy crew too. he just said boo to the blues of it
all like a fools grip and smashed  the day in its toad like flabby kisser

...


So the music rang to the poetics of war and the promise of the good life
sang to tell the tale of what was held in the tattooed arms of men who
would be boys -- the little girls who cried like babies as they got dug
out and spewed or kissed them under bridges and would pass like a swoon.
  only’s daddy and his sheba took refuge in a broken house come near
queen st in this place called new palestine. devland drove his camper
while only grewup and raised a backyard full of dogs for 3 letter men
and jews who were taking over hoods and buildng condos to dodge the
niggers and chugs,  and what more than that,  he had one pitpull
hotpepper fed and closeted trained for his cousin, shamus, what come to
love the attraction of dark skin and the violence of decadence that it
promised.

...

Only’s other time was spent in helping raise the dogs for his daddy with
his mom.  otherwise, he was running with his bro fear and other works
and thinking on the deserts of the sahara and reading viruses set to
colour on foo scap while emptying himself into that split.  It took
plently completely. his study.  The first evening.  Sinking in her was
like the opening of a vowel. his jane’s name was susan.  Only’s head was
filled with many schemes and things -- she was more on than in it when
time came to replace the illuminational target of his fist firing hits
off in the highlands.

...

She saw devland get out of that camper.  only’s daddy had drove up in
his vanagon to pick up another switch puppy for a couple of queens in
james bay.  He went past the kids who kidnapped dogs as companions then
played in the sun in the streets and begged the neighbours for broken
walkmens.  she still liked when he came by sometimes. he walked like a
french kiss sent across a café house. she still could know him from
blocks away on foot -- he still stroled to a psychedelic bop when  he
came toward the place she stood and what held the dogs in the backyard
beyond her.  she had become a pairshaped lady with  most of love dropped
out of her.  those legs could barely hold her anymore. life had become a
major iron deficiency caused by a brutal period with no sense of
nutritional suppilments -- you could tell by her wired barely kept hair
and that the eyes weren’t yet flat but more centered on a tear caught in
a draught. he still fucked her once in awhile. she thought their life
was sworn to have been like a religion. she was always afraid that she’d
become one of those spandex ladies she seen shopping or sipping cider in
navy pubs as a young girl.
	-how they doing-
-good, one looks like she’s pregnant.  should know for certain in about
a couple of weeks or so. I could take her to the vets but I know how
much you hate…
	-about 2 week? swell-
but with a rocking daddy like devland,  she figured, who breathed  a
conformation ceremony of psychedelic blues, she surely figured and would
have bet her life,  a swell cool even when he leaned back waiting for
the streetlight to change,  she could have sworn she’d be betty page
forever.

only came passed his mother from out the house with a pooch under each
arm. devland took them off him and eyed him that he should follow him to
the camper and they left her as she turned and contained a controlled
waddle back into the house.

the dude next door, he saw the transaction btwn only and his daddy and
he whispered to the darkie over a fug saying;
‘…that kid is bad…’

the house down the block on bay…

‘…I saw him hit his mom…’

the house down the block on bay held only’s lil cousin who was buck
nekked in a bed, at this time, his minibike lowlow crashed on the floor,
with  this 13yr old paki chick he went to school with laying next to
him.  he loved her for the moment of spurting without knuckling off.
she had gained him into it swell and he held  her like containing a
disaster. Her parents where at work and his was done for now.  Something
in the cereal for the girls these days – their racks were so much bigger
than the girls who covered  the wax of blindfaith. Only’s cousin had a
7.7 dick - real cool and thick- the size of what  people once said
nigger’s had fucked with  - and he was becoming so popular that some
haters was calling him ginger. He shared one thing with that family from
straight up to metaphorically– he kept the rhythm and beat up many a
galamity into submission and that was plane to see. The paki girl was
wrapped around him with her hand cupping his resting dick and balls.
brought into experience she lay there ; wanting more of his jetliner and
to make him her habit -- figuring she keep longer—add some respectablity
in her life; bagging a jet black haired cousin of a brown headed aryan
who swaggered the blocks in a red jersey and oversized ballcourt shorts
-- the true son of a desolate rockabilly, in a hood dedicaded to the
beast of blues – they cuddle over  what  was butta and chatted  over
pillows about what they don’t like
what they do
they don’t like abortion
murders of kin
they don’t like some of her friends – they kind of jelly of him.
--- he likes her head
the way she stares cross eyed
and toads over his lollipop and that baby she can ride
she likes the skin and the tone of his voice
	 he like her d cups - there’s no confusing her for boys
and that she ain’t flat and them babies bounce back pretty
don’t make him brail for the likes of that tittie
he humps his flow into her caramel limo
he’s got endless gooey for her diddy
1.2.3.4.
it was stat. not made for fluffers or beat down whores.  He grabbed a
handle and road her fat city. shaytan in a western  -- pride, hypocrisy,
sloth, gowness, envy,  love excessive, lust, depravity,  disobedience --
shaytan in a western.  Sonic stolen after a bloody fucking and wetness.
  Internal qibla level stanzas of misdirection. It was not for the
weakened  or 21 navyboys  in fudge bars too scared to kill an arab for a
canadian – government-  who would talk about it while absorbed in coke
dreamings of 3ppcli mercenaries shooting pakis and banging somali teens
with angel lust. It was just the plane truth at stake here.  Like those
who shoot loads like salt like tears.  Deep skinny dipping in the water
  hitting bottom resembling a black and blue explosion becomes a bigger
splash.
His cousin stroked her skin like he was painting it for art class.  She
wiggled as he hardened in her hands.  He turned to press her down into
the mattress and he saw his bike, a torn up manga comic book on the
floor and fantasics and men resembling the intials of radical black men
ready to die for lost causes and the ill perfecfion of islam. And he
blew away satan and slipped gently creeking into a rhythm.

Let me step into the stanza and recite you letters in notes you will
never figure

Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
William Shakespeare (King John)

        Faulconbridge:

	Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
        John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
        Hath willingly departed with a part,
        And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
        Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
        As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
        With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
        That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
        That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
        Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
        Who, having no external thing to lose
        But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,
        That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
        Commodity, the bias of the world,
        The world, who of itself is peised well,
        Made to run even upon even ground,
        Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
        This sway of motion, this Commodity,
        Makes it take head from all indifferency,
        From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
        And this same bias, this Commodity,
        This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
        Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
        Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
        From a resolved and honourable war,
        To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
        And why rail I on this Commodity?
        But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
        Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
        When his fair angels would salute my palm;
        But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
        Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
        Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
        And say there is no sin but to be rich;
        And being rich, my virtue then shall be
        To say there is no vice but beggary.
        Since kings break faith upon commodity,
        Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.

Lucid and annulled      It's the same problem you've always had: no-one wants to go far enough. Out past the good neighborhoods lies the area of the city in which suburban boys vanquish their fears of mediocrity; everyone's "from the street" these days, even if the paint on ragged houses peels across the boards, rendering him unusable...

Day Trip:  A Monumental Vision of Half a Lifetime
By DAVID WALLIS
Opus 40, a magnificent maze of platforms, pools, ramps, terraces and
bridges in a bluestone quarry near Woodstock, N.Y., not only
constitutes a work of art, it also stands as a monument to discipline
and hard work.

Dear friends and poets,

  Please consider submitting your work.  We welcome original poetry and poetry in translation.

  To Topos, a journal of international poetry, invites submissions for its tenth volume on the subject of poetry and poverty guest edited by Dr. Karen Holmberg.  Welcoming work from individuals of all cultures, regions, nations, and groups, we call upon poets to replace the abstract with the tangible, to give substance to the voices and faces of those on whom our corporate economy depends and who are often relegated to a state of silence.   We hope to collect a body of work that renders the truth of this most comprehensive form of oppression.  The issue will include a preface by Michael Parenti.  Submissions may be in any language if accompanied by English translation, and must be received by October 1, 2006.
  To submit, click on http://oregonstate.edu/dept/foreign_lang/totopos/index.html

  Karen Holmberg’s first book, The Perseids, won the Vassar Miller Prize in 2001, and her work has appeared in such magazines as The Paris Review, The Nation, Slate, Quarterly West and Southern Poetry Review.  She lives in Corvallis, OR, where she teaches in the MFA program at Oregon State University.

    Michael Parenti is an award winning author and activist who has published numerous books, including Superpatriotism (2004), and The Assassination of Julius Caesar (2003) which won the “Book of the Year Award” (nonfiction) from Online Review of Books. His most recent work is The Culture Struggle  (2006). For further information, visit his website:  www.michaelparenti.org.



  About To Topos
  To Topos is an international poetry journal that features poetry in translation, oftentimes the original appears together with its English translation. The following is excerpted from our Poet's Market entry:

"To Topos is committed to fostering human rights on an environmentally fragile planet. Its focus is altermondialist, recognizing that the causes of poverty and injustice are often related to race, gender, nationality, and the effacement of earth-given resources. Most issues are thematically focused.

  "Previous themes include Incarceration, Peace and the Sea, Forests, and North African Voices.  Winona LaDuke (White Earth Land Recovery Project) and Dr. William F. Schulz (Amnesty International) have prefaced recent issues. The journal is open to both aspiring and recognized poets. The journal particularly invites submissions from refugees and the borderless. The journal is primarily interested in living poets who believe words carry the gift of positive social change.

"The mission of this journal is to reveal the human face of poetry as a statement of urgency in today's world. The journal is open to all aesthetic and stylistic orientations, but submissions should be a seed for social change along humanist principles without indulging in political or nationalist rhetoric."

Just released, an issue dedicated to Contemporary Hungarian Poetry, guest edited by Eniko Bollobas of Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest. A copy of which is being presented to the Hungarian Prime Minister.

  To purchase copies of this Hungarian issue, or other back issues:
  http://oregonstate.edu/dept/foreign_lang/totopos/index.html

  For our next issue, we are in the process of reading the nearly 400 submissions for our Indigenous Americas: Poetry by Indigenous Peoples of the Western Hemisphere issue, guest edited by Allison Hedge Coke, Northern Michigan University. In May, Ms. Hedge Coke addressed the United Nations regarding the effect of publication impact on Indigenous Human Rights.

  Future themes include Contemporary Turkish Poetry and Contemporary Belgian Poetry.

Our 2004 issue on Forests features an introduction by Winona LaDuke and was given a favorable review in the prominent French poetry journal, Friches. The 2005 issue on North African Voices was featured on www.babelmed.net.

We just received an Oregon Literary Arts Fellowship for Publishers grant earlier this year. Our pages include works by the likes of academics, asylum inmates, Nobel and Pulitzer candidates, scholars, and farmers.

As today (6/3/06) would've been Allen Ginsberg's 80th B-Day, I'm deciding to bury the hatchet once & for all and, in a display of egalitarian elan, am publishing an unabashedly "Beat" Ginsberg pastiche (of "Pull My Daisy") on Stoning the Devil (www.adamfieled.blogspot.com). It's today's post....check it out!!

Greenlaw Ave





http://www.greenlawave.com/mp3/cbcradio1bigcitysmallworld.mp3


Combining urban soul with a touch of jazz, for a smooth, organic sound.


Front woman Skyla J's, contagious vocal style, dreamy flute playing and
honest lyrics has been compared to an "early Jill Scott meets India
Irie" by UK's Fmagazine.




Skyla J has been writing and performing for over ten years. In 2002
Skyla's track "Next Une" was released as a single on DJ Teknosteps
album "Music For Short Attention Spans". This tune now has five
International remixes including an issue by Chicago Producer, Roy Davis
Jr. The beauty that comes from her lyrics and voice is a reflection of
her dedicated spiritual lifestyle soulful uplift.




Michael Anthony Osbourne (aka Mc Ozzie) has been on the music scene
for over fifteen years as a ground breaking Jamaican poet and musician.
His original behind-the-beat-bass instrumentation and edgy lyrics add
even more weight to an already heavy vibe. These two talented musicians
have been working together for over eight years and provide the
backbone of Greenlaw Ave.




After a whirlwind cross-Canada tour in Spring / Summer 2003,
Greenlaw Ave dropped down in Victoria, B.C. where in only six months
they took the city by storm. At B.C's, Monday Mag Awards, Greenlaw Ave
won "Most Memorable Show of 2003" and were the most nominated artists.
They played a sold out farewell performance featuring Universal artist
Kia Kadiri before heading off to take on the UK.




Within weeks of arriving in the UK, they were embraced by four
major music collectives in London: Ghetto Lounge, Soul Baby, SEB and
Raison D'etre. Quoted as "hotly tipped" by Chiswick Times, Greenlaw Ave
was regularly featured as a not to be missed headlining act at London's
top venues: Cargo, Spitz, Ten Rooms, Blue Jay Jazz Lounge, amongst
others.




Since May 2003, Greenlaw has played over 350 solid performances in
Canada and the UK. With two successful indie tours on their resume, and
a loving, growing International fan base, Formation Records, Britain's
longest running Indie Label, took notice of Greenlaw Ave and signed

That is simply not true.

I don't think so.

I agree. It seems to me one of the most relevant paradigmatic shifts taking place within the idea of post-modernism has less to do with ability and more to do with means. The prevalent self-consciousness of  modernism has adorned our psychology, science, ( particularly popular) etc. , or should I say rendered our ' understanding' of such,  with binary tensions stemming, perhaps, from the very impulse of introspection right on through nationalism and empirical science. It is the means by which we have devised our appendages( tools)  of  'understanding' , that perhaps might be noteworthy as one aspect of what it might mean to be post-modern. One need not look much further than the development of the medical gaze over the last century, contemporary medical imaging, facial coding systems or surveillance technology, to recognize that it has been in great part due to the innate characteristics of instrumentation itself ( editing, myth, etc..) that has modeled what can be
 considered our post-modern visual culture. The barriers between the object,subject and their instrumentation are becoming quickly blurred. Instrumentation is being implanted and vice -verse. This, of course, to wonderful, life saving and progressive ends as well as to horrific and deadly ends.

Quote from dear friend who is a writer of essays and
poems, former publisher of Democratic Tibet, Tibetan
Youth Congress contributor, poet and historian who
made the LONG MARCH to Nepal, India (and not for
holiday--and not unlike so many Tibetans, but very
much unlike MAO), "The measure of violence is to act
secondly, a concessionary forgiveness, the first." He
is a proud man, even when he stands shoeless, as he
has done at odd times and for many years, or bends
over because of rectal disease (years of cold and wet
floors), or looks unsure as he asks a friend (newcomer
or Tibetan whose relative managed to escape to the US
or Swizterland and WEStern unioned some funds, as they
say) for money.

I am reminded of an American friend, who pointedly
told me just how the Tibetans he witnessed selling
their wares seemed, well, happy existing under
conditions again and again described with terms like
occupation, genocide and plain-spoken bad. I held my
breath upon his regurgitation, thinking for a moment
of James Baldwin's Blues for Mr. Charlie. Too, I was
reminded of the first 'concentration camps'--work
camps, ghettos--visited by the Red Cross during
Hitler's reign (and I am specifically thinking of
Terezin, Czech Republic). It was observed, and this is
a matter of recorded history, that the children seemed
well adapted to the conditions they were subjected to,
and that this arrangement seemed acceptable. Of
course, the Jewish children had been given candy and
restrictions had been made more flexible with the
expectations of the Red Cross' arrival. Oh, and what a
swell time it must have been!As an American, I am also
reminded of how black folk were depicted as jolly
during slave days through Jim Crowe -- and how some of
the most vital and soulful culture was ever produced
in the face of abysmal odds and with the assistance of
the same kind of folks. Too, I am amazed how adept
middle class folks parading as anti-globalization
hippies can be when it comes to ambivalence and
bargain shopping.

He doesn't have citizenship anywhere in the world. He
can't leave this 'refugee camp,' but the police
harrass him by 9 pm (if he's foolish enough to venture
out at this hour). If caught, because he has no
official status, he will be returned to China--and be
greeted less than cheerfully for his heroic departure
from "If you going showing pictures of Chairman Mao"
PR China more than nine years ago and for his
dissident views. It should be pointed out that
Tibetans like D. are loosely permitted in India under
the pretense of being relatives of HH. The Indian
government, however, does not officially welcome or
encourage the arrival of Tibetan refugees--in fact,
their is much animosity (and, of course, land is also
part of the equation). To continue, his friend K.,
also a writer, admires Allan Ginsberg and says many
Tibetans love Whitman and American free verse. Another
friend, W., and he is lucky (because his older
brother, who crossed into Nepal caring for his three
siblings was able to make his way to France), shows me
three burns on his arm, the size of quarters each--and
they were made before it was learned just how shameful
"I love Tibet" was. The place seems to be filled with
Israeli's, which is interesting and ironic, perhaps.
In state of being a refugee, where days simply
go--somewhere--and God continues to live in the sky,
we all sip this freedom and pretend we like it!

Sorry Warren, Adam, but these two statements confuse me.

Adam, you say: "There is a greater understanding of psychology and =
physics that allows all things to be looked at more critically and =
sharply."  And, you precede that with "The change, I believe, is the =
relationship between man and his own mind."    All of which I take to =
mean the change from modernism to postmodernist derives from the point =
that postmodern folks have a greater understanding of their anxieties, =
phobias, quirks, and general idiosyncratic behaviors than their =
predecessors, the moderns=20

Such a statement seems to dismiss the relevance of actuality, the =
conditions of the real world surrounding the comprehension of that =
"...relationship between man and his own mind."  In short, the statement =
seems to me to teeter on the brink of idealist thought. =20

Now, please don't misunderstand nor misinterpret my point here as =
critical of you or your thinking...hell, you may be 100% accurate.  I am =
after all the one seeking to understand the distinction and looking for =
an answer to the question: "What constitutes a postmodernist?"  And I =
think it is critical here to point out I'm not looking for an answer to =
the question "who are the postmodernists?"  That question comes only =
with a host of names as its answer.  I want the underlying explanation =
for "why" these they are so labeled.

And, Warren, it appears to me that you "agree" with exactly the opposite =
of what it is that Adam defines as the essence of the post modern.  I =
frankly can't reconcile the statement, "The prevalent self-consciousness =
of modernism has adorned our psychology, science..."  with the above =
statement by Adam. =20

Again, both of you, I'm not intending to argue or demean.  I merely am =
seeking answers, and these two comments seem to contradict each other at =
the same time they claim agreement. =20

Also, from what I've been reading this past week (off the list) I'm =
beginning to get the sense that distinction between the modernists and =
the postmodernists is more a sense of a "desire" for a different label =
than a genuine performance difference...the children just wanted to have =
a name change.  But my reading is far too limited at this point to allow =
me to make that or any other conclusion. =20

Meanwhile, know this, all the comments are helpful, even those that are =
difficult, or impossible to reconcile.=20
Thanks,
Alex=20

But if I understand what postmodernists want to do clearly, as I may
not, the goal of postmodernism is precisely the opposite: to AVOID
looking at anything critically and sharply. Instead, postmodernism
seems to be about regressing to a primitive, archaic, primordial, and
NON-rational state. Even in discussions of the issue haven't we seen
at least one of the defenders of post-modernism on this list resort
to school-yard name-calling instead of engaging in any way critically
or sharply with the issues at hand.

But this is just what the postmodernists deny! They want to revert to
primitivist, non-rational, primordial barbarism, not new cures and
new ideas.

Postmodernism's denial of rationality appreciates antiquity?

Well, then, it's not a paradigmatic shift between ability and means,
is it? Not that there seems to be much to choose, in fact, between
"ability" and "means", after all. What is ability but means? What is
means but ability?

It's just this kind of confusion that seems so typical of the
discourse of the advocates and defenders of postmodernism. After
looking closely at what is said, it turns out that nothing much is
actually said -- and what is said seems recursive or to be just plain
nonsense. The problem Mr Lloyd seems to be trying to identify is the
same old problem of the relationship between means and ENDS, not
between "ability and ... means". This is not, of course, a new
problem -- and confusing and conflating ends with means doesn't make
it new. Perhaps, though, confusing and conflating ends and means is
what is most postmodern about this sort of analysis? Do you do it on
purpose? Is that what postmodernism is, after all: making the same
old mistakes over again? Watch out, ladies: in the bad old days they
stoned and burned uppity women. What rough beast, its hour come round
again, slouches towards us?

Advice to Young Ladies
AD Hope

A.U.C. 334: about this date,
For a sexual misdemeanor which she denied,
The vestal virgin Postumia was tried;
Livy records it among affairs of state.

They let her off: it seems she was perfectly pure;
The charge arose because some thought her talk
Too witty for a young girl, her eyes, her walk
Too lively, her clothes too smart to be demure.

The Pontifex Maximus, summing up the case,
Warned her in future to abstain from jokes,
To wear less modish and more pious frocks.
She left the court reprieved, but in disgrace.

What then?  With her the annalist is less
Concerned than what the men achieved that year:
Plots, quarrels, crimes, with oratory to spare --
I see Postumia with her dowdy dress,

Stiff mouth and listless step; I see her strive
To give dull answers.  She had to knuckle down.
A vestal virgin who scandalized that town
Had fair trial, then they buried her alive.

Alive, bricked up in suffocating dark;
A ration of bread, a pitcher if she was dry,
Preserved the body they did not wish to die
Until her mind was quenched to the last spark.

How many the black maw has swallowed in its time!
Spirited girls who would not know their place,
Talented girls who found that the disgrace
Of being a woman made genius a crime.

How many others, who would not kiss the rod,
Domestic bullying broke or public shame?
Pagan or Christian, it was much the same:
Husbands, St. Paul declared, rank next to God.

Livy and Paul, it may be, never knew
That Rome was doomed; each spoke of her with pride.
Tacitus, writing after both had died,
Showed that whole fabric rotten, through and through.

Historians spend their lives and lavish ink
Explaining how great commonwealths collapse
From great defects of policy -- perhaps
The cause is sometimes simpler than they think.

It may not seem so grave an act to break
Postumia's spirit as Galileo's, to gag
Hypatia as crush Socrates, or drag
Joan as Giordano Bruno to the stake.

Can we be sure?  Have more states perished, then,
For having shackled the enquiring mind,
Than those who, in their folly not less blind,
Trusted the servile womb to breed free men?

Subject:      another post(modernist)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Alex, On the matter of reconciliation, I wonder if you aren't encountering
certain paradoxes and antinomies which are, to my mind, not to be
resolved.  That is, I think of contradictions as driving thought or
paradoxes as the seeds of thinking, but I don't expect them to disappear.
(Is that a postmodern position, or one from antiquity?)

I realize, too, that you didn't ask for more names, but as it happens I've
been reading David Antin of late and for what it's worth I would point to
a couple of pieces.  The first was a presentation given at the MLA ("the
notion of appearing here seemed to me a little like the invitation of a
pheasant to a banquet" he says!) called, simply, "Is There a
Postmodernism?"  I know it from the "Bucknell Review" 25.2 (theme:
Romanticism, Modernism, Postmodernism), but perhaps someone else knows if
it's been collected or re-printed elsewhere.  The Spring 2001 issue of
"The Review of Contemporary Fiction" is devoted to Antin and is also
useful, especially the excerpt from Charles Bernstein's e-mail interview
with Antin, which I guess has also been published in full as a book.)

Two points from the short MLA essay: 1) The opening or closing, life or
death, of metadiscourse(s), be they modernist or postmodernist, is often
personal rather than epochal, i.e., for Antin modernism began in 1948
because that is when he encountered Eliot, Pound, and Stein.  I think we
can infer from this that we live in or in-between multiple chronotopes,
and this may be why the figures of "ghosts" or "hauntology" are so
powerful.  2) Antin concludes on this note: "I would like to suggest that
one of the fundamental postmodern acts is the opening up once again of the
question of where the domain of the arts should be, how they abut on the
social and even natural sciences, as the social sciences are beginning to
debate how much of their activity is science and how much art" (135).
[This, I think, is congruent with Altieri.]  A quarter of a century later,
I think it's safe to say that the question is still open in some
environments, taboo in others.  Not everyone welcomes inter- or
trans-disciplinarity, and I certainly do not see a widespread re-thinking
of curricula.  And yet I think Antin gets to the root of the issue when he
says that "Just as there is no special isolated faculty of reason, there
is no special faculty of feeling or emotion."

Here there is, for me, no getting around theories of embodied cognition
and metaphor (perhaps this is what others mean when they talk about a new
relationship between humans and minds).  I take Lakoff and Johnson's
claims in "Philosophy in the Flesh" very seriously; reason is not a
separate "faculty"--it piggybacks, if you like, on a neural architecture
evolved for motor coordination, etc.  This is not a matter of "regressing"
to a primitive or archaic or irrational site for thinking, but
acknowledging that, as Lakoff and Johnson put it, "The locus of reason
(conceptual inference) would be the same as the locus of perception and
motor control, which are bodily functions" (20).

None of this is to say that periodization is impossible, but then we would
be talking about postmodernITY, and as I recall someone has already
recommended David Harvey's indispensable book.  There are a lot of primers
out there, but Omar Calabrese's "Neo-Baroque" (Princeton UP, 1992) is one
of my favorite introductions to method in the arts and sciences, even
if--maybe because--the examples through which he arrives at his titular
characterization of the era (is it still ours?) come from the Eighties.

Sorry for all the names, Alex.  I'm not trying to be pedantic.  But
metadiscourses are today so bound up with signatures.  Perhaps
conversations would be easier if their insights found their way into a
shared vernacular.

Kevin

"The paintings of Gerardo Yepiz are a lively mix of Basquiat's Neo-Expressionist primitivism & intense visceral energy, the cool irony of Warhol & Lichtenstein's Pop works, & the painterly textures & vigorous brushwork of original AE masters de Kooning & Kline. Abstract but passionate, these paintings create dense, layered atmospheres w/ bold color-fields & harmonies & equally bold formal configurations. Repeated images signify "hooks", parts of the paintings that leap to our attention & stay there, while cool or warm color patterns determine the ambience of each particular work. The overall impression left by these paintings is of a rich, multi-leveled world in which the last fifty years of American painting are synthesized."

  Check out three prints of Yepiz's best work on PFS Post (www.artrecess.blogspot.com).

  Also, the next Neo-Formalist thesis is up on Stoning the Devil (www.adamfieled.blogspot.com).

I suspect it=B9s a real good idea to jam Frist, Bush & Co. as quickly as
possible on this latest homophobic gas bomb =AD i.e., the amendment to make
gay marriage illegal.

Dear Stephen, Each week, Senator Frist and the Republican Leadership make
choices about the Senate agenda. They could focus our work on record high
gas prices, the war in Iraq, or skyrocketing health care costs. But there's
an ugly truth: it's election season and down-in-the-polls Republicans are
turning to their same old playbook - fear and division. Later this week,
Bill Frist, in an attempt to appease extreme right wing elements of the
Republican Party, has promised that the Senate will vote on the Federal
Marriage Amendment and attempt to write discrimination into the Constitutio=
n
for the first time in 230 years. Join me in telling Senator Frist, "The
Senate should be working on real issues - not writing discrimination into
the Constitution" by visiting the DSCC's website:
http://www.dscc.org/realissues/act
<http://activist.acthere.com/page/m/zp6dvpuzbcj/XHUczK> This divisive and
unnecessary amendment that would undermine the Constitution has
overwhelmingly failed each time the Senate has voted on it. We don't need
another Terri Schiavo moment where we spend valuable time away from the
important work that needs to be done. Now, more than ever, it's time to
focus on security, solutions for the high cost of healthcare and gas prices=
.
But you know Bill Frist and the Republican Leadership can't be trusted to
address real issues.  After all, Senate Republicans and their big oil
friends have forced more than ten votes to drill for oil in ANWR, but not a
single vote to lower gas prices.  They spent months trying to privatize
Social Security, but Bill Frist can't find room in the schedule to raise th=
e
minimum wage or provide funding for Stem Cell research.  We need a Presiden=
t
and a Congress that doesn't play divisive politics. At a time of war,
Republicans should unite the country and focus on the real issues, not
divide and undermine its founding principles.

Hello Alex,
  My 'agreement' was an effort to stabilize, said  "teetering" in a polite attempt to suggest  the very "relevance of  actuality" that you mention in your response. I don't know of a more influential factor in  " the real world surrounding our comprehensions of...." than vision and visual culture. As I said, I wasn't going to discuss ability, but instead, means. Discussing man's ability's at all( in the sense that it was used  in the original statement),in itself, seems a little " idealistic", so 'means' seemed to be the best way to open up discussion in a humble  way. Opening up a friendly conversation was all I was after.I guess I can see how you reached irreconcilability with my statement, in fact, I think the clarification has helped everyone involved....
  Also I wasn't aware of the original question you posted. I was responding to a response. I have watched this conversation for a while and have been unaware of the original question: "What constitutes a postmodernist?". I'll have to chew on that for a while..... I think you are correct to assume as your, recent reading has led you to believe, that "desire"  for difference was certainly at the root of most post-modern art,  ( completely asside from post modernity) as it has been for all art , the labeling part, is usually up to someone else ( other modernists, French guysetc..) . Kids are given names; they don't choose them. Perhaps they declare nicknames, but those can only be documented by the authorities. Kids grow, they change, they get labeled. Thanks for the post.

  Sorry Warren, Adam, but these two statements confuse me.

Adam, you say: "There is a greater understanding of psychology and physics that allows all things to be looked at more critically and sharply." And, you precede that with "The change, I believe, is the relationship between man and his own mind." All of which I take to mean the change from modernism to postmodernist derives from the point that postmodern folks have a greater understanding of their anxieties, phobias, quirks, and general idiosyncratic behaviors than their predecessors, the moderns

Such a statement seems to dismiss the relevance of actuality, the conditions of the real world surrounding the comprehension of that "...relationship between man and his own mind." In short, the statement seems to me to teeter on the brink of idealist thought.

Now, please don't misunderstand nor misinterpret my point here as critical of you or your thinking...hell, you may be 100% accurate. I am after all the one seeking to understand the distinction and looking for an answer to the question: "What constitutes a postmodernist?" And I think it is critical here to point out I'm not looking for an answer to the question "who are the postmodernists?" That question comes only with a host of names as its answer. I want the underlying explanation for "why" these they are so labeled.

And, Warren, it appears to me that you "agree" with exactly the opposite of what it is that Adam defines as the essence of the post modern. I frankly can't reconcile the statement, "The prevalent self-consciousness of modernism has adorned our psychology, science..." with the above statement by Adam.

Again, both of you, I'm not intending to argue or demean. I merely am seeking answers, and these two comments seem to contradict each other at the same time they claim agreement.

Also, from what I've been reading this past week (off the list) I'm beginning to get the sense that distinction between the modernists and the postmodernists is more a sense of a "desire" for a different label than a genuine performance difference...the children just wanted to have a name change. But my reading is far too limited at this point to allow me to make that or any other conclusion.

Meanwhile, know this, all the comments are helpful, even those that are difficult, or impossible to reconcile.
Thanks,
Alex

I agree. It seems to me one of the most relevant paradigmatic shifts taking place within the idea of post-modernism has less to do with ability and more to do with means. The prevalent self-consciousness of modernism has adorned our psychology, science, ( particularly popular) etc. , or should I say rendered our ' understanding' of such, with binary tensions stemming, perhaps, from the very impulse of introspection right on through nationalism and empirical science. It is the means by which we have devised our appendages( tools) of 'understanding' , that perhaps might be noteworthy as one aspect of what it might mean to be post-modern. One need not look much further than the development of the medical gaze over the last century, contemporary medical imaging, facial coding systems or surveillance technology, to recognize that it has been in great part due to the innate characteristics of instrumentation itself ( editing, myth, etc..) that has modeled what can be
considered our post-modern visual culture. The barriers between the object,subject and their instrumentation are becoming quickly blurred. Instrumentation is being implanted and vice -verse. This, of course, to wonderful, life saving and progressive ends as well as to horrific and deadly ends.

Mr. Bales,
  It seems you have grossly misunderstood my statement to Adam. When I discussed a paradigmatic shift having to do with 'means' over 'ability', I was distilling his statement into two devices one of which I thought was worth discussing; that of 'means' , the means I refered to were the means in his statement  ie.  " the relationship between man and his own Mind". he uses,I think, psychology and physics or something... the point was to discuss the 'real' tools of the statement not vapor or ability, and I was certainly not trying to suggest some over sweeping generalization about the inversion of means and ends or ability or anything else. I was trying to, politely evoke conversation about 'real' things. I am new to this list, and it seems, one must really be diligent with the way one casually says something.

But if I understand what postmodernists want to do clearly, as I may
not, the goal of postmodernism is precisely the opposite: to AVOID
looking at anything critically and sharply. Instead, postmodernism
seems to be about regressing to a primitive, archaic, primordial, and
NON-rational state. Even in discussions of the issue haven't we seen
at least one of the defenders of post-modernism on this list resort
to school-yard name-calling instead of engaging in any way critically
or sharply with the issues at hand.

But this is just what the postmodernists deny! They want to revert to
primitivist, non-rational, primordial barbarism, not new cures and
new ideas.

Postmodernism's denial of rationality appreciates antiquity?

Well, then, it's not a paradigmatic shift between ability and means,
is it? Not that there seems to be much to choose, in fact, between
"ability" and "means", after all. What is ability but means? What is
means but ability?

It's just this kind of confusion that seems so typical of the
discourse of the advocates and defenders of postmodernism. After
looking closely at what is said, it turns out that nothing much is
actually said -- and what is said seems recursive or to be just plain
nonsense. The problem Mr Lloyd seems to be trying to identify is the
same old problem of the relationship between means and ENDS, not
between "ability and ... means". This is not, of course, a new
problem -- and confusing and conflating ends with means doesn't make
it new. Perhaps, though, confusing and conflating ends and means is
what is most postmodern about this sort of analysis? Do you do it on
purpose? Is that what postmodernism is, after all: making the same
old mistakes over again? Watch out, ladies: in the bad old days they
stoned and burned uppity women. What rough beast, its hour come round
again, slouches towards us?

Advice to Young Ladies
AD Hope

A.U.C. 334: about this date,
For a sexual misdemeanor which she denied,
The vestal virgin Postumia was tried;
Livy records it among affairs of state.

They let her off: it seems she was perfectly pure;
The charge arose because some thought her talk
Too witty for a young girl, her eyes, her walk
Too lively, her clothes too smart to be demure.

The Pontifex Maximus, summing up the case,
Warned her in future to abstain from jokes,
To wear less modish and more pious frocks.
She left the court reprieved, but in disgrace.

What then? With her the annalist is less
Concerned than what the men achieved that year:
Plots, quarrels, crimes, with oratory to spare --
I see Postumia with her dowdy dress,

Stiff mouth and listless step; I see her strive
To give dull answers. She had to knuckle down.
A vestal virgin who scandalized that town
Had fair trial, then they buried her alive.

Alive, bricked up in suffocating dark;
A ration of bread, a pitcher if she was dry,
Preserved the body they did not wish to die
Until her mind was quenched to the last spark.

How many the black maw has swallowed in its time!
Spirited girls who would not know their place,
Talented girls who found that the disgrace
Of being a woman made genius a crime.

How many others, who would not kiss the rod,
Domestic bullying broke or public shame?
Pagan or Christian, it was much the same:
Husbands, St. Paul declared, rank next to God.

Livy and Paul, it may be, never knew
That Rome was doomed; each spoke of her with pride.
Tacitus, writing after both had died,
Showed that whole fabric rotten, through and through.

Historians spend their lives and lavish ink
Explaining how great commonwealths collapse
From great defects of policy -- perhaps
The cause is sometimes simpler than they think.

It may not seem so grave an act to break
Postumia's spirit as Galileo's, to gag
Hypatia as crush Socrates, or drag
Joan as Giordano Bruno to the stake.

Can we be sure? Have more states perished, then,
For having shackled the enquiring mind,
Than those who, in their folly not less blind,
Trusted the servile womb to breed free men?

has been updated with 15 pieces by Martha Deed.

There are poetries which seek (or simply end up) narrowing what it is
possible for poetry to be, to do, to say. There are poetries which
seek (or simply end up) expanding what it is possible for poetry to
be, to do, to say. Each has their merits, each their place. I prefer
the latter, and place the work of Martha Deed squarely within the
expansive.

Subject:      Spanish is not a foreign language
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

For years I've been saying to myself that I should learn Spanish.

It's been so easy not to learn it.  It's easy being lazy when  you
already speak and write the language of the ruling class and race.

And where I come from no one learns Spanish, or even considers
it.  Only one member of my extended family has ever graduated
from college (and it's not me).

The recent hostile arguments from our esteemed Washington
leadership for making English the official language, meaning a
requirement for the privilege of citizenship, has me as angry
as I am embarrassed.

Angry because the racism and classism handed down from
the pearly top.  Embarrassed because I do not know Spanish,
but want to better support those who LIVE in the language.

So I've decided to be as vocal as I can be about learning Spanish
this year.  Mainly because I want to say as often as I can,
"I am NOT learning a foreign language, but another American
language!"  Because this IS TRUE!

Learning Spanish and being confrontational about NEEDING to
learn it has never seemed more important.  Solidarity with the
Latino community in their (our) present and future crises needs
to be met at the very least with making an effort to communicate.
That and knowing more about a culture and a community than
what and how to order off the menu.

Also, this crisis of language in Washington might just be the
very thing needed to make more Americans aware of Chavez
and the amazing revolution in Venezuela.  Such awareness
can only make Americans angry about what we LACK!

May the backfiring begin, and soon!

It will also be good to read poetry in Spanish, to finally see

THE SILENCE OF MEN

A man I've never dreamed before walks
into my apartment and sits in the green
chair where I do my writing. He carries
in his left hand a large erect penis
which he places silently on the floor.
The phallus begins to waltz to music
I cannot hear, its scrotum a skirt;
its testicles, legs cut off at the knees.

I want to know why this disfigured
manhood has been brought to me. I look up,
but my guest is gone. His organ, deflating
in short spasms like an old man coughing,
spreads itself in a pool of shallow blood.
The silence between us is the silence of men.

-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

In The Silence Of Men, Richard Jeffrey Newman confronts and breaks the two
great silences that permeate men's lives: silence about sex and silence
about violence. Graphic and intimate, celebratory and heartbreakingly
painful, these are the poems of a survivor for whom writing has been a
primary means of survival. Robin Behn has written about these poems,
"[Richard Jeffrey Newman's] is an unremitting empathy, as uncommon as it is
necessary." In the Foreword, Yusef Komunyakaa has this to say: " Richard
Newman's.. poetry dares us, as men, as human beings, to share what we have
experienced and imagined-the good and the bad. He seems to be saying that
dialogue is what makes each of us whole. Not in a gush, but through a
measured language that embraces art."

-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

Richard Jeffrey Newman is a poet, essayist and translator. In addition to
The Silence Of Men, he has published two books of translations from
classical Persian literature, Selections from Saadi's Gulistan and
Selections from Saadi's Bustan (both from Global Scholarly Publications,
www.gsp-online.org, 2004 and 2006 respectively). He has been publishing his
work since 1988, when the essay "His Sexuality; Her Reproductive Rights"
appeared in Changing Men magazine. Since then, his work has appeared in a
wide range of journals, including Prairie Schooner, ACM, and the Birmingham
Poetry Review. As well, his work was recently anthologized in Access
Literature (Thomson Wadsworth, 2005). Currently, in addition to working on
his second book of poems, he is translating selections from the Shahnameh,
the Persian national epic, and collaborating with Professor John Moyne on a
new Rumi anthology. Richard Jeffrey Newman sits on the advisory board of The
Translation Project, www.thetranslationproject.com, and he listed as a
speaker with the New York Council for the Humanities,
http://www.nyhumanities.org/speakers/lectures/lecture.php?lecture_id=1186.
He is an Associate Professor in the English Department at Nassau Community
College in Garden City, New York.

The Silence Of Men is the first book of Newman's own poems to be published.

It appears that a good deal of what postmodernism consists of is not
giving a damn if you know what you're saying. The postmodernist's
motto: "Only disconnect". I guess that explains the lot: if you don't
give a damn what you're saying you can say anything; and best of all,
if you're saying it to other postmodernists, they don't give a damn
whether you're saying anything, or whether you give a damn whether
you're saying anything. What a racket.

If I parse the sense of what you're saying here correctly, and I hope
you'll correct me if I'm wrong, you see ability as "vapor" and means
as a "relationship", and claim there's a paradigmatic shift from
"vapor" to "relationship", or from "ability" to "means". In the
context of the conversation you were distinguishing "the ability of
human beings to destroy the planet" from "the means of human beings
to destroy the planet", so what you seem to be saying now is that you
see a paradigmatic shift from "the vapor of human beings to destroy
the planet" to "the relationship of human beings to destroy the
planet". Is that right?

And are 'real' things vapor, or relationship, or something else?

In case you have been missing "Baghdad Burning" - which has been
sporadically appearing at  best -  this one goes right to the depths,
complete with an Emily Dickinson rejoinder:

Tuesday, June 06, 2006
=A0
Bad Day...
It=B9s been a horrible day. We woke up to unbearable heat. Our area averages
about 4 hours electricity daily and the rest is generator electricity, whic=
h
means we can use our ceiling fans, but there=B9s no way we can use air
conditioners.
We woke up to an ominous silence- an indicator that the generator isn=B9t
working. E. went next door to check and got a confirmation. It might not
work all day. The neighbor responsible for it was going to bring by the
=8Cgenerator doctor=B9 as soon as he was free.
The electricity came at 6 pm for only twenty minutes- as if to taunt us. Th=
e
moment the lights flickered on, we were gathered in the kitchen and we coul=
d
hear the neighborhood children began to hoot and holler with joy.
Before that, we heard the news about the dozens abducted from the Salhiya
area in Baghdad. Salhiya is a busy area where many travel agencies have
offices. It has been particularly busy since the war because people who wan=
t
to leave to Jordan and Syria all make their reservations from one office or
another in that area.
According to people working and living in the area, around 15 police cars
pulled up to the area and uniformed men began pulling civilians off the
streets and from cars, throwing bags over their heads and herding them into
the cars. Anyone who tried to object was either beaten or pulled into a car=
.
The total number of people taken away is estimated to be around 50.
This has been happening all over Iraq- mysterious men from the Ministry of
Interior rounding up civilians and taking them away. It just hasn=B9t happene=
d
with this many people at once. The disturbing thing is that the Iraqi
Ministry of Interior has denied that it had anything to do with this latest
mass detention (which is the new trend with them- why get tangled up with
human rights organizations about mass detentions, torture and
assassinations- just deny it happened!). That isn=B9t a good sign- it means
these people will probably be discovered dead in a matter of days. We pray
they=B9ll be returned alive=8A
Another piece of particularly bad news came later during the day. Several
students riding a bus to school were assassinated in Dora area. No one know=
s
why- it isn=B9t clear. Were they Sunni? Were they Shia? Most likely they were
a mix=8A Heading off for their end-of-year examination- having stayed up the
night before to study in the heat. When they left their houses, they were
probably only worried about whether they=B9d pass or fail- their parents
sending them off with words of encouragement and prayer. Now they=B9ll never
come home.
There=B9s an ethnic cleansing in progress and it=B9s impossible to deny. People
are being killed according to their ID card. Extremists on both sides are
making life impossible. Some of them work for =8CZarqawi=B9, and the others wor=
k
for the Iraqi Ministry of Interior. We hear about Shia being killed in the
=8CSunni triangle=B9 and corpses of Sunnis named =8COmar=B9 (a Sunni name) arriving
by the dozen at the Baghdad morgue. I never thought I=B9d actually miss the
car bombs. At least a car bomb is indiscriminate. It doesn=B9t seek you out
because you=B9re Sunni or Shia.
We still don=B9t have ministers in the key ministries- defense and interior.
Iraq is falling apart and Maliki and his team are still bickering over who
should get more power- who is more qualified to oppress Iraqis with the hel=
p
of foreign occupiers? On top of all of this, rumor has it that the Iraqi
parliament have a =8Cvacation=B9 coming up during July and August. They=B9re so
exhausted with the arguing, and struggling for power, they need to take a
couple of months off to rest. They=B9ll leave their well-guarded homes behind
for a couple of months, and spend some time abroad with their families (who
can=B9t live in Iraq anymore- they=B9re too precious for that).
Where does one go to avoid the death and destruction? Are the Americans
happy with this progress? Does Bush still insist we=B9re progressing?
Emily Dickinson wrote, =B3hope is a thing with feathers=B2. If what she wrote i=
s

New entries at Ann Margaret Bogle BLOG mostly since March 13, 2006:

2 short stories, "Almanac" and "Hogging the Lady," previously published in
Poetic Inhalation, February 2005.

2 previously unpublished short stories, "Cigs," and "Rule Out Euthymia."

2 Swedish folk poems, "Ode to Coffee" (Hyllningsdikt Till Kaffet) and "Varan
Prost."  Many visitors to my blog -- several per week -- are seeking the words
to "Rida Rida Ranka," also cited there.  One visitor posted the Norwegian
translation.

"Bill Evans Lake, 1999," a poem by Victoria Tester, courtesy of Veery Books,
NY, from Miracles of Sainted Earth (University of New Mexico Press, 2002).

The story of my relation to Ann-Margret in "Wild Bore Harley."

So -- in the same season that the Senate declares English our "national"
language, the final two contestants in the "National Spelling Bee" were
confronted with German words! Can you say "Ursprache?"  Can Bush?

I say lock up the Bees; throw the book at 'em.  What kind of anti-American
spelling terrorists are they?

Subject:      and what, friends, is a sea?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

And what, friends, is called a ship?  If there is, friends, any kind of
large vessel, subject to be steered for the purposes of shipping a range
of items, this vessel being composed of various materials-—whether metal
or wood, concrete or fiberglass-—such that it floats, carrying objects
one wishes to keep dry-—this, friends, is called a ship.

And what, friends, is called a sea? If there is, friends, any expanse of
seawater, positioned between continents or amid various nations, such
that it would be coated by pointy waves, supportive of various kinds of
wind-—whether gusts or light breeze, whether slight breeze or gentle
breeze, whether moderate breeze or fresh breeze, strong breeze or gale,
whether moderate gale or fresh gale, strong gale or whole gale, or
whether wind storm or hooricane—-this wind being usually clear or grey,
resembling an invisible rack from which various birds may be
suspended—-whether frigatebirds or kelp petrels, storm petrels or awks,
whether pelicans or the arctic tern-—any such expanse of seawater
providing a relatively frictionless surface for the purposes of
seatravel, a surface one may study but not understand, at which one may
stare but not comprehend, and whose bottom is constituted by shells,
muds, corals, sands, trenches or volcanic elements—-being thus a more or
less gargantuan body of seawater, such that it is inclined to induce
humility in those adjacent to it or poised upon it, which humility may
itself come in the guise of awe, vomiting, or tourism—-this, friends, is
a called a sea.

And what, friends, is called a cruise?  If there is an activity,
friends, constituted by the unilateral movement of several hundred
people en masse across the surface of seawater, aboard a ship engaged in
the approximation of a hotel, in which one may find the selling of
jewelry, clothing, alcohol, and a diversity of commemorative objects,
and upon which the days are divided by a person called a “cruise
director,” whose name may be Dave, and whose voice piercingly comes
unbidden through the various ceilings of the ship, the days thus being
divided by the cruise director into group activities whose purpose is to
render controlled approximations of joy, which are called “fun”-—this,
friends, is called a cruise.

And what, friends, is called a friend?  If there are, friends, any kind
of companions, with whom one shares this joy or that joy, and who at
times can aid one in the often difficult task of retaining the capacity
to be surprised by this life, and with whom one feels fortunate to have
spent time, even a little time, whether eating dinner or writing poetry,
whether talking of Tristan Tzara or staring at the wake of a ship-—even
a little time talking of frigatebirds or chatting with the children of
these companions or engaging in small talks by a street bench on a tiny
island-—any such person toward whom one is inclined to feel gratitude
for having shared, even briefly, the endless humility of this
life-—this, friends, is called a friend.

i never thought that a language was a geographic thing, it may start someplace but like (and with people) they move (or die), they change (or die), they become something else (or die),  if your government wants to name just one as the the top dog, that's fine, people will still talk whatever langague they need to to get the job of life done

yeah -- it does sound funny to declare that Nahuatal is an American language,
even though the people who evolved that language didn't call this place
America, and then say that Spanish is not an American Language -- so yes, it
does depend on what you define as American - I live in a place that is called
America by most people who live in other parts of North and South America --
and I count among my neighbors people who speak Spanish, Armenian and Quechua
-- Not one of them speaks that language in exactly the way it is spoken in its
place of origin --

So they're American on my tongue --

Obviously there has to be a point to postmodernism. Sometimes I think it's =
its own point.

I don't think it's obvious at all. I think it is an embarrassing
mistake; that the people who initially started writing about it
didn't think it through, and by that time they were too well-known
for writing about "postmodernism" to back down, and they were stuck
with this pointless pseudo-movement about which so many of its
defenders and advocates are either inarticulate, incoherent, or both.

> Sometimes I think it's its own point.<

And look at that: right on cue. What do you mean "Sometimes"? What
would "being its own point" mean in terms of a description such as
"Postmodernism" is supposed to be, compared to "Modern" and
"Romantic" and "Classical" and the like?

It seems the company Marcus works for has a bit of indeterminacy going
for it:

*The Company*
Designer Glass is a team of people who've found that their skills
mesh together well to produce a whole greater than the sum of its
parts.  */Begun in 1949, 1985, or 1987, /*depending on whether you count
the other companies we've bought over the years, Designer Glass has
been doing good work for long enough to know that this is what we
like to do, and what we'll be doing for years to come....

PRESS RELEASE	


Relaunch of the « Poems of the Week » website by the
Parliamentary Poet Laureate


The Parliamentary Poet Laureate, Mrs. Pauline Michel,
is proud to announce that the « Poems of the Week »
website is now again online. Mrs. Michel has
relaunched this website dedicated to Canadian poets
and their poems on June 5th. This project has been set
up by the previous Poet laureate, Mr. George Bowering,
in 2002.

From now on and until the end of Mrs. Michels mandate
on November 16th, readers will have access to poems
written by 48 living Canadian poets invited to share
their poetry. These poets come from all around the
country, they are from several ethnic origins, they
are women as well as men. Their work is already well
known or will soon be. French writers and English
writers are equally represented.

Two new poems will be available each week : one in
French, the other in English. Previous poems will
remain online in the archive section so readers can
read them until the end of the project.

Visit this out of the ordinary website, which makes
the promotion of Canadian poets and  contributes in
its way to the Canadian literature radiance.

A postmodernist is anyone who someone in authority thinks is having more fun
than they are (paraphrasing Tuli Kupferberg's- or was it Ed Sanders'?-
definition of a hippy).

[News From Underground] Gay Americans under NSA surveillance


National Security Agency Will
"Neither Confirm Nor Deny" Surveillance of LGBT Community
"2006 is the new 1984," says SLDN

Washington, DC - In a June 5 letter to counsel for Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network (SLDN), the National Security Agency (NSA) says
it will "neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence" of
information that may have been obtained through agency surveillance of
the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.  SLDN sought
information, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request,
after media reports indicated the agency may have been monitoring
groups and individuals opposed to the military's "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" ban on lesbian, gay and bisexual personnel.  The June 5 letter
was sent in response to SLDN's appeal of NSA's refusal to release any
information related to that surveillance.  The appeal was filed on
SLDN's behalf by the law firm of Proskauer Rose LLP.

"2006 is the new 1984," said SLDN executive director C. Dixon Osburn.
"The federal government's Orwellian surveillance programs of ordinary,
law-abiding citizens violates our right to privacy under current law.
The government's refusal to disclose its surveillance programs erodes
the public trust."

The NSA letter, from William B. Black, Jr., notes that "any
substantive response to [the original] request would tend to confirm
or deny specific activities."  SLDN has up to five years to appeal the
NSA's response.

In January, the Department of Defense acknowledged that it had
"inappropriately" conducted surveillance on student protestors at
several universities.  The Pentagon has also indicated it has
additional surveillance materials, in the form of government TALON
reports, which will be released at a later date.  Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld has said the surveillance program is "no big deal."

A copy of the NSA letter, along with other materials related to SLDN's
FOIA request and lawsuit, is available online at www.sldn.org.

The point being made that post-modernism is irrational and may be saying
absolutly nothing goes along with my point very well.  If there is a
greater understanding of the workings of the mind and nature then there is
a greater ability to disrupt it, destroy it, and point out its
absurdities.  A non-grammatical, non-comprehendable flow of thought could
show that the writer has a greater understanding of how his own thoughts
are produced. Either that or, the writer is completely full of shit and
running a "racket" as was previously stated.

With this sort of thing there is a fine line between genius and asshole.

I'm having trouble finding additional thinking/writing on Gramsci in
terms of his discussion of "progress" and "becoming" in <i>The Prison
Notebooks</i> (from "The Study of Philosophy" in the selections edited
and translated by Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith).

I did have the entire (2) translated volumes but returned both. Perhaps
this is treated at greater length there?

I am also interested in thinkers that relate Gramsci and poetics in
terms of these two notions of progress and becoming.

I searched also online for discussion groups on Gramsci but found none.

If you have any thoughts on the above, or can point me in a direction on
any of the above, I'd be grateful. Please backchannel.

Kindest regards,
Deborah Poe

Ahhh Mr. bales my friend,
  It seems you have really been at it today! Where is this motto of disconnectedness you speak of? What post modernist has forged this motto? What post modernist lives by a motto? Post modernist dis-connectivity, I bet, is concerned with separating from the ' disinterested purposiveness' in the shadows, behind the triangulated columns of binary logic. Are you back there robed with your rod ?  I'm not sure from where this idea of irrationality has come from either. Again what post modernist has made the declaration of irrationality and if he did; how did you understand it? What is your rationality? Do you suppose the rationality of say, the Yaruba tribe in Africa whose social hierarchies depend upon patterns and depths of facial scaration, is the same as your seemingly Euro centric rationality? Perhaps, what you coin as  irrationality is just another form of rationality with different 'ends' deviously carved under the gold leafed 'means'  of the Nike of Samothrace's wings,
 cracking slowly with each languorous flap.Those nasty deceptive postmodernists! You make claims of postmodern  inarticulation and incoherence, it may, and of course, correct me if I'm wrong, and I'm sure you will with emotional and irrational rigor, be unclear and incoherent because you are unwilling to wrap your head around different modes of rationality, different forms of thought? Now, Mr. bales, I'm just having a bit of fun here, as you have been doing yourself, with me. But on a more 'realistic' note, I really haven't heard you mention any specific postmodernist or postmodern 'thing' that has offended you so much.For example, much post modern architecture is "connected" with its' environment and its' use. Generalities have been par for the semantics, thus far. If you remember, my original statement was an attempt to open up a discussion about vision and instrumentation in an effort to suggest that perhaps the increasing union between instrumentation ( say
 surveillance) and sight ( behavior) may be in some way part of what it means to be a postmodernist( perhaps by default as Charles Jenks suggests, we may not have a say) living in a ubiquitously (Westernized) world. I am only a mere student of life as I will always remain, and I am interested in learning as much as possible about other points of view and other modes of thought and I think I am capable of being articulate or coherent enough ( or at least I can try) to have a civil non-aggressive conversation. Perhaps this might entail too much patience on your part, and that I can understand, and if this is so I am sorry I have wasted so much of your time on your list with your topic,

  Your friend Warren

I don't think it's obvious at all. I think it is an embarrassing
mistake; that the people who initially started writing about it
didn't think it through, and by that time they were too well-known
for writing about "postmodernism" to back down, and they were stuck
with this pointless pseudo-movement about which so many of its
defenders and advocates are either inarticulate, incoherent, or both.

And look at that: right on cue. What do you mean "Sometimes"? What
would "being its own point" mean in terms of a description such as
"Postmodernism" is supposed to be, compared to "Modern" and
"Romantic" and "Classical" and the like?

from the intro to David Harvey's The Condition of Postmodernity:

"No one exactly agrees as to what is meant by the term, except, perhaps,
that 'postmodernism' represents some kind of reaction to, or departure from,
'modernism'. Since the meaning of modernism is also very confused, the
reaction or departure known as 'postmodernism' is doubly so. The literary
critic Terry Eagleton (1987) tries to define the term as follows:

       There is, perhaps, a degree of consensus that the typical
postmodernist artefact is playful,
       self-ironizing and even schizoid; and that it reacts to the austere
autonomy of high
       modernism by impudently embracing the language of commerce and of
commodity. Its
       stance towards cultural tradition is one of irreverent pastiche, and
its contrived
       depthlessness undermines all metaphysical solemnities, sometimes by a
brutal aesthetics
       of squalor and shock.

In more positive vein, the editors of the architectural journal PRECIS 6
(1987, 7-24) see postmodernism as a legitimate reaction to the 'monotomy' of
universal modernism's vision of the world. 'Generally perceived as
positivistic, technocentric, and rationalistic, universal modernism has been
identified with the belief in linear progress, absolute truths, the rational
planning of ideal social orders, and the standardization of knowledge and
production.' Postmodernism, by way of contrast, privileges 'heterogeneity
and difference as liberative forces in the redefinition of cultural
discourse.' Fragmentation, indeterminacy, and intense distrust of all
universal or 'totalizing' discourses (to use a favored phrase) are the
hallmarks of postmodernist thought. The rediscovery of pragmatism in
philosophy (e. g. Rorty, 1979), the shift of ideas about the philosophy of
science wrought by Kuhn (1962) and Feyerabend (1975), Foucault's emphasis
upon discontinuity and difference in history and his privileging of
'polymorphous correlations in place of simple or complex causality,' new
developments in mathematics emphasizing indeterminacy (catastrophe and chaos
theory, fractal geometry), the reemergence of concern in ethics, politics,
and anthropology for the validity and dignity of 'the other,' all indicate a
widespread and profound shift in 'the structure of feeling.' What all these
examples have in common is a rejection of 'meta-narratives' (large-scale
theoretical interpretations purportedly of universal application), which
leads Eagleton to complete his description of postmodernism thus:

      Post-modernism signals the death of such 'metanarratives' whose
secretly terroristic
      function was to ground and legitimate the illusion of a 'universal'
human history.
      We are now in the process of wakening from the nightmare of modernity,
with its
      manipulative reason and fetish of the totality, into the laid-back
pluralism of the
      post-modern, that heterogeneous range of lifestyles and language games
which
      has renounced the nostalgic urge to totalize and legitimate itself....
Science and
      philosophy must jettison their grandiose metaphysical claims and view
themselves
      more modestly as just another set of narratives."

Grind yer teeth on that awhile... and let the sophistry begin (continue)!

that 'postmodernism' represents some kind of reaction to, or departure from,
'modernism'. Since the meaning of modernism is also very confused, the
reaction or departure known as 'postmodernism' is doubly so. The literary
critic Terry Eagleton (1987) tries to define the term as follows:

There is, perhaps, a degree of consensus that the typical
postmodernist artefact is playful,
self-ironizing and even schizoid; and that it reacts to the austere
autonomy of high
modernism by impudently embracing the language of commerce and of
commodity. Its
stance towards cultural tradition is one of irreverent pastiche, and
its contrived
depthlessness undermines all metaphysical solemnities, sometimes by a
brutal aesthetics
of squalor and shock.

In more positive vein, the editors of the architectural journal PRECIS 6
(1987, 7-24) see postmodernism as a legitimate reaction to the 'monotomy' of
universal modernism's vision of the world. 'Generally perceived as
positivistic, technocentric, and rationalistic, universal modernism has been
identified with the belief in linear progress, absolute truths, the rational
planning of ideal social orders, and the standardization of knowledge and
production.' Postmodernism, by way of contrast, privileges 'heterogeneity
and difference as liberative forces in the redefinition of cultural
discourse.' Fragmentation, indeterminacy, and intense distrust of all
universal or 'totalizing' discourses (to use a favored phrase) are the
hallmarks of postmodernist thought. The rediscovery of pragmatism in
philosophy (e. g. Rorty, 1979), the shift of ideas about the philosophy of
science wrought by Kuhn (1962) and Feyerabend (1975), Foucault's emphasis
upon discontinuity and difference in history and his privileging of
'polymorphous correlations in place of simple or complex causality,' new
developments in mathematics emphasizing indeterminacy (catastrophe and chaos
theory, fractal geometry), the reemergence of concern in ethics, politics,
and anthropology for the validity and dignity of 'the other,' all indicate a
widespread and profound shift in 'the structure of feeling.' What all these
examples have in common is a rejection of 'meta-narratives' (large-scale
theoretical interpretations purportedly of universal application), which
leads Eagleton to complete his description of postmodernism thus:

Post-modernism signals the death of such 'metanarratives' whose
secretly terroristic
function was to ground and legitimate the illusion of a 'universal'
human history.
We are now in the process of wakening from the nightmare of modernity,
with its
manipulative reason and fetish of the totality, into the laid-back
pluralism of the
post-modern, that heterogeneous range of lifestyles and language games
which
has renounced the nostalgic urge to totalize and legitimate itself....
Science and
philosophy must jettison their grandiose metaphysical claims and view
themselves
more modestly as just another set of narratives."

Grind yer teeth on that awhile... and let the sophistry begin (continue)!

I confess, I made it up in response to the demonstrations I've seen
by postmodernists, or their advocates or defenders, in order to point
up the absurdity of the postmodernist position.

No doubt it is. I'm questioning whether that's a good thing.

You claim right out loud that "is concerned with separating from the
'disinterested purposiveness' in the shadows, behind the triangulated
columns of binary logic" and you can't see why that looks like the
idea of irrationality?

As far as I can see, you yourself have:

Do you suppose the greenness of the infield fly rule, which women
holding babies disregard irrespective of whether there are men on
base, is any more feline than a locomotive?

Why don't you ask a question that makes sense? What can the patterns
of scarification in the Yoruba have to do with the patterns of
rationality? If you get appendicitis, are you going to try to decide
what to do based on the social hierarchies of the Yoruba, or go to
the hospital?

If it's rationality, then let's hear about the rules and means and
ends of that rationality. Lay it out for us all: explain this "other
form of rationality".

Or it could be that the incoherence and inarticulation are merely
coverups for there being no there there. If there is a "different
mode of rationality", then explain it. As for "different forms of
thought", I do not deny that in the least -- but thought and
rationality are not the same thing.

Can we agree that Frank Gehry's curvilinear architecture is
"postmodern"? Can we agree that they don't build those buildings with
"postmodern methods" but, instead, rely on some really serious number
crunching in the same old rational way? Can we agree that those
buildings do not get built unless the same old rational way of
thought can show that they're not going to fall down? So what's
"postmodern" about them at all? Postmodernism is either an entirely
superficial thing that stands on the shoulders of rationalism, or its
as "other" as you claim, and why would anyone bother to crunch the
numbers for Gehry? Why not just bend the steel randomly and hope?

This is superficial, not an example of "other" thinking, or of "other
than rational" thinking.

Have you ever really looked closely at a medieval building? Have you
noticed that the joins are amazing even after a thousand years; that
the carvings on the underside of the chairs are as good as those on
the backs? And so on? Why do you suppose that is? It's because the
dominant religious sensibility of the time was that God Is Watching
Everywhere All The Time -- craftsmen would not then, as so many do
now, fail to sand and finish the join just because it was hidden from
sight or hard to see. Perhaps the surveillance you speak of, and the
human reactions to it are not postmodern in the least, but rather
medieval. You may object to the "watching everywhere all the time"
notion on other grounds, but I scarcely think that you can claim it
is "postmodern" merely on the grounds that an awareness of the
watching exists. That's not enough. Your claim of postmodernism has
to rest of more than that, or, if that's all you've got, you have to
see that it's at best medieval, and perhaps lots older than that.

In short, once again, to re-emphasize the point I made talking to
Alison Croggon, the human condition hasn't changed, and calling it
"postmodern" insteadof "medieval" doesn't get you any further along.
Calling a tail a leg doesn't give a dog five legs.

That's like a doctor confronting battlefield casualties by simply
cutting the throats of all the wounded. Is it the artist's call to do
just what everyone else is doing? If on the battlefield where killing
is occurring, kill more? If in a milieu of squalor and shock, be more
squalid and more shocking? How do you reconcile such an attitude with
your credit rating, your house, your job, your spouse, your kids,
your neighbors? Why aren't you out there in the squalor being
shocking? What price respectability with a postmodern view?

Let's have no more brave talk from a safe distance behind the lines.
Go bankrupt. Kill a cop. Blow up a building. Pursue another kind of
rationality. Be postmodern, don't just talk about it. Either do it or
shut up about it. But writing poems can't be a postmodern response to
postmodernity because it's just too freaking rational in the old way.

Well then by all means, let us have some heterogeneity in, say, math.
Why aren't you an architect or engineer? Why don't you go out and
build a postmodern building that looks like nothing else? Oh, and
don't forget to invent a whole new mathematics to make sure it won't
fall down, while you're at it! No fair using the old math, or hiring
a "real" engineer, either, or it won't be "postmodern" -- it'll just
be ordinarily modern because it'll depend on those ordinarily modern
notions such as rationality and all. Let's have Postmodern for real,
shall we?

What crap. Those are the hallmarks of rational thought, not
postmodern irrationalist thought. You think it was a postmodern who
thought up "Question Authority"? Was Socrates, then, postmodern?

What crap. These ideas have been around for aeons, and they come and
go in emphasis depending on conditions and circumstances. There's
nothing postmodern about them. Zeno of Elea was criticizing the
absolutism of the Pythagorean number line hundreds of years before
the Common Era, and in terms that have taken 2500 years to really
understand. You can see the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in Zeno
of Elea's paradoxes of motion. What "postmodernism" seems to consist
of, mostly, is ignorance about what other people have done before.

Oh my -- "secretly terroristic"!? Well, come to think of it, in my
experience the people who are most adamantinely postmodern are just
those people who ARE terrified of math and science, who don't get it
and can't do it. But they manage to graduate from school with good
grades in spite of a profound ignorance, and that leads them to think
that if they can get away with faking a good education, they can get
away with faking good art. Why not eliminate all the hard stuff in
art, and call whatever the result is, well, art. If it's difficult,
eliminate it; if it's easy, call it postmodern.

Well good luck with that. More hospital beds for the rest of us, I
say, because I hope you have the courage of your convictions, and
when you wake from the nightmare of modernity to a case of
appendicitis that you have the decency to die your postmodern death
without trying to sponge off the rest of us.

And while you're laying there dying of a condition the modern world
could easily correct, you tell yourself narratives of the Yoruba
scarification rituals, all right? I'm sure you'll find that very
helpful!

I could grow to like this whole postmodern thing -- maybe we can sell
it to the rest of the world by exporting postmodernists to China and
India as the Germans exported Lenin to Russia: like a destructive
virus. We'll keep on with the nightmare of modernism here in the
West, and you postmodernists all go and preach your gospel of
alternative narratives to the rest of the world. Convince them that
their own native narratives are superior to the nightmare of
modernism, and that those pipelines and ports and airbases are none
of their concern. Okay?

well . . . I seem to have picked up that idea from fifty years of conversations
with people throughout the Americas and relatively extensive reading -- The
usual objection comes when people in my part of the Americas refer to
themselves as "American" in such a way to imply that people in La Paz or
Toronto are not also "American."  If you would prefer not to be included in the
term "American," that's your right -- but surely you aren't denying the term to
the rest of us, no?

In case it wasn't clear, I did say Spanish is "another" American
language, not "the other" American language.

Some of you don't seem to mind "Quechua, Aymara, Cherokee,
Nahuatl, and Guarani" as being called "American" languages?
If you're so concerned, why say that Cherokee for instance should
be called an "American" language, when America is named after
an Italian navigator?

Our government's war against Cherokee being a shared language
was won more than a century ago.  But it is my hope, and the
hope of many others, that our fascist government NOT win THIS
war against Spanish.

Maybe we should ONLY elect candidates who would support
speaking in tongues as the legal, national language of the day,
which would make for some VERY interesting presidential
debates, no?

Jonathan Skinner and I had lunch not long ago in a pocket of
Philadelphia where Spanish is the first language.  And in the
restaurant no one spoke English.  It was a good thing he was
there because I had no idea what was being said to me any
more than they could understand me, and he played interpreter.
That experience helped me make my mind up that this is a
language of necessity.

Every public school should be teaching English and Spanish
as requirements, not MAKING the Spanish speaking children
learn only English.

And there IS a deeply rooted racism/classism surrounding
the tyrannical act of MAKING people speak only English.
You can't possibly tell me that that needs to be pointed out.

The beautiful thing about all these different languages that we
are constantly confronted with is that it's our most striking
example of FEELING separated, and getting the urge to make
that separation mend, making something new, for everyone.

Let's MAKE globalization backfire on the international corporate
thugs by making globalization be about a world of human beings
learning to live TOGETHER.

Spanish is the language of REAL change on the planet right now.
Countries like Bolivia and Venezuela are saying FUCK YOU on
a daily basis!  And NOT mind you to trade power of one
thug for another, but to GIVE power to the people.

The Venezuelan Constitution puts our own to SHAME!  Chavez
and his genius cabinet have forged a document that is the most
inclusive and caring constitution you will find.  And THIS  document
helps make Spanish a dangerous language to American interests
on the verge of making CAFTA make NAFTA look like little league.

For anyone who is interested I have a link to an interview that
I did earlier this year with Mary Kalyna on her return from the
World Social Forum in Venezuela.  Here's the link:

(http://phillysound.blogspot.com/2006_02_01_phillysound_archive.html)

Does anyone have advice for what is the best book, or CD, or
class or whatever to learn Spanish?  I've been looking at books,
but thought I'd ask in case someone knows an excellent one.

Much appreciated, CAConrad

But isn't the defense of English really some sort of racist bull
And about the marginalization of poetry in the US... isn't poetry generally
considered some sort of academic, nerdy, loser freak show in most cultures?
Maybe in the US there is less pretention about dismissing poetry, and other
high end European courtliness, tea bags, and high tea cucumber sandwiches,
but even the Russians look at you in a weird way when you talk about being a
poet in today's world. Even the Russians!
I am not sure of this but...

The Senate did not feel compelled to honor a foundational language during the
years when the bulk of the immigration was from Europe.  Honor has very little
to do with anything the Senate does these days.

Here's a message from Rebecca Moore the co-curator of an event I'm involved
with happening this Friday night.  Hope you can make it:

*LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL MOXIE*







 *Hello Friends...*
I co-curate this event with the amazing souls at Issue Project Room.  We are
already declaring it a tradition!  Cause we know we must keep highlighting
songs of rebellion and uprising and protest... must keep encouraging those
songs to be written, make a place for those songs to be continually sung,
support the artists who sing them, and bring people together to hear them.
New ones, old ones - we want to hear all of them.

We use the term "song" loosely and abstractly... the evening is part
musicians and singers, but also part film (visual songs, in my book) and
part spoken word (songs of the heart and soul).  We have to keep each other
buoyed up between rallies, marches, and administrations... so you can keep
your heart strong and chin up.  The artists can come with just about
anything related to a person standing up against status quo - it can even be
about rebelling against rebelling - - as long as we have on display all the
beautiful moxie people can be made up of.

please come hang - get your ire up and your game on...
XO

Micheal & Joe,
Yes, poetry is marginalized in the US. But I don't
think it is because Americans assign less value to
their language. On the contrary, language is what we
are all about. I think poetry is partly (& originally)
marginalized because of the attitude Micheal
Rothenberg refracts: the isolation of poetry from the
public in the academy. This trend has been mitigated
somewhat by the trends in spoken word, slam,
hip-hop-rap & bouts that bring poetic language
directly to the public & are getting some media
attention. But I think there is an additional "cause"
of this marginalization in addition to the selfishness
of academe. By this I mean how the "value of
imagination", which should be the principle province
of poetry (see the poetics of W. Stevens, R. Blaser,
W.C.Williams, A. Fletcher for starters) has been
appropriated by the media, film/tv, politics and
marketing industries. Those who are in a position to
reward imagination are putting all their money in
these places rather than into poetry writing or events
(even the academy provides skimpy funds for poetry).
The scale of poetry writing & events as celebrations
of the imagination is miniscule compared to
contemporary competitors I list above. The "language
professionals" of imagination & energy who might turn
to poetry are being swallowed up by fame & fortune
provided by these other dominants in the culture. What
is needed to address this?

The Hall of Mirrors is also of course a site of infinite reflection.  It
is in that place Aaron Rosen chooses to stand and confront--reflect
upon--the eternally enigmatic smile of Mimesis and the fleeing figuire of
Truth. Like Leonardo before his wall, he discovers marvels of form there,
flesh, shadow, pulse, ash, syllables and silence, glyphs of our becoming

As a Canadian, my objection is to the USA referring to itself as
"America,"
but I understand that it comes from the same personality that refers to
all USAmerican sports championships as "world championships."

I doubt very much that potential poets have been persuaded not to
write poems by the lure of money. Poetry has never paid as well as
other ways of recycling one's education.

Superlatives are always suspect. I'd guess that languages that
entered the larger world late have been pretty tolerant of words from
other sources. Hebrew, for one, which began the 20th century with a
2000 year old vocabulary.

What the hell does "regressive" mean when applied to language?

You don't think "potential poets" might have turned their skills to
money-making
uses in, say, fiction writing, advertising, etc.? I can think of even
accomplished
poets who have.

Maybe the double negative's confusing me.

Confuses me too.

People driven (or given, in Creeley's phrase) to write poetry will do
so, even if they work at insurance companies or write novels for
their day jobs. If they really need to write poems and their day jobs
eat whatever energy they need for the poems then they find different
day jobs. If they're less committed to poetry it's probably just as
well that they don't write poems. Even talent gets you only so
far--staying-power counts for a lot.

It's quaint to think of fiction writing as a road to wealth,
considering how few actually pay for their computer paper out of
their earnings as writers, but I imagine there are younger writers
out there who are more optimistic about their chances.\

Yes Garcia, but the language is corrupted through spin, political
doublespeak and the onslaught of commercials. McClure said it is amazing
the vocabulary kids these days have. Problem is most of the words they
know are brand names.

tonight i finally read posts from the beginning of this fun discussion.

i like what you=B9ve said, adam, especially >>It is a great evolution that
apreciates antiquity, but is aware that there is always another evolution o=
n
the horizon.<<=20

& what steve potter said early on >>It's probably more useful to talk about
the way a particular work responds to the condition of postmodernity than
whether a work is or is not itself postmodern.<<  right on!

a couple thoughts:
just as we discover the mutability of =8Ctruth=B9 or =8Cconsesus reality,=B9 so too
our comprehension of degrees of self(& other as self)-awareness or
self-consciousness. these are reflected in postmodernism, a term, i wonder,
defines itself best in the process of definition. i=B9m not trying to be
obnoxious. to what steve potter stated, =B3There is less and less consensus
reality, more and more isolated personal reality,=B2  i=B9d venture to say that
it=B9s not about consensus reality vs. =8Cthe imaginary=B9 as
psychosis/subconscious - rather consensus reality vs. the concept of
subjective sensual experience & reciprocal causality...& even further, to m=
y
favorite(s), vs. projected/individuated/manifested/=8Cvalid=B9 reality. the
parallel to quantum theory glares in this, despite disagreement over why al=
l
predictions have been =8Cproven right=B9 - there is no separation between the
observer & the observed. i=B9m in the holographic camp, myself.

this, i think, gives a snapshot of postmodernism =8Cnow=B9: everything is
incremental, everything is relative, the universe expands at every
coordinate, our sense, even en masse, is subjective. anything, everything,
we know now may likely be =8Cproven=B9 =8Cwrong=B9 down the road. in all these
discussions on the topic there are degrees of postmodernism, just as there
are degrees of awareness. some are using the term as a way to acknowlege
that we now know what we didn=B9t know then. i guess that=B9s a valid use (afte=
r
all, everything is!). but the larger, more postmodern (yes, i dared to say
that), understanding is the whole concept of nonlocality, just as the idea
that there is no beginning and end to the universe. i find it really
interesting how panicked that makes people & why some respond to
postmodernism (& the concept of it, as little as it=B9s understood) so
violently. binary much?

all best,

I suppose that a lot of us anticipated that this discussion would
degenerate into vapid generalization, and now it has.

Also sprach Marcus Bales:

It appears that a good deal of what postmodernism consists of is not
giving a damn if you know what you're saying. The postmodernist's
motto: "Only disconnect". I guess that explains the lot: if you don't
give a damn what you're saying you can say anything; and best of all,
if you're saying it to other postmodernists, they don't give a damn
whether you're saying anything, or whether you give a damn whether
you're saying anything. What a racket.

I urge Marcus Bales to read McEvilley, who is a classicist, and a Pyrrhonist pledged to the school of Diogenes of Sinope, and a hard core cynic.  To dismiss McEvilley's postmodernism in these terms is pure bombastic folly based on utter ignorance.

What a waste of time.

Dear Poetics,

I'm looking for Jack Hirschman's English translation of V. Kamensky's poem "Constantinople." He did it up as a broadside some time ago (1970s?). He can't find a copy among his papers. Since it's a visual poem, I'd like to see the translation layed out a la original. If anybody has a lead on this, I'd appreciate hearing about it. I believe Hirschman is currently Poet Laureate of San Francisco.

Thanks,
Louis

  I have not seen Steve Carll's name in a long time, and he waws on fire when he stopped publishing so it seems like it is that material, so I fully endorse the collection unseen, he practically disappeared after running an important mag called Antynem (sp?) from the west coast, glad to see you put this out in your short press-run series.

I think Sokal did it best with his unearthing of ignorance[1] within
the PoMo disciplines wrt Science and technology. Not that anyone in
"Science Studies" seemed to care - in fact, I remember a quote from a
science studies guru boasting that he'd failed science in school.

I'm with the idea that science is socially-constructed up until the
point that sez all narratives are equal. You can be an expert in a
domain and, if I can borrow GWB's habit of anthropomorphising abstract
nouns, "science" is an expert par excellence in it's chosen fields.
Science has been very successful bringing us magic ("any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" - Arthur C
Clarke) ,  alchemy, (although you may want to wait until the gold has
cooled down a bit) and raising the dead (defibrillators). One of
science's successes has alas, been da bomb and now we really, really
*can destroy the world. If one of the particle accelerators produced
the right particle, there's a chance that existence could wink out
altogether. For the first time in history, the True Believers - or
someone like them - *can bring about the "End of Days"[2]. Ironic, no?

Ironically, those who are steeped in Western rationality used it to
bring about the "equality" of narratives (that's a paraphrase from
here http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articles.php somewhere, for
the indeterminists amongst you). To me, this act helped lay the
conditions for letting the creationist genie out of the bottle, and
those with an ideological axe and a power axis to grind it on are
grinding awayl. Good luck with the faith-based science, guys!

If you view a set of meta-narratives through the lens of adaptation,
both Science and Religion have adapted to various cultural conditions
throughout history. Science, with it's paradigm of continual
revolution/evolution at no matter what the cost[3],  is built for
adaptation, has adapted  better, coming to great significance in
around 500 years - I think I'd identify Paracelus as the first
alchemist who foreshadowed modern science with his attitude "does it
work?". The word "scientist" didn't exist until the 1830s. I suspect
there will always be a niche for religion, for those who blind
themselves to reason; reason, however, is a bully, and once allowed
in, it will force all miracles out[4].

Ramble over - I hope that I haven't been too generalised -

Roger

[1] http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/ My take on this is:
<hippy>Oh, look, indeterminacy! Fractals! Unknowability! the whole
solar system is just a small atom in a giants body</hippy> Everything
changes - well, yes, and no. Transferring concepts btn disciplines is
a dangerous hobby. Artistic responses seem to be more successful.
[2] In a bit of gallows humour, I have a small bet with a friend of
mine that Iran will - if they haven't already - deploy nuclear mines
in their cities. Should anyone be foolish enough to invade, well, you
get the picture. I'm hoping my bet won't pay off.
[3] the phoebe and ross sketch where phoebe accuses ross of having no
belief - or not strong enough beliefs - when he says that he would
change his mind if evidence of god were unearthed. No, that's a
feature, not a bug. That's the way science works. Religions change
their stance throughout history as well of course, but it seems to me
that most Western have this idea of immutability.

hi roger, glad to read your post.

>I think Sokal did it best
sokal is a different topic (though fun).

& by socially-constructed, do you mean to say that it is 'real' or
'unreal'...
>up until the point that sez all narratives are equal.
because i feel that social constructivism is also a different topic.

another thing that tickles me about postmodernism is the potential for
qualification (convolution!). i'm unsure if you are addressing what i wrote
but in case: i didn't assert a notion of equality. i'm not ambitious enough
to construct or adhere to a [system of] measurement. & i don't believe that
all narratives (or perceived realities) are so - so far as they are
effective. perhaps their foundation is (if the approach is linear), i don't
know.

> <hippy>Oh, look, indeterminacy! Fractals! Unknowability! the whole
> solar system is just a small atom in a giants body</hippy> Everything
> changes - well, yes, and no.

in/determinacy is irrelevant - that's another point of postmodernism,
thankfully. simultaneity rocks.

>Transferring concepts btn disciplines is
> a dangerous hobby. Artistic responses seem to be more successful.

speaking as an artist, depends on what one finds of value in the created
work. i like the idea of being relevant* to my time. or my interpretation of
it. as a poet, i'm interested in truth - that is, what does not contradict
my sensual & conceptual faculty. i find primary value in the individually
perceived/experienced moment. thus, my potential indeterminacy is neither a
scapegoat nor an existential dilemma.

*consistency between disciplines is a strong argument for foundation &
direction if that's what interests an artist/audience.

despite the temptation to further digress, i'll sign off.
best,
hassen

I've read McEvilley, and listened to him read on the web, too. He's
not a postmodernist -- he's a progressive liberal, much like me. His
view is not that the human condition has changed with the advent of
the atom bomb; his view is not that the human world view has changed
with the advent of some change in the human condition. He's using the
same old tools of rationality and the great liberal ideas that have
stimulated so much that's good in the world now. If you call
McEvilley a "postmodern" you might as well call John Stuart Mill one,
too -- and perhaps you do.

"Post-Modernism is a deeply revised attitude toward history that
attempts to separate it form the concept of providence, denies any
claims of inevitability, and aims at a multi-cultural solution to the
problem of history, rather than an imperialistic one. " -- McEvilley

There is a fundamental difference between Indigenous and American.

In many parts of the world there are peoples whose culture is long in a
certain place, whose language is native to a certain place and this is one
kind of culture. You can make an argument that Arabs, Persians, Vietnamese,
Chinese, Japanese, some African groups and some European groups fit this
category.

Except for the Indigenous cultures of Mexico, the Andes, and the Amazon this
cannot be said anywhere in he American continent and this is something new
for world history.

American is a hybrid of (Depending on the country)

European, Indigenous, African, and Asian. This hybrid also includes religion
which is quite important throughout the American continent.

So when you hear Spanish spoken with a Voseo accent from Argentina, or
Portuguese spoken with the heavy Italian inflection of a Paulista or a
Minnesotan speaking English with an inflection of Scandanavia you are
hearing a hybrid that is American but and this is important but for the most
part it is an imposed culture with a few Indigenous words

- not a bad culture just an imposed one-

I speak, Spanish, Portuguese and English but none of these are Indigenous
American languages-

"America"s (Or whatever name you want to use for our continent) native
languages are the indigenous ones.

It's not about "being pursuaded." It's about
environment. To make a sports analogy, an athlete with
default potential to play professional tennis (add
your
desired professional sport name here_____) will apply
his/her skills to another sport (and excell at it) in
the absence of an infrastructure that publicly
promotes, remunerates and rewards achievement.
Everyone knows there's no money in poetry. But, with
an infrastructure that publicly promoted, remunerated
and rewarded poetic achievement/competition, the
environment might well produce different cultural
realities
As for the poetry "persuasion" that's another
discussion.

for years now Sokal has been going around inviting people who talk about the
postmodern to step out of his office window to see if gravity is socially
constructed -- this is, of course, an absolutley silly perversion of what
people talking about science studies had been saying -- just as is the canard
that poststructuralists say that "everything is relative" --

and just who is it that says "all narratives are equal" and where is it said?

To find fault with a correspondence theory of truth is not to say that
"everything is relative" -- and neither is even the most reductive version of
standpoint theory -- To argue that science proceeds by means of forms of
narrative is not at all to say that there is no way to reach judgments about
the workings of various narratives -- it is to say that "laws of science" are
just that; laws of science are human descriptions of natural phenomena;
theories of things such as gravity don't levitate in some eternal realm of the
ideal any more than we do --

the first responders to the Sokal hoax did indeed come off badly, and should
have taken a few minutes to think more carefully about just what the situation
they were in was -- but Sokal himself seems to have little appreciation of just
what his hoax did and did not accomplish --

For example -- if you read Sokal at length you will find him making much of the
discussion Derrida got into during the Q & A at the famous Johns Hopkins
conference about an "Einsteinian constant" -- Well, it turns out, despite what
Sokal said, that there was such a thing as an "Einsteinian constant" and that
scientists have recently returned for another look to the idea that Einstein
himself had at one time abandoned -- now, I think it's pretty clear that it
isn't the same idea Derrida and company were talking about, but the point is
that Sokal was a bit too hasty in his denunciations -- as the people at Social
Text were a bit too hasty in responding to him --

and does anybody really believe that any critique of western reason iplies an
adoption of irrationality?  isn't that rather like saying that becaue Olson's
postmodernism criticized western humanism he was opposed to humans?

I, too, have been called a hippy.
So I shaved my hair completely but then was mistaken on and off for a
skinhead.
Later I took to bleaching my hair and people would in all seriousness
ask me, "Are you from California?"
These days I let it go for five or six weeks between trims and find
that now others just project cartoon characters on me, e.g., Shaggy
stepping off the screen from some spooky mystery.  It's the most benign
misrecognition yet so I more or less let it go.

I shaved my head four years ago and played with my resume.  Blatant
lies.  They didn't help.  But I really looked like a total putz with no
hair.  As for The Fugs....

Ed & Tuli, Huh?

How old am I, for Godsake?
Someone used to call me a beatnik.
A beatnik.  Right.
Jack K., Allen G., Neal C., William B.:
it sounded like an Anonymous program.
If you shot up with Burroughs you could say
you were a Friend of Bill's.
I was old enough to see The Fugs
at some theater on 2nd Avenue in 1968.
They weren't as much fun as Zappa,
whose guys all humped stuffed toys on-stage.
But they talked real dirty and didn't think much
of the whole Peace and Love thing
from guys like the Beatles and Donovan.
Now I find that some guys my age never heard of them
I sang a friend "Dirty Old Man" a month ago,
word for word, and also "Doin' All Right"
and he was hysterical.
My biggest mistake was I didn't marry
the Slum Goddess.
She wasn't the kind you brought home to mother.
Given my mother, that would have been okay.

MAY '68 AND ITS AFTERLIVES by Kristin Ross is an excellent study of the
original events and what happened to their presentation and manipulation
through time afterwards--turning the political struggles and killing and
suppression of workers into a cultural event mainly focused on students and
intellectuals.  The massive shutdown of the whole country is forgotten in
the nostalgia for what occurred in Paris alone.  Ross traces also the return
of the political and workers movements in the fight against globalization.
     I lived in France at the time--in Arles, rather than Paris, though was
in Paris in June that year and lived there for three months the following
year in which repression especially of workers' movements was still very
strong--much of what Ross writes is very true--the strikes were nationwide
and there was a feeling of betrayal by a great many of people--the sense
that the students got to go home for the summer and leave the brunt of the
punishment to the workers and shop people and others who had to remain--also
that the offical unions and communist party had sold them out.  I got
involved in 1969 with bomb throwing anarchist cells of workers from Renault
factory which is where many of the strikes began--these people were far
angrier and better students of the history of urban guerilla warfare than
any of the "enrages", whom they regarded with contempt as exploiters of the
working class for their self promotion within the cultural hierarchy and
industry.  (The May '68 industry--)
      Ross makes use of huge number of the documents of the time and shows
that one of he main goals was equality--along with anti-imperilaism,
anti-Americanism, and effects from Vienam and Alegeria, s well as showing
how since May '68 the professional keepers of the flame have distorted and
manufactured a culuturally and ethically acceptable official version and
myth.  It's very fascinating to read and observe this process in
movement--raises many questions of the interelationships among aesthetics
and politics--

     Ross is also the author of a very good book called THE EMERGENCE OF
SOCIAL SPACE  Rimbaud and the Paris Commune.

Here is, I think, a good example:

If it's not an example of equating all narratives, on what other
grounds than that all narratives are equal would such a senseless
question be asked?

But the issue at hand in this discussion, starting with my exchange
with Alison Croggon, has been whether there is indeed something we
can identify as "the condition of postmodernity" at all. To ask about
the way a particular work responds to the condition of postmodernity
is to beg the question: it assumes that there is a condition of
postmodernity to respond to, and that is the question: is there such
a condition?

But that's not what's happening here. The postmodernists are taking,
for example, the name of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and
claiming that that principle makes "everything relative", even though
the HUP doesn't apply in human-scale conditions, and not Heisenberg
nor any other mathematician or physicist has ever said it did. It is
an inappropriate leap by folks who hear "Uncertainty Principle" and
conclude that "Everything is relative". You might as well hear
"Everything is relative" and claim that therefore all sex is incest.
It's silliness.

Not "any critique" -- but certainly in those that say "Who gives a
damn if you know what you are saying!", or that claim the
scarification of the Yoruba which denotes social hierarchies is the
same kind of thing as the Euro-centric rationality in discussion
about whether there has been a significant change in the human
condition that justifies calling our time "postmodern" or not. We do
not lack for examples of irrationality in the utterances of the
advocates and defenders of postmodernism here.

Actually, Marcus, I think Warren Lloyd is making exactly the opposite point
[with regard to rationality(ies)] -- Yaruba and European rationalities are
different.

Also he doesn't say that either one is better than the other or that they're
equal, just that they're (which would, to make a bad pun, on the face of it
seem to be true) different.

I also fail to see where "all narratives are equal" figures here.

I have come across, or heard of, lunacies which would equate bus tickets
with Shakespeare's First Folio, but that's not postmodernism, it's simply an
occasional absurdity that kicks around academe.

I don't find a problem with postmodernist -- for me, basically, Eliot and
the usual suspects are modernist, after that we have postmodernist writing.
(The rejection not simply of The Grand Narrative but of narrative per se.
OK, oversimply put, but there.)

Postmodern, on the other hand (if I haven't managed to somehow switch the
terms) is the latest grinding howl that emerged from the various
misinterpretations successively laid on poor de Saussure's +Course in
General Linguistics+ -- structuralist, post-structuralist, finally
postmodern.

One is (primarily) a literary phenomenon, the other a critical/philosophical
one.

Sure, there's an overlap, but they're horses of a different colour.  Or one
is an ass and the other is a mule.  Or whatever metaphor you want to
generate from this -- Zebroid anyone?

My two bits into the pot.

There are xenophobic elements, and moments, in France and Quebec, but
I'd hardly call either place, or their language, xenophobic, and
certainly as compared to the US. Despite the news to the contrary,
Paris (for centuries) and Montreal (for decades) are homes to
enormous populations of immigrants and foreign residents who maintain
their languages.Paris in particular was for a long time the
destination of choice for political exiles. You might want to take a
look at Jason Weiss' "The Lights of Home; A Century of Latin American
Writers in Paris."

A good test might be any bookstore in Paris, with its wealth of
translations. Speaking just of poetry, which I know more about,
francophone readers have available a wealth of material that
anglophones don't: major poets from Africa, the Middle East and Latin
America who remain unknown in the US are readily available.

I think the subject was xenophobic languages, not people. France fights
like hell to keep French free of foreign contaminants. US English
just sucks it up.

If you believe that our Senate's actions have anything to do with a love of the
English language, you have not been attending to their speeches.  If you think
this isn't about politics, you haven't been looking at the calendar.  If you
think racism has nothing to do with any of this, you
should really read more of the publications from the organizations that have
been lobbying for this and funding the English as an Official Langauge
movement.

I absolutely love American English; even the one third or so of its vocabulary
that derives from French.  I have seen nothing written by anyone here to
indicate that anybody is ashamed of having English as a first language.   On
the other hand, I find the English spoken by our president and by many of our
political leaders to be deeply embarassing.

I love the fact that we made somebody Poet Laureate of the United States who
read all his poems in Russian.  I'd like to see Juan Felipe Herrera chosen as
Poet Laureate, but won't hold my breath.

I'm with William Carlos Williams on these issues -- that's my kind of American
idiom --

Here is, I think, a good example:

"What is your rationality? Do you suppose the rationality of say, the
Yaruba tribe in Africa whose social hierarchies depend upon patterns
and depths of facial scaration, is the same as your seemingly Euro
centric rationality?"

If it's not an example of equating all narratives, on what other
grounds than that all narratives are equal would such a senseless
question be asked?

But the issue at hand in this discussion, starting with my exchange
with Alison Croggon, has been whether there is indeed something we
can identify as "the condition of postmodernity" at all. To ask about
the way a particular work responds to the condition of postmodernity
is to beg the question: it assumes that there is a condition of
postmodernity to respond to, and that is the question: is there such
a condition?

> To find fault with a correspondence theory of truth is not to say

But that's not what's happening here. The postmodernists are taking,
for example, the name of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and
claiming that that principle makes "everything relative", even though
the HUP doesn't apply in human-scale conditions, and not Heisenberg
nor any other mathematician or physicist has ever said it did. It is
an inappropriate leap by folks who hear "Uncertainty Principle" and
conclude that "Everything is relative". You might as well hear
"Everything is relative" and claim that therefore all sex is incest.
It's silliness.

Not "any critique" -- but certainly in those that say "Who gives a
damn if you know what you are saying!", or that claim the
scarification of the Yoruba which denotes social hierarchies is the
same kind of thing as the Euro-centric rationality in discussion
about whether there has been a significant change in the human
condition that justifies calling our time "postmodern" or not. We do
not lack for examples of irrationality in the utterances of the
advocates and defenders of postmodernism here.

Here is, I think, a good example:

On 6 Jun 2006 at 19:17, Warren Lloyd wrote:
"What is your rationality? Do you suppose the rationality of say, the
Yaruba tribe in Africa whose social hierarchies depend upon patterns
and depths of facial scaration, is the same as your seemingly Euro
centric rationality?"

If it's not an example of equating all narratives, on what other
grounds than that all narratives are equal would such a senseless
question be asked?

But the issue at hand in this discussion, starting with my exchange
with Alison Croggon, has been whether there is indeed something we
can identify as "the condition of postmodernity" at all. To ask about
the way a particular work responds to the condition of postmodernity
is to beg the question: it assumes that there is a condition of
postmodernity to respond to, and that is the question: is there such
a condition?

But that's not what's happening here. The postmodernists are taking,
for example, the name of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and
claiming that that principle makes "everything relative", even though
the HUP doesn't apply in human-scale conditions, and not Heisenberg
nor any other mathematician or physicist has ever said it did. It is
an inappropriate leap by folks who hear "Uncertainty Principle" and
conclude that "Everything is relative". You might as well hear
"Everything is relative" and claim that therefore all sex is incest.
It's silliness.

Not "any critique" -- but certainly in those that say "Who gives a
damn if you know what you are saying!", or that claim the
scarification of the Yoruba which denotes social hierarchies is the
same kind of thing as the Euro-centric rationality in discussion
about whether there has been a significant change in the human
condition that justifies calling our time "postmodern" or not. We do
not lack for examples of irrationality in the utterances of the
advocates and defenders of postmodernism here.

Dear Diary,

So last night I had a dream. I was walking across a bridge made out of film and
on the other side there were trees made out of paper with pages of poetry
hanging from the branches. Musical instruments were floating on the water,
while a grand piano thundered from the sky and a guitar string snapped like
lightning. Poets were walking around, and movie screens replaced each of their
faces. This all happened in what seemed like a technological jungle and
different medias blended to the point where one couldnt tell which form was
which. Then I saw a billboard that read:


HairFlip: A Multimedia Journal of Visual and Literary Arts is accepting
submissions for the first issue due in the summer of 2006. For the first issue,
we are leaving the theme entirely up to you and look forward to the
indeterminate outcome. We are currently seeking various writing including
poetry, prose, fiction/nonfiction essay, audiovisual works, paintings,

Lots of things being done, as they say. I'm getting
married in less than a month and this traveling is
getting, well, downright tiresome. I found myself
walking down this steep and rocky footpath, a route
one needs to travel when returning 'home'--and this
kind of walk might, but who knows, qualify for what I
believe is now called, extreme sports, or
idiocy--depending on one's alignment. I'd rather not
comment other than to say I was scared.

A friend has decribed me as timorous, a word not used
often these days, I think, but something learned byway
of archaic speech 101, the kind of thing Chinese
education ass jams into the minds of education-ed and
re-education-ed drones preparing to dine on democracy
movements and foreign dollars in that climb towards a
'peaceful and harmonious society,' as chummy Hu likes
to say often. And the Indian papers reported yesterday
that Google.com has been nixed in most outlets.
Google.cn, the bastardized version of the search
engine, a nice wad for Google ups that Chinese sensors
(and Reporters without Borders ranks China at around
48/49 countries for free speech, N. Korea is last)
hang round the belt like colostomy bag filled remnants
of human dignity--or, perhaps, a spike to be torn deep
into the mind of those who might dare to whimper--or
try to collect the most basic information contrary to
official all-encompassing and universal gov't reports
reported on state TV.

Some of my colleagues and some expats might disagree,
but then again, they occupy a very different caste in
China's hiearachy--and, too, they are caucasian. To be
frank, I could look like a lot of things: Turkish,
Latino, Saphardic, from far west of China. But I'm
glad these very same people honor me so, "because my
pronunciation and intellect is up to the [white middle
class] standard"--and, thankfully, I'm able to pass
without recollection of "double-consciousness." But I
digress, and this is all about hyporciry, which really
busts my political hemroid, and how middle class
liberalism has its limitations and enemies within.
Besides, my spelling is terrible!

Now, back to that story. So, I was hiking down and
about midway through I happened up the biggest damn
cows I'd ever seen, with horns, said the fisherman, as
big as Hemingway's marlin, and I, naturally, took a
start. Tried to navigate, can I say, around them to
the left, which was along a stone incline, and to the
right, which was a presipise, really, and it was dark,
and I'd had a nip with this Kashmiri named Babba [and
his story is IMPORTANT]. Now, just imagine, a footpath
about 1m wide, rocks on left, long Wyle E. Coyote drop
on right, night fall, feeling "light"--and what does
one do? Well, I tried my best to not be gored and so
managed to drop about 3m down to the right, off the
side, to where the path continued round. This wasn't a
climb down, nor a calculated effort to be sensitive to
those bovines, but rather was a fall. Kept thinking as
I dropped, "My face, it's gonna hurt, not my face. ANd
then, damn I like this shirt." Cut ups hands, forearm,
deep gash to my calf where I landed, bloody, no horns,
lots of pain. Then the thinking: "What kind of bugs do
I now need to worry about having contracted, with all
this domesticated animal pat everywhere"--and then,
"Whoa, the face is fine, the shirt, too!"

Taking the protest about "narrative" here first, and addressing the
protest about "rationality" next, different and equal are two
separate notions; a claim that things are different is not a claim
that they are not equal -- at least, not necessarily. I think in the
context of Lloyd's presentation it was clear that he was trying to
equate the two narratives. His tone and manner were emphatic that the
one narrative was as good as the other.

Robin Hamilton wrote:

If only -- but he wasn't comparing rationalities; he was comparing
the physical symbols of social hierarchy (or perhaps the social
hierarchy itself) on the one hand with a discussion about
postmodernism on the other. If he's not equating the two narratives,
the narrative of the social position created, according to Mr Lloyd,
on one's willingness to scar one's face, with the narrative of a
discussion of a literary term, then what _is_ he doing?

> Also he doesn't say that either one is better than the other or

Well, no one says that tribal scarification for social hierarchichal
purposes, and a discussion about the definition of a literary term
aren't different. The assertion Lloyd made was that the respective
rationalities and narratives are equal, as I understand it, however
different. What would be the point of an advocate of postmodernism
asserting differences where there are clear differences, if not to
try to make the claim of an underlying equality? One of the central
claims of postmodernism is that despite cultural differences we're
all human. Of course, that's nothing new -- and my point is just
that: that postmodern attempts to say that in spite of our
differences we're all human is point-blank evidence there has been no
postmodern paradigm shift. The notion that we're all human despite
our differences is simply not a new notion -- it's been around for
aeons.

Well, perhaps "postmodernism" is such an absurdity.

Yes, it appears that Alison Croggon and I were talking about this
kind of meaning of postmodern; she was arguing that there has been a
significant change in human nature that has resulted in postmodernism
and postmodern art -- and I was, and am, arguing that there has not
been.

In all the history of humanity there have always been new weapons
that were going to destroy life as we know it, and sometimes they
have. But, therefore, the notion that this new weapon is going to
destroy life as we know it is simply not the turning point Alison
Croggon and other defenders and advocates of "postmodernism" would
have it be. It's tediously common, and it's all happened before.
There is nothing new here, and certainly nothing that would justify a
reversion to the irrational.

And what would that reversion to the irrational entail, anyway, come
to think of it? What exactly are the postmoderns suggesting ought to
happen as a result of their falsely-perceived "turn"? To revert to
irrationality, to archaism, to primordial feelings, is to increase
the risk that some damned fool who accepted that it would be
thrillingly in fashion and postmodern to embrace his or her
irrational pirmordialism will say "Oh, to hell with it" and push the
button.

I simply don't understand the rush to embrace the very sorts of
things that have historically produced the longest and most brutal
kinds of conflicts: the zealotry and religiosity of the embrace of
the archaic, the primordial, the irrational, that postmodernism
preaches we ought to embrace. The embrace of the primordial, the
archaic, the irrational have all historically resulted in the worst
wars and atrocities. The notion that, once we have a really REALLY
poserful new weapon that we should therefore embrace the primordial
and the irrational seems ludicrously inappropriate  The postmodern
urge to embrace the primordial, the irrational, seems more like a
deliberate embarkation on a policy of suicide.

I don't see why a celebration of differences has to entail, for
postmodernists, an embracing of the primordial or the irrational. In
fact, it seems that a celebration of differences is what must be done
as the rational, reasonable thing to do, precisely so that we do not
destroy ourselves withn the mutually exclusive zealotry that human
beings have so often embraced before with the primordial and the
irrational.

I shaved my head five years ago -- in 2001 before 9/11 -- due to men's sudden
insistence on having a baby with me, men I had never met or drunk men I had
long known.  I had not been advertising to have a baby.  One of the drunk men,
now living the existence of a poet, called from San Francisco to say he would
take the plane to Minneapolis, do it, then leave me to raise the baby.  He was
driving taxi, something his ex-wife, another of my friends, had not liked in
him.  Another drunk one, a novelist (calling from MO.) wanted to spread his
superior genes with their single flaw or two to as many states as he could get
to.  He assumed my mother would pay for everything.  "Everything" means private
schools.  Well, she hadn't even paid for private schools with me, so I'm
really unemployed.  He was working.  Then a wealthy drunk poet (calling from NY)
called in for quintuplet boys to go with his three boys already.  "Girls then,"
I said.  "No," he said.

Perhaps if I had suddenly mated, just then, as a bald woman, with a man with
a shaved head, everything would have turned out okay.  I had been very
attracted to bald men -- even been engaged to one for years -- but he and I didn't
have a baby.  He had a baby with a woman he had never met before, while he was
at a music festival.  The baby was then adopted by rich, white people, a fact
that caused me to grow highly suspicious of the economics of having babies,
something I had not been in the past.

It was a Jamaican man, a steel drum player, as it turned out, who got the
thing started with me, when he rushed up to me at a bar, where I had stopped in
for exactly one drink (what I could afford), and said, "Have my baby."  We went
on two dates total with my hair still long.  (I must not have wanted a baby
so soon: at 39.)  On one of the dates, I had slathered myself with muscle rub
that had a menthol smell to it, so I smelled really awful and almost could not
eat.  The wisdom I got from this man:  "Never let anyone tell you you can't
have a baby until you're 52."

I feel egregiously misquoted here: nowhere did I say that "human nature",
whatever
that is, has changed. I _did_ argue that there has been a significant shift
of cultural perspective
in the past 50 years, especially in western culture, in large part because
we are capable of
- and are - destroying our global environment, and not only that, we are
aware that we can
do this. We have more culture and more historical knowledge available to us
than at any
time in history. There are more of us than ever before. &c. There is nothing
prescriptive about
this, only attempts to describe: I find it personally a fascinating, if
frightening, time to be alive.

I think Robert Musil was especially prescient about all this, and he has
much to say that's
interesting about this false binary between "rational" and "irrational",
which are very reductive
ways of thinking about thinking. He suggests there are other ways of
describing and experiencing
thought.  Fwiw, it seems to me that the most seriously irrational people
are those who claim the most bullish rationality, those of neo-con or
fundamentalist persuasions,
mirrors of each other's nationalistic aggressions, claiming nationalistic or
religious particularities
as universals. That seems to me a direct act of revulsion against the
complexities of modernity and
what might be called a postmodern phenomenon.

But I'm not arguing. I just don't like being misrepresented.

"Prevallet's third (and boldest) book of poems, SHADOW EVIDENCE
INTELLIGENCE, is a fierce and direct confrontation of political
insanity and poetic form. Drawing inspiration from the news, these
poems seek to create epiphany out of the fallacious, tormented, and
violent logic that is currently being used to justify war, injustice,
and torture. These poems bring together multiple frames of reference
that logically cannot add up to a single thought; they restore to
poetry the bold experimentation of form and content necessary to
imagine a saner world." --Sandy Schmitz

About Heretical Texts: This series aims to investigate and challenges
the assumption that poetry, as art and communication activity, is
political. Central to the Heretical Texts mission is a focused
imagining of 'political poetry' as a form of public intervention,
invention, and invocation that calls on language to call out a public,
a people.

I'm sorry you feel misquoted; certainly I'm not intending to misquote
you. This is the first appearance of the adjective "cultural" in your
claim, however. Before you were talking about the whole human race;
now you're talking about just a few people in just one culture.

The problem for postmodernism lies, however, in the problem that if
all cultures ought to be given equal weight in a multicultural view,
and all the various views within each culture, as well, then there is
nothing in the narrative about the atomic bomb by a few people in
just one culture to privilege it over the narrative of social
hierarchy by facial scarring among the Yoruba, or any other group
that does not share the postmodern view. Postmodernists are obliged,
by the terms of their own claim, to give the same weight to the any
view (for instance, that they're wrong simply because they  have
nothing like enough facial scars to make their opinion important)
that they give to their own. Yet at the same time, postmodernists
seem to feel pretty argumentative about their view being right!  If
that's postmodernism, it looks more like an intellectual shuffle than
a compelling world view.

It's not a "false binary" -- it is rather a binary of wide but not
universal applicability. The question isn't whether we should be
rational or irrational, as so many postmodernists seem to think, but
how we can be rational appropriately.

Furthermore, just by saying something is a "false binary" you
necessarily create a binary: the "real binaries" and the "false
binaries". How do you tell a real from a false binary?

I can agree that rationality can be misapplied, and one of the
prominent ways to do it is to do as you've suggested, claim
nationalistic or religious particularities as universals. Starting
from that agreement, though, is it possible that you can also agree
that rationality is not _prima facie_ a bad thing? That there is
appropriate rationality, inappropriate rationality, appropriate
irrationality, and inappropriate irrationality?

This, again, begs the question since it assumes the "postmodern
phenomenon" that it wants to conclude exists. The question remains
whether there is such a "postmodern phenomenon" or not. You must
define "postmodern" adequately, and use it consistently, or you have
to face the charge of being inappropriately irrational, and you can't
really claim to be saying anything of significance or importance in a
rational discussion.

Unless, of course, it is your view that discussions should be
irrational. In which case, let the flyting begin, eh?

If I am talking about Beckett or Genet, which in part I was, most
intelligent people would assume that I was speaking about something called
"culture". Do I have to point out that I'm talking about poetry if I mention
Yeats or Howe? I most certainly wouldn't be talking about anything so
dubious as a universal "human nature". It is late and I am tired and I
should not let myself be annoyed. I suggest you go and read Musil for some
elegant and subtle ratiocinations that are rather more interesting than your
limited conceptions of the rational and irrational.

Cheers

"all narratives are equal" was my misinterpretation of this article:

http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articleprint.php?num=45

and probably some other things I've picked up along the way. I could
well have screwed the terms up. I am not a qualified practitioner of
these black arts and it appears that I will stay that unless I learn
to substitute "epistomology" for "narrative". Apologies all round.

<QUOTE>
For a postmodernist, however, this modernist faith in science is only
a sign of Eurocentrism and cultural imperialism. For a postmodernist,
other cultures are under no rational obligation to revise their
cosmologies, or adopt new procedures for ascertaining facts to bring
them in accord with modern science. Far from producing a uniquely
objective and universally valid account of nature, the "facts" of
modern science are only one among many other ways of constructing
other "facts" about nature, which are equally valid for other
cultures. Nature-in-itself cannot be known without imposing
classifications and meaning on it which are derived from cultural
metaphors and models. All ways of seeing nature are at par because all
are equally culture-bound. Modern science has no special claims to
truth and to our convictions, for it is as much of a cultural
construct of the West as other sciences are of their own cultures.

This view of science is derived from a variety of American and
European philosophies of science, associated mostly with such
well-known philosophers as Thomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend, W.O Quine,
Ludwig Wittgenstein and Michel Foucault. This view of science has been
gaining popularity among Indian scholars of science since the infamous
"scientific temper" debates in early 1980s when Ashis Nandy, Vandana
Shiva and their sympathisers came out in defence of local knowledges
and traditions, including astrology, goddess worship as cure for
small-pox, taboos against menstruation and (later on) even sati. Over
the next two decades, it became a general practice in Indian scholarly
writing to treat modern science as just one way to adjudicate belief,
no different from any other tradition of sorting out truth from mere
group belief. Rationalism became a dirty word and Enlightenment became
a stand-in for "epistemic violence" of colonialism.
</QUOTE>

It seems to me that western science *has* some claims to the "truth",
or at least, a working set of truth, which includes the truth of
blowing up the world.

Neither do I believe that to criticize western rationality makes one
irrational. However, throwing around the keys to such a gee-whiz bang
box'o tricks doesn't seem to be a particularly bright idea.

but what I really don't get is why you turn to a quotation from somebody who
clearly despises postmodernism for definitions of postmodern?  Do you really
believe that an article claiming that the "postmodernist left" has paved the
way for religious fascisim is an ubiased source?

Lieber Marcus,

It is good that you have read a little McEvilley.

But, please, don't stop there. Keep on reading.  In fact, read this
[from the opening chapter of *Sculpture in the Age of Doubt* [1999:
Allworth Press]:

Preface:

"The present historical period is one that attempts to present itself as
somehow without boundaries and directions, yet nevertheless possessed of
a strong character.  This is not really unusual; it is characteristic of
periods that might be called ages of doubt, including periods embracing
a number of great philosophical traditions.  Still, to those who become
accustomed to the purposive and ideological age that seems to have
recently ended -- and that is commonly called "Modernism" -- the
condition of uncertainty feels bizarre."

The Barbarous Noise

    Modernism was what might be called an age of certainty, feeling
itself to be founded on universal truths and to grasp clearly the
direction in which they tended.  In contrast, the new age, with its
conspicuous lack of universals and directions, strikes many beholders as
confusing and undefined; so accustomed are they  to boundaries and
markers that without such indicators, they feel there is no frame for
meaning.  For them, the new age dawns with a sense of betrayal.  Their
attitude is exemplified by Bertrand Russell's remark in *The Will to
Doubt* that an outlook which does not recognize the objective existence
of an "ideal rationaity" is "very dangerous, and in the long run, fatal
to civilization.
    The most widely used name for this era is "post-Modernism" -- an odd
name because it does not seem  to refer to what the period is but what
it comes *after*.  Even the experts writing about it are apt to say that
they don't know what it means.  Surprisingly, it is often the advocates,
rather than the critics, of post-Modernism who claim  they are helpless
to undertand it.  They must espouse it, then. from a surfeit of the last
age -- a willingness to accept almost anything in preference to it.
This is because the last -- the Modernist -- age is widely perceived
today as having been a raw power trip that proceeded not only by
deceiving others but by self-deception.  Those who advanced the various
Modernist endeavors were really speaking of "contigency while believing
themselves to narrate necessity, of particular locality while believing
themselves to narrate necessity, of particular locality while believing
themselves to narrate univerality...."  Their obsession with
universality, certainty, and the absolute thinly disguised a manic
desire to control: "The target of certainty and of absolute truth was
indistinguishable from the crusading spirit and the project of domination."

Well, I don't have the time or interest to type out the footnotes here.
But, Marcus, I have taken the trouble to type this entry in so that you
can examine it and respond to it.  If you continue to insist that
McEvilley is not a post modernist, well, I think that there will be
other things that I can spend my time on, and you can keep on doing what
you have been doing on this list.

I won't bother you any more.

But if you are willing to recognize that McEvilley is in fact a culture
critic with greatest sympathy for this vague thing that we call post
modernism, then perhaps we can continue to converse.

I think that McEvilley is a lot less like you than you think

He is as post modern as Charles Olson was, as was suggested earlier.

Best, George


 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Also sprach Marcus Bales:

I've read McEvilley, and listened to him read on the web, too. He's
not a postmodernist -- he's a progressive liberal, much like me. His
view is not that the human condition has changed with the advent of
the atom bomb; his view is not that the human world view has changed
with the advent of some change in the human condition. He's using the
same old tools of rationality and the great liberal ideas that have
stimulated so much that's good in the world now. If you call
McEvilley a "postmodern" you might as well call John Stuart Mill one,
too -- and perhaps you do.

"Post-Modernism is a deeply revised attitude toward history that
attempts to separate it form the concept of providence, denies any
claims of inevitability, and aims at a multi-cultural solution to the
problem of history, rather than an imperialistic one. " -- McEvilley

Dear Michael,

Has the deadline passed for Fedora #3. At present,
I've been bogged down with work in Himalaya (if you
can believe it)--monsoons, sickness, ick and tat. I'd
like to submit some work. Your time will be sincerely
appreciated.

Regards,
Alex Jorgensen

An apology to the list. While I should be aware enough

again and again mess it all up. I hope Michael that my
last inquiry made its way to you.

Fair comment - to a certain extent. I never claimed that article as
defining pomo. Neither do I claim that pomo paves the way to a
theocracy: I said it "helped" pave the way. I think science studies
has muddied the waters to a considerable degree, and allowed
creationism as an epistomology a foot-hold where  it should have none.
However, sweeping aside criticism as "biased" seems to me to be the
wrong way to counter that criticism (it's almost the "Cartman
defence"). If that article has no validity, then I'm happy to hear the
reasons why.

Could we stir Sokal and Bricomart's +Intellectual Impostures+ into this mix?
They link (alternative chapters) an attack on postmodernism with an analysis
of scientific epistemology, the whole thing written from an +activist+
American Left stance (to a large degree explaining the ferocity of Sokal's
critique -- his big hero, as he makes plain, is Noam Chomsky).

Interesting that the only major figure to emerge unscathed is Foucault.

(I think there may also be a hint of the Institute of General Sematics in
the background, but I wouldn't go to the stake for this.)

Roger, have you read it?  What do you think of it?

"the plan is the body" Robert Creeley

"Emile Cioran, himself a crosser of linguistic boundaries (he was a  Rumanian
who wrote exquisite French prose), comments: "In a borrowed language,  you
are conscious of words; they exist not in you but outside of you. This  interval
between yourself and your means of expression explains why it is  difficult,
even impossible, to be a poet in another language besides your own.  How
extract a substance from words that are not rooted in you? The newcomer  lives on
the surface of language; he cannot, in a tongue belatedly learned,  translate
that subterranean agony from which poetry issues."

Hard evidence of a sort for this view comes from the cognitive  sciences.
Steven Pinker in The Language Instinct mentions an ingenious  experiment that
shows how early infants get attuned to their mother tongue. It  was found that
"four-day-old French babies suck harder to hear French than  Russian, and pick
up their sucking more when a tape changes from Russian to  French than from
French to Russian." This positive response to the mother-tongue  is due to the
fact that "the melody of mothers' speech carries through their  bodies and is
audible in the womb. The babies still prefer French when the  speech is
electronically filtered so that the consonant and vowel sounds are  muffled and only
the melody comes through. But they are indifferent when the  tapes are played
backwards, which preserves the vowels and some of the  consonants but distorts
the melody. Nor does the effect prove the inherent  beauty of the French
language: nonFrench infants do not prefer French, and  French infants do not
distinguish Italian from English." The inference is that  "The infants must have
learned something about the prosody of French (its  melody, stress and timing) in
the womb, or in their first days out of it."

The experiment demonstrates that one is most intimate with the lyric  genius
of one's mother tongue. It follows that poetry written in a language  other
than one's mother-tongue is not likely to be conspicuous for its  lyricism."

Translators are exceptional, are they not?

On eagerness  of suckling: a small caveat. There are lots of poets
who write in languages other than the one that came with mother's
milk. Is there an age limit? Armand Schwerner was exclusively
francophone until age 9, Reznikoff (I think--I'll stand correction)
heard primarily yiddish at home, Codrescu Romanian. How about Celan?
I could probably come up with a few more among us moderns. Charles
d'Orleans (contemporary of Chaucer) wrote lovely poetry in English
during his twelve years in captivity.

Somebody else should pick up this list.

And there's the question of dialect.

Two interesting experiments to try:
1. Have a nursing mother coo to her infant in a language she learned in school.
2. Have said mother coo in different languages, one for the left, one
for the right breast.

At what point would the milk curdle?

And (giggle giggle) the inevitable question: does it work with adults?

Anyone remember the Jamie Leigh Curtis role in A Fish Called Wanda?

Your earlier post appeared to take as accurate the article's summaries of
postmodernism, and thus read, to me at least, as a mode of argument from
authority.  My comment that the article was biased was not a sweeping aside of
criticism but rather an assertion that if our purpose is to find descriptions
of postmodernism to argue about we might do better to look at the desriptions
from writers such as Olson or Lyotard who were, albeit biased in different ways
themselves, attempting to describe what they saw as emergent phenomena rather
than, as the author of that article was doing, attempting to draw fatally
flawed cause and effect arguments their own dismissive versions of other
people's arguments --

I didn't say that you said that pomo paves the way for a theocracy -- I quoted a
passage in the article in which that writer makes such an argument


At leat two oddities about your assertion that science studies "helped" pave the
way for creationism to gain a foothold -- one is that the science studies you
seem to be talking about did not precede creationsim -- another is that most
proponents of creationsim take the same antipostmodernism stance that you take
-- I'm not arguing that you must be the friend of your enemy's enemies -- I'm
just not clear about how postmodern questioning of foundationalist arguments
and appeals to a transcendent  ideal realm of truth help  pave the way for
people who hold that postmodernism is absolute relativism and a denial of truth

just by way of reminder of how we got to this point:  I read here that
postmodernism claims that all narratives are equal.  As someone who has read
fairly extensively in the literature of postmodernism, I was a bit surprised by
this, never having encountered it as an assertion made by any proponents of
postmodern views.

But since I haven't read EVERYTHING, and could imagine that somenone somewhere
may have said such a thing under the guise of theorizing the postmodern, I
asked --

 Upon reading that article, I saw that it was not in fact any proponent of
postmodernism saying anything like "all narratives are equal," but was in fact
an attack upon theorists of postmodernism, creating a number of straw man
arguments.  So I asked as follows:

What I was arguing was that we shouldn't rely on assertions of what
postmodernism holds to be the case that come from a clearly biased source.
(there's plenty enough to argue about just in the differing views of the
postmodern we get from someone like Lyotard and someone who reads it as a
sypmtom, like Jameson, without going to someone like the author of this article
who can't be trusted to represent the arguments at issue.)  Basing a criticism
on a misrepresentation of the opposing view is indeed a straw man argument --
saying so is not "brushing aside" criticism, it is in fact pointing out one of
the flaws that invalidates the criticism, as you ask me to do --


that takes up my two post quota for the day, so I retire from the field --

watch my blog later this weekend for a brief accout of my trip to the drive-in
movies!

Mahmood Jaballah. Mohammed Majoub. Hassan Almrei. Mohamed Harkat. Adil
Charakaoui. You might not recognize these names, but you should. All five
men have been imprisoned for years at a time with no access to the charges
or the evidence against them. Two are now out on bail, complying with
severe restrictions, including in one case, being banned from speaking
Arabic. All five men could face deportation to countries where they will
be tortured. And this is happening in Canada-a country that prides itself
on promoting human rights and civil liberties.

The Secret Trial Five, as they are known, are all being held on "security
certificates"-a draconian measure introduced 20 years ago that allows
Canada to imprison non-citizens indefinitely without charges. Even the
detainees' lawyers are not allowed to see the evidence against their
clients. And what does it take to get an immigrant thrown in jail? Two
signatures-one from the immigration minister and one from the minister of
public safety, in this case, Stockwell Day. Yep, the same guy who has been
quoted saying he believes that the Earth is only 6,000 years old, and that
homosexuality is a "mental disorder that can be cured by counselling."
CSIS officials make their case behind closed doors, and two politicians
get to decide whether or not a person will have to endure years of
Kafkaesque hell.

So, why should queer people in Canada care about five Muslim men who have
been accused of terrorism? Some would argue that restrictions on human
rights are a necessary precaution, in the face of the Osama Bin Ladens of
the world. But according to Gary Kinsman, a sociology professor at
Laurentian University, Canadian gays and lesbians should be alarmed,
because the ways that Muslim men are being targeted by the RCMP and CSIS
mirrors the ways that gays were targeted in the 1960s and '70s. Kinsman
has studied the RCMP's surveillance of gays and lesbians in Canada. This
included the purging of thousands of queer people from the Canadian civil
service, and the use of the "fruit machine"-a device that was designed to
identify homosexuals by showing people pornography and measuring the
dilation of their pupils. The theory was that homosexuals were vulnerable
to blackmailing by Soviet agents, who could have extracted state secrets
by threatening to reveal their sexuality.

"It's important to remind people that lesbians and gay men were major
targets from 1958 onwards," says Kinsman. "The RCMP would go to community
organizations and ask about people's practices. They would harass people's
families. In the 1970s, the RCMP conducted pretty specific surveillance on
gay and lesbian organizations. At the first gay march in Ottawa in 1971,
the RCMP was watching. They targeted not just individuals, but entire
social movements. And people had no idea what evidence had been collected
about them."

According to In The Shadow Of The Law, a report published by the
International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, in "hundreds" of
instances, Arab and Muslim people in Canada "are being visited for
interviews by security forces without warrants, and taken away for
interrogation. Although the full extent of Bill C-36 [so-called
'anti-terror' legislation swiftly passed by Parliament in 2001] was not
implemented in these cases, it has been used as a threat to 'encourage'
voluntary interviews by citing the risk of preventative detention allowed
under the Act. Victims of such police conduct have been afraid to come
forward publicly for fear of further retaliation."

Some may not be surprised that Stephen Harper's government is unwilling to
repeal the most egregious elements of Canada's anti-terrorism legislation.
And the pressure from the US to join George Bush's War on Terror continues
to escalate. The US State Department's annual Country Report on Terrorism
called Canada a "safe haven" for Islamic terrorists, saying that political
fallout from the Maher Arar case has created a chill between Canadian and
US intelligence agencies.

Kinsman believes it's the increasing integration of Canadian and US
foreign policy that leaves us vulnerable to terrorism, not the imagined
actions of individual Arab and Muslim immigrants. He cites Canada's
newfound role in Afghanistan and the logistical and material support that
Canada is providing to the US occupation of Iraq.

Kinsman rejects the notion that immigrants should be the targeted,
especially in those cases involving security certificates, where the
government hasn't been required to produce one shred of evidence to
support the (top secret) charges being levelled at Jaballah, Majoub,
Almrei, Harkat and Charakaoui.

"We should remember that until 1976, it was illegal for lesbians and gay
men to immigrate to Canada," said Kinsman. "If gays and lesbians have
learned anything about our history, we should stand in solidarity with the
people who are being targeted today."

And despite the millions of dollars spent and thousands of lives ruined by
the RCMP's campaign against homosexuals, not one confirmed case of Soviet
blackmail ever emerged.

This month, the Supreme Court of Canada will be hearing Adil Charakaoui's
appeal of his detention, ruling on whether or not security certificates
are constitutionally valid. Let's not leave it to future historians to
condemn security certificates as a black mark against Canada's human
rights record.

Hi, I'm new to the list, but this conversation has been fascinating reading for a first timer, I just wanted to chime in with a couple of points that
the discussion has raised for me:

1.) Criticism's of "Postmodernism" that represent "Postmodernism" as an ideology with identifiable values and tenets often miss the boat as, on the
one hand, it misses the semantic distinction between postmodern philosophy and postmodern literature, not to mention their bastard child in postmodern
critical theory. Postmodern philosophy, as a grouping, really only makes sense as the other half of modernist philosophy, the point being, at the
beginning of the twenty first century in the world of philosophy there are currently groups of people who take as a jumping off point on questions of
epistemology the British empiricists, the logical positivists, and/or Wittgenstein. These philosophers, the modernists who are also known as
"analytic" philosophers because they work in a tradition largely influenced by the Cambridge philosophers of the last century (Russell, Moore, Ramsey,
Ayer, Ryle), who, after Frege, felt that the whole game of philosophy was to get the answer through logic and the analysis of syntax and semantics. On
the Other hand, Postmodernists follow in the tradition of the continental rationalists, nietzche, Hegel, and/or Heidegger and from them grew out not
just the existentialists, but the structuralists, post-structuralists, and "Postmodernists" like Lyotard. What's truly the most interesting aspect of
this distinction from the point of view of a poetics is that the differences between modernist and postmodernist philosophy is primarily a stylistic
and methodological one as opposed to  real differences in thought. The various camps, generally, don't even talk about the same things, and it's only
when generally less well informed lights try to bring to bear the arguments of one camp on the positions of the other (in the process taking all sorts
of things grossly out of the context within which they are meaningful) that problems occur. These problems of course, are not real, and generally the
criticisms one sees as a result, alan sokal's naive popperism in response to science studies, are little more than tilting at windmills. For more on
that phenomenon, see Gabriel Stolzenberg's various commentaries on "The Science Wars" here: http://math.bu.edu/people/nk/rr/

2.) One thing that I think one can be fairly critical of is the application of the work of various postmodern philosophers in various jargon fueled
and specious ways by, generally, students and professors engaged in fairly woolly disciplines. While one hesitates to go so far as to criticize the
existence of such programs, generally speaking it is difficult to tell what specific sort of training goes on in English departments, ethnic studies
departments, gender studies departments, or comp lit departments that qualifies their graduates to hold forth on matters relating to science, logic,
philosophy, mathematics, the history of science, history, and sociology. Which is to say that I think the broad reach of various forms of literary
criticism has in a lot of cases confused various critics into thinking that their purview is something beyond textual analysis and i think that a lot
of people who've spent a lot of time studying and developing expertise in other disciplines rankle when they get criticized by folks who really don't
know what they're talking about. In response, they, like Alan Sokal and various other outsider critics of "Postmodernism" turn not on the uninformed
mediocre lights spitting jargon at them in a meaningless way, but rather to the sources, possibly quite honestly in the naive hope that they will
discover what it is that these people are talking about so that they can respond in kind. What they encounter, of course, is largely a bunch of
semiotic theory or linguistics that doesn't in any way relate to empirical science or mathematics or history or whatever, and which, naturally, they
as people who are not well versed in that sort of thing, looks like total gibberish. So, combined with the gibberish-as-accident here and the abject
gibberish spewed by the mediocre lights of other depts at the Uni, these people, being rational if maybe a little arrogant in their expertise,
conclude that the whole field of "Postmodernism," which label they apply because they can't find anything else that fits and it looks like a word that
describes an ideology, as nonsensical and counter-productive.

3.) and this is the short point, sorry to go on at such length in my first post, what's really interesting is when people actually do the work to be
versed in the various fields. People like Hilary Putnam or Umberto Eco, or even Gabriel Stolzenberg, who commit to doing the reading and understanding
the various fields and arguments without allowing personal ideologies to influence their attempt to understand the Other. Interesting synthetic ideas
come out of this sort of inquiry and i think from a poetics standpoint, particularly when it comes to the sort of envelope pushing that more avantist
American poets get up to, that can only be a good thing. What's required, really, is the subjugation of the us or them impulse and allowing
intellectual curiosity to be ones guide. Given the current state of things, i think the world could do with a lot more intellectual curiosity.

thanks,

Only to the extent I will ask a question that others might wish to
answer.  Joseph Conrad.  Reportedly English was not his second but his
third language.  The order was Polish, French, finally English.  Well,
this is not a question...maybe.  When could he have learned English with
such fluency?  He was 36 when Almayer's Folly was published.  Mastery of
a language does not just happen?

He'd been sailing on primarily English ships and living in an English
speaking environment from the age of 18. And there was exposure at
home--his father was a translator of Shakespeare into Polish. Plus he
was brilliant, and he read a lot. Til the day he died, however, he
spoke with a heavy accent.

In a largely forgotten novella, "Amy Foster," Conrad expresses his
fears about what being a foreigner in England felt like. The
eponymous heroine, in an isolated village in The Wash marries a
foreign, non-anglophone sailor who washes ashore one night. Gradually
she adopts the fears and prejudices of the other villagers. I'll go
no further--it's too good a story to explain away--one of his best.

Just curious as to whether this issue was resolved on
this list. I think it's important to speak Spanish,
personally, certainly more than, say, Chinese or
German, and certainly in the context of long-term
relations among the Americas. To be multilingual (to
whatever extant) would be great, too.

I wonder, however, and this is a sincere question, how
attempts at assisting immigrants, children of
immigrants, Americans with whatever challenges
(income, cultural)at learning English well are coming
along? I ask because outside of the US, there seems to
be a consensus that speaking English well, if one
wants to be mobile, have much of a chance of
competing, is required. And this would certainly seem
important for any nation where English is not
secondary. (Additionally, quite the industry has
developed in Latin America, Asia, Europe around this
model).

French? Well, and while I have no problem whatsoever
with France in general, and I do much admire the
culture, their imprisonment of Tom Paine
notwithstanding, I think it best to ask the Europeans
(and they will, most probably, laugh).

Please backchannel me on this if time permits. I would
be very interested.

I have it in my sweaty paws. All good knockabout stuff. I'm not sure
Foucault comes away clean - the few time he's mentioned is when he's
declaring Deleuze to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.
However, I think a rapprochement is over-due, or one side cries
"civilisation!!!"

I've been having a running argument hereabouts wherein I've,
ironically given my posts here, been defending pomo philosophy,
arguing that the current anglo-saxon science establishment is closed
and that, at some stage, scientific thought will have to come to grips
with the fruits of post-modernism, whatever they are[1].  I have
argued with the mysogynists hereabouts that a feminine science might
come up with different answers, althought it's hard to see how:

F=ma
E=mc(sqr)
area of a circle = pi times radius squared

could be vastly different under any alternate system (although that's
an unprovable assertion). I can see what is meant by women probably
handling the maths of flow dynamics better however, the Navier-Stokes
equation look just plain hard for anyone ... although of course you
could set up an experiment to test the assertion.

Reading other reactions to my emails, it seems that "oh, they don't
understand us" seems to be the defence of the day. Oh, poor you.

As for science studies: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_studies
wherein Foucault gets a mention.I leave it up to better minds than
mine to decide whether or Science Studies is a "proper", "legitimate"
branch of pomoism, although "social construction of knowledge" gets
mentioned a lot in relation to Science Studies.

Enter Steve Fuller, who claims not to be a pomoist, but to be living
in the post-modern condition, thus neatly avoiding having to define
himself.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Fuller_%28social_epistemologist%29

He testified as an expert witness defending Intelligent Design in the
Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case.

However, his position seems to be very close to Paul Feyerabend, who -
correct me if I'm wrong here - seems to argue for a democritisation of
epistomologies.

Amusingly, Paul Feyerabend wrote: "We have learned that there are
phenomena such as telepathy and telekinesis which are obliterated by a
scientific approach and which could be used to do research in an
entirely novel way (earlier thinkers such as Agrippa of Nettesheim,
John Dee, and even Bacon were aware of these phenomena)."
(http://www.galilean-library.org/feyerabend1.html) What-evah, dude. My
thanks to Aldon for introducing me to a genuinely new form of
entertainment. Farewell to reason indeed.

Of course, he doesn't actually *defend creationism, however, and this
is where I scratch my head a bit, it does appear to encourage thoughts
that creationism may spring from an epistomology which is to be taken
seriously and valid. Intelligent Design certainly post-dates PF's
assertions. And PF seems to be a paid-up member of the pomo club,
although maybe his membership has expired?

[1] I have seen some naughty people actually questioning the
acheivements of theorists. Maybe to have a theory is acheivement
enough?

Re +Intellectual Impostures+ (which has a different title in the States,

Neat way of putting it.

Well, it was mutual -- Deleuze after all did say the last millenium would be
seen as the Age of Foucault, and wrote his biography (which I have on my
shelves but not yet read).  Mibee perhaps interesting, given the activist
Left subtext of +Intellectual Impostures+, that Foucault is the only one of
the usual suspects that Noam Chomsky has any time for.  (Me too, to
acknowledge my prejudices.)

I rather like Delueze -- mad as a kite but with a nice line in images --
those rhyzomes!  The Sage of Raynes Park no doubt reads him on his
allotment.  Otherwise, I have to say I'm unremittingly neanderthal when it
comes to the pomo Literary Critical branch of postmodernism (to follow Jason
Quackenbush's useful distinction).  I get on a bit with New Historicism
(which isn't in my book postmodern -- the Brit side comes out of Lever's
+Tragedy of State+) which I had to, once working in the Renaissance.  But as
for Derrida ...  I once obtained a doctor's note saying I was medically
excused from having to read him.

I kinda think we ought to draw a distinction between the epistomology of
science and the epistomology of mathematics -- pi is definitely the later,
E=mc(sqr) maybe on the boundary.

It always irritates me, on the same lines that the statement, "Humanity is
descended from the apes" irritates me -- we're descended from a common
ancestor, monkeys are our cousins, not our grandfathers -- to be told that
Newton was proved wrong by Einstein.  Load of bullshit.  Newtonian physics
was redefined as a subset of a larger physics, and still has an "absolute
truth" in its own frame.

And Newtonian physics is probably more mathematics than science.  Equally,
moving deeper into pure math, Euclid has lasted even longer and never been
disproved, but became a subset of a larger mathematics about the same time
as Newton was put in his place.

I'm trying to remember what Sokal and Bricmont say about Feyerabend -- I
think they see him as a hard rather than a soft epistomological relativist.
Sloppy misquote, but I can't put my hand on +II+ to check the terms they
actually use.

I found the chapters on scientific epistemology a damn sight easier to
understand than the chapters on postmodernism, and also more interesting.
Really, all I got from the pomo slagging was a good laugh, but on occasions
found it as hard for me to get my head round as pomo itself.

'Nuff.

Very interesting post, and I suppose useful within the discussion,
but sort of like making careful distinctions between kinds of cargo
cults, isn't it?

I just read the following description for a Brazil conference (this
apparently must have just happened) on Charles' website. I think it bears
repeating in and of itself - and the question to Charles of whether the
papers from the international cast of participating poets will be published=
,
etc??

Poetry in a Time of War and Banality
International Meeting
Curators: R=E9gis Bonvicino & Alcir P=E9cora

Proposal=20
The twentieth century appears to have bestowed on us a legacy of constant
and seemingly irreparable disaster. It left us with the aporia that poetry,
as the synthesis of intellectual and creative activity, has become incapabl=
e
of dealing with stupidity and barbarism. This is evident in the Nazi and
Fascist crimes as well as in the institutionalization of economic violence
in a world that is becoming both global and disorganized at the same rate,
with catastrophic consequences in the form of local, ethnic conflicts moved
by hate, sectarianisms, and private tragedies. What remains of the
nationalist projects has become a strategy to strengthen corporate
interests; at the same time, internationalism, rather than opening up to
pluralistic and democratic human experiences, has boiled down to a strategy
of exploitation=8Beconomic, touristic, and for the sake of legitimizing racia=
l
and social prejudices.

In the beginning of this century, a new form of such violence has begun to
emerge, one derived precisely from its continued existence: it is the
muffling, the dampening down of the scene of destruction. An impotent
creation --lagging behind technology, the market and a voracious media and
communications industry, lacking any political impact or liberating
aesthetic--, it survives by shrinking poetic goals or the audience for
poetry. Skepticism vis-=E0-vis revolutionary transformation, the consistency
of the avant-gardes or ideological dogmatism has not resulted in actions
that are freer, as we would like to think, but, instead, has given us a mor=
e
garrulous production in increasingly homogeneous environments. Joint
property of peers, corporate genre practices=8Ball these fragment and render
poetic production banal. Parochial activity takes offence at criticism and
debate. Condescendence, lack of courage, a pact of peers, mutual forgivenes=
s
make evident the scant seriousness accorded to poetry, as well as the
disbelief in its transformative power. But what type of real production
could relinquish the power to transform?

An impressive consequence of that legacy of catastrophic continuities (whic=
h
precisely dampens down and absorbs disaster as a normal occurrence) is the
conformity poetry displays vis-=E0-vis an average production. In that
environment, writing becomes an inconsequential habit, a " hobby"=8Bi.e., a
activity of one's childhood or youth and that one abandons upon reaching
adulthood, or that is continued merely as a weekend activity--, or instead,
a professional occupation, as any other, a modest way to earn a living
alongside other editorial or university-teaching tasks. In such times, ther=
e
is no more reason to expel the poets from the Republic --as Plato would hav=
e
it=8Bwhich does not mean a lack of spiritual progress: apparently, no poet is
perceived as dangerous anymore, as incongruous or rapturous, to the point o=
f
affecting the disorderly order of contemporary uncivil life.

How to respond to such a lack of vision and of urgency peculiar to poetry, =
a
realm that by definition is hostile to mediocrity? How to resist that
barbarian shrinking of horizons, proportional to the redundant proliferatio=
n
of garrulous writing? Or, at least, how to denaturalize disaster and
reconquer the pain emerging from it? Can poetry still be more than an
affirmation of frivolity, arrivisme, and intellectual affectation or --on
the opposite end of the spectrum-- of loutish modesty and a hopeless
remainder? If we don't already have plans for the future, it's important to
say that the present also does not belong to us: the dampening down of
expectations produces indifference, alienation and routine, not the
enjoyment of a pleasant life. What can poetry do against this state of
things which seems to have no end? And if it can do nothing, can it be more
than frivolity?=20

Along those lines, I'd like to mention Samuel Beckett.
 He wrote much of his best work in French.

The idea that someone who has not heard a language
from the womb to adulthood should be a prerequisite to
being a poet is idiotic.  A baby responds to the voice
of its mother regardless of the language.  A poet can
write a poem in any language.  Somebody could know two
words in a language and write a poem in it (if they
were the right two words).

English is my first language, but I've studied French
& German, lived in Germany, and am now studying
Ojibwe.  Through my ancestors I feel a strong
connection to the German language, perhaps hearing my
grandparents when in the womb or during childhood.
But, so far, learning Ojibwe has been a profound
experience.

From my point of view, European languages like
English, French, German and Spanish, though adopted by
many people living in the Americas, will always be
colonial languages and thus necessarily foreign, just
like dandelions are plants foreign to the Americas.
They may thrive here, but we should recognize their
origins.  There should be special recognition to all
the indigenous languages of the Americas -- Ojibwe,
Dakota, Mvskoke, Navajo, and on and on -- and they
should be actively studied and preserved, and most
importantly used as often as possible.  Then, instead
of being choked out by weeds, perhaps the indigenous
languages can thrive like potatoes and tomatoes.

I made fun of the original post. But to be fair, the post referred to
"the lyric genius of one's mother tongue." Suppressing the gag
reflex, it would seem that the author was limiting poetry to a
particular kind of poetry, the lyric, or even "one's native woodnotes
wild," and was definitely not talking about prose, where the
distancing that Cioran mentions usually comes into play for native
and foreigner alike, because most prose attempts to express or
explain something other than itself.

A problem with the experiment is that French mothers don't speak
French as such to their infants any more than English mothers speak
English to theirs--the rhythms of their speech are in fact quite
different from the language used between adults (except in bed) and
tend to be similar in all languages. Apparently it's instinctive to
croon to babies.

Do bottle-fed poets write formulaically?

. . . different from the language used between adults (except in bed) and
tend to be similar in all languages . . . Do bottle-fed poets write
formulaically?

Non-scientific generalities, but humorous. What is obvious to me is that
children grow in the womb hearing bed language as well. They recognize their
parents from their voices.

More to the point was this Bangladeshi poet asking why he should* write in
English. He was fortunate enough to be comfortable in three languages as I
recall, but had to work harder to convey artistic elements in English,  which
previously was primarily an academic language for him. I greatly  appreciate his
"nature" poem about the lonely park bench. An authentic  experience translates
well into any language.

Not non-scientific in the least. Subject of many studies.

The impact of mother-infant language should be on poetry written in babytalk.

I think Cioran was talking about poetry that doesn't convey an
experience but is.

About Heretical Texts: This series aims to investigate and challenge
the assumption that poetry, as art and communication activity, is
political. Central to the Heretical Texts mission is a focused
imagining of 'political poetry' as a form of public intervention,
invention, and invocation that calls on language to call out a public,
a people.

I guess it depends on what you value in discourse. I find it useful and interesting to try to understand what people are saying when their utterances
sound nonsensical. Particularly when they think what they are saying is meaningful. At the same time, using your cargo cults analogy, philosophically
speaking I've got more of a beef with the naive metaphysical realism of people like Alan Sokal than I do with a feminist philosopher of science like
Lynn Hankinson, although i think both of them have some pretty wacky ideas, i also think both points of view are worth considering and understanding
from the context within which they present themselves.

Dear Mark & List,

I also have misgivings about this experiment and the conclusions that Pinker draws from it. Pinker is smart and entertaining, but he is also a Chomsky epigone and an American, which means  that he has at least two problems with multilingualism: one is theoretical; the other is  cultural.

I think that it is generally recognized by linguists that American monolingualism is an anomoly, and not at all the norm.  Chomsky's various programs for linguistics tend to dismiss multilingualism as a surface feature, not deep.  But in a multilingual Europe or a multilingual India, for example, one can find numerous examples of writers with literary skill in two or more languages.  Another example that immediately comes to mind for me is Nabokov.

And in Europe for centuries going back to Dante there have been writers who could perform equally well in their vernacular language as well as in Latin, and in India writers who did the same in their vernacular as well as in Sanskrit.

There's an entertaining book by Richard Watson, an American novelist as well as a well-known specialist in Cartesian philosophy and Descartes.  It's called *The Philosopher's Demise*.  It recounts his huge embarrassment as an American academic of enormous reputation in French scholarship.  But he was incapable of delivering a paper orally on Descartes in French.  His spoken French was unbearable to the French.  The book is a chronicle of his failures as a speaker of French, although he has written with greatest erudition about Descartes' French.

On the other hand, many very mediocre as well as rather good European scholars of, say, Sanskrit, can switch between a half dozen languages at a conference.  But their written articles, in English for reasons of accessibility and distribution, are uniformly atrocious.  One of my present, summertime, gigs is editing a Buddhist Sanskrit grammar by a Russian Jewish emigre now in France writing in English. It is not a very pretty sample of multicultural literacy.

But in fact such a thing exists far more widely outside the US.  How many list members who translate Spanish poetry into English feel that their Spanish is as good as their English?

Best,
George

On eagerness  of suckling: a small caveat. There are lots of poets
who write in languages other than the one that came with mother's
milk. Is there an age limit? Armand Schwerner was exclusively
francophone until age 9, Reznikoff (I think--I'll stand correction)
heard primarily yiddish at home, Codrescu Romanian. How about Celan?
I could probably come up with a few more among us moderns. Charles
d'Orleans (contemporary of Chaucer) wrote lovely poetry in English
during his twelve years in captivity.

Somebody else should pick up this list.

And there's the question of dialect.

Two interesting experiments to try:
1. Have a nursing mother coo to her infant in a language she learned in school.
2. Have said mother coo in different languages, one for the left, one
for the right breast.

At what point would the milk curdle?

And (giggle giggle) the inevitable question: does it work with adults?

Anyone remember the Jamie Leigh Curtis role in A Fish Called Wanda?

How racism has invaded Canada

What is the term 'brown-skinned' doing on the front page of a major
Canadian daily?

By Robert Fisk - 10 June 2006



http://news.independent.co.uk/world/fisk/article754394.ece">


http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article13575.htm


This has been a good week to be in Canada -- or an awful week, depending
on your point of view - to understand just how irretrievably biased and
potentially racist the Canadian press has become. For, after the arrest
of 17 Canadian Muslims on "terrorism" charges, the Toronto Globe and
Mail and, to a slightly lesser extent, the National Post, have indulged
in an orgy of finger-pointing that must reduce the chances of any fair
trial and, at the same time, sow fear in the hearts of the country's
more than 700,000 Muslims. In fact, if I were a Canadian Muslim right
now, I'd already be checking the airline timetables for a flight out of
town. Or is that the purpose of this press campaign?

First, the charges. Even a lawyer for one of the accused has talked of a
plot to storm the Parliament in Ottawa, hold MPs hostage and chop off
the head of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Without challenging the
"facts" or casting any doubt on their sources -- primarily the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police or Canada's leak-dripping Canadian Security
Intelligence Service (CSIS) -- reporters have told their readers that
the 17 were variously planning to blow up Parliament, CSIS's
headquarters, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and sundry other
targets. Every veiled and chadored Muslim woman relative of the accused
has been photographed and their pictures printed, often on front pages.
"Home-grown terrorists" has become theme of the month -- even though the
"terrorists" have yet to stand trial.

They were in receipt of "fertilizers", we were told, which could be
turned into explosives. When it emerged that Canadian police officers
had already switched the "fertilizers" for a less harmful substance,
nobody followed up the implications of this apparent "sting". A Buffalo
radio station down in the US even announced that the accused had
actually received "explosives". Bingo: Guilty before trial.

Of course, the Muslim-bashers have laced this nonsense with the usual
pious concern for the rights of the accused. "Before I go on, one
disclaimer," purred the Globe and Mail's Margaret Wente. "Nothing has
been proved and nobody should rush to judgment." Which, needless to say,
Wente then went on to do in the same paragraph. "The exposure of our
very own home-grown terrorists, if that's what the men aspired to be,
was both predictably shocking and shockingly predictable." And just in
case we missed the point of this hypocrisy, Wente ended her column by
announcing that "Canada is not exempt from home-grown terrorism". Angry
young men are the tinderbox and Islamism is the match.

The country will probably have better luck than most at "putting out the
fire", she adds. But who, I wonder, is really lighting the match? For a
very unpleasant -- albeit initially innocuous -- phrase has now found
its way into the papers. The accused 17 -- and, indeed their families
and sometimes the country's entire Muslim community -- are now referred
to as "Canadian-born". Well, yes, they are Canadian-born. But there's a
subtle difference between this and being described as a "Canadian" -- as
other citizens of this vast country are in every other context. And the
implications are obvious; there are now two types of Canadian citizen:
The Canadian-born variety (Muslims) and Canadians (the rest).

If this seems finicky, try the following sentence from the Globe and
Mail's front page on Tuesday, supposedly an eyewitness account of the
police arrest operation: "Parked directly outside his ... office was a
large, gray, cube-shaped truck and, on the ground nearby, he recognized
one of the two brown-skinned young men who had taken possession of the
next door rented unit..." Come again? Brown-skinned? What in God's name
is this outrageous piece of racism doing on the front page of a major
Canadian daily? What is "brown-skinned" supposed to mean -- if it is not
just a revolting attempt to isolate Muslims as the "other" in Canada's
highly multicultural society? I notice, for example, that when the paper
obsequiously refers to Toronto's police chief and his reportedly
brilliant cops, he is not referred to as "white-skinned" (which he most
assuredly is). Amid this swamp, Canada's journalists are managing to
soften the realities of their country's new military involvement in
Afghanistan.

More than 2,000 troops are deployed around Kandahar in active military
operations against Taleban insurgents. They are taking the place of US
troops, who will be transferred to fight even more Muslims insurgents in
Iraq.

Canada is thus now involved in the Afghan war -- those who doubt this
should note the country has already shelled out $1.8bn in "defense
spending" in Afghanistan and only $500m in "additional expenditures",
including humanitarian assistance and democratic renewal (sic) -- and,
by extension, in Iraq. In other words, Canada has gone to war in the
Middle East.

None of this, according to the Canadian foreign minister, could be the
cause of Muslim anger at home, although Jack Hooper -- the CSIS chief
who has a lot to learn about the Middle East but talks far too much --
said a few days ago that "we had a high threat profile (in Canada)
before Afghanistan. In any event, the presence of Canadians and Canadian
forces there has elevated that threat somewhat." I read all this on a
flight from Calgary to Ottawa this week, sitting just a row behind Tim
Goddard, his wife Sally and daughter Victoria, who were chatting gently
and smiling bravely to the crew and fellow passengers. In the cargo hold
of our aircraft lay the coffin of Goddard's other daughter, Nichola, the
first Canadian woman soldier to be killed in action in Afghanistan.

The next day, he scattered sand on Nichola's coffin at Canada's national
military cemetery. A heartrending photograph of him appeared in the Post
-- but buried away on Page 6. And on the front page? A picture of
British policemen standing outside the Bradford home of a Muslim "who
may have links to Canada". Allegedly, of course.

Sure, that can be interesting, and useful in a sort of narrow way, I
guess, but still, cargo cults are cargo cults.

Considering and understanding pretty wacky points of view from the
context within which they present themselves can be useful, I
suppose, and no doubt interesting, but, especially when considered
from the larger context than that within which they present
themselves, pretty wacky is still pretty wacky.

In human history there have been all sorts of pretty wacky ideas, but
the most common of them may be fairly called examples of "sympathetic
magic": sticking pins in dolls to try to hurt other people, or
dancing and shouting to scare demons out of sick peoples=B4 bodies, and
the like. The notion of testing to see if the idea worked, and if it
didn=B4t work, to try something else, seemed more honored in the breach
than in the observance, if it was thought of at all.

But gradually, through a concatenation of circumstances and a great
deal of time and some significant successes, enough people accepted
the idea that observing the world, making hypotheses about it,
controlling for variables, and then testing those hypotheses, re-
examining the variables and the controls for those variables, and
modifying those hypotheses and controls, and testing again, worked,
that it became a practice generally accepted as worth the time and
materials that went into it.

Still today, as you point out, most people in what purports to be our
scientific society believe an enormous number of things that science
holds to be nonsense.  It=B4s hard to believe how much junk belief
there is out there, and how much of it is based on junk science, and
why.

Why is easy:  it=B4s difficult and expensive to do good science, to
hypothesize, control for variables, and design tests that test for
the thing one is testing for.  But junk science is easy:  it=B4s almost
as easy as sympathetic magic -- in fact, some of it is no better.

The difference between magic and science is that science demands that
you should report everything about your test of your hypothesis that
you think might make it wrong -- not only what you think is right
about it. You must search for, and present as part of your
conclusions, other causes that could possibly explain your results,
including the things you thought that you've eliminated by controls,
or by some other experiment, and how they worked -- to make sure
people who are following your work can tell that variables have been
eliminated, or at least controlled or accounted for.

You have to go into the details that could cast doubt upon your
conclusions. It=B4s of the essence that you do the best you can to
explain why things didn=B4t turn out the way you thought they would, if
they didn=B4t -- even if the variance is pretty small, and why they
did, if they did, even if just barely. Not only that, but when you
hypothesize, it=B4s not enough to hypothesize within a small ambit; you
have not only to explain how your hypothesis and test explains one
thing, you have to show how it fits in with other larger hypotheses,
and how it throws some light on how those things work, too.

The notion of science is to make sure that everyone who may look at
your work has every chance to judge your work fairly and justly --
that they have no doubt that your work is designed to investigate
what really happens, and not merely argue self-interestedly for a
particular result.

Contrast this idea with salesmanship. There=B4s a famous example of a
salmon-canner who was canning perfectly good salmon, but the flesh of
that fish was white instead of the traditional pink. Consumers were
not buying it in droves, because they expected canned salmon to be
pink. So the white-salmon canner changed the label on his can to
include the phrase "Guaranteed not to turn pink in the can", and
almost overnight pink salmon was almost unsellable. The pink-salmon
canners sued. The white-salmon canner claimed he was telling the
truth -- and he was. But the thing he was implying by telling his
small truth was not true at all. It=B4s not enough to tell the truth;
you have to tell the truth in context.

It=B4s not just that the truth will come out, eventually, either - it=B4s
not because other people will try to repeat your experiment, and
praise you if you were right, or expose you if you were wrong; it=B4s
the context in which you were right or wrong that makes an
investigation scientific or not. Natural phenomena will agree or
disagree with your hypothesis -- but it is the integrity with which
you create your controls for variables, and with which you examine
your own results before you make your conclusions, an extreme care
not to fool yourself, that makes it science instead of cargo-
cultishly carving headphones out of coconut shells, and antennae out
of wood.

The first principle of the scientific method is not to fool yourself,
and the second is that you are the easiest person for you to fool, so
be very very careful. The best result of the scientific method is
that if you are careful not to fool yourself, you won=B4t be trying to
figure out how to fool other people. That particular kind of
integrity, scientific integrity, the attempt to show how you yourself
may be wrong, is the essence of the scientific method. If you put
forward results that make sense not only within the context within
which they present themselves, but also in the context of how
everything else works, and your results shed some small light on how
everything else works, you can think of yourself as a scientist. But
if you are only interested in pointing at results that make you look
good, or that support your conclusions merely within some narrow
context, you can think of yourself as a salesman, even if you are
talking about literary theory or a philosophical idea, and that's
trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for
pool!

Postmodernism seems determined to reject the scientific method,
though, and turn back to relying on magical thinking. But I'll bet
not a single person on this list, however committed to postmodernism,
would give up his or her modernist health care plan in favor of a
postmodernist one that sneered at medicine in favor of sticking pins
in dolls -- not even if that postmodern plan were interesting in the
context within which sticking pins in dolls presented itself. Why,
I'll bet they all wash their hands after they go to the bathroom, and
before they eat, and so on! By golly, I imagine they even pay
attention to the expiration dates on their food packages, and even
lock up their poisons and guns to keep their children from playing
with them.  And, no doubt for the most part, obey the traffic laws
and have safe sex. I think that says a lot about the context in which
postmodernism presents itself.

Marcus,

Then surely you must appreciate the very friendly debate between Richard
Rorty and Daniel C. Dennett? Theirs is an authentic dialectic, but I'm  wondering
how it relates to poetics. Will this discussion about postmodernism  enable
us to write "bright" or "edgier" poetry? Is poetry held up to scientific
method or postmodern jargon? Both of these employ a philosophical stance which
denies they are intrinsically philosophical. I enjoy reading and writing poetry
that includes elements from both perspectives, not their  "truthiness."
Mary

Uh oh -- be very careful, here, Mary, or Alison will start calling
YOU names, too! Your question here is not only a very good one, it's
very close to mine: what does postmodernism, or the postmodern
condition, however the advocates and defenders of postmodernism
define those terms, get us in terms of poetry and poetics? What are
the characteristics of postmodern poetry, or even poetry in response
to the postmodern condition, that distinguishes it from other poetry?

I think the notion that there is any such thing as "postmodernism" or
"the postmodern condition" is a bunch of hooey because I think human
beings have not changed in any significant way in response to any
"turn" or "event" before which human beings were "modern" and after
which they are "postmodern". I also think that there is no general,
or western, cultural awareness of any such turn or event, not even
among the people who claim there is. I think postmodernism is a
pretty good marketing campaign. Further, I think that if there were
no "postmodernism" and it was posited on the internet as we know it
today the advocates and defenders of that "postmodernism" would be
derided as trolls and flamers -- trolls for the merely preposterous
provocation of their claims, and flamers for their behavior.

This is not to say that there aren't very smart people doing very
good work -- far from it -- but good work can't be postmodern by
definition, can it, since the point of postmodernism is that there
isn't any good work, there is only self-interested salesmanship of
one agenda, or bias, or another.

Within a world view that holds that there can be no good work, only
self-interested salesmanship, what do you expect to find? Why, an
enormous amount of self-interested salesmanship, of course -- what
else?

Once again, Faulconbridge, in Shakespeare's _King John_, demonstrates
the postmodernist view 400 years before anyone thought to call it
"postmodern":

Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
William Shakespeare (King John)

Faulconbridge:        Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
        John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
        Hath willingly departed with a part,
        And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
        Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
        As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
        With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
        That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
        That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
        Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
        Who, having no external thing to lose
        But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,
        That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
        Commodity, the bias of the world,
        The world, who of itself is peised well,
        Made to run even upon even ground,
        Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
        This sway of motion, this Commodity,
        Makes it take head from all indifferency,
        From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
        And this same bias, this Commodity,
        This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
        Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
        Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
        From a resolved and honourable war,
        To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
        And why rail I on this Commodity?
        But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
        Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
        When his fair angels would salute my palm;
        But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
        Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
        Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
        And say there is no sin but to be rich;
        And being rich, my virtue then shall be
        To say there is no vice but beggary.
        Since kings break faith upon commodity,
        Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.

Dear All,

Though summer in NYC seems to be pulling its punches so far, summer
poetry is showing no such restraint. We are starting up the
Vacation House season with two readers who will heat the late
spring damp out of your bones. Please come join us at the McNally
Roninson Bookstore, 50 Prince st. b/t Lafayette and Mulberry, at
7PM this Wednesday [6/14/06] for Drew Gardner and Corina Copp.

Corina Copp hails from Lawrence, KS; Boulder, CO; and New Orleans,
LA. She is most recently the author of Play Air (Belladonna* Books,
2005), and the e-book, Carpeted (Faux Press, 2004). Her poems and
reviews have appeared or are forthcoming from Fence, The Germ, The
Poetry Project Newsletter, Pom2,and Magazine Cypress. She is the
Monday Night Reading Series Coordinator at the Poetry Project at
St. Mark's Church, and lives in Brooklyn.

Drew Gardner is the author of Sugar Pill (Krupskaya 2002) and
Petroleum Hat (Roof 2005). He lives in New York City, where he edits
Snare magazine and teaches workshops at St. Mark's Poetry Project.
He conducts the Poetics Orchestra, an ensemble featuring poetry and
structured improvisation. His weblog, Overlap, was started in 2003.

See you there,
Cheers

To Poetics Poeple:

ANNOUNCING ESSAY PRESS:

Essay Press is a new imprint dedicated to publishing innovative,
explorative, and culturally relevant essays in book form.

We are interested in publishing single essays that are too long to be
easily published in journals or magazines, but too short to be
considered book-length by most publishers.  We are looking for essays
that have something to say?essays that both demand and deserve to
stand alone.  We particularly welcome work that extends or challenges
the formal protocols of the nonfiction essay?including, but not
limited to, lyric essays or prose poems, experimental biography and/or
autobiography, innovative approaches to journalism, memoir
(anti-memoir), experimental historiography, formally innovative
manifesots, political tracts, and/or aphoristic writing.

Essay Press is edited by Eula Biss, Stephen Cope, and Catherine
Taylor.  We are writers who do not share a single cohesive aesthetic,
but rather a dedication to publishing work that might not otherwise be
published.  We intend to produce an eclectic catalogue that will
include work by a few well-known writers as well as many new or
emerging authors.

We are presently accepting submissions of essays ranging from roughly
40 to 80 pages. Our submission guidelines are posted on our website at
www.essaypress.org.  Through that website, you can also join or
mailing list  to receive announcements of forthcoming books and other
news. Or, you may send submissions and/or queries to:

I think that's a pretty common, and generally untenable, viewpoint. I don't=
 want
to get too far off on a tangent, but re: this particular subject, that is
so-called "sympathetic magic," I highly recommend everyone read Ludwig
Wittgenstein's "Remarks on Frazier's Golden Bough." Which, If memory serves=
, is
reprinted in the collection of his works entitled "Philosophical Occasions"=
 and
that any decent university library should have a copy of.

That's also a very common, and ultimately I think unsupportable view. What =
I'd
like to suggest, since you seem like a reasonable person committed to a cer=
tain
philosophical skepticism about what Michael Shermer has dubbed "Weird Belie=
fs"
is that your view of science as you've just explained it is also a cargo-cu=
lt.
That's not to say it's not an interesting, and ultimately laudable idea, wi=
th
the ultimate goal of explaining the unprecedented success of science in the
world since the enlightenment. Part of the problem is that scientific progr=
ess
doesn't really happen the way you've just described. Without going in to to=
o
much detail, it's obvious from examining the history of science that scienc=
e has
proceeded not gradually but more along the lines of what Thomas Kuhn descri=
bed
in "the structure of scientific revolutions." That is, periods of relative
stability with scientist's working within an accepted paradigm punctuated b=
y
periods when paradigms shift and there is a great deal of uncertainty with =
many
members of the scientific community trying to save old theories while other=
s try
to promote any old thing that comes along simply because of it's newness. T=
he
virtue of the scientific community and scientific inquiry in the abstract i=
s
that it is a stabilizing force that tends over time to accept the best, mos=
t
complete set of propositions that explain the broadest set of the available
evidence. But this is a complicated topic that people (not postmodernists, =
mind
you) write doctoral disserations about, and in any case i'm rapidly approac=
hing
my level of incompetence in talking about it already. I would highly recomm=
end
some books though, not just the Kuhn I already mentioned, but also Arthur F=
ine's
"The Shaky Game" and Paul Feyerabends "Against Method" as well as this link
discussing the "Duhem-Quine Thesis" also known as "confirmation
holism":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_holism

You're absolutely right, but you're also tilting at windmills. Which is why=
, as
I said before, it makes good practical sense to take some time to understan=
d
what people are saying when they are saying things that sound nonsensical t=
o
you. Then you're not likely to make statements like this that in fact
expressions popular in the cargo cult you belong to.

This is the point I was trying to make with my previous post about getting the semantics right. You're conflating "postmodern" literature--which, if anything, is a gross misnomer of a very old literary tendency, I think first evidenced by the preacher of Ecclesiastes--with comments about the "postmodern condition," which, in all fairness, is something that's pretty exclusively a phenomena that happened among the political left in France after the events of May 68 failed to result in a Marxist revolution. Of course, out of that, there was some interesting work done, not the least of which being the deconstructive method of explication du texte, foucault's historical method, and baudrillard's hyperreality. All of which present us with different ways of looking at the world, which is valuable. The only really unfortunate thing to happen as a result of both the rise in frequency of postmodern
literature after world war ii--largely because writing became a profession rather than a trade and writer's became more aware of academic criticism than they had been in previous generations--and the introduction of post-structuralist semiotic theory to the English speaking world (and completely out of context given that most of the work that lead up to it and situated it within its proper context was for some time afterwards largely untranslated), is that in the United States, and to a lesser extent Great Britain, there has been an explosion of jargon fueled criticism masquerading as philosophy which takes as its subject anything under the sun and is largely vacuous and built on a network of bad logic and appeals to authority.

If you understand that about the topic, then you'll see why saying things like:
> This is not to say that there aren't very smart people doing very
> good work -- far from it -- but good work can't be postmodern by
> definition, can it, since the point of postmodernism is that there
> isn't any good work, there is only self-interested salesmanship of
> one agenda, or bias, or another.
>
> Within a world view that holds that there can be no good work, only
> self-interested salesmanship, what do you expect to find? Why, an
> enormous amount of self-interested salesmanship, of course -- what
> else?

necessarily misses the target, because the postmodernism you're describing doesn't really exist, and you're not going to find anyone but the dimmest of lights who would hold to such a feeble position. Put another way, Postmodernism is not an ideology in the sense that you are describing it, and more to the point, many of the things that are labelled postmodern have little or no relation to eachother beyond the need of various person's pursuing tenure to publish as much gibberish as possible in order to secure their mediocre teaching careers.

The "Livres d'Artistes: Artists and Poets in Dialogue" show at the New York
Public Library is amazing. It's a cornucopia for the eyes to see all those
paintings, prints, drawings by Picasso, Miro, Delaunay, and others, next to
poems poets with whom those artists collaborated: Tzara, Char, Michaux,
Mallarme, Apollinaire, Breton, Desnos, and others. For more info, see
http://www.nypl.org/press/2006/frenchbookart.cfm. The show will be up till
August 19.

And also:

Nicaraguans Salomon de la Selva and Joaquin Pasos both wrote poems in
English (though of course nearly all their work is in Spanish).  Julia
de Burgos wrote a single poem, her last, in English.

And think of all the African poets, from Rabearivelo on, writing in
colonial languages whose "mother tongues" were likely to have been
indigenous languages (or, in the case of Breyten Breytenbach, a creole
language like Afrikaans).  (Africa??  When does that vast continent
ever appear on this list????)  Or Egyptian (thus African) poets like
Georges Henein and Georges Schehade, both of whom wrote in French.

William Carlos Williams's "mother's milk tongue" was Spanish, yet he
never wrote in that language as far as I know.

Was anyone on the list at the Weldon Kees event last night at the
Cinematheque here in San Francisco=3F  Last year guest curator Jenni Olson=

turned an elegaic tribute to a dead friend, Mark Finch, into a feature
documentary called THE JOY OF LIFE, which spoke in a spare and moving way
about people drawn to the Golden Gate Bridge, like Finch, to take their ow=
n
lives=2E  In the course of her research, she said, she came across the lif=
e,
work and of course the disappearance of Weldon Kees, whose car was found o=
n
the north end of the bridge on July 18, 1955, and that she became taken
with Kees' work as both poet and filmmaker in the early San Francisco film=

avant-garde=2E  (Not much mention made of his painting=2E)  Perhaos only J=
enni
Olson, with her myriad connections to a hundred archives, could have pulle=
d
together such a program, which was billed as the first retrospective of
Kees' fugitive film work=2E

Since he completed only one film, the program was supplemented by other
shorts on which he had contribute his many talents=2E  James Broughton's
classic ADVENTURES OF JIMMY (1950) began the show, a nice print with Kees=92=

barrelhouse piano score=2E  Broughton was in full Buster Keaton-Chaplin mo=
de
with this short, in which he leaves a rundown cabin in the wilderness and
goes to San Francisco to find a wife, or possibly a boyfriend, or one of
each perhaps=2E  It's crazy coy, and Broughton's not a great silent film
actor, but it's cute and the audience lapped it up=2E  Olson followed this=
 up
with two of Weldon Kees' so-called "data" films, both from 1952, HAND MOUT=
H
COORDINATION and APPROACHES AND LEAVETAKINGS, also silent, in grainy black=

and white=2E  Frankly, these left me a little mystified=2E  Why on earth w=
here
they made=3F  In HMC, we watch a harried mother go through an entire day
taking care of an adorable little boy who looks to be about 15 months
old=97-feeding him, bathing him, putting on his diapers, while four older
kids look on from the background and attempt to steal scenes from Baby=2E=20=

Kees and Gregory Bateson are sometimes shown in the corners of the
apartment, cameras held up to their faces=2E  But why=3F  The second
"anthropological film" was lensed by Kees with a camera hidden in his
valise, and documents ordinary Oakland and Berkeley citizens saying hello
and goodbye=2E  Kees (presumably) supplies some winsome captions for each
brief scenelet, some of them lasting but a few seconds=2E  In one of the
scenes, laid in front of UC Berkeley's Wheeler Hall, an imposing professor=

walks across some steps with a brace of burly grad students, and a
sharp-eyed member of our audience identified the faculty guy as George M=2E=

Stewart, the novelist (STORM) and author of the classic work on
California's Loyalty Oath THE YEAR OF THE OATH (1950)=2E

HOTEL APEX was screened next, the only completed film Kees signed, a
fascinating and beautiful poetic impression of a rundown boarding house
badly in need of demolition=2E  The camera glides and rises through the
ruined space, stopping to dolly in here and there at odd-shaped remnants, =
a
Dinah Washington poster, a scattering of beer caps, a soaked paperback cop=
y
of Phoebe Atwood Taylor's 1931 THE CAPE COD MYSTERY=2E  We wonder about th=
e
people who once lived there, how they came to tun out on their old
possessions; the HOTEL APEX has some of the mystery of the Marie Celeste=2E=
=20
Time heals everything, folks say, but the displacement of the hotel
remains, still, eerily vigorous, nearly a shriek=2E

Then we saw a color film, William Heick's THE BRIDGE, on which Kees acted
as a cameraman=2E  Bizarrely it's a series of impressive Wow! shots of the=

Golden Gate Bridge, swamped in fog, glittering in the sun, viewed from a
bird's-eye view above, sometimes from the great steel pilings at its base,=

while a "movie voice" from the period recites, really skips through, what
seems like a LOT of Hart Crane's poem THE BRIDGE=2E  We see Kees scurrying=

down a steep slope balancing a tripod; it's spooky, the way he seems to
risk tumbling into the rough white surf=2E  I thought Crane's verse really=

beautiful, but you could tell some people were having a hard time followin=
g
it, especially the way it was enunciated, in these rapidfire "You Are
There" rapidfire sub-Gielgudisms=2E  Finally the lights came halfway up an=
d
we listened to a KPFA broadcast of Weldon Kees' own radio show, which he
co-hosted with a friend Michael Grieg=2E  This episode was recorded shortl=
y
after Kees' disappearance, and Grieg puzzles it out over the air, playing =
a
song ("Daybreak Blues") that Kees wrote, and reading one of Kees' longer,
most interesting poems, "The Journey=2E"  Grieg's got a great voice, like
Vincent Price crossed with sandpaper, and he made "The Journey" sound like=

a million bucks (funny thing, though, he pronounces "Formica" with a
strange accent on the first syllable, as though along the lines of
"fornicate=2E")  And the grief and bewilderment of Kees' suicide was palpa=
ble
in this longago radio show from KPFA=2E  Very touching=2E  I came away fro=
m
this retrsopective thinking that, despite Dana Gioia, despite Donald
Justice, whatever, Weldon Kees deserves all the scrutiny and commentary
he=92s been getting=2E  Maybe he wasn=92t the world=92s greatest filmmaker=
, but we
have only these bits and pieces to ponder, like reading fortunes from tea
leaves=2E  Anything might have happened, and nearly did=2E

POLIS IS THIS: Charles Olson and the Persistence of Place
Director Henry Ferrini In Person

Preceded by two experimental video shorts from 1968
featuring readings by Olson and Robert Creeley

Yerba Buena Center for the Arts
701 Mission at Third Street
San Francisco
415-978-ARTS (to reserve tickets)

From postman's son to Postmodernism's founding father,
and from schooner fisherman to scholar, this hulking
six-foot eight Harvard-educated historian drifts back to the
hard-luck New England fishing port of his boyhood summers
after the 1956 close of Black Mountain College.

There, surrounded by the cruel poverties and sorrows of a
town at war with the sea for over 300 years, Charles Olson
creates a unified and transcendent vision of a besieged
people caught between tradition and modernity.

Featuring John Malkovich, Amiri Baraka, Jonathan Williams,
Anne Waldman, Diane di Prima, Ed Sanders, Pete Seeger,
and others, "Polis is This" investigates the seminal avant-garde
poet, Charles Olson, in conjunction with his enduring
connection to his place and origin of inspiration,
Gloucester, Massachusetts.

George,

Not sure what you're point is. The voice, by its
nature,  is personal. Every uttered word a political
act, one could, I think, easily argue. It take lots of
mettle to raise one's voice loud enough to be heard.

I thought I'd throw my two cents, as they say,
reckoning I might have some idea related what I
thought, but might've been mistaken, was a debate on
the issue of language Stateside and to what I see as
an absurd debate on all sides--and mostly because lots
on both sides of this debate simply aren't equipt with
the kind of practical knowledge and therefore
persuasive language to actually do something
productive (in political sense). But I said, lots--and
not all.

And my post, as you saw, was simply a query. A polite
one at that, which is not always so easy given the
lengths some posters go to, well...

AJ

From the editor's note:

*[Stammer's] poetry is never still. It is always restless, always branching
out and growing back in on itself. It is special. Perhaps, even, it is one
of a kind. Harry's textual potions are post-Language excursions which test
the firmament of syntax. Just as his (equally ambitious) vispo experiments
prod =96 and sometimes outright mock =96 the link between word and image, s=
o his
poetry defies the relationship between language and thought. Stammer's
unusual mind-to-page transcriptions attempt to redefine writing as a more
free and organic process. *

If every view is nothing but another cargo cult, then there's nothing
to recommend the choice of any view over any other view. That means
there's nothing to recommend your assertion that my view is a cargo
cult - it=B4s nothing more than your bias for your own point of view,
and my bias for my own point of view is just as valid as yours. Where
do we go from here, Jason? Pistols for two and champagne for one?
What possible benefits accrue from the view that all opinions are
equal, equally valid, equally good?

That's like saying that internal combustion engines don't work by
containing an explosive mixture of fuel and air within a cylinder
that allows a piston to stroke up and down within that compartment in
a regular cycle, but instead that cars work by pressing on the
accelerator and brake while steering. You've deliberately changed the
context and the meanings of the terms without notice.

My description of the scientific method doesn=B4t conflict with your
notion that science proceeds in periods of relative stability
punctuated by paradigm shifts. Sometimes the work as I described it
is work within a period of stability and sometimes it is work within
a paradigm shift, just as sometimes the car is going straight and
sometimes it is cornering. But without a scientific method such as
I=B4ve described, the car doesn=B4t move at all, because the engine isn=B4=
t
working.

It may be that we're both right, in other words: that I have
accurately described how to do science and you've accurately
described how people do their jobs and play politics in those jobs.
Men went to their graves calling Pasteur a fool and a fraud because
they saw science as a job the politics of which are more important
than anything else. But if science is really just an old boys' club
and nothing really works, if it's just the politics of one biased
group out-playing those with some other prejudice, how do you explain
the workings of anything? Shouldn't in that case a magic spell work
just as well as a car to get you from place to place? What brand of
magic carpet do you use to get to work?

Wait a minute -- evidence? What's that to postmodernism, or to a
postmodernist? There's no such thing as evidence in the postmodern
view, is there? Isn't every assertion just as good as every other
assertion? How can there be anything even resembling "best most
complete set of propositions that explain" anything, when both "best"
and "most complete" would necessarily privilege one view over others,
and privileging any view over any other view is anathema?

Once again, if every view is nothing better than a cargo cult, if all
views worked just as well as any other view, how do you account for
any changes in human history, starting with fire and the wheel? Raw
food is just as good as cooked; cold is just as good as warm;
dragging a travois is just as good as rolling along with a wheel,
wife-beating is just as good as not beating -- for a postmodernist
there is nothing to choose between them: travois, wheel; fire, no
fire; beat or don't beat; it's all good.

There can be no victims and no criminals, no right and wrong, for
that matter, if you hold every view to be just another cargo cult, to
be just as good, just as valid, as any other. There is no basis on
which to judge any act to be criminal or wrong from a postmodern
view. The best a postmodernist can do is accept whatever condition he
or she was born into, its biases, prejudices, and agenda. The most
thorough postmodernists, it turns out, are the people who are least
reflective about whether his or her own biases, prejudices, and
agenda are worthy or even justifiable. Postmodernism is, ultimately,
a retreat into a gated community! Postmodernism is "I=B4ve got mine,
Jack."

Just so; and how is that summary significantly different from what I

We seem to be in violent agreement.

Just when you thought that you'd had enough excitement with the resurection Australian Football, and all that, along comes the very much anticipated return of that poetry journal: Malleable Jangle. "I told you so," yes - yes after a rather too long recess we're back.
This is the return issue, no 9 Winter. It includes new poetry from Doug Draime, Richard Fein, Lorin Ford, Ricky Garni, Marthe Reed, Laurence W. Thomas, Christian Zorka, and an article by Giles Goodland on collage in poetry. So go to it and have a look around, it's at: http://www.malleablejangle.netfirms.com/ All the best, and good luck in Germany. Robert Lane.

Stephen, I haven't seen the Gore film (and I'm not sure that I want to, it
probably won't tell me anything I don't know). But I am a very big fan of
William Kentridge, and have seen several of his works, including that one at
MOMA. I like immensely what you say about his work, and I think you are very
accurate about its power. This seems very right to me: " One senses that the
very charcoal strokes he makes for the drawings are a way of digging and
scraping deeper and deeper into his subject matter until he arrives at a
certain sense of truth. I suspect it's the sensuality of that process that
makes me trust the work - the video as an artifact becomes an imaginative
kind of a social and human fact."

You might be interested in a review I did of an opera he directed (The
Return of Ulysses) which featured some more of his beautiful animation - for
me, an extraordinarily moving production (you have to scroll down through
the Robert le Page, unless that interests you as well) - it's at

"I don't see why, as I get the feeling here, that poets whose first  language
is English are ashamed of it...This isn't about politics, racism, or  the
like. It's about love. - Joel"

Eileen R. Tabios loves the English language so much that she married it!  I'd
post a link to one or more of her websites, but that would probably only
lead to an off-topic discussion of wine and German shepherds, some of the  other
things she loves nearly as much as English.

Apparently many of the participants in this topic thread are automatically*
proficient in other languages, and they've never struggled to  artfully
express in step-mother tongues. A simple google of the Bangladeshi  poet, Kaiser
Haq, demonstrates that he has succeeded.

It's permissible to love tongues. It's understandable that we love breasts.
But it's pathetic to miss the point so persistently. Only infants tend  to
milk a situation. When a body matures it moves onto other breasts or  bottles.

bios:

*Todd Colby

Todd Colby lives, writes, and works in Brooklyn, NY. Tremble & Shine, his
most recent book of poems, published by Soft Skull Press, has a dazzling
cover painting of a cowboy standing on a bed by his wife, the artist
Elizabeth Zechel.

*Cuomo!

Brooklyn folk/punk act Cuomo! take the ethics of simple song structure and
upbeat energy of The Ramones or The Clash, then applies the lyrical
sensibilities and songwriting sophistication of Bob Dylan or Simon &
Garfunkel. These combined elements have created a stripped down and earthy
folk aesthetic steeped with a lyrical quality of honest cynicism and lonely
optimism that attempts to bring a refreshingly humble approach to socially
conscious and political songwriting. Songwriter Dave Cuomo is also
co-founder and editor of Urban Folk, NYC's indy folk magazine. After
recently signing with Jersey roots/punk label, Ever Reviled Records, Cuomo!
is preparing for the summer release of their debut album Holiday and
accompanying national tour in the fall.

*Dancin Dogs

Dancin Dogs is a celebratory absurdist recreation of seriously frustrated
dance funk emerging from two factors: growing up in the disgusting kennels
of Wooftown (a pet store in a Connecticut mall), and accidentally being fed
fishfood instead of dogfood for 5 months by the idiot managers of Wooftown.
No ex-members of anything and very little tolerance of human beings in
general. Dogs.

*Sander Hicks=20

Sander Hicks is an independent publisher, community organizer, and writer.
He founded Soft Skull Press in 1992, and won awards for his work there. He
gained serious national attention when he stood up to the Bush machine in
1999 by republishing the controversial Bush bio Fortunate Son. He was
featured alongside the book's author, Jim Hatfield, in the Cinemax/HBO
documentary "Horns and Halos." He ran Soft Skull until a leave of absence i=
n
2001.=20

After a year-long "recharge" time spent working on houses and riding an old
motorcycle around Taos, New Mexico, he returned to New York City to start
Vox Pop/DKMC, New York City's only community-empowering bookstore, cafe, an=
d
media machine.

Hicks is a playwright, a musician, and a reporter. He grew up in the
Washington, DC suburbs, where his teenage hero was Ian MacKaye, of the band
Fugazi. His political art-punk band, White Collar Crime, played Warped Tour=
,
in 2001.

As a journalist, Hicks broke new ground on the 9/11 attack for New York
Press, Long Island Press, GNN.tv, and "INN World Report" television. He
confronts a neo-con and Democrat cover-up regarding 9/11 in his book, The
Big Wedding, which has 10,000 copies in print. His next book, Meet the
Future Head-On: Rediscovering America's Progressive Mainstream (Vox Pop,
Fall '06) will explore "the progressive spirit at the core of the beliefs o=
f
a majority of Americans." This character is ignored by the "politics of
death" practiced by the outdated "dinosaur" political parties.

*Mitch Highfill

Mitch Highfill is the author of a Dozen Sonnets, Koenig's Sphere (Situation=
s
Press), and The Blue Dahlia (Detour). He lives in Brooklyn.

*Dibson T. Hoffweiler

In 2002, Dibs was bored all summer. To calm himself, he wrote some songs to
feel better about himself. It didn't work all that well. Back in New York,
he stumbled upon the Sidewalk Cafe. He started writing songs with his frien=
d
Sara, and they formed a band called Dibs and Sara. They were an immediate
success.

With their newfound wealth, Sara decided she would visit Italy. Dibs decide=
d
to stay in New York and be a debaucherous fool. After joining numerous othe=
r
bands (including the likes of Huggabroomstik, New Lease On Life, Secret
Salamandar, Cheese On Bread, Urban Barnyard, Dibs On Joie, and others long
forgotten) Dibs began pushing his solo material once again, which had
significantly improved since 2002.

The 2004 release, "More Unsent Letters", was a best seller on Luv-A-Lot
Records, and charted on Canadian radio (the radio part is true, I am told).
The recording was done in one session with Dashan Coram, Luv-A-Lot CEO and
head engineer. Dibs' 2005 release, "Slivers and Bits", blows "More Unsent
Letters" into the water, with it's use of more than one instrument.

Watch for Dibs, who is putting together a band which will also use more tha=
n
one instrument, blowing Dibs out of the water, compared to when it was one
guy with one instrument.

*Robert Kerr=20

Robert Kerr is a playwright and songwriter living in Brooklyn. He wrote the
book and lyrics for the short musical "The Sticky-Fingered Fiancee" and the
songs for his plays "Kingdom Gone" and "Meet Uncle Casper" as well as his
Brothers Grimm adaptations "Bearskin" and "The Juniper Tree." He was also a
founding member of the Minneapolis band Alien Detector.

*Limp Richard

Limp Richard's alter ego, Todd Carlstrom, has played in NYC bands for
years (The Domestics, Heroes of the Alamo, Dirty Vicars). Limp and his
backing band, the Disappointments (including Limp Richard on guitar, Limp
Richard on bass, Limp Richard on drums, and plucky New Jersey native Limp
Richard on piano) are currently amassing their first cache of studio
recordings, with Major Matt Mason USA engineering. Influences include but
are not limited to Brian Jonestown Massacre, PJ Harvey, Spoon, and Matthew
Sweet. He may or may not have backup musicians for the Clash show, he hasn'=
t
decided as of press time. He is managed by the beautiful but criminally
pathological Remorah. Look for a myspace page soon with four freshly minted
songs!=20

*Matt Lydon

Matt Lydon was born and raised in south central New Hampshire. McDonald's.
Rollerblades. Trees. He is married and has two beautiful children. He lives
in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

*Randi Russo

Mixing indie rock, New York garage rock, and singer/songwriter
sensibilities, Randi Russo has drawn comparisons to fellow New Yorkers Patt=
i
Smith, the Velvet Underground, and Sonic Youth for her chaotic and pensive
songwriting.

Growing up in Long Island, Russo briefly flirted with the violin, piano, an=
d
amateur turntable scratching until her early adolescence. Concentrating on
visual arts in her teens, she eventually went on to study painting in St.
Louis, where she began to fully explore the indie rock, grunge, and punk of
the early '90s while working at a college radio station. Purchasing an
electric guitar at the age of 19, the left-handed Russo found playing
right-handed unsatisfactory, eventually playing left-handed but keeping the
instrument strung the same as if it were being played right-handed. This
technique created a distinctive form of chording and riffing, and Russo soo=
n
formed her first band with a bassist and a percussionist under the guise of
Raizel. The trio recorded one single but disbanded in 1996, leaving Russo t=
o
hone her craft in relative seclusion until she emerged as a solo artist
following her return to New York City in 1999.

After about a year on the solo circuit, Russo formed a band and recorded an
admittedly chaotic live EP that captured only their second show with Live a=
t
CBGB's 313 Gallery. Following being approached by Olive Juice Records, Russ=
o
entered the studio to record her debut, 2001's intensely focused Solar
Bipolar. Although it was released at roughly the same time other New York
garage-influenced bands were again rising to prominence, Russo and her band
stood out from the pack as the vehicle of a tough-minded female
singer/songwriter and successfully avoided being categorized as a bandwagon
jumper. -- The All Music Guide

*Schwervon! Has Hot Pants

Schwervon! are Matt Roth and Nan Turner, the swamp rock Sonny & Cher of the
Lower East Side. Sharky plays in whimsical trio Pantsuit with Nan, and Toby
Goodshank plays in the bands The Moldy Peaches, Double Deuce, The Tri-Lambs=
,
Christian Pirate Puppets, and solo. They all enjoy hot pants.

*The Leader

The Leader is a rock indie duo of drums/vibraphone, played by classically
trained Sam Lazzara, and bass, played by not classically trained Julie
DeLano. They sing in "harmony" and can't get away from writing about these
dark political times.

*The Marianne Pillsburys

Maine native Marianne Pillsbury writes pop-rock songs with cleverly-crafted=
,
hook-laden melodies and brash, witty, tongue-in-cheek lyrics. Released in
2004, her debut album The Wrong Marianne has received enthusiastic reviews
from The New York Times, Time Out New York, The Boston Herald and The San
Francisco Chronicle and elicited comparisons to the best work of Liz Phair,
Juliana Hatfield and Jill Sobule. The album was named a Top 12 DIY Pick in
Performing Songwriter Magazine. The song "Boo Hoo" won Best Alt/Rock Song i=
n
The Great American Song Contest 2004 and was also selected for inclusion on
ROCKRGRL magazine's Discoveries 2005 compilation CD.

Her Brooklyn-based band The Marianne Pillsburys bring Marianne's songs to
life with a raw punk-pop vibe. Think: Blondie, Elastica, Liz Phair fronting
The Rolling Stones, or Juliana Hatfield singing lead for The Pixies. The
band has played NYC venues like Mercury Lounge, Luna Lounge, Pianos,
Arlene's Grocery and Southpaw, out-of-town venues in Boston, DC, LA and San
Francisco, and festivals like M.E.A.N.Y. Fest (Musicians & Emerging Artists
in New York), International Pop Overthrow and the Millenium Music
Conference.

In April 2005, the band released a 3-song demo called "The Hot EP" produced
by the fabulously talented Roger Greenawalt (Ben Kweller, Ben Lee).

*The Trouble Dolls

The Trouble Dolls' roots go back to Kudzu, the cowpunk band formed by singe=
r
Cheri Leone and guitarist Matty Karas in 1986, when both were attending hig=
h
school in Huntington Beach, Calif. Three months after their formation, they
recorded a demo in the garage studio of reclusive pop genius Emitt Rhodes
and sent it to legendary KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer ("Rodney on the ROQ").

Rodney fell in love with the tape, becoming one of Kudzu's first and bigges=
t
supporters. One song from the demo, "Death Valley Girl," was Rodney's
most-requested song for three weeks running -- managing to hold off the
Bangles and the reunited Monkees. The song subsequently appeared on the
Frontier Records compilation Thangs That Twang.

In 1988, Kudzu toured up and down the West Coast as the opening act for Ran=
k
and File. Later that year, following an appearance on MTV's "The Cutting
Edge," they signed to Restless Records. Their Ray Manzarek-produced debut
album, California Scheming, came out in 1989, but few copies made it into
stores, due to the financial difficulties Restless was undergoing at the
time. However, the album did not escape the watchful eyes of lawyers for
United Features Syndicate, which syndicated John Neale's comic strip
"Kudzu." They promptly issued a cease-and-desist order, effectively putting
the last nail in the album's coffin.

Although Kudzu had in fact taken their name not from the strip, but from th=
e
Georgia weed depicted on the cover of R.E.M.'s Murmur, they decided that,
rather than fight, they would call it a day. Matty and Cheri moved to New
York City at the suggestion of a former schoolmate who offered them work
writing and recording music for the Cartoon Network. However, the work
proved to be something less than steady, and the pair separated for a time
to pursue "real world" careers. Cheri studied film at New York
University--while there, she directed the Gutterball video "Trial Separatio=
n
Blues"--while Matty became the pop music critic for the Asbury Park (N.J.)
Press.

In the summer of 1995, Matty and Cheri reunited to form the Trouble Dolls
with guitarist Michael Taylor, a New Jerseyan who was in an early version o=
f
Monster Magnet but was unceremoniously fired when he refused to learn any
more Hawkwind songs. Michael provided the band's name after discovering
trouble dolls, a Latin American charm, on a trip to Guatemala; but he left
the band in 1998 to pursue a career in television (Trekkies will recognize
him as the writer of some of the best episodes of "Star Trek: Voyager"; the=
y
will also probably be angry at us for calling them Trekkies).

For the first two years of the Trouble Dolls' existence, they were solely a
studio group, recording soundtracks for spaghetti-westerns-that-never-were
on Matty's cranky four-track and making up bios about themselves that
seamlessly blended fact and fiction (a practice which continues to this
day). One of their bargain-basement epics found its way to the BMX Bandits,
who covered the Trouble Dolls' "Love Isn't for the Lazy" on the B-side of a
fan club 45. Another track, "Planet Robin," found its way onto the
soundtrack of the 1996 indie film "Ed's Next Move". Still another, "Ice
Cream Cow," reached WFMU DJs Belinda and Hova, who continue to play it on
their Saturday morning show "Greasy Kid Stuff."

On their way to becoming a proper band, the Trouble Dolls recruited Gabe
Rhodes, a filmmaker and one-time member of the San Francisco band Scenic
Vermont, to play drums after he moved to New York in early 2001. Later that
year, they met Pam Weis while sharing a bill with her band, Bionic Finger,
at the Ladyfest East festival. When Bionic Finger broke up shortly
afterward, Pam became the Trouble Dolls' bassist.

The Trouble Dolls play their aphasic melange of prepackaged, post-Madonna
chanson and bubblegum at New York City clubs such as Luna Lounge, Arlene
Grocery and the Sidewalk Cafe. Their (they can't believe it's their first)
EP, I Don't Know Anything at All, was released in June 2002 on their own
label, La La La Unlimited, and their debut album will follow later in 2002.
They also recently completed the score for the Tony Daniel-directed indie
film "Ame rican Bohemian," in which Matty and Cheri have (totally out of
character!) cameos as musicians who wear silly clothes and smoke.

In Mediated, Carol Mirakove strives to integrate particular political
situations with her emotional states of being. These poems, here in
four sections -- Mediated, Fuck the Polis, Propaganda, and Pornography
-- celebrate formal experiments towards structural integrity, such that
we might realize other worlds as not only possible, but actual. Rodrigo
Toscano: "Mediated is incisive, artful, athletic." Jeff Derksen: "the
documentary poem Fuck the Polis is a pivotal work."

About Heretical Texts: This series aims to investigate and challenge
the assumption that poetry, as art and communication activity, is
political. Central to the Heretical Texts mission is a focused
imagining of 'political poetry' as a form of public intervention,
invention, and invocation that calls on language to call out a public,
a people.

You're right on the money, if I really believed that *every* view was just =

eration was that the idea that there is a "scientific method" which guarant=

I haven't changed the context at all. You're asserting that science is succ=
essful because it has a special method that gives it special access to gene=
rating true propositions. I disagree. I think that science is successful, a=
nd I think that the history of scientific inquiry bears this out, because o=
ver time it generates more inclusive explanations of a body of observed phe=
nomena. The mistake in your view isn't in asserting that science works. Tha=
t science works is non-controversial. What is problematic is a view that sa=
ys science works because it follows the scientific method. Not only are the=
re all sorts of examples in the history of science--from special relativity=
 to natural selection to punctuated equilibrium to uniformitarianism to new=
tonian physics to the copernican revolution--of theories and scientific ide=
as that came about through a process nothing like the sort of "scientific m=
ethod"=20
that gets described in the introduction to high school physics text books a=
nd that you've reasserted in your argument, but the very Idea of a scientif=
ic method is in fact anti-scientific. In order to be correct, the theory th=
at science works because it uses the scientific method various problematic =
metaphysical principles, not the least of which being the correspondence th=
eory of truth and the general validity of inductive inferrence, have to hol=
d, when in fact they don't. So where does that leave us? It leaves us with =
the non-controversial fact that science works and all sorts of evidence in =
the historical record of how it has gotten to be as good at working as it i=
s. In the face of this, we can cling dogmatically to a scientific method, o=
r we can be more scientific and take a look at the evidence before us.

Actually, the engine will work whether you have the tools to explain it or =
not. If everything in the engine is functioning properly, anyone, regardles=
s of their views about what brought about the existence of the engine, will=
 be able to turn the key and make the motor run. That's not what we're talk=
ing about.

Nobody is suggesting that science is just an old boys club and that nothing=
 really works. What's important is that the scientific community, that is, =
working scientists and the ultimate arbiters of which theories and paradigm=
s are regarded as true in a given period, are compelled by pragmatism and o=
bservation and not by social pressure. Which is not to say that there isn't=
 all sorts of politics that goes on in the scientific community. What makes=
 science truly so remarkable is that it still works in spite of all the pol=
itics that would tend toward stagnation. Which is why it's interesting to s=
tudy science sociologically, which is what science studies does.

you keep talking about "the postmodernist" and a "postmodern view" and i ke=
ep trying to explain to you that that's tilting at windmills. I've read mos=
t of the philosophers that would be included in any list of major postmoder=
nists and none of them ascribe to the sort of relativism you're describing.=
 I've also read extensively among the poets and novelists who would be desc=
ribed as "postmodern writers" and I don't think that there's any of that re=
lativism there. As for the postmodern american literary critics, well, who =
knows what they believe. i doubt that they do themselves. But I sincerely d=
oubt there's enough regularity or internal consistency there to be able to =
call pin it to "the postmodernists."

I have never said that every view is nothing better than a cargo cult. I ha=
ve said that the view you described, naive scientific realism as a reaction=
ary metaphysical position taken in response to paranoia that science is som=
ehow going to be undone by the creeping terror of the pink nihilists (thats=
 my term for the people I think you mean by "the postmodernists"--pink nihi=
lists has such a nice pejorative ring to it don't you think? you're welcome=
 to use it yourself if you like), is as much a cargo cult as is any weird g=
roup of whacked out french marxists who've lost their faith. More important=
ly, scientific realism is problematic as a metaphysical theory because it p=
laces limits on the purview of scientific investigation. Arthur Fine, for e=
xample, has shown that certain ideas necessary to the development of genera=
l relativity require a form of instrumentalism. Which is to say, if Einstei=
n=20
felt the way that you do about the scientific method, we'd still be baffled=
 about all of these anomalies in the motions of the planets and the clocks =
on satellites. The clocks on satellites would still work the same way that =
they do now, but we wouldn't understand it. That's what science is, a bette=
r understanding, not a magical set of formulae that make things work. As su=
ch, science is immune from any sort of idiotic criticism of it that the pin=
k nihilists might launch. No matter what, humans will be curious, observati=
ons will accumulate, and explanatory theories will have to encompass them. =
That's how science progresses and it's really in no danger.

It's different because you insist on lumping everything that might be descr=

Ist International Festival Of Son Jarocho
A jorney into African Heritage in Mexico

Mexico is a pluri-cultural country, with a majority mestizo population and a
considerable number of indigenous peoples. What is not well known is that
Mexico also has a strong African heritage dating back over 300 years, that
has significantly influenced its culture. Seventy years ago the prestigious
anthrolopologist Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán defined the concept of La Tercera
Raíz (The Third Root), in reference to the African heritage in Mexico. The
contributions and the existence itself of the Afro-descendents and
Afro-mestizo population in Mexico are scarcely known. For this reason, the
objective of Afro-Mex is to present to the Washington audience different
dimensions of the African cultural heritage in Mexico. Afro-Mex presents
various musical expressions of the state of Veracruz where such heritage is
notable: the Ist International Festival of Son Jarocho, with 5 popular music
groups. The participation of Dr. Antonio García de León and particularly the
collection of documentary films Afro-Mex Series by director Rafael Rebollar
will offer a broad context of this fundamental but often ignored aspect of
the Mexican culture.

I just said that in Spanish you can speak personally (say "tu," for

or not (say "usted", for example), and I said that both are important,

I think that's natural, particularly given the stringent efforts of many of them to  blur the line themselves, aided and abetted by people like Richard Rorty. What makes it fuzzy is the fact that the post-structuralists approached philosophy as a form of literary criticism. Which isn't to say that there isn't still a distinction there.

Postmodern Philosophers:
Foucault
Heidegger
De Man
Levi-Strauss
Lacan
Baudrillard
Lyotard
Gadamer
Jameson
Eco


Postmodern Literary Critics
Bataille
Julia Kristeva
bell hooks
Judith Butler
Terry Eagleton
Edward Said
Susan Gubar
*Barthes
*Derrida
adorno
Deleuze
Guattari
Zizek

I have to confess that i'm never quite sure where to stick Barthes and Derrida in my own mind. I think they can be read both as critics and as philosophers. As critics, they're brilliant. As philosophers, i'm not sure i understand them. What I think the list illustrates though is that "postmodernism" is more of an umbrella term than it is an ethos. I think very few of the people I listed on either list would describe themselves as "postmodernists" it's their approach, I think, that makes them postmodern, and the things that concern them that make them critics or philosophers. The dividing line, I think, being that philosophers have to be more concerned with the quality of their arguments, whereas critics are freer to express opinions and aesthetic judgments. Again, it gets fuzzy, particularly with people like Derrida and Foucault who engaged in both sorts of activities over their careers.
At the same time, though, I think the list of the postmodern critics i've given here is largely the brighter lights, and when i tend to speak desparagingly of "pomo critics" i'm talking more about their imitators and acolytes, none of whom are well known enough to making listing them meaningful, than I am the people I've listed.

I confess i'm not overly familiar, but i think he's a pretty straight example of a critic.

I have to say that a list of "postmodern" philosophers that includes
Levi-Strauss, Heidegger and Gadamer is working with a notion of the postmodern
beyond my powers of comprehension -- while it's alwayas a mistake to conflate
postmodernism with poststructuralism, and I won't do that here, I don't know
how we wind up with structuralists as postmodernists --

On the matter of Guy Debord -- this brings us to some interesting intellectual
history -- while many have remarked the relationship between the emergence of
postmodernism (or rather, thinking about the postmodern) and poststructuralism
and the polotical events in France of 1968, few in the USA spend much time
lookng at what brings these things together in '68 and what preceded that
moment -- In particular, Debord, Lyotard and Baudrillard, to name just three,
all had associations with the SOCIALISM OR BARABARISM group that included
Castoriadis and LeFort, and that was in working contact with the group of
activists and thinkers arund C.L.R. James in the USA --  The struggles and work
that brought people like Castoriadis and Lyotard to a post-Marxist view was
instrumental in the thinking that evolved around the conception of the
postmodern --

As critics, they're brilliant. As philosophers, i'm not sure i understand them.
What I think the list illustrates though is that "postmodernism" is more of an
umbrella term than it is an ethos. I think very few of the people I listed on
either list would describe themselves as "postmodernists" it's their approach,
I think, that makes them postmodern, and the things that concern them that make
them critics or philosophers. The dividing line, I think, being that
philosophers have to be more concerned with the quality of their arguments,
whereas critics are freer to express opinions and aesthetic judgments. Again,
it gets fuzzy, particularly with people like Derrida and Foucault who engaged
in both sorts of activities over their careers.

Actually, to extend this, I'd agree with Aldon that some of the names Jason
lists aren't even +post+structuralist (unless we take anything after
Saussure's +Course+ as that).  Levi-Strauss and (early) Barthes (Elements of
Semiology, Writing Degree Zero) are (in my book) structuralists, the later
Barthes post-structuralist, and Derrida somewhere in the debatable lands
between post-structuralism and postmodernism.

As a little bit of not so much intellectual history as tittle-tattle, in the
late sixties, across 68, I was publishing in a poetry magazine at Glasgow
University called +NiK+ [sic], which towards the end, post-68, ran under the
banner:  "The revolution will come when the last bourgeoisie is hung from a
lamppost by the guts of the last capitalist."

I don't know whether this is actually from +The Society of the Spectacle+,
but it was definitely a Situationist slogan, and could be found here and
there across Paris at the time (though there it was enscribed in French,
natch).

I'd also have a hard time considering Theodor Adorno
a "postmodernist," or for that matter, Edward Said, author
of "Humanism and Democratic Criticism."  Or Guy Debord, really.

"The revolution will come when the last bourgeoisie is
> hung from a
> lamppost by the guts of the last capitalist."

Actually, a better translation of the slogan is "Humanity won't be
happy until the last bureaucrat is hung with the guts of the last
capitalist," which itself is a detournement of a statement long
attributed to Diderot but actually written by the atheist priest
Meslier, "Humanity won't be happy until the last priest is hung with
the guts of the last king."

But the scientific method doesn't claim to guarantee success; it
claims to guarantee nothing, in fact. What it hopes to achieve
through systematic honesty and integrity is to fail and fail again
and try to find out why. But there is no guarantee of success! Good
heavens! Where did you get that? Are you sure we're talking about the
same "scientific method", here?

That's not what I said at all. I said that the scientific method
pretty much reduces to honesty and integrity in investigation. Try
not to fool yourself, and remember you're the easiest person for you
to fool; and if you can stick to that, then you won't be casting
about for ways to fool other people into thinking you've got success
you haven't got. Failures are as important as successes. The
scientific method is about success at devising experiments that test
for what you want to test for, and that are transparent so that
others can do the same test and get the same result.

On 13 Jun 2006 at 9:49, Jason Quackenbush wrote:

It's controversial to a postmodernist, isn't it, who believes that
every view is just as good as any other one -- that magic is just as
successful as science, that sex with a virgin will rid you of AIDS,
and so forth.

Actually a good part of the bad science done is done because high
school physics texts, or any other texts, in my experience, don't
talk about the scientific method: what it is and what it isn't. What
it is is a rigorous sort of honesty and integrity, and a willingness
to try and fail and try again.

But they do hold, well enough for our general purposes. We live as if
they hold, and others, as well. Not even a postmodernist would be so
silly as to test whether turning the steering wheel violently to the
left at 70 mph still makes the car flip end for end or not; not even
a postmodernist would drive off a cliff to test whether gravity still
works; not even a postmodernist would see a car ahead of him on the
freeway splash into and stall out in a lake of water and not slow
down and go around it, inferring that the same would happen to his
car.

But postmodernists recognize no evidence -- all views are equally
valid! Why do you keep arguing both sides of this issue?

This is wrenching my metaphorical comment out of context and trying

But that's what anyone must mean who says that all views are equal,
equally valid, equally good. You cannot reasonably hold that all
views are equal and that some views are better than others at making,
for example, engines. If there are views that are better than others
at making engines, then you have to recognize that as a better view,
and that other views of making engines, with eye of newt, say, or
postmodern assertion, are just not as good.

But Alison does; so do several others who've written to support her
views; and you seem to, sometimes.

That's a very inaccurate characterization of my summary of how
science works and what the scientific method is.

Yes, you keep saying the same things I have already said, but in
slightly different words, and pretending that you've said something
different. I didn't claim "science is ... a magical set of formulae
that make things work"; I said that the scientific method is a better
understanding of how not to fool yourself.

i have just returned from adelaide's experimental art foundation where i spent a week in a workshop with three german web 3d experts, of interactive television vangoughtv fame. i share my experiences for those that are interested.

hi
whether you think to bugger is good or bad
or if you think to be buggered is good or bad
by woman or man or furry animal or impersonal plastic,
let us celebrate bugger art

bugger is the name i give to my computer
when it misbehaves
when it does not do what i want it to do
so bugger is really the name for unachieved dreams,
non-physicalised visions
ideas that didn't work
actualisations that didn't realise
solutions that didn't solve the problem
the woodshavings on the sculptor's floor
the recycle/trash on your desktop
the hair at the barber's salon
the bits of cellulloid that buried the old film-maker and analog editor
the mix that's left in the bowl in the sink
the minutes spent waiting for pages to load
the hours spent watching frames, scenes render
this is bugger data
bugger data must be a by-product of art
well i'll be buggered!
like the lanes and alleyways of the city
it is the left over,
refuse space where no bugger goes
the crumbs of meals already eaten,
the smell of wild times already had
the footprints and fingerprints of lives
the realm of the dodgy
the socially morally and culturally buggered
but without the bugger data
there would be no art
if you are not prepared to create bugger data
you will never make art

monday, on the birthday of the queen of england, 12/6/2006.


back at the gold coast
lovely warm days
chilly nights
my own bed and hot shower
karaoke and whiskey
ah its good to be back home
but
that does not mean i didn't enjoy myself in adelaide.
thanks everyone it was just what i needed, a great injection of artists and
art and creative ideas.
it gets so mundane when you are teaching full time.
but meeting like minds is always inspirational.

i also managed to get a fly-through of my 3D model of adelaide constructed
with words created in anim8or and textured and placed into a 3d world in
sketch-up with images of the not-city, the backstreets, lanes and
alleyways. sketch up lets you make multiple pages of your model from
various angles and perspectives and then outputs the pages as frames in a
flythrough movie with smooth transitions as qt and avi. not the
interactivity i wanted out of vrml but it is an effective piece
none-the-less. my goal will be to get it working in a vrml browser the way
i want it displayed (expect emails martin). but for now i am satisfied with
my linear temporally fixed 3d animated text poem on the not-city.

Great!

If anything, in addition to its flexibility and
disposition towards absorbtion of traits belonging to
other tongues and cultures, English, among the many
languages, is detail-oriented (which many simply
aren't--Mandarin is just one example).

The editors at 21 Stars Review are looking for new and established writers
of poetry and prose, with a focus on new writers.

We strive to publish work of the highest quality. We have a strong leaning
toward work that uses constraints, innovative meter and form, or carefully
executed collage/cut-up techniques. Prose with amazing sentences will be
preferred over prose with unamazing sentences. Plotless or
intricately-plotted very short fiction (ideally under 1000 words) is also
something we enjoy.

If you have a particular affinity for or interest in John Ashbery, Jorge
Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Emily Dickinson, Annie Finch, Barbara Guest, Amy
Hempel, Paul Hoover, Harry Mathews, Flann O'Brien, Frank O'Hara, Georges
Perec, Gilbert Sorrentino, Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, Arthur Sze, or
Diane Williams, we would especially like to read your work.

Many thanks C. L. Winks--the posting  in this discussion i've most enjoyed
(for "gallows humor" ho ho!) and found the most informative--as didn't know
of Meslier, though knew the quote.  "The names change, but the game remains
the same" in these slogans through time.  Imagine if instead of country club
jail cells CEOs faced public hangings upside down and guttings like pigs a
la death of Mussolini! Entrails of lobbyists and congresspersons wound
around their necks . . . the heads of the President, VP and Cabinet mounted
on poles in front of the White House . . .

     Adding to Aldon L. Nielsen's post, another person who had a great
influence on Debord--and close contact and  friendship from 1958 until a
nasty break, as so often with Debord, in 1962--is Henri Lefebvre, whose 1947
book CRITIQUE OF EVERDAY LIFE was especially important to the Situationists.
  Lefebvre had been an important Communist Party memeber, expelled when
joining with the SI.  His 1974 book (translated 1990 and gone through
several editions since) THE PRODUCTION OF SPACE contains discussions of
Situationist ideas and projects.
      Like Stalin, whom he obsessively attacks in his films, Denord made
sure no one ever made off with his head--systematically purging over and
over the Situationists to maintain a tight reign so to speak.
      Lefebvre also had an influence on the early Baudrillard, who attended
Lefebvre's lectures in the late 1960s.

This bit about "influences" on Debord (doubtless with their attendant
anxieties) should be qualified: equally important to Guy were folks
like the great Danish artist and theorist Asger Jorn, Lettrists Gil
Wolman and Ivan Chtcheglov, and of course many of his own comrades
during the existence of the Situationist International.

I really think the comparison of Debord with Stalin is frivolous in
the worst way -- after all, Guy never killed anybody (and when French
gutter journalism tried to implicate him in the murder of his friend
Gerard Lebovici, he successfully sued for libel).  As with Andre
Breton, Debord has been dumped on by any number of variously-
intentioned critics for his rigor in personal and political
relationships.  But I say -- let those who have never broken with
anyone in their lives cast the first stone.  And regarding "obsessive
attacks on Stalin" -- substitute "Hitler" for "Stalin" in that phrase
and the extent of its hollowness becomes patent.  One can never attack
dictators enough!

My bad and sorry that's confusing, I didn't mean the success of individual =
scientific progress, i was talking about the wider success of science in th=

ods that won't give you boccilism.

right, I understood you correctly. the philosophical question I'm raising i=
n response to that is how is it that honesty and integrity in investigation=
, in other words being objective, leads to propositions whose truth value i=
s guaranteed (that is, are objectively true) and which therefore have predi=
ctive power, which, lets face it, is what we all expect from something call=
ed the law of gravity. There's no doubt in my mind that this is what goes o=
n when science works. The question for me is really just a semantic and syn=
tactic one, that breaks down to trying to understand the correct analysis o=
f phrases like "scientific knowledge" "scientific theory" and "scientific f=
act" as they relate to the grammar of more general terms like "truth" "fact=
" "real" and "knowledge."

But that's a very boring discussion for people who aren't as fascinated by =
Wittgenstein as I am, so I think I'll leave that discussion there.

I really can't disagree strongly enough with a definition of postmodernism =
that reduces to relativism. Certainly it's the case that a relativist could=
 give a postmodernist account for their relativism, but to my mind postmode=
rn philosophy is characterized by it's anti-foundationalism (that follows o=
ut of the postmodern reading of Nietzche that begins with Heidegger's pheno=
menolog) with respect to metaphysics and epistemology. There are lots of wa=
ys to reject that everything grows out of first principles that don't resul=
t in the sort of relativism you're describing, and I think that Foucault an=
d Sartre, to just name two examples, show a good example of how one can go =
about doing that. Which is not to say that I think Existentialism or the po=
wer/knowledge issues foucault raises are necessarily correct understandings=
 of the world, but both are interesting, raise interesting problems, and ar=
e not in the least bit relativistic.

I'm really not. I'm contesting your conflation of postmodernism with relati=
vism.

I'm new to the list, and I don't know alison, but if she really holds to th=
e views i'll fight her hammer and tongs on that issue, because relativism=
=3D!postmodernism and one can certainly be all manner of postmodern without=
 having to ascribe to a dangerous, self-defeating, and ultimately authorita=
rian view like cultural relativism. As for me, I'm a disciple of the later =
Wittgenstein and hold that view of the world to be the correct approach to =
philosophical issues. To my way of thinking all systems of belief are worth=
 examining for the grammatical structure of its tenets and to see what is r=
eally being said. That doesn't mean that every collection of nonsense that =
anybody spews out purporting to "explain everything" has equal merit as reg=
ards truth value. Most of the time nonsense is just nonsense.

I really do think that we're violently in agreement on that issue.

I don't see any real problem with saying structuralism being a form of postmodern philosophy. To my way of thinking, postmodernist is a big tent adjective in the same way that judaeo-christian is a big tent adjective. there aren't any fundamental tenets that are required in order for the term to apply, rather I'd follow habermas in noting that all that's required of postmodernist thought is just a generally anti-foundationalist attitude following vaguely after heidegger in his rejection of the modernist pursuit the goals of the enlightenment. What one puts in place of the "unfinished project of the enlightenment" doesn't matter so much as that initial rejection which modernist philosophy doesn't accept. Structuralism, post structuralism, deconstruction, existentialism, gadamer's hermeneutics, heidegger's phenomenology, behaviorism, reductionism, post-marxism, post-feminism, critical race theory,
standpoint theory, postcolonialism, maoism, neo-conservatism, science studies, critical theory, gynocentric feminism... They all reject that "unfinished project" in one way or another, and as such, can be described as postmodern even if they don't fit lyotard's criteria of rejecting metanarratives.

Sartre, Camus, and De Beauvoir -- post-modern???????

Maoism -- post-modern?  I didn't realize that the Cultural Revolution
(which was neither) involved "de-centering the subject."  Silly me, I
thought it meant killing real people.

"Critical theory" -- post-modern??  I guess Marx was post-modern,
then.  Come to think of it, maybe Heraclitus was too.

Neo-conservatism too?  Well, some of their exponents are ex-Leninists,
so maybe they're post-Marxists as well, and hence post-modern.
Behaviorism too?  Connect me to those electrodes; I need to
deconstruct my subjectivity.

I guess the one thing that isn't postmodern is terminological
precision, to which this poster seems to have an aversion.

Thanks, David, for all these book refs re the Situationists!

Curious how Jacque Roubaud's approach to Paris fits or does not fit into the
Situationist spirit. I suspect his Oulipo frame does not fit well into
concrete interruptions of an urban space - tho I think he is interrupting it
- at least - on a metaphysical level.
I am speaking here primarily on an intuitive level. I have done so many
different kinds of walks in this City with serendipitously different kinds
of intentions (elegiac to invasive to romantic to political, etc.), I get
overwhelmed with aphasia when it comes to restating my previous reading of
any 'orthodox' approaches to urban space- if 'orthodox' is finally even fair
to Debord at all.

    You wrestle with an essence. Curling alongside someone's
 analogue brogue, you can gorge yourself on animal fat
 on the hoof; you can pounce on opulent ventures still latent
  with sterility; you can grow your order over every other
 face until you walk on unrippled undappled pathways
  and no gaze savages your form. The lookout on the mountain
 grazes unheard trees, even weeps when she finds
 those broken limbs; hot hazy days, the blood of the conquest,
 puddles lapping at the margins of the Lake. A marquee
  on the Lorain Plaza Theatre says something that reads.
 I calculated the lacerations, their rate and their tarry,
  and turned red over end, over and over and over again
 until you walk, striped with tertiary operations,
 through my door. Then you might have looked at me--

but . . . if structuralism is postmodern, what is poststructuralism?  Is the
tent you are erecting so large that it simply includes anybody who is not a
foundationalist?  Are thinkers who believe it is possible to account for all
generation of meaning really in the same camp with people who think that is an
impossible dream?

Alison has said (and holds to) nothing of the sort, and thinks her "views",
such as they are, are speculative at best. Nor does she understand why her
name keeps getting dragged in here and having medals pinned on its lapel
that it has neither earned nor desired. So you can put them dukes down,
mister.

What's boccilism? The creeping infestation of obscure Italian sports
into American life? Okay, okay, I couldn't resist. Just a little
tongue in cheekiness.

But what kind of distinction is "not the success of individual
scientific" projects from such individual scientific projects as
airplanes, satelites, tv, rollercoasters, and the like? You seem to
misunderstand entirely what science is and does, what the scientific
method is and does, and what it means in the world and in philosophy.
I think you have hold of the wrong end of the stick on this, Jason.
If you accept that there is a "wider success" of science and yet call
it a "cargo cult" you are clearly misunderstanding what science is.

It's not "being objective" to engage with problems with the kind of
systematic honesty and integrity that constitutes the scientific
method, though it's certainly "being empirical". You gotta problem
wit' dat?

That's too bad, since that's not how science works at all. Predictive
power is all very well, but to say that a theory has "predictive
power" is not to guarantee success -- it's to give a likelihood of
success. Sometimes the likelihood is very high; sometimes not. Your
characterization of science is a caricature.

Very postmodern of you, I'm sure -- but not very scientific.

I'll be happy to discuss it with you backchannel if you like, but for
my part I'd prefer to keep it frontchannel because the most valuable
things about lists such as this is when two people who know something
about something get into a discussion about that something and chew
over it in a public way; that is, the public forum prevents them from
descending into jargon and elusive allusions and obscurity. The
knowledge that people who are not expert in the field makes the
discussion better.

That's the way it's been presented here. I'm criticising that
presentation of it. Present it differently if you think that
presentation is flawed.

So which is the postmodern philosopher, Socrates or Theatetus in
Plato?

But the scientific method is all about anti-foundationalism. It
accepts everything as contingent, and that it may all shift should
something significant be found to be different than previously
thought. It's just that some things are hard to imagine to be
significantly different. But to a large extent talk of "laws" and the
like is marketing to contest with the appeal of other views as, for
example, the further you get from "hard" science the more you get
referents to such things as "Pareto's Iron Law". It's less iron and
more irony the further it gets into trying to be predictive about
human beings instead of about heat and reactions. But even so, that
everything is contingent is the basis of the scientific method,
because there's always the possiblity that it's all wrong and the
great crocodile god had it right all along.

I'm not conflating it; I'm saying that the advocates and defenders of
it on this list have conflated it; I'm asking whether it makes sense
to do so by asserting their conflation.

Maybe so; but you're the first to assert it here.

Yeah, well, I've found that when you examine many systems of belief,
postmodernism not least among them, you find that what is really
being said is "I don't care if it's wrong or contradictory or
nonsense, I just believe as I was taught to believe, and nyah to
you".

I'll be interested to see what you say to the people who have asked
you other questions about the big tent of postmodernism.

To my way of thinking, postmodern is a pretty clear cut case of what Wittgenstein was talking about in Philosophical Investigations when he was advocating for letting rough, vague terms remain rough vague terms. Yes, Postmodern Philosophy is a great big tent. That's what I was trying to get at with the analogy to the term "Judaeo-Christian." There's not a lot of similarity between the belief systems of a liberal vatican II catholic and a hasidic jew, but they both fall under the same big tent of Judaeo-Christian and they're related in important ways that allowing them to exist under the big tent captures linguistically. Same thing with postmodernism. Sure, the semiotic goals of the structuralists are denied by post-structuralist thinkers. But they are part of a counter-modern tradition of philosophical thought that includes thinkers like rousseau, schopenhauer, nietzche, heidegger, husserl,
and their various twentieth century decendents, all of whom question the possibility of coming up with a complete understanding of philosophical issues by building from a foundational understanding of metaphysics, epistemology, and logic. I do think it's a bit of a shame that nobody bothered to name it until the twentieth century and that it's been stuck with the unfortunate misnomer of "postmodern" rather than a more accurate "contra-modern" or "anti-modern." But postmodern is what we've got.

By way of contrast, various philosophies such as those of marx, hegel, frege, the british empiricists, the continental rationalists, twentieth century analytic philosophy following after Russell/Moore/Wittgenstein (including scientific anti-realists like kuhn and feyerabend), various forms of positivism, logical atomism, and to a certain extent certain currents within pragmatism and neo-pragmatism are decidedly modern, are not concerned with the same sort of program as goes on in postmodern philosophy, and largely disregards the things that go on in continental europe stemming from heidegger, mostly, but also encompassing the semiotics project of the structuralists and post-structuralists. Because of those distinct differences, it's useful to be able to say "These are postmodern philosophies" and "these are modern philosophies" in such a broad way.

This is why, I think, it's important to keep in mind that when one is talking about postmodern art and literature that that's really only coincidentally and/or tangentially related to postmodern philosophy, and it's only in the last thirty years or so that there started to be any real sort of interplay, largely because of the way that literary theory is being taught as if all postmodernity were monolithic and adhered to certain tenets, when, quite frankly, it's idiotic to assume that, for example, just because Russell Edson's poetry is postmodern that there's anything to be gained by the application of Foucault's historo-critical method to it. The problem is in the critics being careless in the deployment of vague terms as if they were precise, and it's the source of much confusion and what Wittgenstein called "philosopher's nonsense" as a result.

Oh for the days of Ted Kooser

I still remember six years ago when Hall, Bly, and Kizer were reading
together in Des Moines. Bly was talking about his "friend, Donald
Hall" repeatedly, but it sure sounded to me and the people that I was
there with like he was saying "Don Ho," until we put 2 & two together.

Now Don Ho as US Poet Laureate.. that would be something.

To my way of thinking, postmodern is a pretty clear-cut case of what
Wittgenstein was talking about here:

464. My aim is: to teach you to pass from a piece of disguised
nonsense to something that is patent nonsense.

The term Judaeo-Christian has a long history, beginning as a
designation of pre-Pauline Christians in Palestine. After the
Holocaust it was called into service as a kind of apology, but, as in
prior usages, only by Christians, and I don't think it's an apology
that's been accepted. Jews use the term when making nice to Christian
or mixed audiences, and only very rarely among themselves. How does
the old saying go? "When I hear that word I reach for my gun."

On a purely theological level, anyone who believes that god had a son
(or even entertains the belief as a metaphor) is in a different tent
in a different world. Jews disagree with each other obsessively, but
not about this.

Exactly. Postmodern is the same sort of word.

Some of you may be aware of Shearsman, Tony Fraser's magazine and
press. Based in Exeter UK, it publishes primarily British and Irish
poetry, though there are a scattering of translations and USians as
well. An essential source, fa who's who of the kind of work people on
this list are likely to be interested in. Tony's editorial taste is unfailing.

Among his offerings is a series of ebooks
(http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/ebooks/ebooks_home.html), the
latest of which is Geoffrey Squires' "Lines." This is poetry
struggling with the edges of what language is capable of expressing,
at the edge of silence. An enactment of and a summary of a lifetime
of thought about the nature of mind and its interface with place and
time, written as carefully as if each word were to be committed to
stone. There are no mistakes.

Only a poet with Squires' wealth of experience could have
accomplished this book. It's a high-wire act without a net or
audience, an act of perfect poise.

Call it wisdom.

I also recommend his "Untitled and Other Poems, 1975-2002," from Wild
Honey Press, another essential source for the best of British and
Irish poetry. Amazon's offering it at $16.00.

The quote you are thinking of is "When I hear talk of the word Culture I
reach for my revolver"--it is usually and famously attributed to Herman
Goering, though originally written in a play by Nazi playwright Hans Johst.

Let me back this up. I am a great admirer of Geoffrey Squires' poetry. Only
it seems to me not written in stone, but something altogether more fluid and
human.

Really, Marcus, by that criterion you would have to dismiss Plato as
postmodernist, as Jason's last three lines could echo aspects of the
Platonic Project.

Mind you, isn't there a strong Plato/Derrida link somewhere?  And I suppose
you could say that Plato was "unscientific", whatever that means, compared
to Aristotle.

But this is becoming deeply convoluted.

I can't be bothered to track down the precise place you say this, Marcus
(late at night/early in the morning, and I'm playing catchup after being
offline for a day or more)  but I had the sense that you're confusing what
is a deeply rooted and conventional description of what constitutes the
material of science (probably rather old fashioned) that turns on the
(dis)provability of propositions, and the nature of the predictive element
in science.  Scientific predictions certainly aren't per se true or false,
but they can be more or less powerful (ie. explain more or fewer phenomena).
This coexists with the predictive element, but isn't the same thing.

I'm not sure that makes entire sense (it is past midnight after a long day)
but I chuck it in here to focus this particular issue, and I'm sure some of
the other participants in this thread will correct me or sharpen up my
point.

Sure, Mark, but isn't it also used to distinguish guilt cultures (the
people[s] of the Book[s] -- Jewish, Christian, and Moslem) from shame
cultures?  Ruth Benedict in +The Chrysanthemum and the Sword+ started this,
I think.

A CALLALOO CALL FOR PAPERS: THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS OF CALLALOO


Callaloo is currently putting together material for an issue to be
published in November 2007 as the last of four special issues
celebrating Callaloo's 30th anniversary. This issue is to focus on
Callaloo's future as an international cultural institution and on the
writers and scholars who will fuel that future.

Over the past thirty years, Callaloo has been an invaluable forum for
the development and critique of the African Diaspora's literature and
culture. As the journal moves into its next thirty years, this issue
will feature personal essays, creative writing, and critical work
illuminating the future of scholarship and literature and Callaloo's
role in their development. As a forecast of the journal's future, this
issue will investigate current trends and opportunities for growth in
literature and in literary cultural studies.



For this 30th anniversary issue engaging the future of Callaloo, we seek
creative work (fiction, poetry, short drama) from writers 45 and under
which represents the future thematic and aesthetic evolution of
literature from the African Diaspora. The focus is not on "experimental"
writing per se, but any innovation in form or subject that forges into
new territory in black literature. We also seek to feature a modest body
of work by new writers who have yet to publish full-length manuscripts.

We also seek short, non-fiction essays (500 words or less) from writers
and scholars of all ages on what they think the future of Callaloo
should or will be.



For the scholarship, we also seek work from scholars 45 and under whose
work uses new and innovative methodologies to deal with established
writers of any era and/or the defining questions of African American
cultural study. We also welcome scholarship dealing with
writers-especially but not exclusively contemporary writers-whose work
has not yet received substantial critical attention.



All manuscripts or other contributions should follow the Callaloo
submission guidelines and be postmarked no later than Friday, December
1st, 2006:

and is that what Godard is referencing in CONTEMPT when the movie producer,
played by Jack Palance, says
"When I hear the word `culture,' I get out my checkbook."

Write Zombie Haiku and Win!

Over at Rock Heals we found ourselves in possession of an extra copy of
Buck Downs' kick-ass new chapdisc (CD), Pontiac Fever, with a directive
to give it away to someone in our readership. Naturally some kind of
poetry contest had to happen -- and so the Zombie Haiku contest began.

Haiku from, about, or just tangentially related to Zombies -- who've
always been a great device for commentary on civil rights and other
disenfranchisement, consumer culture, disease/mortality and/or just a
great plot vehicle for carnage, mayham, and shotguns.
It's easy.
It's fun.
It ends on June 30 (two weeks from today!).

A sample:

stumbling down the street
moonlight reflects off puddles
where is my left arm?

                      /Jason Sweeney/

The submissions have been amazing diverse in approach -- see more here,
but don't let it hedge you in... there are a hundred more angles to ponder:

My point has been all along that there is no "postmodern turn" or
"postmodern event" before which the human condition was one sort of
thing and after which it became "postmodern", as Alison averred. I'm
arguing that postmodernism is a bunch of hooey, not that Plato was a
postmodern so we much reject him!

To the extent that that confusion is characteristic of anyone's
argument here, I was trying to show it's characteristic of Jason's,
not mine. I think i ti s Jason, not me, who has mischaracterized
sccience and the scientific method.

Quaint to think that there was a time when Jews Moslems and
Christians were gathered under one tent. As I said, a long history.
The common use of the term, by presidents and other public speakers
and casually by almost all of us, has little to do with Ruth Benedict.

I don't expect the term to become non-PC; it bugs me nonetheless.
Hopefully we can play nicely together without pretending away difference.

How optimistic of me.

The Comics Journal on Elsewhere #1: "This comic creates an impression of a
foreign land that feels more authentic than a more traditional memoir ever
could. ... Elsewhere #1 reminds us of the power the comics medium can
possess. It might be one of the best uses of the comics form as
autobiography in a long time."

Dear Buffalo listers:

Does anyone have the contact info for New York readings at Bowery or other
locations we don't know about? Cracked Slab Books is publishing Michelle
Noteboom's book Edging this fall and we are looking for a NY Date for her to
read.

Thanks for the help

Hi, friends,

If you're in NYC please check out the following event. I'd love to see you =
all there.

The Trial:

A Historic Response to Contemporary Witch Hunts
by artists Sergio Barrale and Christophe Casamassima

Opening Reception: Thursday July 6th 6-9pm
Exhibition Dates: Thursday July 6th - Thursday July 27th

Tribes Gallery presents the work of artists Sergio Barrale and Christophe C=
asamassima in =93The Trial: A Historic Response to Contemporary Witch Hunts=
.=94=20

Using images and text associated with the Joan of Arc trial Barrale and Cas=
amassima contextualized contemporary witch hunts and clandestine trials inv=
olving political prisoners of faith.

In amazingly detailed pencil drawings on mammoth-sized canvases Barrale rec=
reates the faces of Joan of Arc=92s jury from Carl Dreyer=92s 1928 film =93=
Passion de Jeanne d=92Arc. Sergio Barrale (410) 627-5758 sbarrale@hotmail.c=
om

Casamassima's drawings are made up of layer upon layer of handwriting that =
responds to the accounts of Joan of Arc's jury. They are never erased, but,=
 as we've seen throughout history, testimonials evolve into myth, and the o=
riginal (lost in the translation, so to speak, as Casamassima =93writes=94 =
in English) becomes illegible. Its sense resembles faith and scrutiny, that=
 is, opposites, and that experience is happening immediately on paper. (410=
) 718-6574 furniture_press@graffiti.net

The opening reception on Thursday July 6th from 6 to 9pm will feature music=
ians performing Gregorian chants and classical music. The reception will al=
so feature poets inspired by the life and trials of Joan of Arc as well as =
those who have faced their own trials on Guantanamo Bay.

About Tribes Gallery: The gallery at Tribes mounts a new show of contempora=
ry artwork every month. Each exhibition embraces different media and themes=
, from photographs celebrating jazz to high-tech installations evoking dyst=
opia. Artists are chosen by the gallery for their innovative use of materia=
ls or treatment of subject, for a vision that grows out of a sense of commu=
nity, and for artistic excellence.=20



Christophe Casamassima
Professor Emiritus, Modern Languages & Philology
University of Jamaica Avenue, Queens, N.Y.

Steve -- so typing ain't yr strong suit -- is the title of your book in fact THE
COMPLETE NOTES OF A CHARLES GAYLE NOTE BOOK THE FINAL NIGHT? and would that
indicate a large quantity of Gayle-related poetry?

it sounds post-concert, at any rate --

I never said Jews, Christians and Moslems held identical views, Mark.  (Both
Jews and Moslems, as you pointed out with regard to Judaism, would see the
Christian Trinity as not that much different from polytheism).  I don't
think Ruth Benedict uses the term as such, but her gult culture/shame
culture distinction seems to be another take on it.

I'd be happy to drop the term if you can come up with something else to
describe the same phenomenon -- the NT coming out of the OT, and to a lesser
degree, aspects of the Koran coming out of both.  I just find it useful to
point to something I think does exist.

Um ... I feel I'm being straw-manned here.  <g>  And I dunno that it's PC.
What would be the non-PC version of it if it were?

Just asking.

     Thank you for noting Roubaud--I know some of his work and have read
excerpts from the new book.
     The amount of writing done on the experience of walking around the
"modern" city in the West and later the East is staggering.  (Yes, a lot of
the walking WAS staggering, too!)  I am planning to reread one of the
first--and if memory serves, one of the best in many strange ways
--Thomas De Quincey's CONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH OPIUM EATER.  It sets the
stage so to speak for so many city walking/seeing/thinking/writing books
which make use of altered states of consciousness brought on by hunger, lack
of sleep, homelessness, drugs, alcohol, etc.  Simply prolonged compulsive
walking--dromomania--can begin to cause altered states, especially when the
senses are enervated by the super abundance of stimuli in a city.  Debord's
"Theory of the Derive" which you can find on line does caution against too
prolonged a period of such actiivity.
      There are far too many examples to go into--a few off the top of one's
head of early books are Poe's story "The Man of the Crowd", Whitman,
Thoreau's "Walking", though not a city walking, if one thought of it as
applied to city walking it can make for many interesting things,  HUNGER by
Knunt Hamsun and the St Petersburg-set novels and tales of Gogol and
Dostoyevsky, as well as the works of Baudelaire and Nerval's AURELIA and
many of Rimbaud's works.  Rimbaud himself was a classic dromomaniac--a
fanatic walker in cities--especially London-- and across Eoropean landscapes
including the Alps and previously non-European-explored areas in Abyssinia.
     A very good Oulipo city book is Georges Perec SPECIES OF SPACES AND
OTHER PLACES, as am sure you know.
     A very good and interesting book is Michel de Certeau's THE PRACTICE OF
EVERDAY LIFE.  This has many ideas of subversion carried out via
infiltration through "tactics" of the most ordinary and hence seemingly
"innocent" sort.  Another very interesting aspect of his thinking is that it
cannot be mapped--what he is writing of is fugitive in nature.  This is
quite different from the mapping tendency in many other approaches to
thinking about walking/the arts/the city in all sorts of situations and
contexts, the derive included.
      Two other very interesting books are Kristin Ross' THE EMERGENCE OF
SOCIAL SPACE Rimbaud and the Paris Commune (U Minn P, 1988) and ART AND THE
FRENCH COMMUNE Imagning Paris After War and Revolution by Albert Boime
(Princeton, 1995).  In the former, Ross shows how the Commune permeates and
inhabits the work of Rimbaud, creating both new forms of social space and
poetic spaces. In the latter, Boime examines the ways in which both
architecture and the promotion of Impressionism were used to create a new
vision of Paris in which that of the defeat in war with Prussia and most
especially the bloodbath of the Commune could be effectively expunged from
historical memory.  Interestingly, Ross has written another very good book
MAY '68 AND ITS AFTERLIVES which examines the ways in which the original
questions and actions and politics of May '68 have been shifted with time
away from these to a much more presentable representation of it
culturally--again, a form of expunging a history in favor of bright colors
and glorious notalgia.
        In my own art work and walking etc in the city I think I work
somewhat the inverse of yourself.  I'm guided by Picasso:  "I don't seek, I
find" and Paul Celan:  "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."
  It's not intended to be elegiac, invasive, or romantic and poliitically
it's expressed in the line of Francois Villon as "Parcial suis a toutes luys
commun"--"I'm biased against all laws equally"  (or "impartially").
     (Maybe he's not a good example--after all he was banished from the
city,  Paris --and never heard from again!)
      "Honi soit qui mal y pense"
       (to see the works i mean you can google my name david baptiste chirot
or, though have added nothing new in while, a great deal there in
archives--abt 200 pieces & some essays
etc----davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com)

David - thank you for your ever so generous overview of walking lit (all
puns intended!) And you managed to do it - re France - without mentioning
Proust, Benjamin and Breton - who, I suspect, you would agree are also
essential to the urban bedrock of various kinds of walking and interpreting
city spaces.

Excuse me if sounded arbitrary about the kinds and intentions that may or
may not inform my walks. I don't set out to take a romantic, elegiac,
political, etc. walk. Whatever happens - as an experience or as writing -
is a consequence of the walk, not an intention to make it x, y, or so. To be
open is the operative position. The outcomes are serendipitous.

I wish - as I have probably said here before - that much academic learning
could peripatetic and extra-mural, or a substantial element of any
curriculum. The often sterile monotony of the boxy classroom I often find in
no way as intellectually provocative as learning that emerges from from the
stimulus of pilgrimage.  I just finished leading a walking & writing class
in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, including the Oceana collection at new
De Young Museum - and that was a joy. Rule one, no talking for the first
hour (writing yes), and then the responses and interpretations, etc. But
that's a longer story.

Thanks again for your reading refs (practically 'staggering.' Many are
familiar, almost as friends, many were new and thanks very much for that.

Robin: It's not that big a deal. It's the standard weaselly political use, and the being co-opted (I hate being co-opted) that I find annoying, but I find a lot of things annoying.

My memory of the shame/guilt culture thing doesn't include Moslems, tho perhaps it should. An interesting topic in itself. It always seemed to me to be trying to explainb too much with a simple dichotomy, and none too precisely.

The "we" of course refers to all us children.

Aldon,

Well, Chinese is ideomatic, as you know. Because of
characters, Mandarin cannot easily create new words
for new concepts. Also, it does not easily accept new
words from languages because of its use of characters.

Four years in China, one hopes, has taught me
something (useful).

Not sure I entirely follow this, though I take due note of the elastice
qualifier "easily" below.  What is it about ideomatic characters that should
make it difficult to add new words?

Aldon,

Questions:

Are you at all familiar with Mandarin or languages
that are idiomatic?

How many languages have you studied (either actively
or passively)?

How much time have you spent abroad--and this meaning
traveling, in Bowles' sense, which is very different
from, say, being a tourist or going somewhere and
supposing one is experiencing what is 'down
home'(while being locked into the caste of an entitled
visa)?

To be honest, and forgive the tone, I tend to see this
sort of disingenuous crap too often. At best, and I'm
sure I'm not alone in this feeling, it is vulgar.

Now, I ask these questions because I've essentially
said the same thing two different ways and, I am told,
have done so with clarity (and mostly because I don't
know you and so therefore wonder how serious you are
about your query).

Too, I do not know how well, seriously well, you know
Han culture. Lots of these things, as you know, are
culturally based, our history configuring what it is
our mouths need say, need feel, and how so.

Let us start with this,
AJ

Dear all:

Friend of mine and sometime critic of PRC--and he was
"shut up" or "shouted down" by Chinese fixture (who
happens, ironically enough, and which says something
about how 'business is done' in PRC, an local editor
for the Economist) at Bookworm Beijing's so-called
open mic (hosted dubiously by a Yank, or wonk). And I
know, because I was there.

He is biking across China.

Give it a chance. Follow him and ask questions. He is
a talented writer, terribly broke, a Brit, drinking
buddy and friend.

You can track his progress, if you have time.

Are not all languages by definition idiomatic?

I studied linguistics formally quite a while ago,
so maybe you are using the term in a fashion
that is peculiar to more recent studies.

What does the term mean in your usage here?

When I (and the Random House dictionary) was
younger, idiomatic meant particular to a language.

About Chinese writing, I can't agree that Chinese is not elastic. No =20
language that wasn't capable of adapting and evolving, that didn't =20
possess the power to convey complexity and refined feeling, could =20
have survived so long, or produced works of literature of such =20
subtlety and detail, e.g. Dream of the Red Chamber (written in the =20
mid-18th century), a complex psychological novel which certainly =20
rivals Proust.

90% of Chinese characters are ideo-phonograms, i.e. they are made up =20
of 2 components, one which is a radical (modern Chinese -- since 17th =20=

c. -- has reduced the radicals or keys to 214) and the other, a =20
phonetic (858  phonetic components). The radicals and phonemes =20
combine to constitute words, and the combinations are virtually =20
limitless. This means that a fluent Chinese reader can usually work =20
out new words.

Examples of recent new words in Chinese (sorry if the characters =20
don't come out properly on your comp).

=E5=8D=9A=E5=AE=A2=EF=BC=9A b=C3=B3k=C3=A8 : blogger
where bo means __universal, wide coverage__ (a Ph.D. is a boshi: a =20
literate person with knowledge) and ke means __guest__.

=E4=BA=92=E8=81=94=E7=BD=91=EF=BC=9A h=C3=B9li=C3=A1nw=C7=8Eng : =
internet
=EF=BC=88this is an older word than blogger, but still a good example of =
=20
adaptation to the new world of telecommunications)
hu means _mutual, one another_;  lian means _to link, to have a =20
relationship_; and wang means _a net, a network_.

=E7=BB=A9=E4=BC=98=E8=82=A1=EF=BC=9A j=C3=ACy=C5=8Dug=C7=94: blue chip
j i=3D achievements; you =3D superior; gu =3D share in a company, stocks =
=20
(original meaning was _thigh, section_)

=E5=9F=BA=E5=9B=A0=E7=BB=84: j=C4=ABy=C4=ABnz=C7=94: genome
jiyin =3D here the choice is homophonic (jiyin sounds like gene), but =20=

the characters choice is not aleatory because ji=3Dbase and yin=3Dfactor, =
=20
cause.
zu =3D group

Of course, like anywhere else, some words are simply adopted from =20
English without any transformation, e.g. hip hop. What may annoy some =20=

Americans is that, unlike the French, and many other European =20
peoples, the Chinese language isn't quite at risk of dissolving and =20
disappearing under the imperial pressure of English. But that's =20
another discussion.

On Terminological Precision and Making (Non)Sense

In his Notes to =93Being and Event,=94 Alain Badiou--a "militant of truth"
--positions himself relative to those of his contemporaries =93who make,
for me, some *sense*=94 (482); he notes, too, his proximity to those =93who=

search, at base, to bind the care of the political to the opening of
poetic experience=94 (483).  Among the first names mentioned one finds
Derrida, Deleuze, and Lyotard.  At the same time, he is open to
demonstration or reasoning via the absurd (Med. 24).  (Is there not
something absurd about the =93terminological precision=94 of Badiou's own
dictionary?)

Either one is willing to grant that =93Dissemination=94 (a term which
recurs with some frequency in B&E) =93makes sense=94 or that Lyotard=92s
parables in =93The Inhuman=94 =93make sense=94 or one is not.  I appreciate=
 the
"big tent" sentiment, but is there a point at which tolerance prevents
or obscures necessary decisions?  Put another way, what does
poststructuralism do for our =93sense=94 of =93sense=94?

I would dispute that any of this is toxic for =93science=94; it seems to me=

that =93science=94 could use a good dose of this kind of =93sense.=94  Scie=
nce
may =93work,=94 in the trivial sense already mentioned: cell phones work,
satellites orbit, this message will have been translated and routed,
antihistamines prevent my sneezing overmuch, etc.  But what =93sense=94
does it make when all of this =93work=94 pushes our ecosystems to=96if not
beyond=96their =93natural=94 limits?  What =93sense=94 does it make to prod=
uce
nanoparticles (fullerenes) by the ton when they are capable of crossing
the blood-brain barrier and destroying brains?  What =93sense=94 does it
make to continue contributing to an electronic archive that requires
more and more energy every day (a four-story cooling tower built near
cheap hydroelectric power in Google=92s latest venture)?  What=92s the
sense of working?

We cannot control the migration of terminology any more than Monsanto
can control the spread of Roundup Ready pollen.

An example: I have been trying to make sense of Barrett Watten=92s
extension of George Lakoff.  In =93The Constructivist Moment,=94 one finds
at least three terms drawn from Lakoff=92s description of metaphor
(although Watten never explicitly acknowledges this): mapping, source
and target.  Where Lakoff speaks of source and target domains (in the
metaphor Life is a Journey, Life is the Target onto which we map, from
our Source domain, conventional knowledge about Journeys), Watten says
=93source text and target form=94 (31-32).  I am not sure what =93sense=94 =
this
makes, although given the power of Watten=92s thinking as a
whole=96especially evident for me in Ch. 6=96I am willing to grant that it
makes a =93sense=94 that will become apparent if I give it time.  On the
other hand, perhaps I=92d rather spend my time putting Lakoff=92s
=93empirically responsible=94 terms to work as is.

Two quotations for anyone still interested:

=93How can one have spent one=92s life with words as defining,
indispensable, heavy and light, yet inexact, as those [=91soul,=92 =91mind,=
=92
=91spirit,=92 =91body,=92 =91sense,=92 =91world=92]?  With words of which o=
ne has to
admit that one has never understood anything?  And to admit this while
discharging oneself of any true guilt in the matter?=94 (Derrida, =93On
Touching=94 7)

=93Although the genuine though never radically clarified idea of
philosophy has by no means been completely sacrificed, the multiplicity
of philosophies, which can hardly be comprehended any more,
nevertheless has the result that it is no longer divided into
scientific directions, such that they could still seriously work
together, carry on a scientific dialogue through criticism and
countercriticism, and still guide the common idea of one science toward
the path of realization, in the manner of the directions within modern
biology of mathematics and physics; rather, they are contrasted as
societies of aesthetic style, so to speak, analogous to the
=91directions=92 and =91currents=92 in the fine arts.  Indeed, in the
splintering of philosophies and their literature, is it still possible
at all to study them seriously as works of one science, to make use of
them critically and to uphold the unity of the work done?  The
philosophies have their effects.  But must one not honestly say that
they have their effects as impressions, that they =91inspire,=92 that they
move the feelings like poems, that they arouse vague =91intimations=92?=94
(Husserl, =93Crisis of European Sciences=94 196)

Who can distinguish rigorously between, or even define in the first
place, a =93philosophical=94 and a =93literary=94 =93effect=94?  And a fina=
l
related question, blending Derrida and Olson: Where is the poetics
community as concerns the critter homo sap?

Many thanks to those who raise the matter of walking.

OK -- your very first question already throws us right back into the patch we
were trying to get out of -- I am not at all familiar with Mandarin, which is
why I was hoping to get an explanation of what you meant instead of all this --

I was thrown off by your spelling in your first post -- or typing (at which I am
surely no better) -- but now I see that you truly did mean "idiomatic" and that
you clearly are using it in a manner that differs from the usage in my
linguistics courses of long ago -- which confusion I see that I share with
George -- I know of no languages that are not replete with idiomatic
expressions -- you appear to intend "idiomatic" in another sense that I am not
familiar with -- so enlighten me --

nor do I know much of Han culture -- but that's not the point here, and I fail
to see how anything in my previous question deserves this tantrum
("disingenuous crap"?)  Are you suggesting that I cannot possibly understand
what you mean unless I already have a deep comprehension of Han culture?

What I said was that I was having a problem understanding why the fact that a
language is written in ideommatic or idiomatic or whatever you really meant
characters should in and of itself be a hindrance to the addition of words to
its vocabulary -- I meant it as  serious question -- you may have said the same
thing twice clearly, but what you said was certainly not an answer to my
question -- If you just don't feel inclined to answer, fine -- but that has
little or nothing to do with my travels and background -- and seems to have
even less to do with a language's being details oriented --

Even the dreaded Wikipedia tells me more than you seem willing to:

'Interestingly, many Chinese characters are likewise idiomatic constructs, as
their meanings are more often not traceable to a literal (ie. pictographic)
meaning of their assembled parts, or radicals. Because all characters are
composed from a relatively small base of about 214 radicals, their assembled
meanings follow several different modes of interpretation - from the
pictographic to the metaphorical to those whose original meaning has been lost
in history.'

Now this happens to coincide almost exactly with the meaning of "idiomatic" as
I've learned it -- but I still would like to know what this has to do with the
difficulty of expanding the vocabulary or being details oriented ---

These sorts of considerations as highlighted in the derrida quote, and the description of watten and badiou's considerations (that I have not read),
always highlight to me the great travesty that is the fact that Philosophical Investigations wasn't translated into French before poststructuralism
got going. No one who's read that book carefully can take this sort of project seriously. just a couple of quotes:
(raising the matter of walking):
"We have got onto slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are
not able to walk. We want to walk, so we need friction: back to the rough ground."
-Ludwig Wittgenstein PI 107

and

"Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screwdriver, a rule, a glue-pot, nails and screws.—The function of words are as
diverse as the functions of these objects."
PI 11

About reading the few intro-reviews of Being & Event: I'm skeptical given the fact that everyone who writes about it seems to accept that Badiou's
work will only be comprehensible to people with advanced training in philosophy. As someone with a little advanced training in philosophy, I have
never once encountered any such claim that bore itself out. the answers to the questions philosophy poses, should they exist, should not require
post-graduate research, and when such answers make such claims to their comprehensibility they are generally easily dismissed on the sorts of grounds
Wittgenstein gives for transmuting bits of patent nonense into bits of plain nonsense.

As for the constructivist moment, well, i think the less said by me about that, the better. Suffice it to say I tend to view language theory of that
sort with little more than a shrug and a "so what?", particularly given it's unprincipled acceptance of certain class divisions within american
culture. If it were very popular, it might be worth arguing against or at least coming to terms with, but as it seems relatively combined to academia,
I have no real interest in it.

To clarify: that's is not to say that I'm not interested in Language poetry. Hejinian's My Life is one of my favorite books, and it was with a great
deal of childlike glee that I finished reading my printout of Silliman's Chinese Notebook. I just don't find the various Language poets' justification
  for writing the way they do to be particularly compelling and would much rather interact with their poetry in a more intuitive way. Which is to say,
again agreeing with Uncle Ludwig, some things cannot be explained but only shown in language. I think what the critical theory of language poetry
fails time and again to explain is generally quite readily shown by the more successful works of various poets working in that tradition. Furthermore,
I find when I read someone like Bernstein or Howe with the sorts of foregrounding of materiality and textualness that critics like watten laud, i find
the poetry much less interesting than if i just read it like a borgesian map of a nation that could never possibly exist and follow the lines accordingly.

Hi all -

Reviews on TN this week -

Eldorado by Marius von Mayenburg, directed by Benedict Andrews. The Session
written and performed by The Ennio Morricone Experience. Both at the
Malthouse Theatre until June 25.

A black mirror is a fit metaphor with which to begin this riveting play, a
parable about human self-destruction. Marius von Mayenburg presents a vision
of humanity as desolate as that of WG Sebald in his novel Vertigo, when he
speaks of the slow, inevitable conflagration of the earth: we consume all
life on our planet with the creeping flame of desertification or the swift
fire of war, leaving behind us a wasteland of ash.

Eldorado begins with a monologue murmured by the property speculator
Aschenbrenner (Robert Menzies), who leans half-lit against the window, his
voice artifically miked so we hear every inflection of his speech. He
reports, seductively, tenderly, on the progress of an urban war. It is
unsettlingly familiar: the language could be taken from any contemporary
news report on the invasion of Baghdad or the destruction of Falluja. Only,
it seems, this war is occurring in the same unnamed western city in which
our suave businessman is living, not in some distant theatre of conflict in
the Middle East or the Third World; this is a play which collapses
perspectives of distance and time. It finishes with Aschenbrenner again, but
this time he speaks as one of the dead: and now he tells us of a new life on
Mars, of atmospheres artificially created by water, where humanity can find
a new home. Like Aschenbrenner (whose very name conjures flame and ash),
planet Earth is dead.

Circus Oz: Laughing at Gravity tour. At the Big Top at Birrarung Marr until
July 9.

I have been very spoilt in the past couple of weeks. It is as if Melbourne
theatre has decided to show me the best it has to offer, from its tiny
alternative theatres to its main stages. And then, just to remind me that
vital theatre isn't exactly a new thing here, I found myself in the Big Top
at Birrarung Marr, just off Federation Square, watching Circus Oz's latest
show.

Kevin,
I appreciate these comments and the ancillary questions more than you =
can ever begin to imagine; you have brought into sharper focus for me a =
peripheral thought I'd been struggling with for some time regarding the =
Post Modern/ Post Structural and perhaps even the Post Menopausal mess =
of some thought and commentary here on posted. =20

I'm particularly fond of the thought expressed by these words of yours: =
"...What "sense" does it make to produce nanoparticles (fullerenes) by =
the ton when they are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and =
destroying brains?  What "sense" does it make to continue contributing =
to an electronic archive that requires more energy every day (a =
four-story cooling tower built near cheap hydroelectric power in =
Google's latest venture)? What's the sense of working?" =20

I rather like that questioning approach, but then I wonder, Isn't the =
answer simple: Because, we are people; it's what we do?=20

A few years back, I hiked and came upon a beaver's dam in a stream that =
flowed across an Alpine meadow.  Land around the dam was bogged and =
water-logged forming a wide semi-circular pond almost two acres in area =
up stream and behind the damn dam. =20

I was pleased at first, happening upon this pristine residence of one of =
nature's own.  Then, I sat in water nearly waist deep and looked at the =
earth underneath wondering how many critters died in the flood waters =
created by the beaver's dam.  In those meadows are all sorts of rodents, =
countless numbers of non amphibious insects, perhaps some nests from =
meadow nesting birds, and then, there was the vegetation that just =
didn't like having soggy roots and died from over-watering. =20

Why, one must ask, do beavers do that, create a habitat that results in =
the deaths of so many other animals, insects and plants?  (And of =
course, I've not mentioned here the fact that to make the dam the =
beavers nipped to death some pretty healthy aspen trees.)  This scene is =
repeated countless times in thousands of meadows across the land =
annually. =20

The answer of course is equally simple: Because they are beavers; it's =
what they do. =20

Do you ever wonder if there are beavers who don't dam streams?  Beavers =
who speak of eco-system destruction caused by their damn dams?  Beavers =
who worry about leaving their world a better place than what they were =
born into?  Beavers who try to teach their young alternative life-styles =
and sustainable aqua-culture? =20

Or would that questioning be peculiar to a species who imagines itself =
as Stewards, creatures better than the dam-building beaver, rather than =
seeing itself as merely another resident of this space in a specific =
time? =20

Is there engineering and scientific skill in what the beaver did? Or is =
it rather that we elevate science and engineering to a level unworthy; =
the knowledge from science (and engineering) might merely be the =
accident of activity resulting in providing new skills for the dna to =
assimilate, weather practiced in pure environs or learned from actual =
experiences?  Oh, my...where is Dorothy when we need her? =20

Can life really be nothing more than a complex series of electro, =
bio-chemical connections occurring randomly and passed on genetically =
through all the myriad of species?  But what of Jesus?  =20

 And what of poetry?  What would John Milton say:=20

 Of man's first disobedience and of the fruit of that forbidden tree...?

Anyway, thanks for the commentary and the questions; I did enjoy the =
read.=20
Alex=20

  Subject: Stop Making Sense?


  On Terminological Precision and Making (Non)Sense

  In his Notes to "Being and Event," Alain Badiou--a "militant of truth"
  --positions himself relative to those of his contemporaries "who make, =

  for me, some *sense*" (482); he notes, too, his proximity to those =
"who=20
  search, at base, to bind the care of the political to the opening of=20
  poetic experience" (483).  Among the first names mentioned one finds=20
  Derrida, Deleuze, and Lyotard.  At the same time, he is open to=20
  demonstration or reasoning via the absurd (Med. 24).  (Is there not=20
  something absurd about the "terminological precision" of Badiou's own=20
  dictionary?)

  Either one is willing to grant that "Dissemination" (a term which=20
  recurs with some frequency in B&E) "makes sense" or that Lyotard's=20
  parables in "The Inhuman" "make sense" or one is not.  I appreciate =
the=20
  "big tent" sentiment, but is there a point at which tolerance prevents =

  or obscures necessary decisions?  Put another way, what does=20
  poststructuralism do for our "sense" of "sense"?

  I would dispute that any of this is toxic for "science"; it seems to =
me=20
  that "science" could use a good dose of this kind of "sense."  Science =

  may "work," in the trivial sense already mentioned: cell phones work,=20
  satellites orbit, this message will have been translated and routed,=20
  antihistamines prevent my sneezing overmuch, etc.  But what "sense"=20
  does it make when all of this "work" pushes our ecosystems to-if not=20
  beyond-their "natural" limits?  What "sense" does it make to produce=20
  nanoparticles (fullerenes) by the ton when they are capable of =
crossing=20
  the blood-brain barrier and destroying brains?  What "sense" does it=20
  make to continue contributing to an electronic archive that requires=20
  more and more energy every day (a four-story cooling tower built near=20
  cheap hydroelectric power in Google's latest venture)?  What's the=20
  sense of working?

  We cannot control the migration of terminology any more than Monsanto=20
  can control the spread of Roundup Ready pollen.

  An example: I have been trying to make sense of Barrett Watten's=20
  extension of George Lakoff.  In "The Constructivist Moment," one finds =

  at least three terms drawn from Lakoff's description of metaphor=20
  (although Watten never explicitly acknowledges this): mapping, source=20
  and target.  Where Lakoff speaks of source and target domains (in the=20
  metaphor Life is a Journey, Life is the Target onto which we map, from =

  our Source domain, conventional knowledge about Journeys), Watten says =

  "source text and target form" (31-32).  I am not sure what "sense" =
this=20
  makes, although given the power of Watten's thinking as a=20
  whole-especially evident for me in Ch. 6-I am willing to grant that it =

  makes a "sense" that will become apparent if I give it time.  On the=20
  other hand, perhaps I'd rather spend my time putting Lakoff's=20
  "empirically responsible" terms to work as is.

  Two quotations for anyone still interested:

  "How can one have spent one's life with words as defining,=20
  indispensable, heavy and light, yet inexact, as those ['soul,' 'mind,' =

  'spirit,' 'body,' 'sense,' 'world']?  With words of which one has to=20
  admit that one has never understood anything?  And to admit this while =

  discharging oneself of any true guilt in the matter?" (Derrida, "On=20
  Touching" 7)

  "Although the genuine though never radically clarified idea of=20
  philosophy has by no means been completely sacrificed, the =
multiplicity=20
  of philosophies, which can hardly be comprehended any more,=20
  nevertheless has the result that it is no longer divided into=20
  scientific directions, such that they could still seriously work=20
  together, carry on a scientific dialogue through criticism and=20
  countercriticism, and still guide the common idea of one science =
toward=20
  the path of realization, in the manner of the directions within modern =

  biology of mathematics and physics; rather, they are contrasted as=20
  societies of aesthetic style, so to speak, analogous to the=20
  'directions' and 'currents' in the fine arts.  Indeed, in the=20
  splintering of philosophies and their literature, is it still possible =

  at all to study them seriously as works of one science, to make use of =

  them critically and to uphold the unity of the work done?  The=20
  philosophies have their effects.  But must one not honestly say that=20
  they have their effects as impressions, that they 'inspire,' that they =

  move the feelings like poems, that they arouse vague 'intimations'?"=20
  (Husserl, "Crisis of European Sciences" 196)

  Who can distinguish rigorously between, or even define in the first=20
  place, a "philosophical" and a "literary" "effect"?  And a final=20
  related question, blending Derrida and Olson: Where is the poetics=20
  community as concerns the critter homo sap?

  Many thanks to those who raise the matter of walking.

  Yrs in dromomania,

Great stuff, I must say. And I'm aware that some might
disagree with what I've stated, which was very
general, either for reasons of politics or accuracy
(and sometimes in such rows, let me say, it can be
difficult to, well, differentiate) -- and I've
received some back channel thoughts on this --
including some suggestions that I read particular
texts. Whatever the case, as they say, remarks have
been informative and, well, appreciated.

Now, and certainly I've not done my best work, let me
say, with regards to explaining myself, the language
used in such explainations and clearly no elaboration
has been made, nor examples given. Let us not forget,
if you'll give me a moment, that I'm not currently in
the comfort of my home or country (so, please, give me
some room to work on this thesis more thoughtfully).

And no, Simon, who back channelled me and said I was
idiotic, no I am not embarrassed -- for either I am
correct in my observations, because they are that, me
working and teaching in China for four years or,
thanks to people like Aldon and George, I will have
correct information for next time round.

Alexander, I think, may be conflating ideographic (written languages
like Chinese and Japanese that use characters based on ideas) and
idiomatic, which Chinese writing is, but so is every natural
language, no?

He also seems to be confusing an honest request to clarify a very
elliptical and not at all self-evident claim with "disingenuous crap."

But most interesting to me, Alex, and anyone who is interested in a
slight change of subject, is that you are confusing experience and
authority. Being a foreigner in China, even living there for some
time, while it must be a rich experience, certainly is not enough on
its own to make someone an authority in comparative linguistics, and
conversely not having lived there is not enough to disqualify someone
from understanding comparative linguistics.

The part of what you said that irks me, though, is this:
"traveling, in Bowles' sense, which is very different from, say,
being a tourist or going somewhere and supposing one is experiencing
what is 'down home' (while being locked into the caste of an entitled
visa)?"

This is an old argument, but one that I'm sort of wrapped up in right
now because I'm working on some stories about travel experiences. The
distinction between "traveller" and "tourist" seems to me just as
self-important and deluded as the old-fashioned tourist persona that
it was meant to critique. Does the authenticity of one's experience
in another country depend on what kind of visa you have? If you visit
China for a month instead of a year, does that mean you were not
really in China, that your experiences there were somehow fake? And
if you stay there for four years does that mean you know what it's
like to be Chinese? At best, this idea is "disingenuous crap."

The idea concerns the fact that this country wants nostalgia. They want
to go back as far as they can – even if it's only as far as last week.
Not to face now or tomorrow, but to face backwards. And yesterday was
the day of our cinema heroes riding to the rescue at the last possible
moment. The day of the man in the white hat or the man on the white
horse - or the man who always came to save America at the last moment –
someone always came to save America at the last moment – especially in
“B” movies. -- gill scott heron

Well, the first thing I want to say is…”Mandate my ass!”

Because it seems as though we've been convinced that 26% of the
registered voters, not even 26% of the American people, but 26% of the
registered voters form a mandate – or a landslide. 21% voted for Skippy
and 3, 4% voted for somebody else who might have been running.

But, oh yeah, I remember. In this year that we have now declared the
year from Shogun to Reagan, I remember what I said about Reagan…meant
it. Acted like an actor…Hollyweird. Acted like a liberal. Acted like
General Franco when he acted like governor of California, then he acted
like a republican. Then he acted like somebody was going to vote for him
for president. And now we act like 26% of the registered voters is
actually a mandate. We're all actors in this I suppose.

What has happened is that in the last 20 years, America has changed from
a producer to a consumer. And all consumers know that when the producer
names the tune…the consumer has got to dance. That's the way it is. We
used to be a producer – very inflexible at that, and now we are
consumers and, finding it difficult to understand. Natural resources and
minerals will change your world. The Arabs used to be in the 3rd World.
They have bought the 2nd World and put a firm down payment on the 1st
one. Controlling your resources we'll control your world. This country
has been surprised by the way the world looks now. They don't know if
they want to be Matt Dillon or Bob Dylan. They don't know if they want
to be diplomats or continue the same policy - of nuclear nightmare
diplomacy. John Foster Dulles ain't nothing but the name of an airport now.

The idea concerns the fact that this country wants nostalgia. They want
to go back as far as they can – even if it's only as far as last week.
Not to face now or tomorrow, but to face backwards. And yesterday was
the day of our cinema heroes riding to the rescue at the last possible
moment. The day of the man in the white hat or the man on the white
horse - or the man who always came to save America at the last moment –
someone always came to save America at the last moment – especially in
“B” movies. And when America found itself having a hard time facing the
future, they looked for people like John Wayne. But since John Wayne was
no longer available, they settled for Ronald Reagan – and it has placed
us in a situation that we can only look at – like a “B” movie.

Come with us back to those inglorious days when heroes weren't zeros.
Before fair was square. When the cavalry came straight away and
all-American men were like Hemingway to the days of the wondrous “B”
movie. The producer underwritten by all the millionaires necessary will
be Casper “The Defensive” Weinberger – no more animated choice is
available. The director will be Attila the Haig, running around
frantically declaring himself in control and in charge. The ultimate
realization of the inmates taking over at the asylum. The screenplay
will be adapted from the book called “Voodoo Economics” by George “Papa
Doc” Bush. Music by the “Village People” the very military "Macho Man."

“Company!!!”
“Macho, macho man!”
“ Two-three-four.”
“ He likes to be – well, you get the point.”
“Huuut! Your left! Your left! Your left…right, left, right, left, right…!”

A theme song for saber-rallying and selling wars door-to-door. Remember,
we're looking for the closest thing we can find to John Wayne. Clichés
abound like kangaroos – courtesy of some spaced out Marlin Perkins, a
Reagan contemporary. Clichés like, “itchy trigger finger” and “tall in
the saddle” and “riding off or on into the sunset.” Clichés like, “Get
off of my planet by sundown!” More so than clichés like, “he died with
his boots on.” Marine tough the man is. Bogart tough the man is. Cagney
tough the man is. Hollywood tough the man is. Cheap stick tough. And
Bonzo's substantial. The ultimate in synthetic selling: A Madison Avenue
masterpiece – a miracle – a cotton-candy politician…Presto! Macho!

“Macho, macho man!”

Put your orders in America. And quick as Kodak your leaders duplicate
with the accent being on the nukes - cause all of a sudden we have
fallen prey to selective amnesia - remembering what we want to remember
and forgetting what we choose to forget. All of a sudden, the man who
called for a blood bath on our college campuses is supposed to be Dudley
“God-damn” Do-Right?

“You go give them liberals hell Ronnie.” That was the mandate. To the
new “Captain Bly” on the new ship of fools. It was doubtlessly based on
his chameleon performance of the past - as a liberal democrat – as the
head of the Studio Actor's Guild. When other celluloid saviors were
cringing in terror from McCarthy – Ron stood tall. It goes all the way
back from Hollywood to hillbilly. From liberal to libelous, from “Bonzo”
to Birch idol…born again. Civil rights, women's rights, gay rights…it's
all wrong. Call in the cavalry to disrupt this perception of freedom
gone wild. God damn it…first one wants freedom, then the whole damn
world wants freedom.

Nostalgia, that's what we want…the good ol' days…when we gave'em hell.
When the buck stopped somewhere and you could still buy something with
it. To a time when movies were in black and white – and so was
everything else. Even if we go back to the campaign trail, before
six-gun Ron shot off his face and developed hoof-in-mouth. Before the
free press went down before full-court press. And were reluctant to
review the menu because they knew the only thing available was – Crow.

Lon Chaney, our man of a thousand faces - no match for Ron. Doug Henning
does the make-up - special effects from Grecian Formula 16 and Crazy
Glue. Transportation furnished by the David Rockefeller of Remote
Control Company. Their slogan is, “Why wait for 1984? You can panic
now...and avoid the rush.”

So much for the good news…

As Wall Street goes, so goes the nation. And here's a look at the
closing numbers – racism's up, human rights are down, peace is shaky,
war items are hot - the House claims all ties. Jobs are down, money is
scarce – and common sense is at an all-time low on heavy trading. Movies
were looking better than ever and now no one is looking because, we're
starring in a “B” movie. And we would rather had John Wayne…we would
rather had John Wayne.

"You don't need to be in no hurry.
You ain't never really got to worry.
And you don't need to check on how you feel.
Just keep repeating that none of this is real.
And if you're sensing, that something's wrong,
Well just remember, that it won't be too long
Before the director cuts the scene…yea."

“This ain't really your life,
Ain't really your life,
Ain't really ain't nothing but a movie.”

[Refrain repeated about 25 times or more in an apocalyptic crescendo
with a military cadence.]

“This ain't really your life,
Ain't really your life,
Ain't really ain't nothing but a movie.”

Another koan-ish line from EzP. I've yet to spot an insightful glossing  from
Poundians on this enigma, so we're deliriously on our own. Carroll  Terrell's
massive _A Companion to the Cantos_ only glosses this bit as  "progress":
"Note repetition of this line." (?) Do the three spaced apostrophes  indicate the
line "that's progress, me yr" should be repeated twice more, sorta  like how
a repetitive musical phrase is sometimes indicated by the phrase  itself, then
repeated three more times thus / / / ? William Cookson offers nada  in his
Guide re me yr/se call it progress.

But look at the context: That section appears to be Ez in his Pisan cage,
overhearing his fellow American POWs, their idiolect and repartee. Pound seems
to be commenting on "criminals and their intellectual interests." And two
African Americans are overheard (at least one of them suspected of murder), and
one apparently (suddenly?) and ironically drops a line of Latin, "ante mortem
no  scortum" ("before death no prostitute").

Or is it mad Ez saying before death no prostitute? If so, it seems to
harmonize with EP's sarcastic tones; they don't let you have a hooker before  they
hang you anymore. That's some sorta "moral progress"?

"Me" in italian: me, myself. BUT: "yr"??? That's got me.

As of today, I gloss this bit as "That's progress from me to you. That's
progress. That's progress. Yea, call it progress."

Your working gloss PQ?

Ishaq---
thanks for posting B-Movie; that was my first experience w/ G S-H.
I've heard most of the old albums, and saw him live alot in the 80s
(once, in Philly, he was with Linton Kwesi,
and said "people are wondering when I'm gonna put a new album out;
well, i say, when you buy the old ones"----I love that)

Anyway, I've definitely heard some hatin on heron in recent years,
and when I saw your post, I feared that he wasn't still alive,
so it's good to hear he's still doing stuff with the hip-hop scene...
but even if he wasn't still active, he's certainly done enough already--
one of the greats

Reviewed by Eric Yost=20
While many poets want to take poetry  from academia to the streets, Larissa=20
Shmailo's  "=20
The No-Net World" shows what poets  might do when they get there.=20
The eighteen poems on this disc are  powerfully read by the author. Selected=
=20
from her ten years deep in the  New York poetry scene, some are  accompanied=
=20
by Bobby Perfect=E2=80=93whose performance here measures up to his name.  Sh=
mailo's=20
voice and technique are impressive, as is her ability to span worlds  and re=
sist=20
labels and ideologies.=20
The No-Net World, the CD's title  poem, goes inside the life of someone who=20
imperceptibly, and through no fault of  her own, spirals into poverty and=20
homelessness. This gut-wrenching poem works so  well not only because Shmail=
o knows=20
our flawed local and national social support  systems, but also because her=20
innate compassion allows her writing to get inside  other voices and other=20
lives. At a time when poets are more concerned with  polishing the hipness o=
f=20
their self-image or marketing their signature voices,  Shmailo has the coura=
ge and=20
heart to put aside self and show us Other. In her  handling of other voices,=
=20
demonstrated in poems like "Williamsburg Poem, "  "Madwoman," and "Johnny I=20
Love You Don't Die," Shmailo ranks among our very  finest poets.=20
It is perhaps because of this intense  consciousness of the other that the=20
poem The No-Net World has become an anthem  for help for the homeless, trave=
ling=20
from poets to political groups, from  Loisaida to the pamphlets of the=20
Australian Worker=E2=80=99s Party, published by Street  News, performed and=20=
recorded by=20
other poets.=20
The collection balances insights  forged by regret, such as =E2=80=9CDeath a=
t Sea"=20
and  "California," with pure vital  force, such as "In Paran" and "Shore." W=
ith=20
rhythmic insistence and intelligent  energy, Shmailo diagnoses the lemming's=
=20
rush of culture in "Lager  NYC."=20
Then there are her translations of  Pushkin and Mayakovsky. Shmailo avoids=20
the traps of a purely functional  equivalent reading. Instead, she gives us=20
Pushkin's semantic load complete,  without sacrificing the meter or tonality=
 of=20
the original. In this she recalls  Nabokov's translation of "Eugene Onegin,"=
 but=20
without the pedantry that  sometimes mars that great writer's efforts.=20
Shmailo, who has worked as a  scientific Russian translator for NASA, brings=
 the=20
poems to us whole and  literally doesn't miss a beat.=20
Finally, there is "How My Family  Survived the Camps," a gripping account of=
=20
life as a slave worker for the Nazis,  where the only way out is through a=20
smokestack in Dora Camp. Here guilt and  necessity merge into a stoic hymn t=
o=20
pure survival, a testament of courage and  resourcefulness that we should ne=
ver=20
be without. If, as Ahkmatova said, "in this  most Christian of worlds, all=20
poets are Jews," Shmailo shows us the transcendent  destiny of insisting on=20
ourselves. Every serious poet should have this CD  available as a reminder o=
f the=20
standards to which we  aspire.=20

OK Ishaq -- If you want to interpret my attempt to get people to pay more
attention to Gil as hatin and buryin, that's your business -- Have you spoken
with him lately?   My comment about the pain of looking back to his brighter
moments was an expression of just that, pain -- I wish that he was in better
shape today than he is -- I wish that I was in better shape than I am -- I wish
Gil and I were still walking down P St. -- I wish you had some freakin' idea of
what you were talking about --

and for people who might have missed it in the 90s, give a listen to Gil's
SPIRITS CD, which includes his heartfelt message to the below referenced hip
hop commuity -- a well as his great lyrics to a Coltrane melody -- He's been on
LIVE AT THE KNITTING FACTORY in recent times, but there've been no more
official CDs since then -- At the time of his arrest a couple years back, he
told reporters that he had hundreds of pages of an autobiography done -- I
really hope he'll get that finished and published one of these days --

Also in BLACK WAX you'll see Gil walking with his then quite young daughter -- A
lovely child -- don't know what's become of her or her mother in the years
since --

"Well, the first thing I want to say is..."

let's make it ruff

"Nostalgia, that's what we want...the good ol' days...when we gave'em hell."

there's a good reason why you're not walking down the street along side
a great bruh like bruh heron -- you disrespectful, shit talkin, sellout
ivory tower frontin mofo

who'd roll with you?

you ain't heron and i sure ain't cube and muggs

so who

calls you out

let's get the big'un

schools out

peace to bruh heron

and

still more the nations

his sonics fuels many EOns

for the final days  of our attack

And as "quick as kodak"

we now learning what  is real

the negative is not black

from the ashes comes boom boxes jammin out his tracks

it's the kids kickin it analogue to digital

from crimmals turn to rebels

"come with us..."

the meaning in the decibels

what got our brutha's back.

if it's a moment of invective, then two of the omitted characters might be

>Reviewed by Eric Yost
>While many poets want to take poetry  from academia to the streets, Larissa
>Shmailo's  "
>The No-Net World" shows what poets  might do when they get there.
>The eighteen poems on this disc are  powerfully read by the author.
>Selected
>from her ten years deep in the  New York poetry scene, some are
>accompanied
>by Bobby Perfectâ€“whose performance here measures up to his name.
>Shmailo's
>voice and technique are impressive, as is her ability to span worlds  and
>resist
>labels and ideologies.
>The No-Net World, the CD's title  poem, goes inside the life of someone who
>imperceptibly, and through no fault of  her own, spirals into poverty and
>homelessness. This gut-wrenching poem works so  well not only because
>Shmailo knows
>our flawed local and national social support  systems, but also because her
>innate compassion allows her writing to get inside  other voices and other
>lives. At a time when poets are more concerned with  polishing the hipness
>of
>their self-image or marketing their signature voices,  Shmailo has the
>courage and
>heart to put aside self and show us Other. In her  handling of other
>voices,
>demonstrated in poems like "Williamsburg Poem, "  "Madwoman," and "Johnny I
>Love You Don't Die," Shmailo ranks among our very  finest poets.
>It is perhaps because of this intense  consciousness of the other that the
>poem The No-Net World has become an anthem  for help for the homeless,
>traveling
>from poets to political groups, from  Loisaida to the pamphlets of the
>Australian Workerâ€™s Party, published by Street  News, performed and
>recorded by
>other poets.
>The collection balances insights  forged by regret, such as â€œDeath at
>Sea"
>and  "California," with pure vital  force, such as "In Paran" and "Shore."
>With
>rhythmic insistence and intelligent  energy, Shmailo diagnoses the
>lemming's
>rush of culture in "Lager  NYC."
>Then there are her translations of  Pushkin and Mayakovsky. Shmailo avoids
>the traps of a purely functional  equivalent reading. Instead, she gives us
>Pushkin's semantic load complete,  without sacrificing the meter or
>tonality of
>the original. In this she recalls  Nabokov's translation of "Eugene
>Onegin," but
>without the pedantry that  sometimes mars that great writer's efforts.
>Shmailo, who has worked as a  scientific Russian translator for NASA,
>brings the
>poems to us whole and  literally doesn't miss a beat.
>Finally, there is "How My Family  Survived the Camps," a gripping account
>of
>life as a slave worker for the Nazis,  where the only way out is through a
>smokestack in Dora Camp. Here guilt and  necessity merge into a stoic hymn
>to
>pure survival, a testament of courage and  resourcefulness that we should
>never
>be without. If, as Ahkmatova said, "in this  most Christian of worlds, all
>poets are Jews," Shmailo shows us the transcendent  destiny of insisting on
>ourselves. Every serious poet should have this CD  available as a reminder
>of the
>standards to which we  aspire.

Alex and Jason,

I very much appreciated your own responses.  I take it, Alex, that the
parable of the beaver would be your pessimistic? fatalistic?
characterization of homo sap.  It reminds me of Andy Clark=92s notion
that humans are =93natural born cyborgs,=94 i.e., we annex and appropriate
and extend ourselves with prosthesis after prosthesis, it=92s just what
we do.  But as you say, the ancient concept of =93stewardship=94 would seem=

to suggest that there is another dimension to being human that
complicates, for those who recognize it, the automatic altering of
environs.  When you say =93nothing more than a complex series of electro,
bio-chemical connections occurring randomly and passed on genetically
through all the myriad of species,=94 though, I have to say that I don=92t
think there=92s any =93nothing more=94 about it; the emergence of
self-consciousness and social orders from such processes, which we
barely understand even as we continue to endanger them, deserves a
healthy respect, although I stop short of calling it miraculous.  In
other words, about Jesus I have nothing in particular to say (my own
path is more or less Buddhist).

About Badiou and his zeal (explicitly compared by himself to Pascal=92s
zealously Christian appeals to =93nihilist libertines,=94 i.e., the
=93speculative left=94) I am still trying to decide what to say.  For a
book concerned with formulating =93atheological axioms,=94 it is remarkably=

full of theological diction.  It is, indeed, a book for specialists
(=93specialists in the labyrinth,=94 in his often all-too-cryptic terms)
and that part of me invested in robust, ordinary language has
increasingly little patience for such projects even as I recognize, as
I have indicated elsewhere, the necessity for functional
differentiation in a modern society.  I would probably not be reading
the book were there not pressures to stay current (interesting that
=93current=94 here means a text from 1988 only now available in
translation)--pressures which, not incidentally, include imperatives to
participate in online activites (about which one is deeply ambivalent)
lest one be accused of living in a cave or even a vacuum.  I certainly
don=92t need Badiou's theory to ground my own =93militant=94 and =93creativ=
e=94
practices.  But it is a provocative text and is useful to me insomuch
as it continues to generate questions; whether it makes good on its
promise of a post-Lacanian theory of the subject I cannot yet say.  The
relevance of such a theory to the advocacy of sustainable practices of
everyday life also eludes me, but given the combined phenomena of
=93ecopoetics=94 and the captivation of contemporary poetics generally by
Lacanian theory it seems to me that if anyone anywhere can offer such
an explanation, this would be the place to ask.

About Language, Jason, I will say this much: one thing that =93The
Constructivist Moment=94 has made clear to me so far is that one will
never be able to mount as effective a critique of that set of practices
as members of that cohort continue to make of themselves; the powerful
and ongoing criticism/self-criticism at the heart of the formation (and
dissolution) of a =93revolutionary cadre=94 or avantgarde is too fraught
with micropolitics--which of course extend into this very Listserv and
condition what its participants are and are not willing to discuss and
lead, perhaps, not only to the strange phenomenon of people being
discussed in the third person when they are in the room but also to
conclusions such as your own: =93the less said by me about that, the
better.=94

Thank you both again for your replies.

Well, yes, thanks both. Invective, yes, I'd say so, and "progress" in =
the
pisan cantos is of course persistently and grimly ironic.=20

I'm beginning to wonder if the keyboard on the typewriter in the office =
at
Pisa was (yet again) different from the one EP was used to, in that this
time round the apostrophe was uppercase number 8, which on other =
keyboards
(like the one I'm using now, and like my old old old portable Olivetti) =
was
an asterisk.=20

This reflection doesn't get me any forrarder, actually, since it still
leaves " yr* * * se" cryptic. "Your arse" is what I thought it might be,
too, but there are so very few instances of uncorrected typos that this
interpretation (I cannot call it an understanding) is still moot.

I'd really welcome further explanations / thoughts. This line is, =
though, a
disturbance in a Canto which (especially in these and the surrounding =
lines)
is concerned with unresolved disturbances.... (But I don't actually =
think EP
is into this kind of imitative form. So I'm still more than a little
baffled.

i read it as a progression of pronouns of one sort or another

me (english, first person, singular possessive) yr (Old English third person plural, if you read the y as a thorn, possessive, "Their" yeah?) '( standing in for yr Middle English second person plural)'(standing in for yr modern English second person singular possessive, which all the other yrs have collapsed into) and then se that wonderful latin reflexive pronoun that the various romance languages hammer into all sorts of uses.

call it progress indeed.

...The thought of becoming yet another person to abandon the

divert American and world attention from Israel’s occupation, perhaps
one of the war’s many intended results. So I stayed at my post. ....The
South African boycott and the campaign to free the “terrorist” Nelson
Mandela were international actions of conscience against a racist
colonizing power that refused to change its ways. We would be applying a
double standard if we did not act on the same conscience today, to
boycott and cut off funds to Israel and pressure it into ending its own
regime of ethnic supremacy. -- James Brooks -- "On Boycotts, Activism,

On Boycotts, Activism, and Moral Standards

On Boycotts, Activism, and Moral Standards

by James Brooks
Dissident Voice

Gideon Levy, of the Israeli daily Ha’aretz, is an artist at the crafts
of reportage and commentary. Prolific yet deeply thoughtful and fair,
Levy delivers his subjects whole and unfiltered on the page, speaking
from the heart in their own voices. His analysis is honest, insightful,
and often devastating in its indictment of Israel’s occupation.

Yet even the most ardent fan will find cause to quibble from time to
time. In a piece that cleverly exposes the hypocrisy in Israel’s
complaint that boycott and divestment campaigns against it are
“illegitimate” ("With a little help from the outside," Ha’aretz, June 8,
2006), Levy also charges international activists with a “moral double
standard” in expending their outrage against Israel when they should be
tending the home fires. For instance, British and Canadian boycotters
should shoulder their own responsibilities and work to end their
countries’ occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan.

Whatever the origin of this critique, it deserves rebuttal because it
puts political activism in a conceptual and moral straitjacket while
denying the fundamentally international character of Israel’s occupation.

As a citizen of the United States, I have been an activist working to
end US support for Israel’s occupation. Mr. Levy’s work has been part of
my education in the human tragedies of this war.

With other anti-occupation activists, I demonstrated and wrote
repeatedly against the Iraq war before it began. But once it was
underway I had to make a difficult decision; would I continue as before,
or focus on the long fight against our crimes in Iraq?

The thought of becoming yet another person to abandon the Palestinians
was abhorrent. And it was obvious that Iraq would further divert
American and world attention from Israel’s occupation, perhaps one of
the war’s many intended results. So I stayed at my post. It remains a
difficult decision today, but I do not regret it. Does it constitute a
“moral double standard”?

When my friends and I work to “free Palestine”, our main goal is to end
our government’s financial, military, and diplomatic support for the
occupation. We feel compelled to support the Palestinians against a
vicious onslaught partially financed by our own money.

We also see that our government’s long-running support for Israel’s war
is connected to other pernicious trends in our foreign policy and
political culture, including the destruction of Iraq and US belligerence
toward Iran and Syria. In this secondary but far-reaching and sometimes
fatal sense, Americans, too, are victimized by Israel’s occupation.

Indeed, the more I understand the forces and history driving this
conflict and my country’s hand in it, the more I appreciate the force of
the truism that we are all connected, that what happens to anyone
affects everyone else in some way. War is an ignorant denial of this
human fact.

Boycott and divestment campaigns are grassroots efforts to publicize the
extreme plight of the Palestinians and protest western nations’ support
for Israel’s demands. They can become the nucleus of a growing public
awareness that could eventually produce political change. In a “free
market” economy, there should be no question as to the right of
consumers and organizations to make and promote joint decisions about
their purchases and investments.

I assume the people behind the CUPE boycott and the now-expired NATFHE
action have been working against the occupation for a long time. It
takes years to develop that kind of “unpopular consensus” in any large
organization. And success in any endeavor brings its own raft of moral
considerations.

When the Canadian government foolishly took on occupation duties for the
“Coalition,” should CUPE activists have thrown up years of progress in
raising awareness about Palestine in order to refocus their energies on
Afghanistan? Wouldn’t that have entailed its own faulty standards and
moral anguish, if not outright abdication of responsibility?

We activists are certainly not immune to the easy attractions of double
standards. But if we are working for justice and peace, are we to be
faulted for the issue we address? Often the issue seems to choose the
person, and we become enmeshed in personal and moral obligations we
never expected to face. There is no single honest answer to these
individual circumstances.

In closing, I’d like to propose a settlement to the frothy debate over
the “legitimacy” of the growing international campaign to boycott Israel
and its accomplices. It can be stated in two elementary observations.

First, I assume we agree that the international embargo against
apartheid South Africa was a morally sound and effective tool to hasten
justice in that colonized land.

Second, veteran South African freedom fighters from Archbishop Desmond
Tutu to labor organizers and SA government officials have been saying
for several years that the situation in occupied Palestine is worse than
the oppression they suffered under white South Africa. (And that was
before the current economic siege, the draconian new permit systems
strangling the West Bank and forcing Palestinians out of the Jordan
Valley, the rising new tide of deaths caused by the spreading paralysis
of the Palestinian health care system, etc. etc.)

Who will argue with the people who defeated South African apartheid and
have experienced Israel’s version of the same system?

The South African boycott and the campaign to free the “terrorist”
Nelson Mandela were international actions of conscience against a racist
colonizing power that refused to change its ways. We would be applying a
double standard if we did not act on the same conscience today, to
boycott and cut off funds to Israel and pressure it into ending its own
regime of ethnic supremacy.

Try one mark as an apostrophe the other two as the letters: yr'arse
Which establishes a large slur for the purpose of intonation.

Well, yes, thanks both. Invective, yes, I'd say so, and "progress" in the
pisan cantos is of course persistently and grimly ironic.

I'm beginning to wonder if the keyboard on the typewriter in the office at
Pisa was (yet again) different from the one EP was used to, in that this
time round the apostrophe was uppercase number 8, which on other keyboards
(like the one I'm using now, and like my old old old portable Olivetti) was
an asterisk.

This reflection doesn't get me any forrarder, actually, since it still
leaves " yr* * * se" cryptic. "Your arse" is what I thought it might be,
too, but there are so very few instances of uncorrected typos that this
interpretation (I cannot call it an understanding) is still moot.

I'd really welcome further explanations / thoughts. This line is, though, a
disturbance in a Canto which (especially in these and the surrounding lines)
is concerned with unresolved disturbances.... (But I don't actually think EP
is into this kind of imitative form. So I'm still more than a little
baffled.

Well, not so sure-- I'm not sure even Pound is quite that reclusivly
byzantine. But that y as thorn is stretching it, no?, given EP's
orthographic proclivities. And your ingenious account of "se" I think
overreaches the context of this line.  But hey, thanks.

YES, Don, that's brilliant, and sounds to me exactly right except for =
the
spacing of those apostrophes (and I sure wouldn't go the barricades over =
my
tiny doubt there). Overall it's an UNcharacteristic abbreviation of =

*About Burning Deck Press

**Burning Deck Press began in 1961 as a magazine. In 1961, poets were
supposed to be in opposing camps, often inelegantly - and inaccurately -
labeled =B3academics=B2 or =B3beats.=B2 The two most widely noted anthologies of th=
e
time (Donald Allen=B9s and Hall-Pack-Simpson=B9s), both representing the period
1945-1960, contain not a single poet in common. Burning Deck (the magazine)
disregarded this split, printing and presented a spread of poets wide enoug=
h
that on occasion an author would complain of being published in such
unprogrammatic company.

Though advertised as a =B3quinterly,=B2 the magazine, after only four issues,
gave way to a series of chapbooks and - later - books of poetry and short
fiction. The direction also changed or, rather, narrowed somewhat.
Considering the limited resources of a small press, we realized that a
narrower focus made more sense than our original inclusive impulse. We
focused on innovative, =B3avantgarde=B2 work which had always been what we were
most interested in. If we still seem eclectic it is because we believe that
the history of poetry cannot possibly be clear before the poems are written=
.
It is not denying the importance of =B3movements,=B2 to insist that there is
another importance in moving beside or apart from them. After all, there ar=
e
many judgements, none of them the last.

In 1973 the NEA began to support independent publishing, and Burning Deck
was able to grow. Anthony Barnett=B9s Poem about Music was our first =B3full
length=B2 book of poems, in 1974.

Until 1985, we printed Burning Deck publications on our own letterpress. In
the beginning it seemed the only way to afford publishing anything at all
and, in spite of the drudgery involved, it remains a source of satisfaction=
.
The automation of bookbinding in 1985 made it financially more feasible to
print full books offset and reserve letterpress work for the smaller
chapbooks. We admire fine printing (under no illusion that ours is such) an=
d
admire any press that prints good work, even by mimeo. Our own practice - a
middle way -is to design and print books with care, in permanent form
(smyth-sewn, acid free paper), but at a price that will not keep them on
closed shelves.

W'assup with Marfa?  (That's pussy backwards in Texas.)

The reason I ask:  I was the sixth of seven editors, the last only a man, who
worked for J. Poindexter after my graduation in '94 from U of Houston cwp on
an account of a ranch he had renovated there.  The account was Mr.
Poindexter's own, a fascinating and already-well-written tale about llamas and hand-cut
adobe.  I did the editing work without ever visiting the ranch.  The rooms in
the b & b went for $400 per night.  He met me sometimes in the kitchen of my
little garage apartment, with the full light coming in on four sides, to go over
the editing changes; sometimes in his palatial condominium just outside the
610 Loop; and sometimes in his office suite in a downtown skyscraper. The brass
plaque outside the suite door read J. B. Poindexter, Corporate Raider.  I was
acting fanatical about use of the semi-colon, probably due to what C. Michael
Curtis had written about the semi-colon, and C. Michael Curtis had liked some
of my short stories in the 1980s.  My phone rang at 8 a.m., and it would be
Mr. Poindexter calling about a particular semi-colon in the 120-page document
-- I had made liberal, but correct, use of them throughout the text, like
sprinkling it with a minced bunch of Cilantro.  How bizarre to hear a message about
semi-colons from such a prosperous and busy man first thing in the morning; I
had a new boyfriend, myself, and not one who'd pondered the use of the
semi-colon much; he thought in songs himself.  I earned $30 per hour for doing that
good work.

Reviewer: JoSelle  Vanderhooft

Listening  to poet and translator Larissa Shmailo=E2=80=99s latest spoken wo=
rd CD is =20
almost like attending eighteen short plays in the span of forty  minutes.=20
Like the best plays, each poem tells a compelling story of  human struggle,=20=
in=20
which characters fight (and routinely fail) to  obtain such basic necessitie=
s as=20
food, shelter, liberty, even love.  Like the best plays, her poems also=20
crackle with breathtaking  language, which in the true tradition of the trag=
edies=20
of which she  speaks almost sound as if they could be sung (indeed, in some=20
cases  they almost are). Shmailo=E2=80=99s expert understanding of the close=
 =20
relationship between poetry and drama, music and language, and the  primal h=
uman need to=20
just hear a really, really good story make  The No-Net World a truly unique=20
contribution to twenty-first  century American poetry, and a CD worth listen=
ing=20
to frequently and  carefully.

Also  in the tradition of the world=E2=80=99s best dramas, Shmailo=E2=80=99s=
 poems are =20
filled with fascinating and all-too-human characters whose stories  of loss,=
=20
frustration, and displacement resonate with the listener  long after the CD=
=E2=80=99s end.=20
One of the collection=E2=80=99s most striking poems  is =E2=80=9CMadwoman,"=20=
a poem about a=20
mentally ill homeless woman, which  would find good company in a book of=20
contemporary monologues for  actresses. Delivered in Shmailo=E2=80=99s warm,=
 full Broadway=20
voice and  accompanied by Bobby Perfect=E2=80=99s restless guitar chords, it=
 might just =20
as well be one.

"Here I am again walking among these vague  and tepid people. They evoke a=20
slight feeling of distaste in me.  They smell my pain. They have no idea. I=20=
just=20
hold my phone, the  cellular phone I use for a disguise and I talk. Talk to=20
the ultimate  answering service. I walk and I talk to God. When you died I=20
ripped  the electrodes out of my skull and ran away from the land of cables=20=
 and=20
TV sets, great battles of television were fought here, great  battles were=20
lost. SoHo is no different from uptown or downtown,  it=E2=80=99s all money=20=
and talking=20
and bars, sex in cars, job-job-job, so I  went to see the trees. The trees w=
ere=20
beautiful, their leaves  forming patterns of light on the ground and as the=20
light played on  my hair and my cheeks I realized no one ever dies. They jus=
t=20
become  trees. Even Marilyn Monroe was alive in a leaf.  "

The  poem follows the speaker=E2=80=99s trip to the West Side Highway where=20=
she =20
meets homeless people, speaks to God and Jesus, and eventually is  =E2=80=
=9Ccured" of her=20
illness. She takes pills, has a job and worries about  her boyfriend=E2=80=
=99s health.=20
But as she informs us, =E2=80=9Cyou can=E2=80=99t really  ever take the gift=
 of madness=20
away."

"Once you have been  stripped by god of everything=E2=80=94clothing, family,=
 freedom,=20
senses=E2=80=94you  are his for life. And I was stripped, oh yes dear Lord o=
f =20
everything=E2=80=94every last thing. God took everything leaving only my  so=
ul, but I found=20
that was  enough."

Not  only the stuff of great drama, this is also the stuff of truly =20
compassionate and socially aware poetry. Instead of sentimentalizing  and=20
infantilizing the mentally ill and the homeless as the  television shows Shm=
ailo rails=20
against tend to do, Shmailo looks at  her subject as an individual, with her=
 own=20
past, present, and  future, as well as her own set of demons to haunt her. B=
y=20
treating  the nameless Madwoman with such care and respect, Shmailo turns he=
r =20
into a modern day Fool, even into King Lear himself when he wails at  the=20
storm in Act III, scene iv:

"Poor naked wretches,  wheresoe'er you are,
That bide the pelting of this pitiless  storm,
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
Your  loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
From seasons such as  these? O! I have ta'en
Too little care of this! Take physic,  pomp;
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
That thou  mayst shake the superflux to them,
And show the heavens more  just."

Indeed,  the echoes of Shakespeare=E2=80=99s greatest tragedy can be found i=
n many of=20
 The No-Net World=E2=80=99s poems, including =E2=80=9CLager NYC," =E2=80=9CD=
eath at  Sea," =E2=80=9CFor Six=20
Months with You," =E2=80=9CHunts Point Counterpoint," and the  title poem it=
self.=20
Like Shakespeare, Shmailo does not attempt to  explain or justify poverty,=20
madness, or the horror of the Holocaust  or diseases such as AIDS (a subject=
 to=20
which Shmailo frequently  returns). Instead, suffering is merely something t=
o be=20
endured,  railed against, even eventually accepted. =20

Shmailo  gives acceptance of suffering and death, which is, perhaps, =20
suffering in one of its most brutal forms, beautiful treatment in  the short=
 poem =E2=80=9C
Johnny I Love You Don=E2=80=99t Die," one of the many on  this CD which coul=
d well be a=20
song, despite the lack of musical  accompaniment.

"Johnny I love you don=E2=80=99t die
Johnny I love  you don=E2=80=99t die
Johnny, do you remember=20
Sitting on the  stoop
The smell of green lilacs
The moon in your hair
My  battered face
Your purple heart
'You said they had no  right
No right
And that no one would ever do that to us =20
again

Oh Johnny I love you don=E2=80=99t die
Johnny I love you  don=E2=80=99t die
=E2=80=94AZT=E2=80=94
Johnny I love you don=E2=80=99t die
=E2=80=94just need  work=E2=80=94
Johnny I love you don=E2=80=99t die
=E2=80=94T-cells go=E2=80=94
Johnny I  love you don=E2=80=99t die
=E2=80=94Up and down=E2=80=94
Johnny I love you don=E2=80=99t  die
=E2=80=94You=E2=80=99ll be strong=E2=80=94
Johnny I love you don=E2=80=99t die
=E2=80=94Soon I  swear=E2=80=94
Johnny I love you don=E2=80=99t  die"

But  eventually the speaker realizes that death is inevitable and  encourage=
s=20
her husband to =E2=80=9Clet go, it=E2=80=99s okay." Shmailo=E2=80=99s willin=
gness  to portray death=20
as an inevitable part of life, and indeed an  inevitable part of love, is a=20
mature, even profound statement to  make in a culture which has become=20
pathological in its fear of  death. =20
But  love does not exist merely as a corollary to death in Shmailo=E2=80=99s=
  work.=20
Several of her poems celebrate love for its own sake,  including =E2=80=9CQu=
antum Love"=20
and =E2=80=9CNew Life." To further emphasize the  importance love has on her=
 work,=20
Shmailo also includes her own  elegant translations of Alexander Pushkin=E2=
=80=99s =E2=80=9CI=20
Loved You Once" and  Vladimir Mayakovsky=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CAlready One," tw=
o Russian poems=20
which  celebrate the passion, scope, and gravitas of love without  discoursi=
ng=20
into the despair that often accompanies  it.

If  the poems on The No-Net World are beautiful, the CD=E2=80=99s sound  qua=
lity and=20
production only add to their beauty. The recording is  mercifully free from=20
static, interference, and white noise that  often plague spoken word CDs. Th=
e=20
sound board used to make the  recording also appears to have been operated b=
y a=20
proficient  engineer; Shmailo=E2=80=99s rich, expressive contralto never sou=
nds tinny=20
or  cavernous. Overall it is a nearly flawless CD that will especially  appe=
al=20
to patrons and practitioners of the performing arts, and to  anyone who=20
simply loves to hear a good story told  well.

Hey mIEKAL,
I'm writing w/ a special request.  Eddy is raising money directly for
Bob, who needs it for health
care at this point.  There is a listing on ebay right now.  It's only
for 3 days & I'd really like
to see him get as much exposure for this as possible, so I'm emailing
you a copy of it.  It'd be
great if you'd post it to any lists you're on that would be
applicable. (At least the dtv group
list.) I didn't want to do it "cold" & without talking to you about
it.) It's really a worthwhile
cause.  I can't believe someone who's had as much influence as a
writer has to worry about money
on his death bed. Damn this place we live in that's supposed to be
free and brave.  whatever.
okay, thanks.

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?
ViewItem&item=280000526520&ssPageName=ADME:B:EF:US:11

I'm sitting here with Bob and we have decided to set up this auction.
With a touch of theatre absurdo...
truth can be stranger than fiction...

Bob, who has had some health fnords of late, and is in recovery,
has agreed for us to set up this auction to raise some cash for his
continued living expenses and care.
Hard to believe with so many of his books crawling around the planet,
eh?

This is our initial experiment
others may follow if this is fun.

All Proceeds of this Auction Go Directly to Bob.


We offer to the RAW & eBay community the following:

Winning bidder will receive

  2 books from Bob's own collection.  Both books are new and are
first editions.


TSOG: The Thing That Ate the Constitution and other everyday monsters
  New Falcon 2005

and

Reality Is What You Can Get Away With
An Illustrated Screenplay
1992 Dell First Edition


  and

Robert Anton Wilson will personally sign, to the winning bidder,
one of the two books.
(that's right...to you...from bob, oh my fnords!...think..
association copy, think of the RAW biographers of the future who will
search you and your heirs out to get the real story about THAT
auction...think of your discordian career and legacy...think brothers
and sisters, think together and get those trust funds out from under
the bed, from those swiss bank accounts, think .........)

and

(just to prove this isn't some elaborate Erisian hoax)

You will also recieve a digital photograph of Bob signing the very book.
Yes, you read that right. An unquestionably unique photo of Bob, in
his cryptonomic cave, deep below the cliffs of Santa Cruz, signing
YOUR book to YOU.

YOU!!!
THE WINNER!

but wait...there's more...



Bob will add a mystery item each day of the auction.
This could be anything from a holy relic toenail clipping, proof of
the existence of God, a dvd, or some other
bit of ephemera from the land of Discordia.

and what do you have to say about it

  I need to mention that the title poem of Rich Jeffrey Newman is one of the best I've read this shitty year of oft plagarized poetic laziness, so buy his book you lack of originality flakers, even in a year where our originality say the first book of flarf, of course published by a primary proginator of American poetry (us, Pavement Saw), has its author release a second book which we are fully supporting and a note will be forthcoming forthwith soon, ther is little in narrative poetry worth repeating beyond myself so I need to say something in the machine guns blaring near my neighborhood in the thirteenth largest city, where money for beaches is what shows status. Good luck from the only--

Someone kindly pointed out my blunder from yesterday:  "Summertime" was not written by Armstrong, but rather, the lyrics came from the pens of Ira Gershwin and DuBose Heyward, song composed by George Gershwin.

  I should admit that the writers below played no role in the execution of my error -- I acted alone from my own grassy knoll.  So please stop by and imbibe, once again, for the sake of what poets hold dear!

Dear bloggers and visitors to blogs,

What about advertising?  I am not presently in a position to have sit-down
(face-to-face) conversations with other bloggers, but I have done a little
reading.  I recently signed up for Adsense with Google.  On my first day, I clicked
on my own ads so many times, I temporarily shut down a little church website
on how to blog.  I felt stunned and horrible for doing so; then I read the
policies and learned that clicking on my own ads is strictly prohibited.
Nonetheless, I earned $40 that day, which lasted 15 hours, a little better than $2
per hour.  Yesterday, I followed policy closely and earned just under $3 for the
whole day.  Today I have earned zip.  Also yesterday, I ate a rather lousy
sandwich that cost $34.  How could it have cost so much?  The beers (I drank
almost 3 Coronas since they didn't have Rolling Rock) cost $5 each.  My friend's
Miller Lites cost $4.  How could beer cost that much?  How could advertising
on my website cost so little?  My blogging days tend to run long.  I usually
stay at it on a simple day for three hours, a harder day for ten.  If I were
earning $10/hour for advertising, I would be content and also would feel nicely
employed.  That would equal $240 per day.

$250 per classroom hour is what our least-well paid teachers at U of Houston
were earning.  Each made $18,000 for the semester s/he taught one
undergraduate and one graduate workshop.  It was one of those teachers who regarded me as
the best writer currently in attendance at the school.  Not best I would have
thought since I am a Democrat.  We were earning $21 per contract hour to teach
and grade undergraduates 15 hours per week.  Typically, I put in 30 hours --
we had 54 students apiece -- so undercut my own pay by half in order to do a
more thorough job grading student papers.  Today, I would be very lucky indeed
if an organization offered to pay me at graduate school wages.  In Minnesota,
where I have lived for ten years, pay is usually $10 per hour, up from $7.50
ten years ago.  Those jobs require a high school diploma.  Housing and food
have gone up dramatically.  Teaching here is done on a voluntary basis.  It may
be possible to win more than a p-t class or two and therefore earn more than
$4,000 per year.  To tutor, which I prefer, I need to advertise.  I need to wait
to do so until the school year starts.

I am hoping to earn $10,000 per year that I now lack, and this has been true
for seven years running.  Creative writing as an enterprise is leaving me
feeling genuinely put out and fatigued.  I have so far foregone $400,000 in
earnings due to having chosen to study cw as a field, and that number is only going
to go up.  I am dependent on the government for health insurance and family
for sustenance.

My informal rank at Wisconsin, by Lorrie Moore, was top 2 or 3 then in
attendance as an undergraduate; at SUNY-Binghamton, it was 1 going in, based on
writing sample.  At Houston, I got the fiction fellowship going in.  Politically
and aesthetically I was a little left and a little offbeat.

I would like to hear from anyone who has figured out a good way to earn
$10,000 per year.  I have had 30 jobs and don't really want just another one.

Ann Bogle

Well, there's honest hard work. And then there's scamming (which
actually necessitates a good deal of work, and the hours can be kinda
rough).

You've had 30 jobs and don't want another one? Great. Join the club and
welcome to the real world.

yes, well, working 246 days a year for $240 (minus weekends, and, hell, i
give you 3 weeks off starting) netting $59,040 should make you feel
'content'.

Ann----nice to see people talking about economic realities of trying
to survive as a creative writer, or teacher,
in today's economy. Maybe if others talk about too---and don't just
try to shut the conversation down, with sentiments like
"welcome to the real world" or "put up or shut up"---we might
actually be able to form some real self-sustaining support network,
start our own unaccredited, but far cheaper, school, cut out the
middlemen, or something.

Black Mountain? Naropa?

I like self-sustaining... unaccredited is a redundancy - we should be think=
ing of advancing our art and our relationship to our peers. Think the Acade=
my, Plato, without the idealism.

Money? Insert a series of H's and A's with exclamation points randomly inte=
rspersed. That is my signature.

By the way, I'll be showing work in NYC at Tribes Gallery from July 6th thr=
ough the 25th. I'm selling several prints, for a lot of money, too, so anyo=
ne with money on this list please come.=20

Subject:      That Dada Strain (Ethel Waters version)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

As a kind of followup to the Dada show in New York, I've just posted the =
following on my ubu.com ethnopoetics web site: Ethel Waters' 1922 =
recording of That Da Da Strain.  The tune was a standard for early jazz =
groups, but over the years it lost its words & became purely =
instrumental.  For myself the title was incredibly seductive, and =
sometime around 1960 I proposed to do an anthology of European Dada =
writings & to use That Dada Strain as a title.  Nothing came of that =
until the Dada section in Poems for the Millennium, but I did use it in =
the 1980s for a book of my own work and for a German radio h=F6rspiel =
(soundplay) and a staged version by a Living Theater offshoot in the =
late 1980s.  The URL for the Waters version is =
http://www.ubu.com/ethno/soundings/waters.html, or go directly to =
http://www.ubu.com/ethno/ for the full lineup.  Now that I've finally =
tracked it down, words & all, I take it to be a significant if =
coincidental part of the history of Dada.

=20

Also a second new audio addition to the site consists of two versions of =
a "toast," The Signifying Monkey, from African-American oral tradition.  =
The URL for this one is http://www.ubu.com/ethno/soundings/monkey.html.=20

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Here are relatively recent interactive audio works for the Web that have the
touch. These, I think, are all created since 2004. These pieces explore
audio and interface in compelling ways.

ja
http://vispo.com


PIXEL BY PIXEL by Frédéric Durieu, Jean-Jacques Birgé, Kristine Malden
(France)
http://www.lecielestbleu.com/media/pixelbypixelframe.htm
The interactivity here is via moving the mouse and clicking. The visuals are
quite good and you exercise subtle but audible influence on the music as you
move the mouse and occassionally click. The relation between the audio and
the visual is subtle and intriguing. Also, as audio (de)composition, this is
rich. More on Durieu and Birgé at
http://arteonline.arq.br/Paris/durieuenglish.htm and
http://arteonline.arq.br/Paris/birgeenglish.htm (2003 profiles).
DIRECTOR


PÂTE À SON by Frédéric Durieu and Jean-Jacques Birge (France)
http://www.lecielestbleu.com/html/pateason.html
An ingenious audio toy. Click the "?" symbol at bottom right so that "Help
bubbles" appear when you mouseEnter controls. Pixel by Pixel is no less an
audio/visual machine than this piece, but this piece highlights and exposes
more overtly the mechanisms that determine the audio composition in this
piece. A different type of music than Pixel by Pixel. As with Pixel by
Pixel, the tone of the audio and the visuals are congruent.
DIRECTOR


GRANULAR by Chris Savage (UK)
http://www.japanesefreeware.com
This is one of the first piece I've seen/heard that gets its audio from a
search engine (so does at least one of Jason Freeman's pieces); you type
something in and a sound is retrieved that relates to your query. But, more
significant than simply being a first in this technological regard, Granular
*does something interesting* with the retrieved sound. "Granular Synthesis
is the process of creating new sounds from tiny fragments (or 'grains') of
other sounds often as short as 10ms in length. These grains then get
redistributed and reorganised (often offsetting the pitch of each one) and
the result is interesting, unpredictable, evolving sounds with vague
characteristics of the original. This is a simple implementation of the
system created in Shockwave - grain length and pitch offset can all be
modified and it includes a simple modulation section. Sounds can be
retrieved via its own internal search engine, so for example typing 'car'
should return some kind of car sound and place it in the synthesizer.
Patches which users create can be saved on the web to be shared by other
users at any time."
DIRECTOR


WORKS FROM ARTZERO.NET by Vera Sylvia Bighetti (Brazil)
MADE TO (UN)ORDER
http://www.artzero.net/madetorder
A suite of 6 interactive audio pieces. A mixture of the tuneful and the
electronic.
TECLA1
http://www.artzero.net/grafic/tecla1.htm
Click and drag the moving triangles to size them; click the rectangular
shapes sort of as a keyboard; mouseover the triangles to trigger their
audio.
DIRECTOR


THREE IN PROGRESS by Katharine Norman (Canada/UK)
http://mappae.novamara.com
Three poetical/audio interactive works. I like the way these pieces move
among poetry and experimental interactive audio.
FLASH/JSYN


LOOPTRACKS by Conor O'Boyle (Ireland)
http://www.looptracks.net
What is striking here is the interactive interface. O'Boyle describes it as
"an interactive music video". And I think part of the idea of many
interactive audio works for the Web is to try to do something alternative to
the music video. Though of course there are also other fish to fry in
interactive audio, such as innovative music.
FLASH


PET_00 by Simon Yuill and Laura Baxter (Scottland)
http://www.paragon-ensemble.com/commissions/laura_baxter/pet_00
PET_00 is an interactive audio piece done in collaboration between software
artist Simon Yuill and composer Laura Baxter. "PET_00 compositions are made
from three types of basic elements: particles, attractors and triggers.
Particles have audio samples linked to them. They move across the screen and
when they cross a trigger area the sound is played. The movement of the
particles can be influenced by the attractors." Mouseover the bottom of the
window for a menu. The thing of interest here is the constructive/generative
interface whereby you construct from "particles, attractors and triggers" an
audio composition. This piece was commissioned by Paragon, a Scottish
project in contemporary new music.
FLASH


FOLK SONG FOR THE FIVE POINTS by David Gunn, Alastair Dant, Tom Davis,
Victor Gama (USA)
http://www.tenement.org/folksongs
"Folk Songs for the Five Points is a celebration of cultural diversity and
change, using “folk songs” as a metaphor to explore immigration and the
formation of identity in New York’s Lower East Side." Click and drag the
white circles to explore sounds from New York's Lower East Side. Most
interactive audio pieces focus on exploring audio/music and interface. This
piece is different. Audio as culture map. Also, the interface is quite well
done and presented.
FLASH


SOUND POEMS by Jörg Piringer (Austria)
http://joerg.piringer.net/soundpoems/soundpoems.htm
Interactive automata sound poems.
FLASH


BALLDROPPINGS by Josh Nimoy (USA)
http://www.balldroppings.com
"BallDroppings .... can be seen as an emergence game. Alternatively this
software can be taken as an audio-visual performance instrument. Balls fall
from the top of the screen and bounce off the lines you are drawing with the
mouse. The balls make a percussive and melodic sound, whose pitch depends on
how fast the ball is moving when it hits the line."

When we posted our _Broadside_, by Kimo Armitage and Michael Puleloa on
our website, asking $1 for it, we were hit with waves of fraudulent
orders via credit card (at least that's what the credit card people told
us).  So we've taken it off sale and are now giving it away.  It's a
marvelous collaboration in Hawaiian Creole English (otherwise known as
"pidgin").  See www.tinfishpress.com for details.  Hit the link to "free
stuff."

Then wander around a bit.  We also have copies of our new issue, Tinfish
16 / trout 13, done in collaboration with New Zealand's fine on-line
poetry journal.  And much much more.  Please support us with a
purchase.  Tinfish has a wonderful line-up of experimental writing from
the Pacific for this coming year, but we need support now in order to
publish then.

But please let me know via email, because I'm going to be away most of
the summer.  I will forward your emails to my erstwhile summer assistant!

aloha, Susan

Dear AMBogle2@aol.com<mailto:AMBogle2@aol.com>

If I understand this request, you are asking me to sanction and suggest =
ways you can scam to keep from working in order to support yourself =
while you write.  I can't do that.=20

There is only one way to make a living 'from' writing, and that is to =
write stuff that sells so that the stuff you have written supports your =
bad habit of writing instead of being a productive member of society and =
doing important stuff like working for a living.=20

Given that your writing isn't selling for enough to do that, means you =
have little choice except to work for a living while you indulge =
yourself in your bad habit. =20

I have some friends who are ski-bums.  They cross the globe seeking the =
perfect downhill moment; they all know, however, they can't earn a =
living (e.g. support themselves) from slalom & moguls.  They pay the =
rent and buy their food from the money they earn doing other stuff: =
waiting tables, changing oil on other people's cars, painting walls puce =
because some bouffant blonde wants puce walls, being go-fers for all =
walks of business people. But they don't want a different life...they =
live to ski.=20

I have some other friends who are wannabe musicians.  They too cross the =
country seeking the perfect gig.  But for them, the gig isn't cash, it's =
a place they can explode into their perfect (their words, not mine) =
orchestrations...harmonies and the cacophony of melding instruments.  =
Most of these friends  are salt of the earth folks.  They work in places =
like Safeway or Wall-Mart in order to sustain themselves between cash =
from performing.  None however wants to face the reality that they will =
never be James Taylor, or Eric Clampton...despite the fact that facing =
that reality would simplify their lives.=20

I write every day; I have written every day since I was a sixth grade =
student...I wrote when I was a student; I wrote when I was a teacher; I =
wrote when I worked in industry; I write now.  None of that effort =
supports me...none of that writing pays the bills.=20

Why is that?  Simply because I am neither a Hemmingway nor a =
Frost...though I did aspire to equal both in my youth.=20

And, AMB, despite what some instructors, professors, advisors & teachers =
may have said to you about your skills and abilities, know this: fewer =
than 1 tenth of one percent of the folks who "write," write and make an =
adequate living from the efforts.  The rest of us do it because we can't =
stop.  And we do stuff like wait tables, wash windows, and peel potatoes =
to fill in the incidental stuff like food and lodging. =20

So, the best advice I can give you is this: Write.  Keep writing.  =
Work...keep working.  And until your writing begins paying the bills, =
don't confuse the two...writing,  from working for a living.  They are =
in all probability different activities, both essential to your future.=20

  Dear bloggers and visitors to blogs,

  What about advertising?  I am not presently in a position to have =
sit-down=20
  (face-to-face) conversations with other bloggers, but I have done a =
little=20
  reading.  I recently signed up for Adsense with Google.  On my first =
day, I clicked=20
  on my own ads so many times, I temporarily shut down a little church =
website=20
  on how to blog.  I felt stunned and horrible for doing so; then I read =
the=20
  policies and learned that clicking on my own ads is strictly =
prohibited. =20
  Nonetheless, I earned $40 that day, which lasted 15 hours, a little =
better than $2=20
  per hour.  Yesterday, I followed policy closely and earned just under =
$3 for the=20
  whole day.  Today I have earned zip.  Also yesterday, I ate a rather =
lousy=20
  sandwich that cost $34.  How could it have cost so much?  The beers (I =
drank=20
  almost 3 Coronas since they didn't have Rolling Rock) cost $5 each.  =
My friend's=20
  Miller Lites cost $4.  How could beer cost that much?  How could =
advertising=20
  on my website cost so little?  My blogging days tend to run long.  I =
usually=20
  stay at it on a simple day for three hours, a harder day for ten.  If =
I were=20
  earning $10/hour for advertising, I would be content and also would =
feel nicely=20
  employed.  That would equal $240 per day.

  $250 per classroom hour is what our least-well paid teachers at U of =
Houston=20
  were earning.  Each made $18,000 for the semester s/he taught one=20
  undergraduate and one graduate workshop.  It was one of those teachers =
who regarded me as=20
  the best writer currently in attendance at the school.  Not best I =
would have=20
  thought since I am a Democrat.  We were earning $21 per contract hour =
to teach=20
  and grade undergraduates 15 hours per week.  Typically, I put in 30 =
hours --=20
  we had 54 students apiece -- so undercut my own pay by half in order =
to do a=20
  more thorough job grading student papers.  Today, I would be very =
lucky indeed=20
  if an organization offered to pay me at graduate school wages.  In =
Minnesota,=20
  where I have lived for ten years, pay is usually $10 per hour, up from =
$7.50=20
  ten years ago.  Those jobs require a high school diploma.  Housing and =
food=20
  have gone up dramatically.  Teaching here is done on a voluntary =
basis.  It may=20
  be possible to win more than a p-t class or two and therefore earn =
more than=20
  $4,000 per year.  To tutor, which I prefer, I need to advertise.  I =
need to wait=20
  to do so until the school year starts.

  I am hoping to earn $10,000 per year that I now lack, and this has =
been true=20
  for seven years running.  Creative writing as an enterprise is leaving =
me=20
  feeling genuinely put out and fatigued.  I have so far foregone =
$400,000 in=20
  earnings due to having chosen to study cw as a field, and that number =
is only going=20
  to go up.  I am dependent on the government for health insurance and =
family=20
  for sustenance.

  My informal rank at Wisconsin, by Lorrie Moore, was top 2 or 3 then in =

  attendance as an undergraduate; at SUNY-Binghamton, it was 1 going in, =
based on=20
  writing sample.  At Houston, I got the fiction fellowship going in.  =
Politically=20
  and aesthetically I was a little left and a little offbeat.

  I would like to hear from anyone who has figured out a good way to =
earn=20
  $10,000 per year.  I have had 30 jobs and don't really want just =
another one.

I wonder if this has happened to anyone else: Yesterday, I was, just for =
the
hell of it, googling the title of my new book of poetry, The Silence Of =
Men,
and I discovered a site on which someone--I don't know who--had =
translated
the title poem of the book into a language I do not recognize and posted =
it
to a website that seems to be an international collection of poetry in
translation. This person did not take the poem from the book itself, but
rather, complete with the author's photo I had used, from an online =
literary
journal that had published it a couple of years ago. No one ever =
contacted
me about this and, as far as I know, no one ever contacted the editor of =
the
literary magazine either. On the one hand, I am quite flattered; on the
other, it's a little disturbing to me that someone would publish the
translation without even contacting me. I am curious what other people's
reactions are. Also, I am hoping someone can tell me what the language =
of
the translation is and, if it=92s not too much trouble, where on the =
website I
can find the email of the person who translated it so that I can contact =
him
or her. I am, of course, also curious to know if the translation is any
good.
=20
Here's the translation, which you can find at

DE STILTE VAN MANNEN
=20
Een man waarvan ik nooit eerder had gedroomd wandelt
mijn appartement binnen en neemt plaats in de groene
fauteuil waarin ik altijd zit om te schrijven.  Hij houdt
in zijn linker hand een grote stijve penis vast
die hij stilletjes neerzet op de vloer.
De fallus begint te walsen op muziek
die ik niet kan horen.  Met zijn scrotum,
testikels en benen afgesneden tot aan de knie=EBn.
wil ik weten waarom dit misvormd
manswezen naar mij werd gebracht.  Ik kijk op
maar mijn gast is verdwenen.  Zijn orgaan, schokkend
met korte spasmen zoals een hoestende oude man,
spreidt zich uit in een plas van dun bloed.
De stilte tussen ons is de stilte van mannen.

The Silence Of Men


A man I=92ve never dreamed before walks
into my apartment and sits in the green
chair where I do my writing. He carries
in his left hand a large erect penis
which he places silently on the floor.
The phallus begins to waltz to music
I cannot hear, its scrotum a skirt;
its testicles, legs cut off at the knees.
I want to know why this disfigured
manhood has been brought to me. I look up,
but my guest is gone. His organ, deflating
in short spasms like an old man coughing,
spreads itself in a pool of shallow blood.
The silence between us is the silence of men.

The composer of the lyrics, anagrammatically, is none other than AIM

Nicely put, Alexander. Good to know that there are people out there
who can make a clear, clean, positive rebuttal, without having to
resort to letting everyone know how much they want to puke.

Well, Pedestal Magazine has published more than half a dozen of my
"found poems" without telling me they're going to or that they did.
Does that count?

Dear Poetics People,

As group play is giving way to direct elimination over in Germany,
we at the Vacation House Reading Series are also getting serious.
This coming Wednesday, 28 June 2006, at 7pm we are featuring two
incredible poet/translator/critics who will knock that false
consciousness right out of your skull. The reading will be
conveniently held at McNally Robinson Books NYC
<http://www.mcnallyrobinsonnyc.com/>, 50 Prince Street (b/t
Lafayette and Mulberry),so you can pick up some light beach reading
afterwords to help you recover.

Mónica de la Torre is co-author of the artist book Appendices,
Illustrations & Notes. She translated a volume of selected poems by
 Gerardo Deniz published by Lost Roads and, with Michael Wiegers,
co-edited Reversible Monuments: Contemporary Mexican Poetry. Her
first collection of poetry, Talk Shows, is forthcoming from
Switchback Books early next year.

Kristin Prevallet is a poet, essayist, and translator; she is the
author of Scratch Sides: Poetry, Documentation, and Image-text
Projects (Skanky Possum, 2003) and SHADOW EVIDENCE INTELLIGENCE
(Factory School,  2006). She received a 2004 PEN translation fund
award for her translations of Sony Labou Tansi. She lives in
Brooklyn.

See you all there

Cheers
N

I had no choice but to separate writing from earning a living. As a graduate
school dropout, I couldn't teach in a college. By default I ended up in the
social services. Eventually I landed in a job where the workload was
ridiculously imbalanced and nobody cared if the job got done as long as
nothing hit the newspapers. I found ways to write on the job. After work, I
got the rest of the time I needed by choosing foods for dinner that didn't
taste bad cold, then wrote during dinner. I learned early on that if I had a
normal dinner, I'd turn on the tube afterward and forget about writing. So I
did what worked for me and retired on a half-pay pension at 55, which now
gives me writing time and the pleasure of a warm meal every weeknight. I'm
not rich, but I do OK.

But the job, while supporting the writing, didn't give me the time to do
the networking necessary. So I didn't have time to develop any kind of
readership until I retired 5 years ago. (Now, if only I could get the
readers to buy my books...)

Basically, we're in this because of what writing gives us. While it would
have been nice to support myself in a related field, I had to make a
distinction: the day job subsidized what I do and I had to be resourceful
enough to make as much writing time as I could.

Work sucked and so did the cold meals, but not writing would have sucked
more. And now I feel very lucky.

confuse the two...writing,  from working for a living.  They are in all

i just wanted to chime in with a resounding "damn straight."

and also to say forget about the delusion of writing for a living. that dream is something that i think should be quashed altogether, mostly because if you do manage to do it, most likely you're doing all sorts of obnoxious garbage like writing ad copy and generally behaving like neil pollack. write because you want to be read, and you'll be okay. maybe every once in a while someone will give you a check for something you've written, and that will be a nice supplement to your real job, but it won't be your bread and butter.

art doesn't do well in mass market capitalism. particularly art that pushes against things like the tastes of the masses who make up the market. and generally speaking, things like fiction and poetry don't have enough of a niche with the kind of disposable cash to act as writing patrons. Sure, there are some colleges that can do it by giving out professorships to writers, but that's a problem too because the more professorships there are, the more creative writing programs there are churning out more mediocre MFAs.

So yeah, do it because you like doing it. If you want to make money, go get an MBA. They're easy to get. You can do it on the internet in four to six weeks, according to several pieces of spam i recieved this morning.

Jason suggested: "write because you want to be read, and you'll be okay.
maybe every once in a while someone will give you a check for something
you've written, and that will be a nice supplement to your real job, but it
won't be your bread and butter."

Poetdom is historically filled with examples of poets taking jobs that don't
resonate with the idea of poetry, Stevens being a VP in an insurance agency
being the most obvious. George Bataille was a librarian. Bill Luoma writes
computer code, and Silliman does computer marketing or somesuch. Etc...

There's always teaching in China, where you repeat the same one hour lesson
10-14 times a week and get free rent and loads of spare time (I did it for
three years).

MieKal: What is the correlation between taking the eyes out of potatoes and
washing windows?

Well, after last night at Langton Arts in San Francisco, one might say,
watching and listening to Brian Kim Steffans and Judith Goldman's "The Wall
on Terra" (a play) in the Performance Writing Series.  Both terrific.

I don't know the economix - I paid $5 for the stamp on my wrist and got
extraordinary value.

I used to wash windows in high rises. It was an easy job and paid really well.

I don't want to say "damn straight." It seems to me that all the writers on
this list write because they are, as Creeley used to say, "given to write."
They have to, and nothing else works for them. All of us also, clearly,
have to have enough money to both keep us alive and to find some time to
write. I'm glad Ann Bogle brought this issue up, but I don't have any easy
answers for her, because I think each of us finds (or does not find) the
mix of work and writing that keeps us going. Some patchwork it together,
some take full-time jobs in teaching, some outside of teaching, some work
in the nonprofit sector, some work in the corporate sector - we're all over
the map. And we do sometimes need and ask for support, and I've only heard
her get a little of that here, with more lack of support bordering on
dismissal of her concerns -- sort of a "hey girl get tough" attitude. That
just strikes me as a little too cold. Ann, I hope you find something that
works for you.

I'm glad for the discussion too. As you say, there are no easy answers,
and precious few difficult answers. As has been said, few of us will
make more than pocket money. It's still worth discussing.

It strikes me that most of the suggestions offered so far (and again,
I'm glad for all of them), indeed most of the suggestions I see floated
about writers' groups in general, are targeted at giving a specific
person a greater share of the very limited available funds to writers.
Schools, for example, whether accredited or unaccredited, make their
money from hopeful future writers, rather than readers. Google Adwords
are a little better, for what little money they yield, since they're
based on surfing rather than purchases, but unless purchases are finally
made, that system will fall apart (or prey on magazine editors who
advertise). Rarely do I see any suggestions on how to get more people to
read, which is the necessary long view.

my back has been broken three times so in their infinite wisdom a few years
ago the state put me on SSI
by the time you pay the rent and road runner and deduct the weekly bus pass
you have abt 6  dollar a day to live on, some months 5 to 6
you are allowed to earn 80.00 a month at a job--80 a month--

so trying to find ways to make a dollar here and there--under the table--
forget abt new books or a new movie at commerical theatres, shows, clothes
etc--
good for finding out alll the alternativies and ways to get in free,
discounts etc all over the place, know people who are in places to get one
in, every form of survival to get by--available around city--things found on
streets--etc--cheapest most low tech art supplies--
necessity is the motherfucker of invention--
everyday an education and a continual activity of imagination--creativity--
learn to travel the world and through eons walking the familiar streets and
parks--finding new ones--
all that is hidden in plain sight--
a form of imprisonment in which one has to create freedoms--
not making any money just learning how to live with ever less--
in all of this, one becomes ironically "a very skilled worker"!

I remind you that To Topos seeks submissions for the forthcoming Poetry and Poverty issue.  For more info: http://oregonstate.edu/dept/foreign_lang/totopos/index.html

  I once had to take a job as a custodian.  Working the graveyard shift (that's 11:pm to 7:am for all the white collar necks out there) nearly killed me.  I cleaned the anthropolgy building at U of Oregon.  After a while I got the hang of it and could finish my work within four hours.  I read and wrote poetry for the rest of my shift.  All this after having graduated with honors at the top of my class, and having returned from a lengthy residency at the Vermont Studio Ctr., winning awards, publishing poems, etc.  I had a glint of light in my eyes of becoming the next (insert noted poet name here).  Little did I know the glint was cast by the reflection of fourescent light in the water of the many toilet bowls I scrubbed.

  I don't know why I write, I don't ask why.  I just do.  And I'll do the stoop labor to keep food on the table, my library card up to date, and my head filled with poetry.  Luckily, I put my writing skills to work and now work as a grant writer/office jockey for OSU, go Beavers!

If you can get this working, this is terrific. Uses the Beatnik plugin.

working on my Windows XP system. But I tell ya this is/was one of the most
exciting interactive audio works for the Web. A crying shame it's so hard to
get working now!

I did both in my youth...and I got to scrub out the pans the potatoes =

cook could turn them into au gratin sort of food.=20

Worse, or I should say, more tedious and tiring than the potato mess was =

Trying to get more people to read is the business I'm in now, having not fared
so well as a window cleaner -- I think the teachers on this list will agree
that one of the few real rewards of our profession is seeing the enthusiasm
with which some students take to some of the readings we bring to them.

Slow work, admittedly -- but a few of those copies of small press books that get
bought get bought by people who've been in my classes --

Ms. Bogle, I'm glad I'm not the only refugee from Binghamton on this
list.  The English Department of course got to be renowned AFTER 1976,
i.e., after I'd shucked, jived, and occasionally worked my way through
the Ph.D. program.  I keep missing some of the good ones. I missed James
Wright by a few months when I was at Lehman nee Hunter. And John Gardner
showed up after I was gone, some others, most recently Maria Gillan, the
first person of any repute to publish me.  There were undergraduates
named Revell, Blumenthal, and Peacock.  I knew from nothing.

I was not a writer in the early '70s--but Robert Kroetsch, who was the
real deal, embarrassed the shit out of me at a memorial reading for
Pound back in 1972 by calling me a "poet." I'd let him read some of what
I was writing. I don't know why the hell I trusted him but I did and I
wasn't sorry.  But: I wasn't a poet then and I'm not now.  I've just
written a few poems over the years, and gotten lucky like a Trappist
monk delivering bourbon fudge to a brothel. "Poet" sets up certain
expectations in my own mind, let alone other people's.  I can't even
define what they are.  Maybe the expectations have to do with the idea
that writing is related to making a living?  If so, the more fool I.

    * Earning a living is what got my attention.  I can't do that at the
      moment.  I lost my job on March 27 and except for a week in
      Brooklyn that involved age discrimination directed against me, I
      haven't been able to work since.  Family Court is up my butt about
      back alimony.  Duh.  No income=no alimony.  It is ugly. So jobs
      prey on me.
    * As for making a living writing...my dissertation advisor at
      SUNY-Bingbang has a son who long ago wanted to write pornographic
      fiction.  Not even high-toned Olympia Press stuff, but real
      slippery-floor-shop stroke books. Mel asked his kid "How many
      different ways can you think of to DO it?" That stopped the young
      man cold.
    * I sometimes imagine I would like to be a male prostitute like Dan
      Brown and write religious pornography along the lines of The
      DaVinci Code or Angels & Demons.  I confess: I read 1/3 of Angels
      & Demons before I knew it was not going to get better.  Mea maxima
      culpa.  But I did not grab a ceremonial dagger and try to perform
      sepuku to cover my shame.  Nevertheless, I persist in telling
      myself that if I am paid enough to write for a fukbuck, if I can
      turn into Irving Wallace or Harold Robbins, i.e., I can live with
      the face in the mirror.  Maybe.  Working in WalMart, however, as I
      might have to, is not dishonorable.
    * I got paid to write poetry: twice!  Except for a few desultory
      poems such as the ones Kroetsch read, I didn't get serious until I
      was 46, in 1990.  Time One was the result of the perfect job:
      Associate Editor of the AT&T Technical Journal, a bigger pile of
      happy horse-shit you never saw.  I learned the production cycle in
      a month, then spent three and a half years writing poetry at work
      on what I call an AT&T grant.  I had the sort of job where you
      cannot invent work if it isn't given to you, so poetry filled my
      time very nicely.
    * Second time was winning a NJ State Council on the Arts Fellowship
      in 1995.  I entered because I had nothing else to do.  I was
      totally shocked when I was one of the winners.  A whole $7200
      which I had to declare, i.e., hide, because I'd solicited the
      money.  Nevertheless, it was a joy.  And I didn't quit my day
      job.  I haven't won since.
    * There is for me an interesting correlation between a day job and
      the ability to write.  Right now, to paraphrase Mose Allison, my
      mind is on vacation, or better, I am SO channeled into getting
      back into the work world that the rare word I manage to commit
      probably sucks beyond all manner of means.
    * It may come back.
    * It may be gone.
    * I don't worry about it.

Ken

First commissioned by Jessica Lowenthal and Joshua Schuster
as part of a project entitled "Poetry, Politics, Proximity:  the
Third Annual Kerry Sherin Wright Prize."  This stunning new
poem "Spring Diet of Flowers at Night" by Frank Sherlock is
now a chapbook published by Mooncalf Press.

What the hell is the 'Idea' of poetry?

Williams was a Doctor, Stevens an Insurance VP, Eliot a Banker, Whitman was
a nurse and printer, Neruda was a diplomat, Olson was a Political Appointee.
Survival and being able to actually write poetry is the imperative and I
think these guys did ok?! Or did they sell out too?

    ***
    Those Girls
    by Jessica Westhead
    $15.00
    Summer 2006
    ISBN-10: 1-894744-21-7;
    ISBN-13: 978-1-894744-21-8
    5.125" =D7 6.625"; 36pp; limited to 100 numbered & signed copies.

    In Those Girls, Jessica Westhead's new collection of short stories, the =
    style of Samuel Beckett meets the humour and content of a Dilbert =
    cartoon. Westhead writes about modern suburban life with pathos, wit and =
    razor-sharp dialogue. To read these stories is to take pleasure in the =
    mundane, daily language we hear everywhere we go. Few people have the =
    touch necessary to pull this off without seeming condescending or rude, =
    but Westhead does it effortlessly. Those Girls narrates a bunch of guys =
    whose lives are preoccupied with women - the women both in their lives =
    and in their fantasies that they never quite understand. This is a book =
    about how rarely people relate and the inexplicable nature of gender. =
    These guys are neither articulate nor successful; they fumble through =
    life spouting office clich=E9s and eating combos. They talk about women =
    at work, during lunch, or overhear them on the commuter train. They take =
    advice from the wrong people and get obsessed with their co-workers' =
    wives. These guys constantly try to get the attention of those girls and =
    figure out what makes them tick, but all to no avail.

Praise to Vernon Frazer for his letter.
Thanks to mIEKAL aND for outing window washers on the list.  (The potato
peelers on the list are coy.)
Hats to Ken Wolman, a fellow SUNYionian.
Regards to the writer on SSI, the winner who worked as a custodian, and all
those who write because they say they have to and feel that economic
questioning, necessity, and reality make for reasonable debate.

Quite a number mentioned scamming; one man at his blog quoted my letter
headed by the statement that I ought to be smacked.

Women on the list are apparently unconcerned with how to earn $10,000 per
year, which is both a good indicator and bad for my morale.

After jobhunting every fall for eight years, I got an offer to teach in
China.  I adored the man who offered me the job.  He said he liked my credentials
and c.v.  I reflected about what was listed there: the courses I had taken,
including women writers and modernism, but not only: 40 courses and seminars in
English alone, covering three degrees, German proficiency, creative writing,
and liberal arts.  I didn't go to China, however.  I would have gone there in
debt wearing their clothing.  I was afraid to owe even $4,000 (what I still owe)
living overseas.

So, again, if I get up to solvency, options I don't have now might open up,
but it has been a very long haul.  My health is good.  The unemployment started
at age 32.

No one suggested, as they did in chunking out the community college jobs in
Houston: women can just get married.  Considering that they were looking for
heiresses and lawyers to marry themselves, I don't know which men they thought
might marry us: creative writers making $3,000 per semester teaching four
nights a week.

This crazy geographer I went on a date with -- he told me, among other things
that he is a Marxist, that I am "too thin for farm life," that he had been
his family's breadwinner, that his wife stayed at home until the divorce then
became a well-paid R.N.  He said he had never met another woman like me in
comparable finanicial circumstances -- I am seemingly set in a comfortable house in
a beautiful part of the metro area but am staggeringly poor.  He had had to
refinance his farm when his wife wanted to go her separate way, and it left him
feeling against the community property law in his state.  He needs a
housekeeper and told me to be a waitress after I had sent him my c.v.  He said there
was someone teaching English at his U who couldn't speak English.  ETC.

One of my brainstorms has been to study housekeeping.  You who do are smart
to teach reading -- I used to do that and liked it better than teaching
writing.  If someone were to teach house cleaning locally, I would sign up.  To be
really good and content at that would possibly get me somewhere.

It makes me uncomfortable that so many people I know (three?) know Bush but
no one I know knows the Clinton, Gores, Kerrys or Wellstones.

my friend ivor hanson is a professional window washer and has written a very good memoir about his experiences--as a musician/window washer/admiral's son who was not expected to make a living in this way. i don't recall what they chose as the name of the book, which is coming out this year, but it grew from an essay he wrote for the "ny times" called "the allure of the ledge." one amazing detail: he was hired to wash some windows at the rather schmancy nyc building in which his parents were living. he showed up with his window gear. the doorman, who admitted him as a visitor on a regular basis, saw him with this gear and said, "sorry, ivor--you've got to take the service entrance!" but if he'd visited his parents earlier or later the same day, sans gear, he would of course enter through the front.

i think about these issues regularly, and so do my friends--male, female, married or not, gay or straight, with or without children: how to afford to live, how to get by honestly and ethically, while still managing to pursue one's non-money-making (or, may or may not ever be money-making) passions and goals. i don't see a gender divide here. my female friends worry just as much. they're not expecting to be "rescued," financially or in any other way.

btw, if anyone cares: i've written a book proposal closely related to this topic (w/ an historical view; not how-to!). my agent has been focusing more on another proposal of mine, but if any publishers out there, or people who know them, would like to see this one, i know she'd send it out promptly--as that would indicate a chance for her (and me) to make some money......

"It makes me uncomfortable that so many people I know (three?) know Bush =
but=20
no one I know knows the Clinton, Gores, Kerrys or Wellstones."

Ann Bogle

*************************************************************************=
***
Ann,

Take comfort; We know the Clintons.

Well, I should clarify, I know Walter and Irene Clinton.  Walter is an =
out of work, military school trained heavy equipment, former Korean =
Conflict veteran diesel mechanic working as a part-time janitor for the =
school district; Irene fills in at the middle school cafeteria when ever =
she gets called.  Both of them voted for Bill Clinton.  "It's a namesake =
thing..." Walter said when I asked him. =20

Incidentally, Walter sculpts, some in wood, but mostly stones.  He likes =
the feel of granite and marble when they've been polished.  He took a =
few courses at the Adult Ed center to help him hone his skills as a =
sculptor, but he quit mid-way through the second such course.  Seems his =
Art Instructor insisted he draw out (sketch was the word used) his =
creations before chipping away at the stone.  "Pain in the ass technique =
," is how Walter referred to the requirement.  "I feel the stone, and I =
know what to take away," Walter assured me over a few beverages one =
evening.=20

 Irene says she likes the smile on Walter's face when he completes a =
project.  She prefers watercolor to oil as her medium.   I equate her =
work somewhat to that of O'Keefe; she has one petunia blossom on canvas =
approx 36'' x 48" that stands out in my estimation. She's working on a =
greatly exaggerated, 6 ft x 8 ft. close-up of Walter's lips in winter.  =
"He's at his warmest then," she told me.  =20

Me, I like the fact they are friends who have found ways to earn money =
to both pay for food and keep themselves in supplies they need for their =
spiritual outlet. =20

I don't know any Gores or Kerrys, but I do on occasion dine with Mark =
Bush when he returns to town to visit his children. =20

Mark's ex-wife Ariel slept with their neighbor while Mark was away on =
business.  Ariel and her friend now live in Mark's former home with Mark =
and Ariel's two daughters.  The court awarded Mark unrestricted =
visitation rights, even though Ariel tried to deny them; she said later, =
she just didn't want him around the girls, it was nothing personal.  =
Also, she got to keep living in the home he continues to pay the =
mortgage on, and she got a 5 year retraining alimony allotment.  The =
judge said since she had been 18 when she first got pregnant, she never =
had the opportunity to fully educate herself. =20

She took a few Adult Ed courses that amounted to nothing; I think one =
course was on flower arranging for the holidays.  Mostly she spent her =
money pandering to her friend's whims and fantasies.   Ariel's live-in =
friend, I think his name is Ted, has been looking for meaningful work =
for the past 5 years or so.  He says he's tired of just having jobs; he =
wants a career.  I have never actually seen him leave the house to =
embark on what might be called employment, but admittedly I've not been =
able to observe 3rd shift hours.  Somebody told me Ted had a degree in =
Liberal Arts, but that could be just a rumor. I've never actually spoken =
to the man.   =20

Mark's trying to find work that won't take him on the road so much; he =
blames the frequent trips for the divorce.  He acknowledges though that =
his commissions & 6 figure salary are tough to replace, especially for =
an un-schooled, untrained salesperson whose primary skill seems to be a =
warm personality and an ability to talk people into buying his narrow =
list of fertilizer products.   =20

My advice to Mark was that he should recommend to Ariel's friend that he =
take Mark's job in order to satisfy that need for a career.=20

I made the recommendation for selfish reasons though; I was hoping, with =
Ted on the road, Mark could get back together with Ariel, and once =
again, I would be invited to Mark and Ariel's for a home-cooked meal.  =
God-damn, that woman knows how to put ingredients together into a savory =
meal!  She does a filet of sole wrapped around a crab cake mixture that =
is literally the best sea-food thing I've ever eaten...and when she =
serves it it's drizzled with a lime and pepper sauce that sparkles with =
a hint of sweet red bell pepper.  Untidy house or not, I think I could =
learn to live with a little mess in the den.  =20
Alex=20
P.S. which Wellstones?   I only know Patricia; she lives in West =
Virginia, or at least she did last time I saw her back in the early =
80's; she'd gotten fat since college.  I don't think she works hard =
enough since she got married to that Baptist minister...this girl used =
to chug rum shooters, then she'd do half dozen of the boys in the room =
just before passing out.  Funny how she took to religion after she quit =
the booze. I'm not really sure she's happy though.  =20

Best bookstore in Vancouver is probably the Charles H. Scott Gallery book
shop on Granville Island. It's the Emily Carr School of Art and Design
Gallery store. You can find work by Lisa Robertson there and quite a few
small press books for sale. Most of the bookstores in the city have very
meagre poetry collections, sad to say. Be prepared to be disappointed.

for used...try

www.wesellusedbooks.com

a western Ontario bookstore owner runs the site and is trying to list all
existing used bookstores.  He's doing very well for Canada and working on
U.S. too

Bowering at least should not be a problem...he's pretty big

but my favorite canadian poet is Alden Nowlan (deceased, from Nova Scotia
I believe)--he's fabulous--check our Purdy too.

Anyone with a favorite used bookstore should check to see if it's listed
on the site and get it listed if it's not...it's free.

A member of this community, I recognize that everyone
has a responsibility to react towards others with
deference, and regardless of what circumstances might
usually arise, and acutely appreciating that
communication is not made possible otherwise.

About a week ago, and I've been lame due to my hectic
travel schedule and the foolishness with which I live
my life, and this what I'm sharing seems important for
reason of explanation for my disdainful behavior, but
I was, regrettably, very rude to Aldon, my reaction to
his intelligent inquiry best termed as inexcusable.

To both Aldon L. Nielsen and this community, I
apologize. I hope that a better job will be done next
time I feel impatient, cranky, or otherwise angry with
the world.

Regards,
Alexander Jorgensen

A word like 'conflate' is a very good word. And
because we do not know each other, this venue one of
anonymity and sometimes here say, I can swallow, even
enjoy, what was mustered and focused with intelligent
candor. I will, however, address some of what was
stated in your email of about a week old.

To begin with, I, at best, hope to provide
information, useful and free of either ego, arrogance
and unfair or intentional bias--at worst, a compass.
As stated in an earlier email, I have been traveling
for about eight weeks, a short time in an otherwise
continuous travel regimen of eight years. It has been
difficult, as you know.

Now, with what I hope is more than empty juice box
slurping sounds--

If Paul Bowles be viewed as either colonialist or
farce, then how about another:

"As the traveler who has once been from home is wiser
than he who has never left his own doorstep, so a
knowledge of one other culture should sharpen our
ability to scrutinize more steadily, to appreciate
more lovingly, our own."--Margaret Mead

You said: The distinction between "traveler" and
"tourist" seems to me just as self-important and
deluded as the old-fashioned tourist persona that it
was meant to critique.

Fair enough, and I understand your intent, I think,
that being the reduction of egos and removal of
elitism, the crumbling of distinctions that might
otherwise dissuade a thoughtful person from either
venturing out, as they say--or speaking what seems
their truth. To be honest, and maybe this is not
relevant for any other reason than for you to better
understand me, I am proud of my knowledge
acquired--for it has been earned--but, alas, I am no
more, really, than a prole (and sometimes always) with
ambition.

But as a traveler, one who has really wandered the
world, nearly 30 countries, residing in five, from
places such as the Galapagos (where I lived and
worked) to India (where I've returned from a second
humanitarian trip in a matter of months), there are
things I've observed. It is, and I think we're in
agreement, about mind-set (and I will elaborate
further and with examples).

Now, with regards to either visa or passport, this,
too, is important for it, really, I think, provides a
framework for what the traveler, as a foreigner, might
be entitled to byway of a culture, along with those
expectations a receiving culture might have of that
traveler. Additionally, race and time are factors,
along with sensitivity and availability of created or
provided opportunities for exploration within a
culture and outside, into its margins (where most
never venture, including within own native
culture--but, as you know, this is often where the
'tastiest buds' are).

In some instances, and this refers to mind-set, the
most liberal of traveler's, let me say, still finds
himself/herself constrained by such a willingness to
accept without prejudice and be apart that it hinders
(and often unknowingly). Too, often a traveler is so
excited in unselfconscious domesticated form one sees
what one wants to see, ventures to those areas most
comfortable--most close to one's point of reference--
and is often limited by a worrisome presupposition
that we are "basically" the same--which, I contend, we
are not, or as I've observed. And death has been
nearby more than a few times.

That is to say, and as you know, our history and
culture (personal, overall) shape us, no, but also
often impede our open search. It is a pretense. In
fact, it is a kind of prejudice parading about as an
openness--and I think a mostly Western one. Too, it is
about expectations--the traveler's and the host's. How
many folks, for example, are able to pass or disappear
within a culture visited. Often, there's the illusion
of a culture opening itself, the supposing that one,
through smiles, some shared exchange, has gained
access to something special which may, often, be
simply superficial.

When one is hiking with one's LL Bean regalia, or
participating in a study abroad program, shopping for
clothing and other stuff precisely available for
solely the traveler, or zipping from here to there
with sights in mind, confronted by people perhaps
sordid or impoverished, financial constraints and an
unwillingness, naturally, to float with fluidity, so
much happens that is often missed. Also, the best of
intentions can prove to be fruitless and
misguided--opportunities often rendered nil.

Here are some examples, taken directly from most
recently received emails--

An email from a T*b*ten friend in India, a refugee
residing near place of dwelling of HH, where I was
most recently:

"Hi! It is very funny what I can hear from a Westerner
who is a visitor sitting there and talking about
touring Tibet to an Indian guy. He doesn't know even
that is happening for Tibetan people in Tibet?...It
seems that he doesn't know the path he treads along,
for why and what target! I just remember that
"Fluttering for a buffalo to appreciate the melodious
cadence."

Now, this, as I witnessed, was very common where I
was. In fact, I was entrenched in this community where
Israelis on Kibbutz and Germans, French visited to see
HH. They didn't speak with Tibetans, purchased goods
from Indians, rather than support a desperate people,
rode around in motorbikes and smoked dope--on the top
of the world no less. They went hiking, camping, very
middle class things, Western things, and will return
home with photos.

And another, which relates to the same, but I could
share an endless list of anecdotes:

"I don't consider myself vulgar for trying to get a
sense of what tibet feels like (yes, including the way
the hans live) at this moment in HISTORY...It's a lot
better for tibet to have travellers (yes, even
insensitive holiday makers, but they generally do
little harm other than irritating the crap out of
people) than to be completely cut off from the rest of
the world. Having tourists floating around can make
tibet's political situation seem less dire. but if
tibet were isolated, people such as yourself won't
have a chance to delve into the angst among the
tibetan intelligentsia and let the world know about
the depth of chinese oppression."

Well, this email, however well intentioned, is silly.
Tibetans don't want her spending her money in Tibet,
because money is made by the oppressor. Too, Tibet is
not a holiday spot, as it is a place occupied, where
90% has been taken or destroyed. Oh, I just want, or
think I have the write, is a mind-set of the most
liberal minded of travelers often.

Now, with regards to China, which is a Portugeuse
word, and its 56 nationalities, the dominant Han, I
know this country intimately. And Hong Kong, Macau,
and Taiwan folk are very different from Mainlanders,
as they are called. As my passport has been recorded
at this internet cafe, little can be shared, but
enough to either leave you constipated--or make the
ol' sphincter collapse.

I've lived in three regions, traveled extensively, run
schools, worked for Tsinghua university, written text
books, the British Embassy (British Council as an
IELTS tester), developed a broad circle of friends
from various economic and power-enabled, I'll call it,
levels. This is relevant, because I come in contact
with people who travel through this place, work in
this place, and seemingly know little else their
limited sphere, which is a judgement I hope you will
allow me to make--these folk being both Chinese in
nationality and foreigners. And China is such a
complex issue/place, and without our Judeo-Greco
underpinings.

So, how it is to be Chinese?

I do not know what it is to be Chinese any more than I
know what it is to be American. I can only report my
observations, share personal stories and anecdotes
offered by people who might otherwise not be able to
speak freely (and there is no political culture here,
one could argue). Too, I have passed as ethnic
minorities, which has been useful, especially as a
writer, and I do think the best are spies. And I can
say the same of the US. What one is, I think, is a
product of places and personal knowledge. And this
returns us, did, I think, to Mead.

I'll stop, now -- and will continue tomorrow about
those issues of linguistics. See, I am able to sit,
now, and write. And no, by background is in English
and cultural anthropology. My wife is a linguist, and
she speaks about seven languages, including Mandarin,
has worked as a translator. Me, I've studied five, not
really an authority, as you say, on any, including
both Mandarin and English--but I've my observations.

And, please remember, out of fairness, that I never
said I was an authority, which, and I do think, this
word is misleading for a number of later to be
discussed reasons.

the minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 13 pieces by mIEKAL aND.

You don't go looking for poetry finds,
you go, looking, for poetry finds.

Have you ever wanted to write poems that used trees, mountains, stars,
and/or squirrels instead of words? Here are the letters with which to
build that vocabulary.

Enjoy,
Dan

To learn about oneself
Give to others

Do not naively confirm
The conventional categories
Of ordinary experience

Let all become one
W/ our dusty world

An ant rising
Out of a bowl
“Goes” ah baby ah baby
This life is good
So let us go
This life is good

“To a mountaineer a
sea voyage is a pleasant
and restful change.”
                 -- John Muir

“It seemed strange
that everyone more or
less afflicted [w/
seasickness] should seem
ashamed.”
               -- John Muir

Strong, glad life

All of us in the brawling traffic
Sun-spanglettes in the ditch
Tumbling black bag, plastic, inflated
In an accident
Of wind
Rolls, dog sized, along
The tan of the concrete
Median barrier

The world indeed this moment
Is kind of a sloppy dock
In a broader, happy bay
Whose flotsam at night
Chips the sky
In stripes of flame

The taillights towing a chain
Of red fire through a tearing fog

The road a draggle
Of quadrangular quanta

“Go where we will, all the world
over, we seem to have been
there before.” -- John Muir

“The world though made
is yet being made
and this is but
the morning of creation.”
                    -- John Muir

Jerome Rothenberg
Is the John Muir of the word

Paints fade
Patinas grow
Scratches froth
Muds puff

And we jig still

“Most people when they
travel only look at
what they are directed to
look at.”
-- John Muir

Dead at confluence of on-ramp
With I-80 near Milton PA
Noon. Susquehanna River
V. high & turbid brown
Sometimes rising on a hill it's like
All our skin is made of sailcloth, our thighs
Of girls, and those books
That we keep out of the wind
Were of meats concocted
-- the pelvis on me
Of a tire erected
-- there is a bright bridge


“If totalitarianism comes to this
country, it will almost surely do so
in the guise of 100% Americanism.”

Nationalist, but he makes the best

Makes it in his home can you believe that?

Rejects what he sees for what he
Thinks
A wise person rejects what she thinks

“They call themselves ‘Indian’….
They say they do not want to change
Their way of life” – Wm Blackmore
The North American Indian, 1869

In the 1760s during the French and Indian War
The Ottawa chief Pontiac almost drove
The British out of Michigan
During the War of 1812 Tecumseh
The Shawnee nearly united all the Indians
Against the Americans in the Ohio valley

But Sitting Bull was not only
A great warrior he was a
Holy man who had the ability
To see into the past and into the future
His name in Lakota Teton
Was Tatonka Iotakay

Considered by his people as a seer
A Weechashah Waukahn
He was born in 1831
Died in 1890. That same year
The US govt declared
The frontier no longer existed.

The Lakota name for white people was
Waséetchoo. Between 1862 and
1890 the US govt fought 11
Indian wars – About 200 separate
Military actions: Ambushes, Raids
And the chasing down and killing
Of fleeing family groups.

Some historians believe US troops
Killed btw 1776 & 1890 about
4,000 Native Americans by
Gunshot or fire or knifing or bayoneting
It is estimated by some that Indians
May have killed 7000 soldiers
And civilians during that same time.

Th. Jefferson believed white folk
Cd not live on the plains:
He was right, in a way: some don’t
Call this living.

The Choctaw, Creek,
& the Chickasaw – And the Cherokee –
Were ordered removed from
Alabama, Georgia, & Mississippi
B/c the whites wanted their land
Which they owned outright
For the growing of cotton Oklahoma
Was to belong to them forever

Genl Philip H. Sheridan
Who devised the masterplan
And coordinated the systematic
Genocide of the the plains Indians
Wrote in 1878 “The govt made treaties,
Gave presents, made promises—none
Of which were honestly fulfilled”

“We took away their country and then
Their means of support, broke up their
Mode of living and habits of life,
Introduced disease among them—and
It was for this, and against this,
They made war.”

This was the same
Soldier Sheridan who fought
So viciously in the civil war

Sitting Bull stood 5 ft 10 inches
Weighed 100 75 pound
Had red brown / brown red skin
Eyes brown large & white
In each eye nestled a great student
Each of his eyeballs was a schoolhouse
Sitting Bull was a highly confident man
He wore 2 long braids
He wrapped them in badger skin
A badger is a bad animal
They are hard to catch and subdue
And once you catch one
God help you
The subduction of a badger is difficult

Bright gray altostratus cool day
His battle headdress when he wore it
Had a hundred feathers in it
  From the eagles of the Black Hills
And the Tetons but mostly he just wore
A single feather in his hair

Sitting Bull was a primate
A great ape
He once to a reporter in the west
“I see. I know. I began to see
Before I was born, when I was
Not in my mother’s arms but inside
My mother’s belly. It was there
That I began to study about my people.
The Great Spirit gave me the power
To see out of the womb.
I studied there in the womb
About many things.
I was so interested that I
Turned over on my side.
The Great Spirit must have
Told me at that time
That I wd be the man to be the judge
Of all the other Indians.
A big man to decide for them
In all their ways.”

The Lakota had rules of engagement
He never broke them.
If he had he wd have the lost
The respect of his people. The sight of
A sick child, any child,
Any such child—the child
Of a fat lady, the child
Of a white lady—the child
Of a fat white lady
Any such sick child, any child,
Brought tears to his eyes

Sitting Bull never attacked a
White settlement. Sitting Bull
Always released the white women
And the white children
In a notebook during the 1860s
Sitting Bull drew an autobiography
41 pictures using a crayon

Again with a white elder couple
In a maroon Buick
A burgundy Buick
What is it about that car
That demographic

The 41 pictures matter of factly depict
Violent events in Sitting Bull’s life

Language of the Oglala Lakota

Often the Whites got things really wrong
When they were talking w/ the Indians
Such that the name “Man Whose

Slight denigration

Squaw is a word fr the Algonquin meaning
Woman whereas the Lakota word for
Woman was Wéeñahn. Whites
Referred to Lakota women as
Squaws.

In 1877 Sitting Bull sd
“What I am, I am.” Which I guess
Was his way of saying
He accepts himself & is comfortable
With his position in the world
This is a Rotring Core fountain pen
When he was born the midwife
Covered Sitting Bull in bear grease.

Lakota parents did not boss
Their children or other children the children
Sleep when they want eat when
They want they were never put
To bed, never forced to eat “on time”
The Lakota never struck their children
Nor did they yell Lakota
Babies were not allowed to cry
For crying cd learn the enemy to them

In the 1600s when the French Jesuits
Encountered them the Lakota lived
In the parts of Minnesota
I grew up in, at, among other places
The headwaters of the Mississippi
Near now Itasca State Park
Which I visited as a boy
And thought a swiz

They were living
Then in timber framed houses
A Father Marquette sd

And they keep their own word

Their enemies and the French

The Creek first
Bringing them thus firearms who made
Then war (there again the Daily

Of the forests west & south
To the valley of the Missouri
The journey taking decades
And the Lakota separating into 3
Peoples: the Teton, The Santée, and
The Yankton groups. Oglala means
People who Scatter Their Own

Sitting Bull’s family belonged
To the band called Itchy-Craw
Which means those who laugh
At each other. The Lakota
Languages contain no swear words.

James Brown has made a career
Out of apoplexy
I wonder what that dude’s
EEG looks like

I believe it is the Hitchcock film
“Notorious,” starring the
Glorious
Ingrid Bergman in which a young
James Brown is filmed as a nightclub act
Whose onstage apoplexies are
“Patronized to” by an eyerolling
Obese whiteboy businessman who does not
Understand what James Brown is doing
The sublimation of Rage
The affrontive subversion of Rhapsody

On another note
“Bad Bad Leroy Brown”
Is one of the greatest songs
On the earth
Also on the Ice Continents and the Waters. An
Example of Modern Balladry

3 characteristics of a ballad:

1) Impersonal narrator

2) Simple plot

3) Often based on real events

I pity Leroy Brown when he
Loses the knife fight
Even tho he was so formidable
I pity Leroy Brown
His loss of life in the fight
It is because I am
Human!
You, you the jailer guard you too
Are human!
You pity Leroy Brown!

I cross again the great Allegheny

In 1863 (?) near Killdeer Hills, ND
Sitting Bull fought whites for
1st time: 2000 soldiers
Led by Genl Sully

Then Sully went to junction
Of Missouri & Yellowstone River
& there built Fort Beauford
Fanny Kelly: Book

Col. George Armstrong Custer
Formerly Maj Genl Custer
Gave a standing order to
His aide that if
Indians should attack when Custer was
Away, his aide was to
Shoot Custer’s wife in the head
If her capture
Was to seem imminent

There was a fort at the
Confluence of the Cannonball
And Missouri in what wd be
North Dakota
At this fort (Fort Rice) for several days
Sitting Bull ran off its
Cattle and ineffectively
Harassed its defenses
But the soldiers responded
W/ cannon & exploding shells

A Cpt Rankin
At Fort Beauford MT
Shot his own wife
Afraid she wd be taken
As Sitting Bull worried

Sitting Bull never captured the fort

As a matter of fact no fort on the plains
Was ever captured by Native Americans
Cpt Rankin shot his wife too soon

Anywhere from 5 to 15 an hr

By late 1860s the 750 mile
Journey between NYC and Chicago
Could be done in 3 days by rail
Custer’s job was to stop the
Lakota from robbing & sabotaging
The Northern Pacific Railroad
Which started in Duluth, MN
And was planned to extend
The valley of the Yellowstone
The way to Seattle

George Armstrong Custer
Was not unlike Geo. W. Bush
A very poor student he
Graduated last in his class
At West Point NY & once
Broke into a professor’s office
To steal exam questions

Following a battle once he shouted
“I cannot but exclaim
Glorious War!”

Custer led haphazard charges
Against the Confederates
Assuring that his command
Suffered more losses than any other
Outfit in the Union army

“You’re welcome” when I say “thank you”
The boy general George W. Custer
Received Robert E. Lee’s flag
At Appomattox and led the
Union Army at its Parade of Triumph
In DC. He loved loudly tailored uniforms
And ostentatious headware
Very like Lord Cardigan

“Like a woman” he was very fond
Of his hair his hair fell to his shoulders
The Indians called him Long Hair
He designed his own uniform

Custer loved animals tho
And was filled often with a buoyancy
Resembling joy

He had a pet porcupine, pet badger
A pet wild turkey, pet beaver
A pet prairie dog and a fieldmouse
That lived on his desk
In an unused inkwell
And a pet raccoon
And hounds upon hounds upon hounds
Houndreds of them
Yet for all he loved animals
He hated human beings

Most specifically black people and Indians
And if any subordinates broke his rules
He actually ordered them tied up in funny positions
And exposed them to flies and gnats
Many leaves blooming
In the valley of the Hudson

His own troops called him Iron Butt
On June 18th 1873 he got telegram
While at Fort Abraham Lincoln
& Left for the Yellowstone country
With the 7th Cavalry on Aug 4th
Sitting Bull ambushed Custer
As he rode ahead of his main force
With a 90 man escort

& Sitting Bull set fire to the tall grass
Custer’s ammo ran very low

Pres. Grant orders Genl Sheridan
(Mr. Total War) into the Black Hills to
Determine if gold was there as the

Due to bank failures & the idea was
More gold was needed but the
Fort Laramie Treaty stipulated this
Area as a Sioux Reservation

Custer’s men & family (some of whom
Died with him) all shot themselves
In the head or shot or were shot
By their comrades

After the death of Custer, Sitting Bull
Was so feared by Americans that
Newspapers surmised he was
Probably white – for it was thought
An Indian cd not kill a white man

Newspapers conjectured Sitting Bull
Was in fact a renegade white man
Who spoke English, German, French &
Chinese fluently.

It was first the newspaper
Editors who suggested
That the government should deliberately spread
Smallpox among Native Americans

Custer, like Genl Grant, from Ohio
A town called New Rumly
“The only good Indians I ever saw
Were dead.” -- Genl Sheridan

“We’re making off for Sitting Bull
And this is the way we go:
40 miles a day on beans and hay
In the regular army, O!”

On May 6 1877 Sitting Bull
Led 889 people & 12000
Horses into captivity at Camp Robinson Nebraska

Strange but patchy snow on ground
In woods to rt and sm. buds on trees

It was in this state, Pennsylvania
In 1871 that a tannery company
Found a way to make quality
Leather out of Buffalo hide
As leather was always in need
For furniture, clothes and drivebelts
(We forget that our rubber drive belts
Were once leather) and at
This time the real slaughter of Buffalo
Started. The term “sharpshooter”comes
  From buffalo huntingkilling. The Sharps
Was a rifle, a big game rifle in that it
Shot a shell 2 ½” long
It could kill a buffalo at 1500 yards

Native Americans said of it
“It shoots today – and kills tomorrow”

THE IDIOT
Joseph Wright Moore killed 20500
In 9 years – a Record
Btw 1872 & 1873 the buffalo
Was wiped out of Kansas
Then they moved into Texas

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
Was founded as a result of the Buffalo slaughter
In 1866. The army encouraged
The destruction of the buffalo
Because it would hasten
The extermination of Native Americans

8 hrs: 507 miles: 63.38mph

Mr. Total War G W Bush Genl Sheridan sd
“These men [buffalo hunters]
Have done more in the last 2 yrs
To settle the Indian question
Than the entire regular army
Has done in the last 30 years.
They are destroying the Indian commissary.”

And sd they shd all get medals
It is for this reason that Pres. Grant
Vetoed a preservation bill
Passed by Congress. “The sooner the Indian
Loses all his Indian ways, including
His language, the better it will be for him
And for the government.” – Richard H. Pratt,
Principle of Carlyle Indian School, 1883
Tuesday July 19 1881 Fort Beauford MT
Sitting Bull surrendered with 187 children & women

“I wish it to be remembered that
I was the last man of my tribe
To surrender my rifle.”

The first white town Sitting Bull visited
Was Bismarck ND – August 1 1881
He ate ice cream in the
Sheridan House Hotel.

Genl Sheridan being the one who
Made the equation btw
Good Indians and the deceased ones.

My little daughter Clio

At 9 hours I cross the 6pm beautiful
Shenango River under
Dark swirled clouds mottled in sun
And the Shenango swollen brown
Puffy out of its banks.

The Lakota word for cattle was
Wohl-Haw from hearing
Cowboys say this:
Whoa (stop) & Haw (go)

The Bureau of Indian Affairs
Banned the Lakota from
Practicing their religions thus
Denying them their rights to
Religious Freedom, banned the Sun Dance
The motto of the Carlyle School
A boarding school near here, in
Carlyle PA was “Kill the Indian
To save the Man.”

During the summer of 1855, 150 yrs
Ago this summer, Sitting Bull
Joined the touring show of Wild Bill Cody
Visiting NYC Philadelphia & DC
He gave most of his money
To white beggars in the cities & sd
“The white man knows how to
Make everything, but he does not
Know how to distribute it”

Strange long series of very white snow
On rt hills mid Ohio 685 miles
So late in April & warm
In the light’s lee.

And then more very white snow
Near Mohican State Park
With orange light splashing sundown
Over everything from just above
The right treeline I am traveling south
I shall read Carlos Castaneda
And wear a bong in my hair
I will approach the days
Of the old mothers
Who stand in the unassailable girdles
On such incomparable marbles
At fairs in rain
At fairs in sun

“The gateway to the Buddha’s
Teaching is sadness, sorrow, and grief.
He does not encourage these emotions:
He encourages awareness of these emotions….
The awareness of suffering & sorrow
Is the 1st noble step.”

“The capacity to face pain has been

A virtue in every single culture –
Except for modern America." -- Paul R. Fleischman, MD

 Henry Miller used to write on Telegraph's (am I right about the company?) time. The Harry Potter lady used to do the same. Is it economics, or is it the fear of that complete commitment? Risky, but it might make us better writers.

The mother of one of the martyrs killed in the operation on the Israeli
military post said that her son took part in this after seeing Israel's
daily massacres against Palestinians. "Each young man watches what is
going on and what is happening to his people. So when you can offer
your people something that could raise their morale and preserve their
dignity it's illogical that you don't act."

Sharon,

This might be a good thing for you, or are you going
to continue at New College?

I'm being offered enough work here and I really don't
want to leave my kids for a year. Especially Robin,
but especially all of them.

How is it now? You must be done with the school year.
How did it go?
I'm teaching at City University this summer, and
possibly in the fall, then Seattle U in the spring. I
thought I was going to "retire" but I guess not yet.

love, Jud

I come from orchard country, and worked in orchards from age about 12,
and I can tell you that I have since worked in a lot worse jobs.

Tsk-tsk and all that stuff.  However, I am grateful to this day that
AT&T ran such a slack operation that I had the chance to learn some
elements of a craft I shall never really "get."

Wasn't J. K. Rowling on the dole before she hit it big with the Potter
books?  So I've heard, anyway.

Friend on the W. Coast said if I'm going to read any of the Potter
books, get the British editions because the American ones have been
gutted.  Apparently the publishers think American kids and teens are
morons lacking attention spans or the ability to concentrate on an idea.

I've read them so I could have book talks about them with my niece who adores rowling. when i looked in to that whole british vs. american version stuff, deciding which versions to read and what not, it seemed a bit melodramatic to say that one is better than the other. I certainly wouldn't say that they were gutted. based on my unscientific comparison, the changes were mostly cosmetic and primarily had to do with UK English vs. US English and one or two cultural touchpoints. just standard "holiday" changed to "vacation" and "notes" changed to "bills" kind of stuuf.

Give me a break. Does a mother whose child has died really say that? What is

condition, says Antin, is have we gotten the right mixmaster?^4^
Sometimes I need Ambien.  Hello it is 5:19 P.M.  You want to say
=93facile=94 or worse but you might want to sleep on your horror and
fascination.  I am old enough now to make friends.

*Centrifugal/Centripetal
Blogging flees a paradigmatic form of multiauthorship.  Rolls and rings
are alibis and parasitical critical potential is foreclosed by the
epithet =93troll=94 as blurbs preempt but really prompt disinterest.
Adjust to the taste of your own centering meds.  Will the potential of
the Poetics Listserv=96-something like a kommunalka=96-have been exhausted
going through overdetermined motions?  Does Watten accidentally confuse
centrifugal and centripetal on the bottom of p.87?  How should we read
the book=92s sole typo: the elision of a lower-case =93I=94 in
=93defamiliarzing=94 (124)?  WordPerfect will not allow me to type a
lower-case I.  Reading slips in concert.  Watten prefers a screensaver
called =93Psychomotor.=94  I would buy all your wares save for not having
made a living wage but one year in the last ten and this at a Research
I institution where contracts for basketball coaches include new cars
and trustees heedless of the city approve a new parking garage.  In
stOOpidgErL=92s photographs, social reality put into production creates
psychotropic effects.  Understandable confusion and =93delusional modes
of organizing reality=94 (307), agents of the letter coming and going at
once on everybody=92s Mobius strip.

*Entailments of the Free Radical
Watten proposes the free radical as an analogy (analogies good,
homologies bad [153-157], as college Buffy recovering from
devolutionary binge drinking might say) for the vanguard, but the
analogy is constrained by the stabilizing effect of Webster=92s (an
effect conspicuously challenged by Ch. 1).  The domain of conventional
knowledge evoked by free radicals, however, is considerably larger and
no arbitrary constraint can prevent its activation.  I set aside the
question of the accuracy of such conventional wisdom, since that domain
is neither univocal nor stable (as witness the recent overturning of a
century of conventional wisdom regarding lactic acid which, it turns
out, has its roots in a faulty experiment on severed frog legs); true
or not, contested or not, the knowledge will be triggered for some
readers.  Who desires and why an image of the vanguard as the driving
force of aging, as an aggressive agent of cellular degeneration, as
well-nigh pathological?  Is =93intensely interacting=94 a euphemism (134)? =

Who discerns the inexistence of an antioxidant multiauthorfunction?

*Above All Do Not Mistake Me
Language practices are not to be confused with or reduced, by the
mechanism of cliche, to =93open works.=94  Do not encourage the already
=93widespread folk theory of nonnarrative writing [first typed =93wiring=94=
]=94
(203).  This could save us all many empty hours over years of
conferences.  Ditto =93writerly ascesis=94 (179).  It was evident to me a
decade ago that the situation was superstatic.  The monologism of the
single-author utterance seems to me consistently overstated.  Have you
ever been bored in Louisville?  The only citation of Juliana Spahr is
of her contribution to a Poetics Listserv discussion about Hejinian=92s
=93deen.=94  I wonder if people taalk about me seecretly.  Note the shift
from first- to third-person and back out again in his discussion of
=93Non-Events=94 (86).  As is well known, an author-function=92s descriptio=
n
of another author-function=92s style re-entered proves illuminating.
Watten is not to the nervousness of some afflicted with the MeMe of
critical nervousness.  Many have worked through the fantasy of Second
World internal exile.  Distal sites sustain =93_the_ point of production=94=

(106, emphasis added).  Salient images include combine harvesters,
sugar beets littering highways like dead rats, me and Ralston putting
Meyerhold to work.  Is self-exercitation=96-the index to =93Watten,
Barrett=94 runs a baker=92s dozen lines=96-in the service of a cultural
poetics (whatever happened to Tartu?) a prerequisite or a prerogative?
What prevents, after the parallel cataclysms, nonmetropolitan
vanguards?  One imagines translating selected paragraphs into BASIC; or
an analysis of the punctual, accretive, nodal, and circular
organization of nonconcepts in Watten=92s serial nonnarratives; or his
violent shifts =93between philosophical discourse, popular culture,
historical reference, and idiosyncratic formulation=94 (240), but that
way lies bad infinity.  I know from =93a minute outside the Symbolic
Order=94 (273).

*He would show you his map (Lakoff v. Lacan)
The cognitive mapping of the commute from Bloomfield Hills to Wayne
State is absolutely brilliant full disclosure.  =93high-end processing=94
(14).  He could I have heard recently and bent ears in turn be walking
to work but it was not believe you up to me in fact all that
micropoliticking heightens my burning disinterest.  =93increased load=94
(24).  By all means it is time for a Real conversation about the cult
of the automobile.  =93source text/target form=94 (30-32).  If the abstract=

is accepted, I will talk about Olson=92s station wagon; if not, I will
talk about it anyway (=93No layoff / from this / condensery=94!).
=93unconscious processes work, at a linguistic level, to destabilize and
reconfigure positionality=94 (71).  Did you laugh at the Monty Python
endnote?  =93impossible to undertake such a mapping apart from the
cognitive processing=94 (132).  I value the singular texture of the
unrepeatable reading experience but as is well known structure will
tell.  =93real-time cognitive processes that cannot possibly match with
possibilities of interpretation except in overdetermined associations
of fantasy=94 (138).  There is a second typo: a reversed apostrophe in
Heidegger=92s possession (249).  =93they demand cognition=94 (166).  The
passage through phenomenology is necessary, cannot be performed by one
generation for the next, must be repeated, and cannot be abbreviated.
Must the West go through the process of choosing between a cognitivist
and a psychoanalytic unconscious?  Does One comprehend the Other?
Poetry, as Juliana Spahr notes, changes brains.^5^  From what kernel
the fantasy of a middle way?  Please describe in as direct a manner as
possible the ethical entailments of a Lacanian pedagogy practiced
widely by a corporation of masters and disciples.

I couldn't exercise my commitment to writing if I didn't have a place to
write and eat. This cost money that I have never in my life been able to
earn from writing. Taking a job was a matter of necessity, not a lack of
commitment to a life decision I made at age 15.

Most of us don't have the means to survive without some kind of job, no
matter how much time we want to spend writing. Has anyone tried to get
their car engine rebuilt with two complimentary copies of the magazine in
which their latest poem has been published? In 45 years of writing, some of
it free-lancing for newspapers, I don't think I've earned enough to cover my
rent, food and other basic survival expenses for longer than one month in
any year of my  life.

Like Henry Miller, like many others on the  List, I've had to work a job I
hated. I found ways to do the job quickly and efficiently so that I could
have the time to write on  what I referred to as "my unofficial government
grant." I still think the employer got more money out of me--in work and
"cultural contributions"---than they got from most of their other employees.

The only people I know who had a "total commitment" to writing, had trust
funds, rich daddies or a partner who would support them. I wouldn't have
objected to any of these, but they weren't available to me.

Now I have an early pension and no job to create an inaccurate perception of
my commitment to writing.

Beautiful screengrabs propagate conflagrations,
where glass is the slowest liquid we know.
Late June sweat sweetens us, timorous among
these dark caul afternoons, turning us cold,

hinting that there's something to us.
Maybe the sun won't rise tomorrow;
maybe our books wil lavish into dust.
The vindictive fence propriety on West

Twenty-fourth street; their eyes are as
muddy as The Black River, slipping into lakes.
I caught television from buying anchors there,
and now I sign my name as a ratio

The point I was trying to make is that both Miller and the Potter author were willling to get fired---and both did, in fact--in order to pursue their writing. Which sets then apart.  Neither was thinking about a place to live, or clothes, or even food. THEY WROTE, period. And that risk, I think, made them writers.

both these writers are novelist - and there is differences - when you write poetry and breathe poetry and can't string a novel together then you need a day job (my book is great and has been review 5 times in the year after it was published - i don't think any of that shit generated one sale) but i would recommend stealing time and supplies and xeroxing (my zine is print in my office) from the job - it's only fair - your bosses would do the same to you and most likely do worst

  it's the poets job to steal words lines and time and whatever you can get away with

"cultural contributions"---than they got from most of their other employees.

The only people I know who had a "total commitment" to writing, had trust
funds, rich daddies or a partner who would support them. I wouldn't have
objected to any of these, but they weren't available to me.

Now I have an early pension and no job to create an inaccurate perception of
my commitment to writing.

Tsk-tsk and all that stuff. However, I am grateful to this day that
AT&T ran such a slack operation that I had the chance to learn some
elements of a craft I shall never really "get."

Wasn't J. K. Rowling on the dole before she hit it big with the Potter
books? So I've heard, anyway.

Friend on the W. Coast said if I'm going to read any of the Potter
books, get the British editions because the American ones have been
gutted. Apparently the publishers think American kids and teens are
morons lacking attention spans or the ability to concentrate on an idea.

It's funny, y'know, that poet/novelist distinction and I know exactly what you mean. I write poetry. I've also written novel length fiction although it has yet to see the light of day. what i find impossible to write are short stories.

as for finding places to write at work i have to say that I think USB thumb drives are the best thing that has ever happened to writers.

  UBUWEB :: Summer 2006
----------------------------

--- RECENT FEATURES ---

The Films of Jack Goldstein (MP4) Ten rarely seen short films made between 1974 and 1978:
"Portrait of Pere Tanguy" (1974), Shane, Butterflies, The Knife, Ballet Shoe, White Dove,
The Chair, MGM (all 1975), Bone China (1976) and The Jump (1978). The long-term
significance of Jack Goldstein's artistic achievement is only now becoming evident. In
his life and work, Jack, who committed suicide in San Bernardino in March 2003 at the age
of fifty-seven, articulated the profound anxiety dominating an era of spectacle, as the
open-ended Conceptual practices that characterized the '70s gave way to an
appropriation-based return to narrative imagemaking. His films, 45 rpm records,
paintings, text pieces, and performances formed a hinge between the end of one decade and
the beginning of another, articulating elements of both while refusing to be contained by
either. You can listen to Goldstein's recordings here.


György Ligeti: Poème Symphonique for 100 metronomes (AVI): Video from an ARTE (France)
broadcast of Poème Symphonique for 100 metronomes. Since its world premiere in the
Netherlands in 1963, Poème symphonique for 100 metronomes has been very rarely performed
in public. The complicated scenographic staging, the detailed preparation by hand, the
need for around ten technicians to activate more or less simultaneously the 100
metronomes, makes the demand for performances limited. Also, György Ligeti: Portrait, A
Documentary by Michel Follin (1993). The Hungarian composer György Ligeti's biography
typifies the displaced cosmopolitan, truly at home only in the international community of
music. Appropriately enough, this revealing film portrait of his life and music has a
train journey as its central metaphor, with Ligeti gazing through the window onto the
changing middle-European landscape. His music - innovative, complex, brilliantly eclectic
- accompanies his reflections and memories. (French, no subtitles).


GreyLodge: UbuWeb's New Partner UbuWeb is pleased to announce our new alliance with the

(1966). You can also listen to audio by Burroughs and read his Electronic Revolution

LPs (MP3) from 1971 as well as two interviews by Hermann Nitsch (MP3), one from 1975 and
the other from 1999.


FluxFilms (1962 - 1970): UbuWeb is pleased to announce the return of FluxFilms. Dating
from the sixties and compiled by George Maciunas (1931-1978, founder of Fluxus), this is
a document consisting of 37 short films ranging from 10 seconds to 10 minutes in length.
These films (some of which were meant to be screened as continuous loops) were shown as
part of the events and happenings of the New York avant-garde. Made by the artists listed
above, they celebrate the ephemeral humor of the Fluxus movement.Films by Nam June Paik,
Dick Higgins, George Maciunas, Chieko Shiomi, John Cavanaugh, James Riddle, Yoko Ono,

others.


Steve Roden "Soundwalk" (2005) [MP3]: Recordings documenting a live five-hour performance
by Los Angeles-based artist Steve Roden aka In Be Tween Noise. Roden writes, "On the
evening of the event, the audience entered the space to find few old rugs covering the
dance floor, and a couple of small lamps with low watt bulbs. From my windowless little
cardboard shelter hidden in a corner, i had no idea what was going on in the space; and
most of the visitors assumed they were listening to a pre-recorded installation... the
piece was playing through speakers located roughly 10 feet above the audience and
reflecting off a dome ceiling back down to the listeners below."

Henri Chopin Videos: UbuWeb is pleased to present four films of sound poet Henri Chopin

power (and the way it is inscribed in the core of the language).

I have written full-time (both poet and novelist) for the past ten years or
so. I had the amazing good sense to get married to a full-time playwright
and we have three children. Alas, no rich daddies or trust funds either. We
can't go on the dole because our income is too intermittent and we're not
exactly unemployed. How do we live? I don't know. We manage, just. Our
children forgive us. Life is good.

All best

After two earlier escapades into (and back out of) Blogland, I am
returning for another go-around (ambuscade).

The new one is found at

http://isola-di-rifiuti.blogspot.com/

It is called Isola di Rifiuti.

Its propensity is toward "Notes, Poetics, Trouvailles, Photographs,
Malarkey, & Guff," or so it claims.

No hit-counters, no trackbackers, no hegemony-building.

Lately, I'm reading Peter Weiss's terrific _Aesthetics of Resistance_.

My terrific spouse and I are reading Popper, _Realism and the Aim of
Science_ -- though since he has the full-time job and i'm on the dole via
his job i may finish the book beforehand -- it's almost like being paid to
read!

I'd forgotten about floods up there. In 1936 the city was underwater:
pictures were displayed somewhere...Roberson Museum?  In '72 my wife and
I had to vacate our cozy cottage in Vestal (Landon Road) because the
meandering little "crick" out back overnight had climbed 50 feet from
its banks and was pouring into our basement.  The cops and firefolk
ordered us to abandon the joint.

Ammiel Alcalay on Epigramititis: 118 Living American Poets by Kent =
Johnson

At the height of the war in Vietnam, Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov
articulated the best of radically different political practices. While
Levertov worked in public opposition, Duncan went "underground,"
striking at the heart of complicity: "We want peace because we are
agonized to realize how much we are involved with and subject to the
will of murderous and conceited men; but the Vietnamese who are fighting
for the truth do not want peace at the sacrifice of their vision of the
good--we, not they, are the ones who need immediate surrender of the war
for the good of our human souls." These many years later, when the
terms of debate and the scale of protest have been entirely predictable,
where it is almost impossible not to be affiliated with the corporate
body of the nation and complicity pervades every core of our being, poet
and translator Kent Johnson has taken up arms in a seemingly marginal
segment of society, that of the "post-avant" poetry scene.

In Epigramititis: 118 Living American Poets, Johnson makes us
understand that the 118 mostly not very well known poets and their
readers whom he satirizes and praises may not be so marginal after all.
In fact, at the receiving end of Johnson's considerable conceptual
acumen and wit, they may very well be representative. The point is that
the consensus of public discourse upon which political power
consolidates itself has to start somewhere, and Johnson takes a scalpel
to these mechanisms in the world he knows best. This insight fuels what
can be a scary book, making readers squirm as they recognize friends,
enemies and poets of "reputation." But precisely because Johnson
names names (each epigram bears a poet's name), we as readers are
called upon to judge our own responses to his mix of invective, humor
and admiration. As the great poet Ed Dorn wrote on an early batch of
these epigrams: "It's about time for something of the sort, what
with the ass licking that rules the day." So far this time bomb has
been tossed around gingerly, but one hopes it explodes in true debate.

Congrats on the great review for one of your books, Geoffrey. I was plannin=
g on ordering that one after my next paycheck, and now i'm even more intrig=
ued. Of course, the used bookstore down the street has a copy of Ted Berrig=
an's "Clear the Range" for sale, and that may win out for my poetry dollar =
this pay period.

SUNY Binghamton is fairly high on a hill; the campus is okay. I was
there this morning though driving there I saw people less than a mile
from my house (in Johnson City) wading to their own homes in waist-deep
water. Many towns in the area have been evacuated. Helicopters are
flying over--state of emergency and coast guard activity. My significant
other lives by the river in Conklin (6 miles from the south side of
Binghamton), had to evacuate, and will go assess damage tomorrow as it
is impossible to get there right now. This breaks the 1948 record, as
you can see here.

This just in from "Absolute Resolutions Corp": a balance due of $48.54,
passed on to ARC by CIRCA POETRY, another debt management concern.  I owe them for
a hardcover copy of TOUCH OF TOMORROW, published by The International Library
of Poets, that featured my poem, "Florence's Weekend" on the first page.  I
signed off permission for another poem "It's the end of a cycle" without
requesting a copy of that volume, THE BEST POEMS AND POETS OF 2005.

I decided to try vanity press with my first ever published poems due to the
fact that I was avoiding giving the appearance of competing with MFA and PhD
poets I had gone to graduate school with in Houston.  They had known me as a
short story writer and somewhat hasty essayist (most of the writers there wrote
VERY slowly).

With the help of a friend, I had paid off a pile of my bills one year: it
equalled six years worth of hefty interest, medical costs, clothes from Target,
toiletries, other incidentals, etc.  The cards charged off ("R9") on the
indeterminate day before my friend and I paid the tab.  That means in credit
terminology, the banks (6 of them) took a tax write off because my payments were
seven months late, then on the following day the banks received their payment in
full, including nasty "legal fees" not needed to collect from me.  My credit
rating is still too low due to the R9s even to rent an apartment, though I owed
nothing.  This is a far cry from where my credit was ten years after I started
as a worker; still, there's little I can do except write letters to the
bureaus.  I'm proud that I have wrecked my credit further due to a poem.

The job I had from Feb. to June of this year I gave to the next person,
without being fired, for my near-catatonic inability to get out of the car and go
into the stores where I was scheduled to start gathering retail data.  My boss
and supervisor were nice beyond compare when I told them I was suffering a
fear of leaving my car.  Agoraphobia -- fear of the marketplace -- fear of open
spaces.  I was earning much needed extra income from that job.  The boss was so
nice, in fact, he invited me to call back in August when I might feel a
little better.  What caused my near inability to leave my car?  It isn't poetry,
but it might be writing-related.

Google Adsense disabled my account due to my invalid clicks but left these
blank patches on my blog where the ads for how to blog used to be.  I wrote to
THEM, too, and told them that many of my readers are sophisticated bloggers
themselves, more sophisticated than I, who will not click on ads for how to blog.
 I learned that Google was getting paid at least $1 for each of those, yet I
was getting paid closer to a penny a day.  I see that my friend, Robin
Reagler, advertises wonderful poetry books at her blog, Big Window.  That's for the
best.

For those of you not at the last Third Thursday Open Mic at the Lark
St. Bookshop to hear the announcement of our new location, I'm pleased
to announce that the series is alive & well & will continue at the
Social Justice Center, 33 Central Ave. (just up the block from the
former QE2).  Our next event is July 20 with the Ulster County/Brooklyn
poet Donald Lev as the featured poet.  Still with the sign-up at 7:00,
open mic starts at 7:30.

The Social Justice Center has been a center for progressive activism in
Albany since 1981 & once was the site of Readings Against the End of
the World.  Many Albany poets are active in our community in issues
involving the environment, housing, poverty, peace & racism, so I am
pleased to be able to continue the Third Thursday open mic at a place
where much of this important work is being done.

Please join us on July 20 & every Third Thursday at the Social Justice
Center.

Peace,
DWx

Subject:      SubText/Seattle - Ed Roberson & April DeNonno
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with readings
by Ed
Roberson & April DeNonno at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, July 5, 2006.
Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of the
performance. The reading starts at 7:30pm.

Ed Roberson, teacher and former aquarium worker in Pittsburgh, has a new
book,
City Eclogue, from Atelos Press. Earlier books include Lucid Interval as
Integral Music; Atmosphere Conditions (Sun & Moon); Voices Cast Out to Talk
Us
In (winner of the 1995 Iowa Poetry Prize); and Just In/Word of Navigational
Challenges: New and Selected Poems (Talisman Books). Roberson lives in New
Brunswick, New Jersey.

Review of City Eclogue (Atelos, 2006) from Publishers Weekly:

"Alternately detailed and abstract, calmly attentive and angry about bad
news,
this set of short lyrics from Roberson (Atmospheric Conditions) describes
urban
verticality ('buildings/ modulate the blocks// upwards/ the city a sky of
floors') and zeroes in on the New York metropolitan area in particular. His
depictions include the detritus of so-called urban renewal, 'From the
project
slabs leveled/ to the poor pride-kept and neat/ stands of/ old houses mowed
down.' They include, too, the sounds of black America, from 'the street-talk
birdcall of sucked teeth' to the disorienting jazz of Thelonious Monk. Lines
like 'Adventure somehow decides to bypass all the already,' announces a
modernist aesthetic which finds the basis for poetry anywhere. But however
abstract he gets, Roberson never loses his sense of a personal voice, of a
man
talking (to himself or others) about the space in which we might try to
live."

April DeNonno teaches contemporary literature, film, and cultural studies at
Cornish College. Recent poems have appeared in the literary magazines Monkey
Puzzle, Facture, and Fine Madness.

The future Subtext 2006 schedule is:

August 2, 2006: Stephen Paul Martin (San Diego) & John Olson

September 6, 2006: Torbin Ulrich/Lori Goldston Band & Bill Horist/Steve
Potter

October 4, 2006: Mary Burger (Bay Area) & Meg McHutchison

November 1, 2006: Meredith Quartermain & Peter Quartermain (both Vancouver,
BC)

December 6, 2006: Lidia Yuknavitch (Portland) & TBA

This is a really interesting idea. There are lots of textual possibilities =
in comics. The first thing that springs to my mind is the text/lettering ef=
fects Dave Sim was using in Cerebus really starting with the Church & State=
 story arcs.

Garden Party
with Olive Juice Music
and Boog City

Sat. July 8, 2:00 p.m., free

a summer series, in the
Suffolk Street Community Garden
Suffolk St., bet. Houston & Stanton sts.
NYC

readings from=20
Joanna Fuhrman and Tanya Larkin

music from=20
Lisa Lilund and Major Matt Mason USA

Curated and with introductions by
Boog City editor and publisher David Kirschenbaum and
Olive Juice Music head Matt Roth

---------

**Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 15th year and
East Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, KY. It  hosts and curates two regular
performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea's ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where 5-13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, CBGB's, and The Knitting Factory. Past
albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana, Nevermind; an=
d
Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.

**Olive Juice Music is a D.I.Y. label, studio, and mail-order distributor
based in New York City and interested in helping people who are in the
developmental stages of trying to do something with their art. Olive Juice
Music is not a traditional record label. The artists associated with Olive
Juice take an active part in how their music is produced, financed, and
marketed. They in turn receive more of the profits gained from the sales of
their records directly, which is how it should be. The strength of Olive
Juice relies upon the active participation of its members to share resource=
s
and help promote a communal spirit among everyone involved as well as
claiming responsibility for taking their art to wherever they would like it
to go.

**Joanna Fuhrman is the author of three collections of poetry published by
Hanging Loose Press, Freud in Brooklyn (2000), Ugh Ugh Ocean (2003), and
Moraine (2006). Her last book was described in Publishers Weekly as an
"exciting mishmash of insights, associations, charms, jokes and biting
social commentary, well positioned somewhere in the nifty triangle formed b=
y
Frank O'Hara, Ted Berrigan and the Shins." Her poems written with others ar=
e
forthcoming in Saints of Hysteria: Fifty Years of Collaborative Poetry (Sof=
t
Skull Press). She teaches poetry in the public schools.

**Tanya Larkin is poet and fiction writer living in Somerville, Mass. She
teaches English at the New England Institute of Art. She is a 2004 recipien=
t
of a Massachusetts Cultural Council Grant. Her most recent poems have
appeared in The Hat, Xantippe, and The Zoland Press Poetry Anthology.

**Lisa Li-Lund hails from Paris, France and writes songs on piano and
guitar. Her record "Lisa Li-Lund Ran away" was just released on Smoking Gun
Records (UK).=20

**Major Matt Mason USA has been making music since the late =B980s. In his
father's basement in Shawnee, Kansas (a suburb of Kansas City) Matt would
amuse his dog Friskie by lip-synching to Kiss records and hammering out
ditties about the threat of nuclear war and peer pressure on a $30 Harmony
guitar. While attending the University of Kansas, Matt got his first taste
of a thriving underground music scene playing guitar for local punk bands
with names like Magic Nose and Dracomagnet that drew from influences
including the Butthole Surfers and Jesus Lizard.

In the early =B990s, Matt localized a five-year long distance relationship an=
d
moved to New York City where he found a home in the now infamous East
Village Antifolk Community. The weekly Antihoots at the Sidewalk Cafe
provided Matt with a chance to vent about the high cost of living in New
York and the rapid deterioration of the relationship he just moved across
the country for. After a brief stint as a record store clerk, he landed a
job as an apprentice at a soho based commercial sound facility. For the nex=
t
five years he would spend his days in a state-of-the-art digital audio
facility servicing high profile advertising clients, while his nights were
spent plucking out edgy lo-fi acoustic love songs into a boombox in a mouse=
-
infested lower east side apartment.

Flash forward 5 years. Major Matt has evolved from the boombox to a catalog
of 4 full-length albums filled with influences that range from Bob Dylan to
Sonic Youth. He has established Olive Juice Music--a fully functional
recording studio/independent record label/online distribution center that h=
e
operates out of his NYC apartment with bandmate/significant other Nan Turne=
r
and cat Gummo (who takes care of the mice). Matt is also a member of the
bands Schwervon! and Kansas State Flower. The DIY spirit is a big part of
Matt's art and lifestyle as he continues to carve out a niche for truly
modern American Folk music.

Tim Truman's work with Grateful Dead (Robert Hunter) lyrics comes to mind.

  Of course you can't overlook William Blake, Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Patchen.  Not that I consider their work comic, but we can kick off our shoes in that room.

Best example, yet. The reprints that Fantagraphics are doing are top
notch. Wonderful stuff.

For contemporary work...

Souther Salazar does some fine things...the Fort Thunder crowd...if you
can get your hands on a huge anthology called Comix 2000, there's some
good work in there, too...

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

The 2006 Midwest School for Women Workers is being
held at the University of Illinois at Chicago on July
16-21. Online registration is now available at
http://www.conferences.uiuc.edu/midwestschool.

For almost 30 years, Union Women’s Summer Schools
across the United States have brought together women
from all sectors of the labor movement to develop
skills as activist union members and leaders, and
build sisterhood across unions and regions. In a time
when many local, regional and international unions
have fewer resources to devote to labor education and
leadership development, the week-long, residential
Women’s Summer Schools fill the gap for hundreds of
union women each summer.

Topics for this year’s school include the
international labor movement, strategic contract
campaigns, labor history and human rights, Jane in
Chicago, political accountability, women in the
trades, leadership, arbitration, and many more. For a
complete list of this year’s courses and descriptions,
please visit the conference Web site.

In addition to courses and workshops, we are also
offering several educational and entertaining
activities that participants may choose to take part
in. Chicago has a very rich and turbulent labor
history, and we would like to offer you the chance to
explore some of the city’s most famous landmarks by
foot, by bicycle, and by motor coach. Other optional
activities include a trip to the renowned House of
Blues and an architectural tour of the city aboard a
river boat. Many of these activities are free,
although some may require a small additional fee.

The registration fee is $750, which includes lodging
for five nights, all meals, breaks, and conference
materials. A commuter rate of $425 is also available.
This option includes all meals and materials, but no
lodging. Some scholarships are available through the
Regina V. Polk Foundation.

Registration for the Midwest School is limited, so
please register today and reserve your spot!

TCR (The Capilano Review) has extended its deadline for submissions for a
special issue on digital writing and poetics. The issue already contains
excellent works in criticism, but is still looking for more creative
submissions and review work.

The issue is meant to compliment a new cohort programme on technology and
language currently being designed and constructed for first and second year
postsecondary study, but also should serve as an introduction to writers,
poets and artists working specifically with digital technology as both a
tool and formative "paradigm" for their art. The issue will feature a mix of
critical essays, creative works, both visual and language based, and
reviews. The issue will be published in electronic format as well as print,
making it possible to receive and publish screen compositions.

If the pieces are too large or complicated for email attachment, please
snail mail a disk copy to:
