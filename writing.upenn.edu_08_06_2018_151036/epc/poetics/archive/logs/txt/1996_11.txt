Yes, & the "liberal" president signs Nafta, dumps healthcare, cuts welfare,
etc. etc. etc. Of course when you point out that the media might have
something to do with such idiocy people say oh no no can't be that, harr,
hmmmgghh. There's a documentary I would recommend called Manufacturing
Consent.

>Has there been social democratic politics in the U.S.?

Yup, lots. Not much in power, some FDR policies. Them Wobblies and such that
got the Wagner Act (legalization of unions) through is what I'm refering to.
Don't remember the source of this information but apparently May Day began as
a European Worker's Holiday to show solidarity with American workers.
Europeans were horrified by the extent of violence labor had to endure in
this country. They acheived legal unionization long before it happened here.
Of course here MayDay is known only as a Stalinist "celebration."

Also re something AL said:
>the giving away of huge
tax subsidies to people who get rich from sports arenas

What about public subsidy of defense. That's REALLY where you're money's
going. It's public money for private profit.

Also re Jeff & Henry's point about legislation. Despite my cynicism, I think
there should be more engagement-- after all there is some hope, even a bit of
evidence, that people CAN effect the government-- not the boardroom.

I don't argue that the medium of television is inherently evil. clearly it
_could_ be a good thing. love them Simpsons. But what is there reflects very
largely the interests of those who own it, period. I.e. not you or me or MOST
OF US. Whether the net will/can be something counter that corporate _force_
remains to be seen. There's an interesting new group -- The Cultural
Environment Movement, doing good work around this. Again, just getting

Yr right. Not only did they achieve legal unionization before they did in
the US, but they also (especially in Britain) very early worked in the
parliamentary area, getting seats in the government. The US is the only big
manufacturing country I know of that does not have some sort of labour
party. But I have heard USAmericans in some contexts refer to the Democrats
as "the left." and I have heard of people like Ted Kennedy called "the
left." In most countries Ted kennedy would be considered a cautious
centrist. I suppose that the US Democratic Party would be considered left
of the US Republican Party, but in most modern countries, the Democrats
would be just a little right of center. The US has no large left-of-center
political body, not one that can win seats. I think that such a situation
can only lead to disaster.

I hear the term "medicare" used by USAmericans somnetimes; I think I heard
that you have to be old to get it. How can a people that desire democracy
put up with such a situation?

LEISURE & ARTS: Books, Booker, Bookies
          Paul Levy
                 Copyright 1996 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
CITATION         The Wall Street Journal, October 30, 1996
DATELINE         London
TEXT             Something is seriously wrong with the Booker prize.
Somebody always profits from the world's premier literary prize, but
until he got the news of his $32,000 award last night, it wasn't Graham
Swift or any of the other five shortlisted British Commonwealth writers
of fiction.

                 According to the British national newspaper, the
Times, in the week of Oct. 12, the third week after the announcement of
the shortlist, the Canadian author Margaret Atwood's contender, "Alias
Grace" (Bloomsbury, #16.99; Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $24.95), a
historical novel about a real-life double murder, sold a
disappointing 485 copies in Britain, putting the book at No.  53 in
the top 5,000 books of any description sold that week.  And she was
top.

Beryl Bainbridge, one of only two English writers on the
Booker list, sold only 161 British copies of "Every Man for Himself"
(Duckworth, #14.99; Carroll & Graf, $21), her tale of the sinking of
the Titanic. Ms. Bainbridge stood at 426 in the overall sales list,
whereas Seamus Deane, the Northern Irish-born poet who teaches at the
University of Notre Dame and whose first novel is "Reading in the
Dark" (Cape, #13.99), sold only 75 and stood at 1,655.  Set in the
1940s and 1950s in Derry, and dealing with a child's discoveries of
grown-up betrayal, this is yet another historical novel.

                 I suppose all six books could be said to be historical
in this limited sense, for Rohinton Mistry's richly generous "A Fine
Balance" (Faber, #15.99; Knopf, $26), which struck me as the only
book listed that really deserved a prize, is set in India during
Mrs. Gandhi's "State of Internal Emergency" in the 1970s.  This
novel, with its cast of fiercely independent widow, students,
tailors and Dickens-worthy Beggarmaster, and its confidently handled
complicated narrative, sold 66 copies in Britain, which put it at
1,981.

Scottish Shena Mackay's "The Orchard on Fire" (Heinemann,
#12.99; Moyer Bell, $19.95), a delicate story of a little girl
during Coronation Year, now seems set in a distant past.
It is a gentle but stirring book that explores the nuances of
class in an English village.  Though artful in its construction, it
sold only 20 copies the week in question, too few to make the top
5,000 list.

This was also true of the winner, the only other book
on the shortlist by an English writer: Mr. Swift's "Last Orders"
Picador, #15.99; Knopf, $23) sold three copies in Britain.  Though
set more or less in the present, the virtuoso flashbacks, shifting
narrative technique and south London dialect give this tale of a
day's outing in which four men carry out the last wishes and dispose
of the ashes of their friend, a London butcher, so firm a sense of
time and place that I think you could argue that it is also a
historical novel.

                 As the authors and their publishers do not appear to
be making a mint from this year's Booker nominations, who is profiting?
The answer is: the bookies.  By this Monday William Hill alone had
already taken over $80,000.  By contrast with the book-buying
public, the money was, rightly so, on Mr. Swift, whose odds were
even money, with big bets on Margaret Atwood pushing her up to
second favorite late Monday afternoon.  Mr. Swift had been
Ladbroke's favorite since the day of the announcement of the short
list a month ago.

                 The opening odds, by the way, are set by real bookies.
Graham Sharpe, who produces the odds for William Hill, told the
Observer's racing correspondent on Sunday that he reads the first few
pages of each book, then a chunk from the middle and another from the
end to establish the opening prices, "and amends them when he has read
all of the runners from cover to cover."

              In past years you could have been forgiven for thinking
that was how the judges themselves chose the actual winner.  Just to
remind you of the Booker's ignominious immediate past, the 1993
prize went to Roddy Doyle's meretricious domestic weepy "Paddy
Clarke Ha Ha Ha," in the year in which Vikram Seth's majestic "A
Suitable Boy" wasn't even shortlisted.  In 1994 the judges scored
another own-goal and gave the laurels to James Kelman's wholly
unreadable mixture of Glasgow dialect and foul obscenity, "How Late
It Was, How Late," while in 1995 they overlooked Salman Rushdie's
magnificent "The Moor's Last Sigh" and gave it to the politically
correct, but anachronism-laden choice, Pat Barker's "The Ghost
Road."

                 This year the shortlist was relatively
uncontroversial: There were no positively bad books on the list and,
except for novels by A.S. Byatt, David Malouf, Michael Dibdin, Ben
Elton and Margaret Drabble (who, in any case, published hers a little
after the deadline and grandly refuses to let her publishers enter her
work anyway), no obvious omissions.  This is a tribute to the judges,
especially to the tough and colorful chairman, Carmen Callil.

                 Ms. Callil, one of the most flamboyant figures in the
history of British publishing, is an Australian who came here in the
1960s, founded the feminist publishing house, Virago, ran the old firm
of Chatto & Windus for a time, and recently left the publishing
industry with many mutual expressions of ill-will.  She is a great
and powerful woman, and all Britain waits to see what she will do
next in her starry career.

               The gross errors of past years have probably resulted
from internecine conflict among the judges.  Last year's chairman,
retiring Conservative M.P. George Walden, kept his panel happy, but
could not prevent their outvoting him and giving the nod to Ms.
Barker.  There have been no reports of dissension from Ms Callil's
fellow judges -- novelists Jonathan Coe, A.L. Kennedy and A.N.
Wilson (also literary editor of the London Evening Standard), and
Ian Jack, editor of Granta -- and nobody misbehaved at last night's
awards dinner at London's Guildhall.

                 Still, the method used by the bookies seems as
satisfactory as that used by the judges in most years.  So here is a
modest proposal.  Why not save thousands of man-hours of reading done
by the judges in order to weed the 150 hopefuls submitted by the
publishers, and let the bookies actually choose next year's Booker
shortlist?

Mary Hilton,

I inadvertently deleted the Poetics Digest message before responding
directly to your post for info on that political discourse project.
Send me info on that! And don't lapse into lurkerhood.

--------------------------------------

Rod,

The _only_ 3rd party that, as of today, has any hope of stabilizing as
anything more than a drain on the other candidates (and even that is a
few elections down the road), is Perot's Reform Party. Which, as I
think I made clear, I see as a variant of fascism with Mickey Mouse
ears. But if it qualifies for Federal Matching Funds, I would expect to
see it do something serious in a post-Ross phase. I think you will find
the Bill Bradleys and Paul Tsongas types out competing with the retired
generals living next to golf courses in the year 2000 or 2004. There
is, however, a good chance that Ross will drive it out of existence by
running a third time.

What Nader has done with the Green Party endorsement has been entirely
irresponsible -- he's basically trashed them and then done nothing with
the opportunity they afforded him to do something real. They of course
got what they deserve in giving their nomination to somebody who has no
interest in their agenda. This may be no dumber than the Peace &
Freedom party giving its nomination in 1968 to Eldridge Cleaver (my
first presidential vote!), but it's no smarter either.

------------------------------

Maria, Aldon et al,

Your very to-the-point responses to my question about sending work to
unseen journals reminds me that the two basic methods of getting
published remain submission & solicitation, two terms that also carry
subtexts of sexuality and power (or powerlessness).

Subject:      a real book review [long, maybe]

Here's a review of a real book(& kinda long).  Delete now or hold your piece.

Jennifer Moxley
Imagination Verses
Tender Buttons, 1996

This is a moving & accomplished real book of lyric poetry, the kind of
work that comes around very rarely.  That is, the contemporary American
poetry scene is highly energized, there is a lot of talent out there, but
rarely does a poet bring it all together in one volume as stirringly
as Moxley has.  It's extraordinary.

From the brief preface, graceful & ambitious & (consciously or not)
echoing Whitman from the first words, this book fulfills its daring
promise.  What Moxley does is begin with the careful, stripped-down
phrasing of Oppen or WCW, & an alert, informed, compassionate, ironic,
sardonic, & highly stylized X-generation(?) (sorry, older, what-ho,
chap here) consciousness.  Beginning with these resources, she pushes
them into regions of vocabulary & lyricism with roots stretching
back to John Donne & before.  The result is a sudden awareness that
the tradition of lyric poetry is alive & well & dangerous to
settled complacencies & self-absorbed attitudes on every level of
the social scale.  The tone is bitter & sweet, the distance maintained
with miraculous balance (between the strictly personal & the
social, the paradigmatic) by wit & humor.

Here is the not-so-surprising surprise.  The attitude, vision & skill
I hear most emphatically moving to support this purely American sound
is that of W.H. Auden.  There is the same brooding ironic combination
of skepticism & openness, the loping accent & sudden foreshortening
lyricism (early Auden especially), the scientific/witty use of
abstractions.  Moxley throws around abstractions & general words
not in the heavy-handed, dehumanized way of much experimental writing,
nor does she eschew them as in most moo-brow U.S. verse.  In her
work abstraction is integrated into the general modal drive & wit of
the poem, whether it's an "ode" on "particles", or an evisceration
of "centurions".  Finally, there is the sense of Auden's magisterial
command of all forms, whether social or literary.  (o.k. this is
not a review of a new Auden book, sorry...)

This book should bring joy.  It brings honor to American poetry.
(& this local is proud to know it was written over time spent
in Providence.yahooey!)  Where Moxley continues, huh, next?  Hers is
a politically motivated/integrated pose - a discouragement
with contemporary (American) dungeons - counterbalanced by
the same kind of poet's hope - the hope which makes language
a social obligation, & the poet's destiny a going forward
into crowds & shared disasters; not planted in a
private agenda of either scripto- or egomania. The poetry is
a mysterious third element brought out of the experience of
discovering it.  Just as she manages to balance new/old in her
manner, her philosophical approach is a counterweighting of
lyrical idealism & its ironies against a downbeat of earth-centered
materialism (epitomized in her image of Virgil heading back down
to Hell, in the sequence "Ten Still Petals").  (Sorry for the
heavy-handed abstractions, gongheads.)

I hope "her contemporaries" (to whom the book is forsightedly
dedicated) & the author will not be embarrassed by this praise.
We may live in the same town, but we ain't even acquaintances -
this may sound like puffery, but it's just enthusiasm.
This is...this book is...well hey, really something (as we
say, emphatically, sort of, with a happy face, & a wave, back
in Minnesota).  - Henry Gould

Subject:      politics & poetics

This is kind of a response to Dodie's posting a couple of days ago and to
the discussion in general.  I just caught up on the list for the week this
morning.

I think that the position of women vis-a-vis politics is very different from
the position of men.  And here I do mean to speak specifically about the
biological (which I actually usually avoid) and historical.  Women couldn't
vote until this century and still are very much so minority voices in the
political process, especially at the national level.  So when Jeff asks why
poetry does not have political effect, that question has a different
resonance for me.

I don't think that there can be one definition of the political, even if we
limit ourselves to talking about the political process, if only for this
reason, that women (and blacks and native americans and hispanics and gays
and blue collar workers and jazz musicians and and) are taken up into the
political process in very specific and differing ways.

And I think that what political efficacy poetry can have--if we are now
talking about the ways that poetry might be taken up in the world--has very
much to do with the poet's and the readers' positioning in the world.  I
think that Amiri Baraka's oeuvre has had political effect, although I do not
know a lot about what effect that is.  And I would say that that political
effect has had to do with his position as a black male in the later 20th
century, rather than the effect of a poetics in general.

I think we can look to other countries, eastern europe, for example, and
talk about poetry having political effect right now.

And now I'm not on ground that's very familiar for me, so I don't want to
sound dogmatic.  But anyway, I do think the specificity of the writer and
her position in the world is what makes for political effect, not the genre
of poetry in general.

And, finally, it seems that the definition of the personal as political is
often discussed in connection with gender issues.  And I'm willing to say
for my own poetry, that I think cultural effect is a kind of political
effect, when it comes to gender (in my case).  Because we have to change the
way people think in addition to changing how they vote or otherwise act in
the world, set policy, etc.  And change for women at the political level
also entails (I would go so far as to say--depends on) change on many other
cultural and social registers.  These kinds of change are completely
interdependant.  And writing is one way to change the way people think.




and. p.s.  calvin trilling's poetry is an example of political poetry that
sucks as poetry.

Yes, I've often thought of proposing a magazine named something like
_Dominance and Submission: a Journal of Literary Bitchcraft_. Copies
of that (unlike, say, _The Journal of English and Germanic
Philology_), might really fly out the door.

Ron,

Thanks for the great post. What third party movement are you more impressed
by? New Party? Nader? I've been supporting the New Party which seems a
genuine attempt to get a labor party going, not based around any one
persona-- but long long way to go.

>By jettisoning its base, the door-to-door Union volunteer
>(capital U), the Democratic party has largely opened up this space.

It seems fairly clear that the disappearance of social democratic politics
from the public sphere is strongly related to the rise of television as a
source of "information." What response do you, others, see to this."

from the outside, this is all fascinating, & of course, up here, we cant
help but be 'aware' of your election, since it will have its effects on
'us.' So, today, the CBC had a story on the 'fact' (?) that most of the
under 30 crowd in the US is getting its political 'information' from
Letterman & Leno. Hmm.

I was thinking, as I am teaching people like Creeley, Levertov, & even
Ashbery to a class here these weeks, that various approaches to the
question of 'whose language is it' which these poets practice in various
ways, is a 'political' act of sorts, even if it reaches only a small
audience to begin with. For the problem, as Silliman & others have
suggested, is that for so many, there seems to be only one discourse
available. Poetry can begin to question that assumption, at least. And we
need such questioning up here as much as down there.

All the best

i'd like to throw-in here on this question of invitation/solicitation for
publishing... i recently tried to append to a piece (recently published,
but which shall go unnamed) a one paragraph summary of the network that had
resulted in my writing and publishing the piece... i tried to do so w/o
appearing ungrateful, and i tried to do so b/c it was clearly a MALE
network that had resulted in my having written and published said item...
nothing insidious here in terms of motivations---but my point was that we
all needed to work harder to open things up some, which latter point
resonated with the gist of my piece (at least, as i saw it---but i tend to
be associative when it comes to such stuff)...

needless to say, said concluding para was chopped on the editorial end w/o
comment... and i can't quite blame the editor, b/c he had his constraints
too...

but i do wish to observe here that it's sometimes damned difficult to
render legible the networking apparatus, in order to change it... and mebbe
if i were a better man, i would have balked at publishing my piece w/o that
concluding para... or at least have made more noise about it, which i *did*
in fact do wrt several other paras...

May Day began in the 1880s in the US, with the fight for an eight-hour
work day.  Now, of course, we're one of the only countries not to
observe it (with Canada and at least the old South Africa, I think).

Some history:

"In 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions passed a
resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's
work from and after May 1, 1886. The resolution called for a general
strike to achieve the goal, since legislative methods had already
failed. With workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen
hours a day, rank-and-file support for the eight-hour movement
grew rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union
leaders. By April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May
Day movement."

My grandfather (who was a socialist before he left Russia in the 1880s),
had nothing but contempt for "Labor Day," which is a holiday without any
history at all in labor struggle.  "May Day is the only Labor Day,"
said he.

Joe, yes I'm at times "mouthing Chomsky." I have spent a fair amount of time
with his writings, tapes, etc. I find him convincing on many questions. There
is a danger though, I think, of his views becoming identified solely with his
persona. He is after all "a star" leftist intellectual-- but his positions
are actually useful in understanding the world (imagine that!) & he makes no
claims to the originality of his analyses.
Other writers I'd champion on these questions & related include Ward
Churchill, Holly Sklar,
Christopher Hitchens, Cornel West. A book called _Goodyear Invades the
Backcountry: The Corporate Takeover of a Rural Town_ by Bryan Palmer gives
one a little perspective on "downsizing" or what they're now calling
"right-sizing." Common Courage and South End seem the better publishers in
these areas these days. & Monthly Review. & New Press.

Thanks for the info on May Day Rachel!

Steve Carll 23, Carol Szamatowicz 22 at Poetry City, 10/31 7:25 p.m.
TIME: C (30 mins), S (30 mins).
ATTENDANCE: 25

San Francisco poet Steve Carll read 23 poems and Carol Szamatowicz read 22
poems at Poetry City on Halloween. Steve, in a red t-shirt, beige slacks
and white Converse sneakers, read poems from his books _Sincerity Loops_
and _trace a moment's closure for clues_, and from an unpublished
manuscript entitled _Drugs_. As has been noted on this listserv before,
Steve sweetly manipulates the lyrics of songs that he likes, elaborating
clear new syntaxes from 'When the rain comes...' or 'And the train
conductor said, take a break Driver 8'. Among the poems in the new book are
some startlingly successful erasures of Robert Bly, poems written to
movies, and poems whose formal restrictions were assigned by editors.
Solicit and submit, indeed! Steve (citing Jeff Conant as the influence)
burst into discursive prose for his last segment, _Drugs_. These brief
essays on perception and effect contained such lines as: "Alcohol can turn
any morning into a wake", "Fame never went to crack's head like some other
drugs we could mention", "LSD, better known as the fifth Beatle", "Hi!
Marijuana's not a drug but it plays one on tv." Steve closed with a poem
called "New Jack York". Good reading.

Ordinarily we have an intermission, but it was Halloween and people were
antsy, so I rushed right into Carol Szamatowicz's reading. Co-host Anna
Malmude came up to the mike to give a second introduction to Carol -- "I'd
like to introduce one of my many moms." Carol elaborated: 'My daughter is
Anna's sister.' Then Carol read twenty-two pieces from her manuscript of
prose-poems. Carol writes  Faginescas, a form named after Larry Fagin and
also practiced by Michael Friedman and Gillian McCain. Where Michael's are
Fred Astaire and Gillian's are Susan Sontag, Carol's Faginescas are Anthony
Trollope. Carol pays a lot of attention to the salient details of social
interaction, which facts I observe in the modest and informative sentences
she prefers. Anyway. Carol wore a black silk top and slacks. Here are some
things she said: "These cheeses are history", "There's only five channels
and beer. I accept that.", "There is a couple who loved eachother since
childhood and that is all that is left of them", "I think you are the one
who spilled", "Besides the suspicion of sleep there is the treachery of
wood", "I was a brisk little tooth drifting to earth", "My genius uses
itself up in the austere nudity of self-reliance", "Boredom that makes us
long for the freedom of combat", "Lick something everyday, I say", "A hell
where we feed ourselves with three-foot chopsticks." Well I take back that
part about Trollope.

In the audience were: Rick Hill, Bill Luoma, Katy Lederer, Anselm Berrigan,
Karl Parker, Larry Fagin, Douglas Rothschild, Drew Gardner and David
Golumbia.

Kevin K., this is what I meant when I used the phrase "cognitive and
emotional dissonace" re Jennifer Moxley's _Imagination Verses_. She doesn't
back away from it, at all. & the phrase "monogamy capitalism" -- a little
personalizing of the term late capitalism. Heterosexual monogamy being the
only "acceptable" choice. Of course one can choose otherwise but outside of a
few urban areas (and often within them) it is very difficult. I.e. you often
won't be supported in your choice. One is robbed, literally, of choices about
one's life, never mind it's "style." Of course this is all there in your
work, just wanted to clarify my own meanderings a bit.

Moxley's poem "The Right to Counsel" begins: "The mighty symbols/ have snuck
away/ with human memory./ Actions are now/ horrifically undressed/ lest they
should/ corner the market." The "Ode to Protest" begins "It's as if to be
real/ you and I must garner backers/ without a rib to call our own." I want
to go on quoting, I really do.

"Things" _are not_ "ok."

The position that "political" discourse is only such if actually effective
encounters some obvious absurdities, not least the effacement of this
presidential election. Certainly, you would be hard put to figure out
the "relavance" and the "effectiveness" of a Republican that gave up
months ago. Would then everything said by Dole et al on TV etc be
considered apolitical? Thanks, Eric.

Thanks Rachel for the May Day background.  I believe the first labor

this strikes me at least as a strangely good question: probably many on
the list assume that both parties speech is effectively apolitical, but
how does our assumption mediate our poetries' relation to the broader
society

This is Dodie

This Saturday, tomorrow, November 2, Small Press Traffic presents Renee
Gladman and Bob Perelman at New College (on Valencia between 18th and 19th
in San Francisco) at 7:30 p.m.

I'd include the snappy flyer copy KK and I wrote, but it's on my regular
computer which broke and got "fixed" and which I have had the nerve to
re-hook up yet.

But, trust me, this will be a great event!  Renee is one of the brightest
stars to come out of the New College Poetics Program.  Her cutting-edge
skateboarding through lyricism and narrative, I think, will work nicely
with Bob's impulses in similar directions -- though using an entirely
different palette of subject matter and influence.

The last couple of readings at SPT have blown me away--Erin Moure and Lisa
Robertson; Kathleen Fraser and Joan Retallack.  Robertson and Retallack, in
particular, dazzled us with a rollercoaster of effects.  The scope of those
two gals!  It was so interesting/stimulating talking with all of these
women I'm feeling that readings alone aren't enough--I'd like to figure out
a way to work in a discussion of process in future events.

The new/old Eliot poems are probably to be found in Christopher Ricks'
new "edition" of early Eliot-- which, in addition to making available a
number of poems that up until now have been available in hard (and
impossible) to access manuscripts, has a huge amount of hard
information and informed
speculation about source, allusion, and context literary and (and
otherwise) in the notes.

Ricks is, for better or for worse, Eliot's dream editor-- in his
sympathies as well as in his learning.

Hi Gary,

My understanding is that May Day begins with those events of May 1-4
1886 in Chicago--the strikes for the eight-hour day, the May 3 police
killings of six demonstrators at the McCormick agricultural machinery
plant, and then on May 4 the Haymarket affair.  The day goes
international on May 1, 1890, and that's a whole other (connected)
story.

Fear the state
that could eat many lives
just hanging
on the hope of
divine punishment.
Singing together
we know not who
we serenade,
if not ourselves
who are no selves
and broken
we look to bedtime,
elope with big
distance in mind.
Space is a vicious map
erected by the
trampling of destiny.
If you can only live
one life, you must die
for those
you throw away.


The book is, as Henry noted, dedicated "To my Contemporaries" -- I read this
first, as, literally & i.e., an act of love & thanks to the poets. Then what
else it means. What is amazing about this writing is the clarity with which
it claims tradition and it's minute.
The tradition it claims & speaks is avant-garde. The avant-garde since
Rimbaud, or Sappho, or Shakespeare, or Bernadette Mayer.

"Ray of your return, an apparition,/ as out on the couch I/ wept,
derivatively."

"This in-wrought geneticism/ has made your leniency all askew,/ a melee on
the installment plan, like chance encounters with minikin emotions/ unstitch
Minerva and the Earth awakes/ distracted reaching for Venus."

"Cut it out and give me that rope,/ I will gladly beat my scared Crusoe/ with
the possibility of life/ and orate at the seashore/ of luckless sinking
blind/ and God-blanched Utopias:/ But know my heart is in your hands."

The ear of intent in Oppen placed in the heart of O'Hara. Jennifer challenges
us to celebrate this _our_ work & through it a point, place, & people ("in
hope of clearing this name from mud"). This name, being Poet, in this now,
"lifelike."

If you think this extravagent you have not read the book or are not capable.
This is not to dismiss those that cannot, but to feel for them. It is the
glory not of power but of the protection of a niche-- these poems challenge
the poetic community to know _unquestioningly_ it's value & right, to exist,
& to speak. "I will say what the register calls forth, the range of the
heart/ a journey in the strap of speech. . ."

Subject:      The Lake Effect

Sorry for the long post, but then I don't post that often, so . . .

The application of modern scientific principles, especially quantum and
chaos theories, to poetics has interested me for quite awhile, so I was
anxious to read Paul Lake's AWP article. Well, I just finished it, and I
think his misapplications are profound. Lake does get some things right:
the idea of emergent phenomena developing from "bottom-up" rules, for
example, and the paradox of self-organizing systems (which, I agree, poets
and in fact all artists should be aware of--I think, however, that most
artists are almost intuitively aware of these orders). And I even agree
that "the laws governing the evolution of living and other natural forms
are the same laws that govern the creation of poetry."
        But no, he loses me almost right away, with the Boids computer
program. I have a version of Boids running as screensaver. It is an amazing
piece of software, related to the various "artificial life" programs. Using
simple iterated rules, it generates flocking behavior. But here's where I
lose the analogy that Lake's going for: these flocks aren't sonnets. There
have different shapes, different patterns every time. A-Life programs like
"Boids" are bottom-up, as Lake suggests, but formal poetry, as Lake
describes it, is clearly top-down. Look at the quotes from Richard Wilbur:
what Wilbur says, and what Lake wants him to have said are quite different.
Lake discusses the spontaneous generation of hexagonal patterns in silicon
oil as it heats; at first disorganized, it breaks into order at higher
temperatures. Wilbur, on the other hand, states "I commit myself to the
metrical precedents which my first lines set." If the oil did this, its
structure would never emerge.
        Lake's sense of a "strange attractor" is a top-down Platonic model.
Rather seeing these patterns are emergent, he sees them as already existing
as "a shadow that hulks toward the page" (Donald Hall). But the basic
model, the first model in fact, of a strange attractor is weather. In
weather we have a feedback system and basic laws. Purely deterministic,
rule-bound, yet unpredictable. The weather on any given day is some
position on an attractor, not the attractor itself, which is a mathematical
abstraction. Taken as whole, the range of possible positions (possible
weathers) forms a strange attractor. Better, I think, to conceive of a poem
as existing on a strange attractor, rather than as the strange attractor.
        Emergent phenomena cannot be "archetypical," as Lake argues they
are. Emergent phenomena arise from simple rule sets which are allowed to
feed back upon themselves. Curiously, Lake's problem with "free verse" is
that it doesn't have enough rules: "with fewer rules and less feedback . .
.it generally fails . . . " But look back at the Boids program: it has
three rules. Three. And none of them describe the final shape (as the 14
line rule and rhyme patterns are dictated in the sonnet).
        Lake's example of the Hopkins sonnet is a bit of cheating, I think.
The wonderful complexity of sound found in Hopkins is not in any way
required for this to be a sonnet. Hopkins is not following any sonnet rule
when he composes those sonically dense third and fourth lines: the internal
rhyme, for example, which Lake sees (properly, I think) as
"self-similarity" isn't required. If it were missing, this'd still be a
sonnet (though not, clearly, as interesting of a sonnet). And Lake has to
really stretch to get this into iambs.
        Two other things Lake gets wrong I think: the issue of time, and
the idea of a broken symmetry. The latter is simply a misapplied term.
"Broken Symmetry" is not "similarity with a difference" (what is
"similarity with a difference"? Difference.) Broken symmetry is a term from
physics; it refers to attempts to unify the fundamental laws of the
universe. At higher and higher energy levels, the fundamental laws can all
be described by the same formulae--this is symmetry. So far, all the laws
(electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear forces) can be unified. Gravity
is the holdout. Anyway, at high energy levels (temperatures)
electromagnetism and the nuclear forces are unified; they are symmetrical.
As the energy levels drop, the symmetry is broken, and we need separate
equations to calculate. To apply this to poetry, Lake would need a theory
of energy-levels in poetic composition. Formal poetry, with its broken
symmetries, would be a cooled down version of a more symmetrical form (the
archetypical Poem, perhaps?)
        As for temporality (the four dimensional structure that Lake
discusses) I simply can't see how he pegs typography as strictly spatial;
how is the "breath unit" 2 dimensional? If one has stopped breathing,
perhaps. I agree with him that poetry is performative, yet there is a
performative aspect clearly in, for example, Projective Verse. Lake can
only miss this by a kind of willful ignorance.
        Finally, what Lake misses is the human input in his formal
examples. In no case is a formal poet simply allowing the bottom-up rules
to run, nor is going to rhyming dictionary anything like randomness. The
poets choose what patterns to follow up on, which emerging form looks
promising. The poet who most clearly exemplifies the chaos principles Lake
puts forth is John Cage. In Cage's work we see simple rules, reiteration
and feedback, and little or no input from the author. Cage, and others, are
much closer to chaos theory than Wilbur or Hall. Yet Lake clearly has no
use for artists like Cage, or even WC Williams, who had a similar (I think)
view of the artist's relationship to nature: not to copy nature, but to do
what nature does (as in Williams' consideration of Shakespeare in Spring
and All). Clearly, such a relationship with nature doesn't rule out
sonnets, but it certainly doesn't require them.
        As Baraka said in "How You Sound": "If a poem as got to be a sonnet
(unlikely tho) or whatever, it'll certainly let me know." That's a
bottom-up approach; how does it differ from Wilbur or Hall or Lake deciding
what the form will be? They, it seems, have an idea (ideal form) already in
mind. This is where Lake gets away from chaos and goes into mere formalism.

I still attach utopianism to the political (and I don't mean, like, Thomas
More). The utopian impulse behind politics certainly seems to have expired
in the view of some on this list. I specifically mean the impulse of
a utopian politics in/through/by poetry. Instead, there's a complacent
pragmatism, or else a productive compartmentalism (terms, types, tones),
and specifically a monologic dogmatism ("poetry is more
dogmatic"), and definitely the uniform reduction of the
political in poetry to the crudest terms (poetic and non) that
would be rejected (with indifference, even) probably by everyone
on this list regardless of issue. (Well, it took a century to begin to get
the reactionary reductivism out of Marxism.) Finally, however,
there's a pointillist dot of delirial hope evident in Rod's characterisation of
Jennifer Moxley's book of poems (though symptomatically it is expressed
defensively).

My only thought about McCaffery's slogan, "poetry is politics that stays
politics," is unformed, and that is that to me it's a form of
idealism, which ain't necessarily a bad word (Mouffe goes to Aristotle),
so that, if it's "palpably false," then it's "false" and "palpable" like a
Hegelian "speculative proposition" is. I know this is cryptic.

"Elsewhere is the key word" why Snyder's is not an interesting political
*poetry* (except for maybe, Wave).

Dean -- I read your excellent post ust after a stroll through my
(supersymmetrical) imaginary garden.  The one place I disagreed with you
was a place where you agreed with Lake.  To my reading, perhaps
negatively affected by these high altitudes, to speak of the "law" that
governs the evolution of life forms as being the same law that governs
the creation of poetry requires either that we are speaking of a law so
removed, abstract and encompassing as to be nearly meaningless, or to
shift the term as we move from one realm to another --

But I'm right with you on all else -- Lake's essay reminds me of past
arguments to the effect that English is inherently iambic, or that the
heartbeat means that we should be more "natural" in the writing of
metered verse --

Chaos theory has been much abused -- rather like those composition texts
that appropriate the left/right brain schema --

look for my new textbook -- +Writing on the Inside of the Brain_

just ust?

the pleasures of merely formalizing???

In high school we used to rent formals --

From Ron S's post about the Booker prize:

In 1994 the judges scored
another own-goal and gave the laurels to James Kelman's wholly
unreadable mixture of Glasgow dialect and foul obscenity, "How Late
It Was, How Late,"

Actually, Kelman is well worth reading, far more so than most other
short-listed/winning novelists. I haven't got round to his Booker-winning novel,
but I enjoyed "A Disaffection" and "The Bus Conductor Hines". What provoked the
torrent of snobbish and ignorant bile he received as a result of his winning the
prize was, I think, the fact that his objective-narrator voice is Glaswegian.
Having your characters speak in dialect/obscenities is just about acceptable --
pigeonhole as "narrative of low life" -- but having the narrator-voice thus
contaminated is not! Anyway, for my money (which I did not place with William
Hill) Kelman is funny and erudite and stretches the boundaries of fiction.

Meanwhile, as a small press editor I can take heart from those sales figures.
Three copies a week for Graham Swift, huh? Maybe Reality Street Editions poets
are not doing so badly after all.

combine this misread of lake's with the formalist hierarchy he introduces,
and you've got a rather insidious example of putting quasi-scientific
concepts to the service of aesthetic ranking... had lake been more
speculative, more tentative, had he tried to feel his way through the
question of self-organization and complexity as it applies to language (and
poetic) practices, perhaps he might have offered us something of value
(sandra braman has done some fascinating work in this regard, in more
abstract terms)... instead, he seems to have assumed that one discourse may
be used to assign value in another, and proceeded from there to build his
'argument'...

anyway, thanx for that!...

Thank you, Rod Smith. Plenty there to meditate on, & it does look
interesting & engaging. I will reread & think on it.

Recalling the reference to a reading by Erin Mour=E9 recently, I would add
that other ways of politicizing the lyric mode include hers, in which a
passionate anger explodes into canny articulation, often in poems about
that 'ideal' lyric subject, love. There are many sublte ways to 'theorize'
inside the poem; it seems Moxley is doing so through a carefully contrived
simplicity; that's interesting. I can see that now I can read some of the
poems. Thanks again for taking the time to type them in.

Subject:      Re: "I recognize a frog by its structure"

hey, that excerpt of mine in my last post was a sonnet, no?...

mebbe i'll add just one more thought here, based on a loosely-knit piece i
published four years ago (on sci-lit, hypertext, tech. writing etc):  the
idea that science "becomes the best source, method, and authority for
determining the ultimate critera of moral values and those ultimate ethical
axioms and guidelines to live and govern by" (113) has been put forward by
no less than nobel-laureate split-brain researcher roger w. sperry, in his
book _science and moral priority:  merging mind, brain, and human values_
(columbia up, 1983)... as i see it, it's no accident that the guy who gave
us the idea that "consciousness is causal," with "emergent" neural process
and the like (which speaks to issues of top-down and bottoms-up at the
neural level) might also have articulated his social platform in just such
terms...

what's happened here is that our social realities are explained, justified
and de/politicized through access to cognitive structure (as this latter is
presumed to speak to mind)... it's only a small next step to ranking
aesthetic value accordingly...

as i observed four years ago, we thus have one answer to frank zappa's and
the mothers' "who are the brain police?"...

best,

joe

Poetix-ers Bob Perelman and myself are speaking on a panel called "Poetry in
the Curriculum" (favorite topic of some of our non-academic listmates, I know)
at MLA, Sat. 12/28 at 3:30. Bob's talking about teaching Olson and Rich (I
think), and I'm talking about him--you can't tell 'cause the full title's not
listed in the program, but it's "Language Writing, Theory, and the
Institutions of Poetry: The Example of Bob Perelman." Anyone at "Assembling
Alternatives" heard an early version of it there.

For my sins, I'm also speaking on an Olson panel, Mon. 12/30, 10:15,
symbolically numbered 666 in the program. I'm to talk about "Olson and
Language Writing. " This seemed like a real good idea at the time I committed
to do it, and it's one of those things (most of us probably have them) that I
always felt like I'd have to write on some day--the complex and conflicted
relationships between the poet who's meant about as much to me as any poet
I've read and later writers who also have meant and do mean a lot to me. So,
not surprisingly, I now feel like I have nothing to say. Or at least I want to
go beyond rehashing all the "I Hate Speech" stuff to address other aspects of
what Ron Silliman so nicely calls this "break within a tradition in the name
of its own higher values."

I'd love to hear what any of you have to say on Olson and LP if you feel
inclined. Ideas for references, etc. (Someone else is "doing" Olson & Howe)

Perelman on Olson, Golding on Perelman, Golding on Olson . . . "This
conference isn't incestuous! It's just carefully structured! Sophisticatedly
self-referential!"

>and feedback, and little or no input from the author.

I'm also in agreement with Dean on most of his points but the above isn't
quite accurate. In most of Cage's texts using chance operations there is also
a great deal of choice. Marjorie Perloff discusses this in some detail
relative to "Writing for the Second Time Through _Finnegan's Wake_" in
_Postmodern Genres_. Retallack discusses this with Cage in _MUSICAGE_. & it
also comes up in _I-VI_. As Perloff notes in her article: "Commentary on Cage
is usually so preoccupied with his use of self-imposed rules and chance
operations that it slights the role the poet-composer's extraordinary art
plays." Not that Dean is 'slighting' Cage, his concern is with chaos theory
not explication of Cage. Nevertheless I thought I'd make my point relative to
Cage's process. Also it is of note that Mac Low has come to prefer the term
"nonintentional prcedures" over "chance operations," because that term, for
him, "includes a wider variety of compositional methods, many of which,
strictly speaking, do not involve 'chance,' though some do." See Aerial 8
interview with Watten.

My Dictionary of Literary Biography article on Cage (forthcoming) ends thus:
"In his late writings he is no longer interested in "nonsense" nor in "sense"
in any conventional understanding of those terms. Rather he has achieved a
poetry which mimics the process of meaning creation in that  while the form
(as of any language) is already constituted the possibilities for almost
infinite recombination are such that the ideas already exist-- it is the
poets task not to have them but to find them, already extant, in the material
of language. As he wrote in _Composition in Retrospect_:
"the past must be Invented/ the future Must be/ revIsed
                                 / doing boTh/ mAkes/ whaT/ the present Is/
discOvery/
Never stops"

Dean's piece, & some of Retallack's articles, come close to discussing chaos
theory, nonlinear dynamics, etc. relative to poetry in a concrete manner, but
it seems still, to me, that no one has escaped
the metaphorical (or possibly ever will) in this discussion. It seems we need
a better understanding of what language is & how it works before these
connections can be made beyond an essentially intuitive level (not to dismiss
the intuitive, hey I am a poet over here huh). Maybe the tools for such
convincing connections are there in linguistics, I don't know.

[This document was prepared by Charles Bernstein (bernstei@acsu.buffalo.
edu) and Loss Pequen~o Glazier (lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu).]
____________________________________________________________________

1. About the Poetics List

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests, and
also to keep the scale of the list small and the volume manageable.
Word-of-mouth (and its electronic equivalents) seems to be working
reasonably well.

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein: contact him for further
information. As of May, Joel Kuszai has working on the administration of the
list.  For subscription information contact us at POETICS@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU.

The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project.

____________________________________________________________________

2. Subscriptions

The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or
unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject
line, to:

listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu

the one-line message should say:

unsub poetics

{or}

sub poetics Jill Jillway

(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your
name to unsub)

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.

*
If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at sharewar sites): from the Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you can
substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.  If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from
your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is
part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider
obtaining a commercial account.

____________________________________________________________________

3. Who's Subscribed

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message
blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:

  review poetics

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.
____________________________________________________________________

4. Digest Option

The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to
your account to each day!  If you would prefer to receive ONE message
each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to
                                listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu

set poetics digest

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply
to this message!!

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this messagage:

set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________

5. When you'll be away

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may
lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily
turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message:

You can temporarily turn off your mail by sending a message:

set poetics nomail

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 7 below.)


____________________________________________________________________

6. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

our URL is

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center
provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new
poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS
List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct
connections to numerous related electronic
RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about contemporary print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we
have an extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as
well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Pequen~o Glazier.
____________________________________________________________________

7. Poetics Archives via EPC

Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and
year or search them for specific information. Your interface will
allow you to print or download any of these files.

Or set your browser to go directly to:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive

____________________________________________________________________

8. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications
as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a
list of your press/publications to
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word processing
program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the address above
to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk. Though files marked
up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your
word processor ill save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is also highly
desirable

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.

Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

Subject:      Re: The Lake Effect

i think the point rod makes re the metaphorical is important:  to do the
sort of work lake is attempting, but to do it [dare i say] better, what
needs to happen is that the arts side of things has got to be shown as
participating conceptually (and linguistically) in those broader
cultural-social movements in which the science, too, participates (this
latter, of course, in mathematical terms as well)... which means that one
needs to be able to situate the sciences not as primary, but as correlative
to the arts in this regard...

and to do so wrt chaos theory is not an easy matter, not least b/c we're so
close to it...

I read an article about the poems in several newspapers a couple of weeks

good-sized article. In all likelihood a story also appeared in things such
as _Time_ anmd _Newsweek_ and _Maclean's_.

And I agree.  "Law" is the wrong word here.  Method, perhaps. Model.
Paradigm, even, if that word were not so devalued at present.  Anyway, if
one sees
consciousness as an emergent phenomenon and language as an emergent
phenomenon,  is poetry, then, not included in this?

Rod, thanks for the correction on Cage.  The material you posted from your
entry in the Dictionary of Literary Biography is close, I think, to my
point.  A method that "mimics the process of meaning creation" is one
which, I think, does what nature does.  Not that nature makes meaning--we
do that, or rather conscious awareness does that.  And consciousness is one
of those processes which may be described as "emergent."  I'm following
Roger Penrose on this--his idea that consciousness emerges at an interface
between classical and quantum mechanics in the nervous system is very
controversial, but it draws on psychology, biology, physics, chemistry,
philosophy--and this is where Joe Amato's point comes in--why not the arts?

Joe's point about "metaphorical slippage" and the error of simply reading
surface features is something to be well aware of--

One of my interests is quantum physics--not the mathematics of probablity,
but the philosophical and conceptual problems it gives rise to.  These
issues are related to chaos, certainly, but are they merely metaphorical
when applied to writing, or to any of the arts?  I mean, if these processes
(nonlinear and even quantum, if one agrees with Penrose) can literally (not
metaphorically) give rise to consciousness, then that allows any field
which makes claims as to the nature of awareness, cognitive experience,
meaning, etc. access to these theories in their full sense, not as
metaphor.  This would, I think, allow poetics as it allows philosophy to
make use of these models.

Just a minor point - the models, etc. of quantum mechanics are interpene-
trated by the mathematics, articulated by the mathematics. That's where
the problem comes in; I'd say to some extent that if you're not interested
in the mathematics of qm, you're not interested in qm, and your "take"
becomes an issue of slippage. Just as mathematics are extrapolated from
concepts, concepts are extrapolated from mathematics. What does it mean
_exactly_ to _apply_ qm to literary texts? And without testability, is-
sues of parameterization, verification, etc., all that can be accomplished
is another dose of metaphor and a further division, ironically, between
the so-called two-cultures looking out, looking in.

And a quick one in return (I can't sleep again) - the problem for me has
always been that the implications are drawn from the concepts, but the
concepts are "leaky" in relation to the mathematics; by the time one gets
to the humanities, the implications are, in a sense, broken. I don't think
the last analogy is correct, but biology in fact doesn't go beyond chem-
istry; without a thorough knowledge of the latter (molecular biology,
etc.), biology returns with elan vital and other life-force concepts.

As for experimental writing - I don't think this is testable; one thing
that's fascinating about cultural productions is their lack of
reproducible verification procedures -

As a new subscriber, someone born, brought up in Glasgow and still
living here, it was a little dismaying to read the quote from Ron S.
on Kelman in Ken Edwards` sensitive response.  In "James Kelman`s
wholly unreadable mixture of Glasgow dialect and foul obscenity",
"wholly unreadable" is clearly not meant as an apologetic admission
of difficulty when confronted with an unfamiliar idiolect; it`s
inhospitable, a contemptuous dismissal.  The complaint of "foul
obscenity" needs further explanation from Ron S before I address it.
Kelman`s every interview for the last five years at least have been
spent explaining why "there`s no such thing as `bad language` - just
language badly used".

I agree with the Glasgow poet Tom Leonard who has spent a career
arguing that your voice is as good as anyone else`s, no matter where
you come from (it looks like this is what Glasgow writers are
condemned to do).

Thanks, Dean T. for illuminating comments.  But doesn't the term "broken
symmetry" actually have a broader application than you make out?  I could
be wrong.  But I thought it referred more generally to forms close to
symmetry that are somehow skewed a little. I've read it (I think!) in
works on math, not just theoretical physics. - HG

I think you're on the right track, Louis, but I don't think "complacency"
necessarily attaches to pragmatism, & a lot of the "defensiveness' on
this subject comes out of an awareness that utopianism in poetry can
mean a complacent, aestheticized idealism, which, despite good
radical style, is disengaged from politics. What is utopianism in real
life?  For me, Whitman is it.  Making a poetics out of "presence".  The
poet backs up his/her words with being there.  (not just elsewhere, eating
sky-pie).  - H. Gould

Subject:      Re: Lake effects

alan is right about the mathematical---it does present a key slippage
point, as it were... and it makes any cross-disciplinary analysis
difficult...

i *do* want to be sure, though, to indicate that mathematics is often put
to the service of faltering paradigms and concepts (perhaps "faltering" is
not quite right here---i'm not entirely certain we're continually
progressing in our refinements)... it's clear that terminology has played a
fundamental role right along in the sciences, both theoretically and in
their articulation... a good example would be eighteenth century
chemistry...

which, again, is why i say that chaos is so difficult in this
regard---we're so close to it that it's difficult to see 'it' for what it
is, and to pull it apart in ways that might reveal the more tacit
assumptions structuring its logic (and its math)... the other complication
is that the mathematics that supports it is not a simple extension of
newton's principia, with which many of us may by now be familiar... i'm not
talking about the easy examples that scientists offer by way of non-linear
equations and the like, in order to talk to a lay public... i'm talking
about the actual math that's employed by folks like prigogine... i've heard
prigogine lecture to a group of physicists as well as to the general
public... and in the former, the key difference was that he was challenged
by the physicists at the mathematical level---and in fact he answered to
each objection on the blackboard, while at the same time saying to the
effect that 'he generally had his mathematicians do such work for him'...

the math he used---and i was with a physicist friend---was itself extremely
difficult, and silenced all objections... one reason why i hold prigogine
in high regard---even if, like most scientists, he *does* presume to be
describing 'reality' more accurately than his predecessors---is b/c he can
shift back and forth from the math., to the concepts, in fact to the
history (i also heard him on one occasion reach way back to newton's
original articulation, to correct an interrogator who had challenged his
remarks re newton)...

anyway, yeah---i've done some work in this regard mself (wrt energy per se)
and it's clear to me that useful insights and correspondences may be
developed in the absence of the math... but it's really quite difficult,
and if you happen to incorporate the math, this will likely be one of the
first things that gets chopped for editorial purposes (and b/c of
audience)... for those of you who are interested, the society for
literature and science (sls) regularly discusses such stuff (and has an
annual conference)... joe conte (who's out there someplace i think) and i
were on a panel there a few years back... on a related note:  i think brian
rotman's work on the semiotics of math. may be useful here (can't recall
any titles at the moment, sorry)...

as to aldon's sense of sokal-ness:  hey, i like that!... but i really do
think lake is serious as hell... but hey man---what REALLY bugs me is that
you've got the title of my most recent poetic project, "lake affect," in
your subject line... which in fact does touch on self-organization and the
like, while slipping & sliding along that great lakes frontier that
conditioned my own childhood self...

Alan:  Yes, I see what you mean--without some grounding in hard science
or mathematics, this becomes a kind of mysticism, and that's not what I'm
after.  To use the example of biology again, it doesn't leave chemistry
behind, it builds on it.  And studies of consciousness build on biology
(neurology).  I'd say these fields do in fact, go beyond the premises of
the the sciences from which they've arisen.  But yes, the hard stuff has
got to be there.

The problem I see, and the one I think you're addressing, is the
mythologizing of whatever science is being touted as "the model."
The working of mind, for example, was once (turn of the century?) thought of
as analogous to a telegraph system, then to a computer, then to parallel
computing (neural networks and the like), now quantum effects and chaos.
That's not to say that these latter concepts aren't useful (I think they are,
and as more than metaphor--even as metaphor they're useful). But will
Lake's ideas (and my counter) seem as silly in the coming decades as
little telegraph wires in our heads seem to us now?  Probably.  But that
shouldn't prevent us from developing these models, using them to see what
they reveal about awareness, cognition, language, meaning.

Dear Robin Purves,

Welcome to the list!

But please note!! Ron had sent to the list an article he characterized as
"lurid" from what he called "The Wall Street Urinal". Ken appears to have
miscontrued this. This truly foul article was by Paul Levy. I thank Ron for
passing it on.
The source of the quoted article is:

LEISURE & ARTS: Books, Booker, Bookies
          Paul Levy
                 Copyright 1996 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
CITATION         The Wall Street Journal, October 30, 1996
DATELINE         London
TEXT             Something is seriously wrong with the Booker prize.

This might be a good place to note that my essay "Poetics of Americas" --
which deals with the relation of dialect to ideolect as both opposing
standard Englishes (and  in the course mentions Tom Leonard's great work and
also MacDiarmid) has just appeared in Modernism/modernity (3:3, Sept. 1996).

Hello all:

I find myself in charge of readings and speakers for the English
Department here at Forida Atlantic U (Boca Raton).  If any of you out
there are planning on being in the south Florida area (Boca Raton is
about 45 minutes north of Miami) and would like to set up a reading (or,
if you're an academic type, a lecture) please get in touch with me.  Our

Subject:      reading report Fall Cafe & Ear Inn

lee ann brown and lisa jarnot reading poetry at the fall cafe on sunday
november 3 in brooklyn ny presented us with a good recipe to revolve.  lisa
read a fire poem and lee ann sang about the susan smith babies.  in lisa's
fire poem was a line about two kids in buffalo mixing gasoline and styrofoam
to make napalm which they launched from a sling shot and aimed at cars.
 anselm's friends work at the fall cafe and are from buffalo and are behind
the bar and know the two kids.  anselm's friends ask lisa if she lived on the
circle street.  lisa is from buffalo.  prageeta sharma videotapes the reading
for channel 13.

after the reading we sit at a table with meg arthurs harris schiff drew
gardner juliana spahr anselm berrigan lewis warsh and lee ann and lisa.  i
want to know how the napalm worked with the slingshot and so does drew.
 harris says napalm thoughts.  drew starts wondering how to think napalm
thoughts with slingshots.  harris looks annoyed.  we learn leslie scalopino
is starting a reading series at Barnes & Nobel in union square new york city
and there are a few questions.  meg says she hates Starbucks.  the questions
center around what to do about Barnes & Noble.  napalm thoughts i repeat and
am grateful for harris.

harris lee ann anselm and meg go to prageeta's for pourri.  juliana drew & i
go to my place and listen to nick drake and talk about gibson, dick, romance
novels and westerns.  drew has heard of the talking backwards linguist
analyzer who has a theory that snippets of things played backwards reveal
what you really mean.  the backwards linguist has played OJ's tapes and he
hears I killed my wife.  i want to grant that much to the unconscious i say
if you played douglass backwards it would come up madonna songs.  i believe
in the power of love.  juliana talks about a scholarly book on romance novels
and their readers.  The thesis is that romance novels are radical because
they give care.  marlene comes over we and go to monte's venetian room and
later to the brooklyn inn for tequila.  i get barded.

lee ann likes games the night before and insists we play bingo at her place.
 we play bingo at her place.  anselm wins and we say All Are Punished.
 Punish Ed like the prince says in romeo and julliet.  we're bored with bingo
but love the new movie.  drugs are quick.  the bingo game lee ann wants to
use for a poem because she has a reading tomorrow and uses her friends to
generate.  we decide to add the numbers together and start each line with the
ordinator (either B, I, N, G, or O).  eg getting O-69 would require you to
come up with a 15 word line beginning with the letter O.  other people get
the same number so there are alterations between juliana and marlene, steve
carll and katy lederer, lee ann and everyone except anselm who won't play & i
have to write it all down.  marlene gets bingo and juliana closes it out
because she doubled.

lee ann has already read this poem at the fall.  the title comes from a
picture of lee ann in the bushes.  it's not a very good poem but we like each
other.

Lee Ann Sneaking up On Eros

I love you
I hate you
In the house of eros the scribes drink tequila alot
I cannot believe in forced contemplation yes no both c'mon
Nor and forced wasting
Nor in enforced wastelands
Nor in the compound
Going on & on forever
In pursuit the scribes take up their pens & weep lavishly
In pursuit the scribes downsize downturn dumb up the table
Inextinguishable from eating
Because people often ask what you are doing
Bob would always ask his family what they were
Berated because of their golden campina diesel car truck
Needing under the table the scuba quality
Of all instances in feminine literature abjection occupies
     extravagance but humility receives blows and thrashing
Of generosity we tolerate no space relations or time benefits
     therefore love thy relation
Go when you take my filbert filial bly like forward rpm
      butte tagalog brand
Jill crossed mighty peaks
Good is the way it boiled vociferously gone are the days
      when it carried issues of blood and bulls bore me
Behold!  bulls bore me under wing
In separate mounds mighty telegraph hounds mighty broken truculence
Never on deep space nine are brothers golden eared
Not feared it completely as such be home largely
Nor just go for just end again again again
Or end end end it now or move
Go flesh & rise go limbs & sail on clouds of your bones
Anselm has to do the free spot
Bloody lepers taste good said love's lost shepherd herding
     around 5 is a manageable number
Never said we nicely the pens revolted & kissed the bone's thigh
O young trilliums meaning yellow bird sycamore beauty trounced
     by stalagmitic teeth
Bamboo aphasia memory stalks murders memory lovingly biting
But it is this time & this memory that wants
Nightwood into the zone of our catastrophe, nora
"If you're such a fan of mine you'd know"
I drink american spirits despite slave ownership absinthe fairies guarded
O my god telling rituals of worship gone really bad
O return to ideas of eros & embark upon cutting

marlene announces that juliana's new sun & moon book is out.  marlene was not
supposed to tell and midwest juliana pretends to look modest & annoyed.  lee
ann has a few questions.  juliana says o, mine should have come out after
yours.  juliana gives lee ann the new chain.  everyone laughs at gary
sullivan's drawings on the spd catalog.

we go into lee ann's apt after a car crash on the street.  lee ann buys the
bingo game for around 4 dollars.  we buy tequila & wine at the liquor store
and lee ann sees the bingo game on the street.  we say good bye to scott
bentley.  juliana says i liked your poims.

We walk from brother's barbecue around which we sat at a table where were
steve lee ann and anselm and katy and scott and juliana.  we look at scott's
poims and i change sakes to snakes in castaways because he is always making
red marks on mine.

                                         CASTAWAYS
                                 -for Jennifer, a Valentine

             If you woke one morning to find the body sleeping next to you
 a shame, a shindig of party favors, a polyester cocktail
 on your fine suit;

             if I lived a thousand years, happily
 ever after never having had
 you to do all over
 again;

            if you'd been the Skipper, I'd be your
 Marianne or Ginger, of course,
 this clearly being a case

of mistaken indemnity, neither
 of us meant anything much to the other

by it, so
 we saidx

and yet, I would have liked to rescue you from all that network variety,
navigating
 the orange and pink Day-glo which Providence channels, tossing off covers
 up such transgressions you searched
 the lagoon, the dawning

                      on land
                      sakes, alive.



steve gives his books to scott, the new one from Logo deadalus and the loops.
I get up from the table to smoke and look at the penn state game at the bar
where it snows.  i conclude sherry is watching the game.  a guy at the bar
says it's hard to get out of state college after a big game where people
tailgate starting thursday morning and he knows someone who can get him seats
when it snows it's in a valley and they don't get the roads plowed until
monday.  he would like to get out of the game with his '49 studebaker army
canvas back truck i must have seen it around town because he parks it on
crosby because he lives on crosby crosby goes one way north do you know
crosby?  a taxi one day was backing up on crosby forty miles an hour and
smacked into his army truck gets 1 mile per gallon straight six pistons this
big and almost kills the two germans in the back.  he files a claim with the
taxi's insurance and finds out there are 900,000 outstanding claims ahead of
his.  he says i'm calling the post and i have friends at the post.  2 hours
later the ceo calls and settles the claim and throws in a bone and says don't
go to the papers.  army truck man accepts the bone and claims that all taxi
drivers in new york city pay $1.46 per day to be insured by this one company.


We are walking to brothers from the ear and katy is very cold because she
misses san francisco.  We say good bye to beth borrus and brenda coultas and
marcella x.  Beth had read poems from her fast talking divorce book.  It's
got a blurb from fanny howe on the back.  She gets out her guitar and sings
to us.  We are lee ann, lisa, juliana, scott, marcella, brenda, anselm, steve
and some other folks whose names i don't know.  She ends with the song about
being stupid.

Smoking cigarettes, it's stupid.
Having unsafe sex, it's stupid
but we do it.

Showing up uninvited, it's stupid.
Falling in love unrequited, it's stupid
but we do it anyway.

Everyday I try to do something stupid.
Everyday there's nothing to it
but I do it anyway.

Drinking beer in the car, it's stupid.
Wishing on the first star, it's stupid
but we do it.

Picking up strange men, it's stupid.
Again and again, it's stupid
but we do it anyway.

Everyday I try to do something stupid.
Everyday there's nothing to it
but I do it anyway.

Talking hours long distance phone, it's stupid.
Walking at night alone, it's stupid
but we do it.

Driving drunk, it's stupid.
Smoking skunk makes us stupid
so we do it everyday.

Everyday I try to do something stupid.
Everyday there's nothing to it
but I do it anyway.


i introduce beth.  While she now lives in elizabeth, beth borrus is a
bougainvillea flowing over a wooden deck in the backyard of her california.

Scott reads occasional poems and Under the Boom of Amazement and it's very
good.  he sits up on the table and his poems are pop rocks in my mouth.  This
line made a whole pack go off:

While sinagua iguana says igneous crustacean was lawless to answer and the
Paiute word is Richter.

i introduce scott as a jacaranda pod.  i met beth and scott in san diego.

if snyder is reading from _mountains and rivers without end_, i highly
reccomend.  saw him read from this last spring at the u of nevada, reno,
and while it is a long-ish reading/performance, it is quite worth it.
snyder seems more at home w/ this epic piece than he has for many yrs w/
other works.  it was a delightful evening, with a delightful person/poet,
who is, it seems, delighted indeed with this poem.
best,
shaunanne tangney

hello robert,
i think i'm kinda late with billbissett's address(but if you still need,
let me know) i witnessed bill read only a few days ago here in londonOnt.
he used to be the writer in res. here(before my time)

well... he rocked. i know jordan davis frequently reports of bigapple blow
outs. but this is londonOnt(where i haven't heard bowering for a few
years) the man (billbissett) read for 1ne hour and 3rty minutes.  it was
for a launch of a local journal called London After Midnight.  we got him
cheap and he left the crowd of 5ty swirling.

raging and excellent,
kevin

Subject:      constabulary notes from all over

well, it isn't Minnesota, I guess, but it's still giving away the farm.  one
earlier story noted that one department head (dean?) welcomed the plan
because now he could, for example, tell a particular faculty member: "the
department is moving in x direction intellectually; so I'd 'like' you to
stop doing y research and start doing research of an x-ish nature."

is it peculiar to Arizona that the Faculty Senates sauntered so gaily up to
the chopping block?

any opinions as to whether said faculty senates, as well as the Board of
Regents, might reasonably be sued by offended faculty members?

I do find it remarkable that "shortcomings" in ANY ONE of the three areas
might be grounds for dismissal: teaching fine? publishing fine? well your
service is a real problem, fella....

the net seems wide enough that, while I doubt few will be fired in the
foreseeable future, department heads and deans and those up the ladder sure
have a vise handy for squeezing any trouble makers.... it's got to have a
seriously chilling effect on political debates in the university, if not
(perhaps?) on research agendas.

what do far-flung Poetics folks think? looming on your own immediate
horizon?  or just another weird story from the land of weird stories (the
folks, say, who brought you Evan Mecham....)

A BLOW TO THE HEAD
I have become speculation
Every delusion conforming to its aesthetic ideal

Lost illusion of the irritable absolute
The crucial accumulates
Thick with hypotheses

Into the stammering tact of written interventions
By minus to retrace the share that's left
By speculation

Be now disabused of any sense of process employed
All is appropriated and selective to profit full of droll
     hunchings
Looks like the prudent are here with the plaster

When there's nothing to lose you
Make do with what was lost
Not a trap for nostalgia's buzzing luster

What is the lost to the gone
Separation of desperation's decoy
From its contacts

Complex ways to lose the struggle to change the price one pays
Puts a though in any thought of a straight answer
Answers to answers blithe as the *uh* in spur

Great site and great stuff, but I have some problems with "insane poetry"

Either all poetry is insane or none is?

The epithet objectifies, distancews, and diminishes the writers. Did they
receive compensation or give informewd consent?  Poetry written by people
who suffer from mental problems is perhaps not as snappy but more
appropriate and accurate.  People are _not_ their diseases.

Forgive the tone.  This is a sensitive issue for me as a psychologist.

I assume this is the Folkways disc, which are now being reissued as part of
a program of the Smithsonian.

It's unlikely that putting any of the poetry on CD is a priority, but last
I checked, ANY old Folkways LP can be ordered & they make a cassette copy
just for you.

Here's a Web address:

<http://www.si.edu/folkways/start.htm>

Everything is not listed there, but if you call the phone number (800
410-9815) I'm pretty sure that you can still get anything on cassette.

Let me know if they no longer do this, 'cause I've been putting off getting
a copy of "Sound of the Junk Yard."

The Olson cassette was available as of last May. My understanding is that
Smithsonian does keep a library of master recordings which are dubbed on
demand, notes included (in Olson's case, by Barry Miles). Mail address for
full catalogue:

Folkways
Center for Folklife Programs & Cultural Studies
955 L'Enfant Plaza 2600
Smithsonian Institution
Washington, D.C. 20560


It's worth checking out, for poetry as well as for music...

hey there tenney: yes, one of the "bad regents" cited arizona in defense of her
plan, saying that az had a clause about layoffs in case of program closings or
etc; and there was a creeepy article in the chron of higher ed a few weeks ago
urging regents' boards to become more interventionist in this vein...regents
boards throughout the country are apparently egging on the one at MN, so there
can be a precedent that they can then in turn cite when chopping away at their
own institutions.  our response is to (try to) unionize, it seems the only way.
i'm excited about unionization for its own sake, as some here are as well, but
some others are supporting unionization in spite of themselves; i.e. they are
loath to unionize but see it as the only thing that will preserve academic
freedom. opponents of unionization think it will bring down the quality, but i
don't see that; rutgers, which is a stellar research university at least in the
humanities, is a unionized state university.  as for the faculty senate's
apparent willingness to compromise or offer themselves up on a platter, i
thought that was peculiar to here, where the general attitude seems to be,"if
you ask for anything you'll be regarded as greedy, so you won't get anything."
this of course results in no one ever getting anything, from departmental tenure
lines to raises etc.  i thought tht was part of "minnesota nice," but i guess
it's endemic to that niveau of faculty/administrators.  it seems contradictory
to the old say "you don't ask, you don't get," but since when have academics
made sense?--md

Subject:      Calling magazine editors for a round table panel

I have in front of me a flyer advertising and soliciting participation
in the "Poetry and the Public Sphere" conference that has already
been mentioned on this list, and which will take place from
4/24-4/27 1997 at the Rutgers New Brunswick campus.

I am interested in proposing to the conference coordinators, as soon as
humanly and electronically possible, a round table discussion by 4 or 5
magazine editors.  The topic would be something like, say, "The Perils and
Pleasures of Avant-Garde Publishing" (no, the title need not be so sugary
or whatever).  Anyone interested should please contact me asap.

Here's the verbatim from the flyer, as it concerns the above:

"Detailed proposals for roundtable discussions (no more than four people)
to consist of five minute remarks and a moderated discussion. You may provide
names and brief profiles of chair and three or four panelists, plus a two-
page proposal describing the topic, approach, and intended contribution of
each discussant."

As you can see from this passage directly above, the proposal will have to
be substantial.  So any feedback, alternate suggestions for the panel's focus,
or anything else you can think of is most welcome by me.  Keep in mind
what the title of the conference is (i won't take the time to keystroke
the suggested topics printed on the flyer).

Subject:      Re: constabulary notes from all over

"faculty development plan"?

"performance improvement plan"?

how on earth is this not to reduce to a rather brutal
you-do-this-or-you're-out edict if it's instituted within an existing
tenure & promotion system that has historically provided for little if any
faculty-based input into such 'plans'?... sounds like it's been modeled on
a rehab program... seems to me it would be better to really start talking
about teaching and learning as such, and not continually sidestep same on
the basis of a research ethos... which latter i wouldn't give up on either,
given the current privatizing pressures... but given that the above would
seem to be a foregone conclusion, it seems to me that arizona has missed
its opportunity, this time 'round, for talking teaching...

so listen tenney, and others so interested:  perhaps it's time to consider,
seriously, collective bargaining... no point in pretending any longer that
teachers are not workers, or pretending that profs can 'discuss' the
intellectual merits of such actions (which reaction i've heard so often
these days that it almost chokes me)... this isn't a matter of intelligent,
give & take discussion---this is a power issue... when we've restored some
balance of power, *then* we can talk with our admins, students, etc, about
how to teach... hear tell the columbia u. alf-cio/faculty meet went down
well (in the words of a gent i know who was in attendance, "it rocked")...
anybody out there have any additional info. on same? (other than what was
reported in the chronicle, i mean)...

my feeling right along has been that we profs should use the nets to
cultivate unionizing... does anybody know who we can talk to regarding
same?---i mean, if there's a specific effort underway to nationalize such
efforts?... i'm aware of different teaching unions (and right now i'm
tilted toward the nea) but i'm unaware of any specific trans-regional
agenda...

we probably should expect that the move to unionize will be met with some
federal resistance too, even if clinton is re-elected... technically the
feds have to support local such efforts (through fmcs, i think it is), but
legislatively, politics is politics...

mebbe this should be a backchannel matter?... i've appended some e-list
info that seems appropriate... that list was supposed to have been set up
for a conference this past september, which i didn't attend (did any of
you?)... note that i subbed well before the conference, but never heard a
word back (except that subbing was not automatic, and that my sub request
had been forwarded to a list moderator for approval)... in any case, i
think we need more of this sort of thing...

anyway, hey, happy election day to all!...

E-Mail List for Faculty Organizing to Resist Attacks on Higher Education

An e-mail list has been created for faculty members on college
campuses who are interested in organizing a response to attacks
on higher education, and to promote a conference (see program below)
on September 28, 1996 in Cambridge, MA titled "Resisting Attacks on
Higher Education and Social Justice:  A Faculty Conference."

This e-mail list is called CAN-FAC, short for Campus Activists' Network,
Faculty Discussion.  It is sponsored by Teachers for a Democratic
Culture and the Center for Campus Organizing, and facilitated by Judy
Ashley at the University of Vermont (jashley@gnu.uvm.edu).

While much of the discussion until the 28th will focus on outreach for
the conference, topics appropriate for this list include attacks on the
tenure system, debates over "political correctness", the campus climate
for progressive faculty members, pressure campaigns by conservative
alumni, and recent congressional action defunding student aid, humanities,
and civilian science programs.

1. TO SUBSCRIBE to the list, send e-mail to:  canet@pencil.math.missouri.edu
   with a subject of "canet" whose body just says:
        sub can-fac Firstname Lastname

2. TO SEND A MESSAGE to the list, e-mail it to:
        can-fac@pencil.math.missouri.edu

3. TO UNSUBSCRIBE, send e-mail to:  canet@pencil.math.missouri.edu
   with a subject of "canet" whose body ONLY says:
        unsub can-fac

4. If the volume of mail on this list becomes too large, you can always
   change your subscription to a "digest" (1 big message per day) by sending
   e-mail to:  canet@pencil.math.missouri.edu with subject "canet" and body:
        set can-fac mail digest

   To undo this use "ack" in place of "digest".
   To suppress mail for the summer, use "postpone" in place of "digest".

For more information on CANET, send any message to:
   canet-info@pencil.math.missouri.edu

If you have any other questions, please contact the facilitator.

Dear Poetics List Folk:

Having been away from the net & this poetics list for almost 3 months now,
it's a pleasure to report in once again and catch up with current conversations.

I also want to apologize to anyone who ordered books in July or early August
who may have been served less than well due to difficulties of a move from
Minnesota to Arizona which is still, in some ways, in progress, as we still
don't have a permanent place to live and many things, including Chax books,
are still in boxes. But the situation is getting better, so please let me
know if you've had any problems.

And, now here, with two new books available (previous posts in the summer
announced these books as "forthcoming"), I'd like to offer to anyone on the
list the ability to purchase these books from us here at the new address.

Prospect of Release
retail $12.95
available to poetics list members & friends (tell anyone) for $9.00
(includes shipping/handling)

from the book:

We malign those who disappear, their
realm is small, yet invoke their names
as our lives evoke theirs, words into
statement. Arms wrapped to the shoulder

in eternity, they cannot follow words.
Instead, our course changes to near
their grounds. Refracted in such frame,

prolific transcendent fatherly healed
cured constant, like indifference, does
affection prove illusion? No beaten

path nor Autobahn leads this way. A
letter, reflected in flame, senses
shoots to send. Unknowable, cemetery grass,
be wise -- forget what we have known.


2.

and, just received from printer/binder:

Hank Lazer
3 of 10
retail $14.00
available to poetics list members & friends (tell anyone) for $10.00
(includes shipping/handling)


from the book:

8 "He had to hide from himself the pent-up anger of having his ambitions
foiled."

9"Viewed in this light, it is no accident that suicides are so common in the
spring."

10 "In human intercourse the tragedy begins not when there is
misunderstanding about words, but when silence is not understood."

11 "Let your life be a counter friction to stop the machine."

12 "When you travel to the celestial city, carry no letter of introduction."

13 "Whenever he got too close to success, he was not only exhilarated but
scared."

14 Fuchsia Farmers of America.

15 "This strange man, rumor said, had written a book no copy of which had
ever been sold."

16 To travel means to become intensely aware, by contrast, of wasted
opportunities at home.

17 When on foot for great periods of time, he became acutely subject to the
weather, the condition of his knees, and the availability of restrooms.

18 "The fruit a thinker bears is *sentences.*"


And if anyone plans any trips to Arizona or nearby, please let me know well
in advance. Perhaps readings can be set up.


all best,

-- [ From: Al Rubottom * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW! if you're anywhere within range by year's end:

A *fabulous* artists book show just opened at the Berkeley Art Center Assoc.,
located in Live Oak Part, 1275 Walnut Street, in (north) Berkeley,
California.
Sibyl & I attended the opening reception on Sunday and were duly impressed
with the high quality of all the work displayed, the marvelous mounting of
the
show [kudos to BACA staff & helpers for a job well done], and the very
intriguing schedule of additional events in conjunction with the show.

The show will run through 29 December, Wed. - Sun. 12 - 5 p.m.
This short announcement is copied from the BACA Newsleaf:

A stunning exhibition of artists books, a number of them collaborations with
scientists, opens at BACA on Wednesday, Ocober 30.

"Science Imagined" invited the exploration of scientific principles and
imaginative
illustration of artists' understanding of those principles. The  books
produced
for
the exhibition are truly astonishing in the range of scientific subjects
explored and
the variety of presentations.

Work was selected in two ways: a core of invited artists was asked to prepare
a piece relating to the subject, and a call for entries was distributed
nationally and
internationally. The responses have been surprising and often moving.
Jurors Susannah Hays (who also curated the invited portion); Robin Rider,
Historian of Science and Curator of Special Collections at the Univ. of
Wisconsin;
and BACA director Robbin Henderson selected nearly 30 books from over 60
submitted.

Books came from as far away as the Netherlands, U.K. and Canada,
as well as from across the U.S. and from the presses of many local artists.
Participants number nearly 80 and include Leda Black, Nance O'Banion,
Marylee Bytheriver, Julie Chen, SAS Colby, Dale Going, Georgianna Greenwood,
Charles Hobson, Michael Henninger, Lisa Kokin, Meredith Mustard, Lynne
Prather,
Joyce Cutler-Shaw, Jaime Robles, Anne Schwartzburg, Judith Serebrin, Indigo
Som,
Joanne Sonnichsen, Donna & Peter Thomas, F. Deschamps and J. Mohns, Elena
Rivera,
Diane Jacobs, Michael O'Shea, Nancy Ruth Leavitt, Dorothy Yule, and many
others.
[including Sibyl Rubottom, James Machacek, Steve Nosaan, and Sara Rosenbluth
of San Diego!]

A lovely catalog is available for $15.
The special events planned in conjunction with the exhibition's run include:
Readings from the books, Tues., Nov. 12, 7:30 p.m.
Collaborations, Artists & Scientists, Thurs., Dec. 19, 7:30 p.m.

Berkeley Art Center
1275 Walnut Street
Berkeley, CA 94709
510.644.6893

easily found from I-80:
take Gilman exit and go east/inland, note that Gilman merges into Hopkins,
follow Hopkins until Walnut, et voila! [check for directions from BACA if
needed]
or, go one block from Black Oak Books/The Cheeseboard/Chez Panisse up to
Walnut
(Peet's is at corner of Walnut & Rose), and proceed north on Walnut
a few blocks 'til you come upon Live Oak Park on your right...

The graphics will download much more quickly now. Thanks to several people
for alerting me to the problem--especially Dean Taciuch,for his suggestions.
I've added another graphic, and some announcements, to the Bulletin Board,
and have more to add as soon as I can figure out how to make that little

Great reading last night by Robin Blaser at SubVoicive, The Three Cups pub,
Holborn, London. His first in London, I believe. He was in fine form, reading
extensively in two half-hour sets from his collected poems THE HOLY FOREST.
There was some discussion about how to acquire this magnificent book, which is
hard to get hold of in the UK due to Coach House Press' demise. Lawrence Upton
suggested putting pressure on Compendium Bookshop to import copies from
whichever warehouse they're sitting in.

Thanks to Peter Quartermain and David Bromige for alerting us to Robin's arrival
in this country (he was appearing in the Six Towns Poetry Festival, Newcastle
under Lyme) and so enabling us to arrange a London gig.

There were about 30 people present, which, as those of you who know the Three
Cups upper room, means quite a degree of intimacy. Among the audience: Sandy
Kindness, Johan de Wit, Gavin Selerie, Brian Docherty, John Cayley, Patrick
Wright, Bob Cobbing, Will Rowe, Harry Gilonis, Peterjon and Yasmin Skelt,
Geoffrey and Valerie Soar, Robert Sheppard, David Miller and our host Lawrence
Upton. Apologies to those whose names I forgot.

Readings coming up at SubVoicive:

19 Nov  Michael Heller
10 Dec  Quick hits (open reading for regulars)
14 Jan  Allen Fisher (the Eric Mottram annual memorial reading)

The Three Cups is in Sandland Street, near Holborn tube station.
All readings start at 8.00 for 8.15pm.

Also coming up:

Reality Street Editions presents a reading
to launch the new "4packs" anthology

SLEIGHT OF FOOT

Miles Champion, Helen Kidd and Harriet Tarlo will be reading.
Scott Thurston, also included in the book, is, unfortunately for us, in Poland.

Tue 26 Nov, 7.00pm at Compendium Bookshop, 234 Camden High St, London NW1

Belated apologies to everyone: Robin Purves, Ron Silliman and the rest of the
list, for giving the impression inadvertently (through lack of proper
contextualisation) that I imagined Ron was berating James Kelman for obscenity!

saw sun ra's surviving arkestra at cramped little joint last night in mpls,
never seen before by moi, very good, transformative energy, moving.  "the saints
were marching in" when these middle aged profound musicians put on their sparkly
space-hats and plastic choir robes and chanted "the earth is not my home," and
"space is the place," and "sunset on the river Nile."  all white audience
practically, that worshipful bouncy look of mouthing the words along, the ones
who weren't too drunk or lovey-doving with their hetero-partners.  very much
cool how these guys interacted with each other organically very.--md

Would like to hear more about the Sun Ra Arkestra Concert -- Like, for
example, who is playing the keyboards in the absence of the once and
future myth?

Grew up watching this band in D.C., where all black (well, not exactly,
since I was there) audiences were then the norm -- There was also a guy
named Norm who used to come to the shows come to think of it --

Does Jackie Jackson still play Bassoon and Ancient Egyptian Infinity Drum?

What's the front line like without June Tyson, Marshall Allen, Pat
Patrick, John Gilmore?????

Has anybody else seen a concert anywhere since Ra's return to whatever
plane beyond Alabama he emanated from?

AND -- Rhapsody Films recently released on vide cassette the remarkable
movie _Space Is The Place_  a sort of Ra Blaxploitation era film not to
be missed --

Evidence records just released a two CD set of Ra singles, including his
Do Wop productions and the unforgettable "I'm Gonna Unmask the Batman"

Ra, by the way, frequently worked with poets -- though his collaboration
with Baraka blew up when the Harlem Blackhouse project went bust --

>
>In Abstractly Represented  Hazel Smith explores the plasticity of language

>association are paramount. The works in this volume range through
>dismembered and reassembled narratives to performance pieces with words
>notated in musical rhythms. They draw on, and can be appreciated within, a
>long tradition of poetry. But at the same time they invert and dismantle
>that traditon, challenging in startling and stimulating ways the whole

For those who've room left in their mailboxes, there's a Sun Ra list which
can be reached at SATURN@NIC.SURFNET.NL. It's a particularly good resource
for those interested in rare, op, Sun Ra titles and upcoming shows, events,
etc. I know that there was an auction held earlier this year (which
featured some Arkestra titles as well as many other jazz titles, rare and
otherwise) that was to benefit the Arkestra and the various illnesses
therein. A post to the Saturn list should yield further details...

in case anyone is going to be in the(new york) city this weekend:

an alumni of SUNYAlbany, Michael Blitz, who is now an assoc.prof at John
Jay College of Criminal Justice will be reading at Biblio's (two blocks
south of Canal St on Chruch) this Sunday at 5 pm.

Michael is one hell of a poet (pick up, scour for: _Five Days in the
Electric Chair_, or his more recent _Suction Files_, both by Woodbine
Press) and a damn fine lunatic when examined closely.

but the reading should go as all readings do, but better.

just a note to anyone who's interested,

my work.  The juxtaposed figures on totem poles may be read as tribal
history, which was the intention of the artisans who carved them.
Earlier, in talking of my efforts, I would mention 'mosaic' or 'collage';
I think the totem pole, with the narrative dynamic, is more apt."--Paul

Kristen Prevallet
Lead, Glass and Poppy
Washington DC: primitive publications, 1996

[WARNING: the Surgeon General has declared that pre-contextualization may
be hazardous to your health & literary sensibilities.]

Like Hesiod and Jimi Hendrix before her, Kristen Prevallet is fascinated
with cosmic phenomena - asteroids, UFOs, the ends of the world(s).  She
brings to these interests a penetrating critical intelligence & a multifarious
poetic talent.  In this chapbook-length short-long poem, as in her
previous work (see for example her longish poem "Mad Sarah" in Nedge #4)
she manages a balancing act which is crucial to serious poetry, in my
view: she pays full due to metaphysics and the religious sense & its
human centrality - but counterweights it with a critical awareness of
the fallibility (& tragicomic nonsense) of human mythical constructs.
What results is a "poetic mythology" which is aware of the global
predicament of the present - an historical-political-ecological
awareness - infiltrated by a need for faith and its artistic
embodiments.

But don't let reviewistic portentousness obscure the reader's sense
of the author's humor, wit & style.  Her balance of faith/irony is
mirrored in a genuine balance of style/material.  Many are the poets
on the one hand who pour out lugubrious documentary/personal rants;
many on the other who are smothered in style: meaningless sound,
arbitrary syntax, put-on artiness.  Few like Prevallet manage to
balance the logic of the theme with the form of the poem.  This
poem is structured in two columns, divided by the spine of the
pamphlet (the "spine" itself becoming a Dantesque symbol of  the
cosmic-human book of life).  On the left hand, the narrator speaks,
in a voice which modulates between the oracular & the personal/
demotic.  On the right hand, quotations, documentary evidence,
which "comment" on the text (& vice versa).  I can't replicate
this format here, but will provide a couple of excerpts.  The poem
opens as follows:

[on left side, lines flush to left margin:]

Often there is a star
comes down from the blue
and lands in the deepest part
where a heart and the flesh
that beats it out
in a trickle of daylight and ash
does conspire to hold
all flying things "sacred"
as bombs and Eros
collide with the same surface
and mark their intent
with an obliteration
elemental as fire
but not as blood-soaked-through
with disasters and near losses
not of faith but of what faith has become
now that the object of sacrifice
is not fit for the faint of heart
because it is real.

[on the right hand side:]

When Comet Hyakutake
streaked close to earth last week,
a German scientific spacecraft made a
discovery that has astonished and
puzzled astrophysicists.  The
comet was emitting X-rays
in a crescent pattern on
its sunward side. (1)

The dead, 13 adults
and 3 small children, were found
in a circle around the remains of a
campfire, laid out on the bare
ground in a sunburst pattern.(2)

[all the sources are footnoted]

This is the first page.  The poem moves into a contemplation of global/
apocalyptic reality; there is an American sense of the steep folly &
intense absurdity of religious enthusiasm yoked to an understanding of
faith as a conceptual necessity.  There is an underlining of sacrifice
and mob violence at the roots of social organization which draws perhaps
on the anthropology of Rene Girard.  The news clips & funny/weird
ritual/astronomical information give the poem a paradoxical realism.
The poem's title refers to materials in painter Anselm Kiefer's
massive "Angel of History", a sculpture-painting of a huge corroded
bomber (now in the D.C. National Gallery) which expresses a parallel
sense of apocalyptic/historical doom & pathos.  Yet the poem ends on a
note of survival-through-understanding which is the conceptual motor

                Grad Student Instructor Strike Dates Set
           Rolling Strikes Will Affect Multiple UC Campuses


        Berkeley, November 6--The executive board of the Association of
Graduate Student Employees (AGSE/UAW) today announced the dates of a
Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) strike on the Berkeley campus. The
Berkeley union will join sister unions at other UC campuses in a series of
coordinated actions across the University of California system, with GSIs
at Berkeley beginning their three-day strike on Wednesday, November 20th.
This follows a decision by The University of California, Los Angeles
administration Monday to appeal a legal decision that found teaching
assistants, readers and tutors have collective bargaining rights under
state law. In response, union leadership at UCLA announced that the week
of action would begin at their campus, with a five-day strike commencing
November 18th.

The coordinated actions will escalate throughout the week if the UC fails
to implement the recent legal decision upholding collective bargaining
rights for academic student employees.

If the UC administration does not grant recognition by 5 p.m. on November
17th, Student Association of Graduate Employees (SAGE/UAW) members at UCLA
will go on strike on November 18th. Thereafter, if the UC does not grant
recognition by 5 p.m. on November 18th, members of the Association of
Student Employees (ASE/UAW) at the University of California, San Diego will
go on strike on November 19th. And if UC does not grant recognition by 5
p.m. on November 19th, AGSE/UAW members at Berkeley will join their sister
unions with a GSI strike on the Berkeley campus (GSIs are also commonly
known as teaching assistants or TAs). Actions on other UC campuses will
also escalate pressure on the UC administration throughout the week.

AGSE/UAW has been seeking collective bargaining rights for academic
student employees (ASEs)-graduate student instructors, graduate student
researchers, readers, tutors, and acting instructors-at UC Berkeley since
1983. Thus far, Berkeley administration has extended collective bargaining
only to readers, tutors, and acting instructors. AGSE/UAW's members, along
with members of AGSE/UAW's sister-unions at Los Angeles and San Diego,
voted last spring to strike unless the UC administration granted
recognition for ASEs. Last week, following the administration's failure to
accept a settlement offer, AGSE membership voted overwhelmingly in favor of
a motion to carry out a three-day strike as part of a system-wide action.
In all, 10,000 out of 15,000 academic student employees system-wide have
signed cards indicating their desire for union representation.

A Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) judge ruled in September that
GSIs, readers, and tutors at UCLA do have collective bargaining rights.
AGSE/UAW members joined members of the other campus unions in disagreeing
with the judge's finding that the university is not required to recognize
the collective bargaining rights of research assistants. But the unions
decided to accept the judge's interpretation of the current state law and
called on the university administration to implement the decision.

The university's failure to accept this offer prompted the union's October
30th decision to set the strike length at three days. "GSIs are responsible
for 60 percent of undergraduate teaching. We don't want to cause any more
disruption than is necessary to make the administration take us seriously,"
said AGSE/UAW president Lily Khadjavi.

The UC administration has already spent millions of dollars in public funds
on its legal efforts to resist collective bargaining for academic student
employees, even though the administration acknowledges the right of most
other UC employees to bargain collectively.

Hey, I was in South Africa at a writers' festival in July, and no one there
said anything about being Tom's friend. In fact, I heard 6 writers say they
would throw him into the Atlantic if he showed his face. That's what they
said.

Don't know about the physical location, but our boy, Bill Gates, has
acquired the rights to digitize and "image" all of it. Ditto the

Tony Lopez, who was mentioned positively in that (in)famous review of
_Conductors of Chaos_ is on a shortish tour of the Canadian West &
California. He read at the University of Calgary on November 6 & the
University of Alberta on November 7. From what he said, the reading at U of
C was very good, I can testify that the reading at U of A was terrific.
There was an audience of over 40, mostly students in the poetry writing
classes, most of whom have not come across the kind of new writing Tony
represents. They listened very keenly to his reading, which was
soft-spokenly intense, rhythmically varied, & wonderfully complex in its
collage of discourses. Lopez read a number of shorter works, talked a bit
about what he does, then read one long section from his ongoing
work-in-progress, _False Memory_ (6 sections of which are published under
that title by The Figures: a book to get now). This was simply a very fine
reading, & a real eye-opener for the audience here.

Lopez will be in British Columbia for the next week or so, then in LA &
possibly at UC San Diego: if youre in the ares, check & see if you can
catch him.

Each section of _False Memory_ is made up of ten 14 line parts. Lopez seeks
to mix & match various discourses for a complex political effect. Here's
just the opening section of 'Brought Forward,' the section he read here:

This is not the time to write as if you believe
In a time of writing. Most authors view cell death
As a landmark or end point for experiments
With other goals in distantly related fields.
So I would have it, letting the grass grow over
As we wade ashore in a costume re-enactment
Of the grand colonial adventure. We call it
"First Landfall in Provincetown," after the event
Unsettled by a cautious trading statement.
Posing as messengers of an unknown nature
With all our cameras running: a repeat, a sequel,
Filming some years after _Apocalypse Now_.
The comparison between Prozac and Ecstacy
May well be misleadingand irresponsible.

Microsoft tech support would more clueless about this than usual (do they
still have live DJs on the hold lines?)  The Bettman & Adams stuff is
handled by Corbis, Gates' other company.  This one's being positioned to do
big business in digital stock photos, but for now they're losing money big
time.

I haven't looked in a while, but there's a Web site that may be useful.

As The Australian Council for the Arts has asked me to be the 'official'
coordinator of John Kinsella's upcoming tour of the US & Canada, I thought
it would be a good idea to let people on this list know about it. John
sometimes posts here, so you will know the name. He is one of the finest
younger Australian poets, with a startlingly wide range, & able to do the
job in all the kinds of poetry he writes. Lyn Hejinian wrote quite
correctly of his recent _Erratum/Frame(d)_ (in her Preface):
        It has often been remarked that John Kinsella has two bodies of work.
        His very recent volume, _The Silo: A Pastoral Symphony_ (one notes that
        its title foregrounds a musical analogy) can be cited as exemplary of a
        meditative, narrative mode of poetry, while the work collected here
        could be said to represent his interests in the 'experimental'. But the
        difference between the books is, in fact, an epistemological one -- a
        question of where what's known lies. And this, in turn, is a temporal
        question. _The Silo_ is a book of memory -- and inevitably, a book of
        landscapes, since it is in landscapes that the past is most clearly
        embodied in present forms. _Erratum/Frame(d)_ is a book of the present
        'denying its geography, blurring genre.'

I dont have the venues, except for the University of Calgary, University of
Alberta, and University of Northern British Columbia, but Kinsella will be
in Buffalo Nov 7; Burlington Nov 8-9; Boston Nov 13; Portland Nov 15;
Newark Nov 21; San Francisco Nov 23; Newark (New York?) Nov 24; Edmonton
Nov 26; Prince George Nov 28; Calgary Nov 29 (I got these dates & places
from his itinerary, so the readings in some places may be a bit tentative).
Look for announcements, & catch this fine young poet from Australia, made
possible by a grant from The Australian Council for the Arts and the
various host institutions.

Like Hesiod and Jimi Hendrix before her, Kristen Prevallet is fascinated
with cosmic phenomena - asteroids, UFOs, the ends of the world(s).  She
brings to these interests a penetrating critical intelligence & a
multifarious
poetic talent.  In this chapbook-length short-long poem, as in her
previous work (see for example her longish poem "Mad Sarah" in Nedge #4)
she manages a balancing act which is crucial to serious poetry, in my
view: she pays full due to metaphysics and the religious sense & its
human centrality - but counterweights it with a critical awareness of
the fallibility (& tragicomic nonsense) of human mythical constructs.
What results is a "poetic mythology" which is aware of the global
predicament of the present - an historical-political-ecological
awareness - infiltrated by a need for faith and its artistic
embodiments.

But don't let reviewistic portentousness obscure the reader's sense
of the author's humor, wit & style.  Her balance of faith/irony is
mirrored in a genuine balance of style/material.  Many are the poets
on the one hand who pour out lugubrious documentary/personal rants;
many on the other who are smothered in style: meaningless sound,
arbitrary syntax, put-on artiness.  Few like Prevallet manage to
balance the logic of the theme with the form of the poem.  This
poem is structured in two columns, divided by the spine of the
pamphlet (the "spine" itself becoming a Dantesque symbol of  the
cosmic-human book of life).  On the left hand, the narrator speaks,
in a voice which modulates between the oracular & the personal/
demotic.  On the right hand, quotations, documentary evidence,
which "comment" on the text (& vice versa).  I can't replicate
this format here, but will provide a couple of excerpts.  The poem
opens as follows:

[on left side, lines flush to left margin:]

Often there is a star
comes down from the blue
and lands in the deepest part
where a heart and the flesh
that beats it out
in a trickle of daylight and ash
does conspire to hold
all flying things "sacred"
as bombs and Eros
collide with the same surface
and mark their intent
with an obliteration
elemental as fire
but not as blood-soaked-through
with disasters and near losses
not of faith but of what faith has become
now that the object of sacrifice
is not fit for the faint of heart
because it is real.

[on the right hand side:]

When Comet Hyakutake
streaked close to earth last week,
a German scientific spacecraft made a
discovery that has astonished and
puzzled astrophysicists.  The
comet was emitting X-rays
in a crescent pattern on
its sunward side. (1)

The dead, 13 adults
and 3 small children, were found
in a circle around the remains of a
campfire, laid out on the bare
ground in a sunburst pattern.(2)

[all the sources are footnoted]

This is the first page.  The poem moves into a contemplation of global/
apocalyptic reality; there is an American sense of the steep folly &
intense absurdity of religious enthusiasm yoked to an understanding of
faith as a conceptual necessity.  There is an underlining of sacrifice
and mob violence at the roots of social organization which draws perhaps
on the anthropology of Rene Girard.  The news clips & funny/weird
ritual/astronomical information give the poem a paradoxical realism.
The poem's title refers to materials in painter Anselm Kiefer's
massive "Angel of History", a sculpture-painting of a huge corroded
bomber (now in the D.C. National Gallery) which expresses a parallel
sense of apocalyptic/historical doom & pathos.  Yet the poem ends on a
note of survival-through-understanding which is the conceptual motor
of the work's entirety.

All and all, this reporter is energized by the poem's combined breadth
of vision & concise, unpretentious style.  I'd like to quote more but
maybe somebody else will.  Get ahold of this little gem of an atmospheric
anomaly radar consternation.  Oh, by the way - the Martians have landed
in New Jersey.  Stay tuned.  - Henry Gould

Wow, I was just handed a copy of the October 26 New York Times article on
the Metro Days of Action, a huge political demonstration/general strike
that we had here in Metro Toronto on October 22nd to 27th.  I just had to
post because the picture in the article is of the Education Rally that I
helped organize!

The week-long series of protests against the regressive policies of
our neo-conservative provincial government, who are systematically
dismantling our social safety net, was organized by a coalition of labour
and social justice organizations, including the Canadian Federation of
Students (the lobby group I'm chairing at the moment.  Diss?  What
Diss?).  The week culminated in a city-wide shutdown on Friday Oct 25 and
a massive march and rally on October 26th.  The shutdown was highly
successful--we managed to shut down our public transit system (I'm still
recovering from the 3am picket) in spite of threats of litigation and an
injunction by the Toronto Transit Commission, as well as postal service,
garbage and other municipal services, the food terminal, the provincial
legislature and government offices and buildings.  There were several
rallies on Friday, including a large rally at the Toronto Stock Exchange
and an even larger (20,000) rally at the Ministry of Education and
Training (hosted by yours truly).  It was a really exciting day--very
festive spirit, despite the anger and frustration felt by many in this
community.  The Saturday march was incredible.  Although there are
conflicts over the numbers, well over 200,000 attended what was probably
the largest political demonstration in Canadian history.

I could go on, if you so desire.  The NY Times article is quite goofy--it
goes on about how odd it is that Canadians are standing up for
themselves.  I guess they forgot that this is the fifth in a series of
rotating general strikes in Ontario....  Yes, it was peaceful.  That's
the point.  The real violence is being committed by our provincial
government, who have decimated our health care system, slashed welfare
funding, closed women's shelters, hospitals and child care facilities,
removed access to transit for persons with disabilities, laid off
thousands of government employees, gutted labour legislation and our
employment equity legislation, cut funding to education at all levels,
hiked tuition 20%, eliminated child care bursaries for students---and
given a 30% tax cut to their privileged golfing buddies. And they are
certainly not done yet.  Environmental deregulation, privatization of our
health care and education systems, and other fun stuff is still on the
way.  This is an interesting place to live these days.  While it was
amazing to be part of such an historic protest, I certainly wish that it
didn't have to be this way.

I remember that your e-mail network was very extensive when you mailed me

information to your network and ask each person to send to their respective

    One Million Signatures in Solidarity with the Okinawan People

Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) in Japan and the Okinawa Peace and
Environmental Network (OPEN),
based in Hawaii, request your name on this petition in support of the
Okinawan People's desire for the removal
of U.S. bases in Okinawa.    As we receive the names, we will forward the
signatures to President Clinton

representatives of U.S. and Japan.

WHEREAS, the rape of a 12 year old schoolgirl on September 4, 1995,by two
U.S. marines based in Okinawa triggered the pent-up anger of Okinawans over
thousands  of crimes committed by U.S. military personnel  over the past decade;

WHEREAS, 89.89% of Okinawans wnt a reduction of U.S. military bases (Sept.
8, 1996 referendum);

WHEREAS, Okinawa was forcibly annexed by Japan in 1879 and, as a colony of
Japan, has been
hosting  a disporportionate share of U.S. military bases  in Japan (i.e.,
75% of the land which U.S. forces occupy
in Japan is on Okinawa despite the fact that Okinawa represents only 0.6% of
total land base of Japan);

WHEREAS, the recent Japan Supreme Court ruling forcing Okinawa to submit to
the government's forced lease of private land
for U.S. bases indicates that Okinawa's property rights are worthless and is
another example of Japan's mistreat-
ment of Okinawans;

WHEREAS,  Pres. Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto of Japan met in
September and talked about closing
Futenma Air Base  but only if another site can be found in Japan.  Since no
other site can be found, U.S./Japan
are now planning for an offshore heliport in Okinawa which will  further
degrade the Okinawan bay environments;

WHEREAS, Okinawa is the only place where even enemy soldiers are
commemorated in its Peace Park: 14,000 U.S. soldiers,  90,000 Japanese
soldiers; and 150,000 Okinawan civilians  (approx. l/4 of entire
population). Each name is engraved on peace walls.

THEREFORE, WE THE UNDERSIGNED, REQUEST THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES
AND JAPAN TO HONOR THE WISHES OF THE OKINAWAN PEOPLE FOR REMOVAL OF U.S.
BASES FROM ITS LAND AND SUPPORT OKINAWA BECOMING A MODEL OF ENVIRONMENTALLY
SOUND AND SELF-SUSTAINING TECHNOLOGY AND ECONOMY.

John Kinsella will also be spending Nov. 14th here at the University of
New Hampshire, giving a lecture on "Hybridity" at 12:30 p.m. and a
reading at 5:00 p.m.  The lecture will be in the Faculty Lounge of the
English Department, Hamilton Smith Hall (all are welcome), and the
reading will be in the Forum Room of Dimond Library (both buildings are
just off Main Street in Durham; heart of the campus).

If anyone on the line thinks they might make it, do let me know whether
you'd enjoy coming along for drinks and dinner after the reading; you'd
be welcome. Romana Huk (tel: 603 862 3992; fax: 603 862 3962)

Subject:      Olson stuff

Alan--

way back around 85 oor 86, when I first moved to Tucson, Steve MacCaffery
gave  a wonderful talk on Olson, for a series of talks my (once and future)
racketball pal Charles Alexander had put together.  As I recall the piece
not only looked at how Maximus wasn't all that neatly reducible to the
pronouncements of "Projective Verse," but also attended to some crucial
Olson valuations of writing (+) versus voice (-).  As I (mis?) recall, Steve
was claiming, therefore, some crucial and surprising affinities.  I remember
trying to bring up the Derrida stuff on a "good writing" which is,
basically, a transparent transcription of a good speech, or of a language of
gesture prior to (quasi-fallen) speech--I think I thought Steve was arguing
that the praise of writing in Olson was to put it baldly anti-logocentric,
and I think I was trying to suggest by contrast that there could be a praise
of writing which nevertheless amounted to a praise of voice and speech.  But
at any rate the piece was a real awakener.  Probably it's been pubished and
everyone (but me) has read the published version.  But if not maybe Steve
(hello?!?) can provide some bibliographic info and/or say more?

hellos to all mentioned (and unmentioned)!

Alan,

I hadn't thought of this when you said Olson and Language pomes, but
Tenney N's post reminded me of Joe Riddel's terrific essay, "Decentering
the Image: The 'Project' of 'American' Poetics?"  It's in Harari's Textual
Strategies.  Tough going in places, because he's weaving so many
traditions together in it, but the piece has some very useful insights
into Olson.  It's a shame Joe never did a book on Olson, because he was
great on him in class.  Here's a typical bit: "Like Pound, Olson appeals
to the archeological metaphor, but the archeologist does not presume to
recuperate presence.  Rather, in his re-search of method, he seeks that
cutting edge, the 'way' to cut a path and not some path to follow.  He
seeks the disruptive, productive tool of writing."  Looking over it, I'm
struck by how much of Riddel's poetics is stitched together here.  Odd to
say, I hear his voice in these lines.  He was always digging around like
this with his words, with a gleam in his eyes.  Well, hope that's useful,
Alan--see you in D.C.

By the way, the panel on "Poetry in the Curriculum" (Alan's other panel,
where he'll be appearing, as he said, along with Bob Perelman) also
includes Harriet Davidson (on poetry as witness) and Kevin Dettmar (on the
pedagogical uses of poetry hoaxes).  Hope to meet some of you there.

now this passage reminds me of that section of derrida's "the writing lesson,"
where he talks of the path cut thru the jungle by ITT for making telegraph
lines...that this is a form (if i read him right) of writing, as is the design
on tribal pottery that predates the arrival of the European.  of course, in
pound, olson and ITT, there is, in addition to the excitement of the pathfinder,
more than a hint of imperialism?

i hope to get to this one tho as i've sd i'll be trapped in a search committee;
i'm still trying to circulate my concept of "micropoetries" as a pedagogical

Dear Poetics List:

I thought this was interesting enough to forward from a book arts list to
this poetics list. Language history, and the history of letter forms as well
as some of their complications, may be one thing that unites these two lists.

Dear Poets,

Call for poems with "science" "theme" for posting on OMNI magazine's Web site
in January. Send your own, or turn me on to your favorites.

Sonnet-length or under (so much for the "infinite possibilities" of the
internet -- seems like 200 words and non-scrolling is the rule) --

"Science themes" include philosophical glass of water musings, hard-edged
global tectonic theories, and the answer to which way the fossil footprints
on the Bering Straits point.

Billed as a Slam, it will be non-competitive. Pay is 50 bucks. The OMNI site
is heavily trafficked; poems will be up for a month. A photo and bio will
eventually be needed.

Write Now! Deadline is Nov. 22.

Bob Holman

Subject:      Re: John Kinsella Reading in New York City

As an addition to Douglas Barbour's welcome note on John Kinsella the other
day I just wanted to remind that he will be reading with our own
Charles Bernstein at The Segue Performance Space in NYC on Sunday,
November 17.  The Segue info again on the reading is:

JOHN KINSELLA, CHARLES BERNSTEIN
Sunday, November 17th, 7:00 p.m., Suggested $5.00
The Segue Performance Space
303 East 8th Street (Betw Aves B&C)
(212) 674-0199
F train to 2nd Ave, L train to 14th and 1st, 6 train to Astor Place
Beer & Wine available for donation.

Here's a quote from a recent review of Kinsella's book Syzygy (Fremantle
Arts Centre Press).  The review is by Tim Liardet and was published
in Poetry Wales.  Syzygy is among those books collected in Kinsella's
recently released The Undertow; New and Selected Poems (ARC 1996).
Kinsella's work has been praised by such diverse sources as Lyn Hejinian
and Harold Bloom.  Here's from the Liardet review:

    "Syzygy is certainly not ordinary. It is a forty-four page opus
of strangely fragmentary individual pieces (with titles such as
'Reality'; 'Entropy/Flesh'; and 'The forest, the farm, a hybrid
bathysphere') which against all the odds come together to form a
remarkable, incoherent but cohesive whole...which begins in
closely-wrought density, gradually sheds its inner tensions in the
process of becoming broken-up and rarified, like the passage into the
ether.  This is clearly a poem -- or sequence of poems -- which
understands and seeks to encapsulate the dislocation and the
contrariety of consciousness; consciousness of itself being arbitrary
and formless.  The last four pages of the work offer as much the
white space of silence as they do the little islands of poetic
gossip.  The precise voluptuary language of the opening:

                                ...O fear ripples evading
                                sonar buoys Blue Gum Lake
                                receding as bores suck effluent
                                from beneath the arses of ducks

yields by degrees to the idiosyncratic fragments of the ending.  This
is a big poem, at times exquisitely worked, a very personal odyssey
which just manages to prevent itself from degenerating into
tricksiness in its progress towards its own denouement."

Please join us for what promises to be a great reading on the 17th,
his only New York reading.

I don't know the route, but I believe a co-sponsor of the tour is the
Western States Arts Foundation, and you might contact them in Santa Fe, or
see if jazz presenting groups in your area who might be connected to them --
and that would be probably any jazz presenting groups -- are bringing Oliver
there. The Tucson Jazz Society brought him to Tucson.

Thank you for the information. Mitchell did a tour a couple of years ago,
solo on many different reed instruments, and seeing him was an absolute
highlight of my music listening life.

Subject:      great book on the university...

those of you who are interested in (north american) 'higher' ed. and want
to read something that'll likely put a serious twist in your take on same,
check out

_the university in ruins_
by bill readings
oxford up:  1996

readings (a canadian) died in a plane crash in 1994 before his book was
published... it's one of the most fascinating -- and accurate -- analyses
of the contemporary university  i've come across... briefly, readings
describes the transformation of the university from a cultural institution
to an institution that participates in the emerging transnational corporate
structure... his is not a marxist analysis---he carefully disengages from
the customary use of terms like "ideology" and the like... his gist is that
the idea of culture was intimately tied to that of the nation-state, and
that in the demise of the latter it is futile for the university to be
criticized for not being sufficiently cultural (the critique from the
right), just as it is futile to expect the institutionalization of cultural
studies and multiculturalism to yield sufficiently radical transformation
(the platform of the left) when in fact these latter are being incorporated
into the system... where he goes as a result i won't attempt to
summarize---and i'm not suggesting the book is not without its problems,
though it's provocative as hell (and historically buttressed throughout)...
his concluding chapters deal explicitly with teaching and community...

IRAN: CONTINUED ARRESTS INSPIRE FEAR AMONG WRITERS

Continued arrests and several suspicious deaths of writers
inspire fear among writers in Iran today, reports the Writers in
Prison Committee (WiPC) of International PEN in an anniversary
action. The action marks a year after Iranian translator Ahmad
Miralai was found dead. After reportedly being detained by
security forces on 24 October 1995 and taken to a hotel for
questioning, Miralai's body was found with injection marks on it.
A half empty bottle and cigarettes near the body led to
suspicions that attempts were made to make it appear that
Miralai, who had given up drinking, had been drinking in order to
discredit him. Miralai was one of the 134 writers who signed a
petition in October 1994 calling for greater freedom of
expression. He had reportedly been called in for interrogation by
security forces at least 20 times.

Miralai is not the only writer to die in suspicious circumstances
in Iran in recent years, says WiPC, recalling that writer Ali-
Akbar Saidi Sirjani died in prison on 27 November 1994 after
being detained by agents of the Anti-Vice Department of the
Revolutionary Prosecutor's Office on 14 March 1994 in Tehran.
Similar accusations of drug and alcohol use were made against him
as well.

In recent months, the harassment of writers has increased. State
television has broadcast a programme denouncing writers in Iran
and abroad called "The Identity", which presents allegations
against writers and intellectuals. "Writers fear the programme is
preparing the ground for further arrests," says WiPC, noting that
"some writers have reportedly been approached by the security
forces and threatened that aspects of their private lives will be
exposed if they speak out about issues related to censorship." In
August, security agents interrupted a dinner at the German
cultural attache's house, where they reportedly separated Iranian
writers from the other guests and filmed them.

WiPC says, "A climate of fear reigns among writers in Iran." In
the last two months, writers have been prevented from travelling
abroad. Others were briefly detained in Tehran and taken to Evin
prison after a meeting to discuss the re-formation of a writers'
association. The writers "were reportedly warned not to hold
further meetings or publish the writers' association charter."
Iranian authorities have banned the books of Iranian writers
living abroad and their publishers have reportedly been
threatened.

Subject:      San Francisco Events this week that I know about

This is Kevin Killian.  Hi everyone.  Hope you're in San Francisco this
week.  Let me tell you about some events I know about here this week.
=46irst of course I hope you can come to *my* reading, it'll be great, at
Modern Times Bookstore on Thursday at 7:30.  Modern Times is at 888
Valencia Street.  I'm reading with Linda Smukler who's here from upstate
New York reading from her new book "Home in Three Days.  Don't Wash" (Hard
Press).  Hooray for Linda and too bad for me, *my* book was supposed to be
ready by now but it's been delayed a week or so.  More about this *epochal*
event later when I have the book in my hands.  Okay, so, see you on
Thursday!

On Friday you already know about the "Premonitions" event at Small Press
Traffic at 7:30 at New College (777 Valencia).   You already know that
Walter K. Lew. the editor of "Premonitions" will be here, together with Bay
Area contributors Myung Mi Kim, Celine Salazar Parrenas and Ronald Tanaka.
But luckily a 4th contributor has stepped forward to add to the lineup:
Oakland's Patricia Ikeda-Nash, author of the now out-of-print volume of
poems _House of Wood, House of Salt_ and other wonderful works, such as the
"Zen Laundry" excerpt from her memoir-in-progress about life in Korean
Buddhist monasteries, published in _Muae 1_.  So don't miss this reading!

Then on Sunday, November 17th, the long awaited "Queer Beats Conference"
takes place at the Lecture Hall of the San Francisco Art Institute.  This
conference was organized by Bruce Boone, Bob Gluck, Jonathan Katz, Aaron
Shurin and . . . me!
It's presented by the Harvey Milk Institute in conjunction with several
other co-sponsors, including the Poetry Center at SF State.  It's an
all-day conference from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  Here's the phone number
for more information (415) 552-7200.  But I can give you a rundown of what
to expect, oh, and it costs $15-$20.  10:30 a.m., introductory remarks by
Jonathan Katz.  Then "Beat Erotics" panel moderated by Aaron Shurin, with
Bruce Boone, Earl Jackson, Jr., Lenore Kandel and Steve Silberman.
12:30--1:30 lunch.  Then at 1:30 another panel, I think it's called "Queer
Identity" with Michael Davidson, Mark Ewert and Ricardo Ortiz, moderated by
. . . me!  Then at 3:00 p.m. "Beat Circles" panel with Maria Damon, Harold
Norse and Scott Watson, moderated by Bob Gluck.  I don't have the synopses
of these talks in front of me but I remember some of them...  Steve
Silberman (yes, the famous authority on Jerry Garcia and the Dead) will be
speaking about Philip Whalen and his first book of poetry, published
quickly, then suppressed due to its high homoerotic quotient.  Bruce Boone
will be talking about dirt.  Lenore Kandel will be making a rare appearance
I think to talk about the censorship of her book "The Love Book" and I hope
to talk about making "Lucifer Rising" with Kenneth Anger.  She is fantastic
and a living legend and hardly ever seen, ever!  I don't know what Earl's
talking about but he teaches at UC Santa Cruz and has written a great book
"Strategies of Deviance: Studies in Gay Male Representation."  He and Bruce
are the high theory guys on THAT panel.  On the second panel Michael
Davidson will speak on . . . . ???  I forget!  But I'm sure it's something
brilliant about the Cold War.  Mark Ewert, a young writer and filmmaker,
will speak about his intimate relations with octogenarian William S.
Burroughs.  Ricardo Ortiz will discuss John Rechy and why/how he was
systematically excluded from cultural histories of the Beat movement.  The
final panel stars our own Maria Damon from the poetics list=8Bshe will talk
about Bob Kaufman and gay influence, etc., I think; Harold Norse, another
living legend from the original Beat Circles of New York, Tangier, Paris
and London; and Scott Watson, a curator from UBC who will present slides of
paintings and other graphic work created by 50's/60's artists whom, for one
reason or another, mostly homophobic ones, were excluded from the Whitney's
"Beat Culture and the New America" show now playing in San Francisco . . .
Charming event.  Hope to see you all on Thursday, Friday and Sunday.  More
later and excuse the long bandwidth of this message... or is it wide
bandwidth?

Subject:      Ear Inn Reading Report Nov 9

Drew Gardner band was fast and furious fri night at knitting factory
downstairs get ready it's called the Alterknit.  Dug is mad at the knitting
factory because they charge seven dollars to some even late into the set.
 Trio of boys bass drum high sax they're all on brain pep i think.  A good
round of poets in the audience too:  Julie Patton, Andy Levy, Leonard
Schwatz, Heather Ramsdell, Garrett Kalleberg, Dan Farrell come to sophies bar
with us, Prageeta Sharma, Daria, Lee Ann Brown, Daria tells about channeling
energy up & down spine chi gong joon bong shows Lee Ann top of head spot,
Marlene Hennesey, Marcy, Shari, EleniS & Laird Hunt.  Steve Dalchinsky whom
dug says he sees EVERY time he is at a jazz or new music event slips in &
out.  At end of set we ask for more and knitting factory man says a short
one.  The Drew Gardner band does a short one.  we go back to sophies in car
and talk about sex.  i recite basting my lover poem and marlene is grossed
out by basting.  couldn't you make that a little more poetic?  dug says it
doesn't get any more poetic.

dug & marlene and i sit on ledge in front window of sophies.  dug distraught
about love & psychoanalysis.  puts cigarette in mouth so points straight down
talks like his dad.  Douglas, the best thing I ever did was marry your
mother.  dug then goes on & on about mom, never anything good enough for her.
 he was ignored and reprimanded for sweeping the porch wrong.  claims now he
wants to fail and but he's even a failure at failing.  we talk about juliana
spahr's new book response.  reading response is like watching ophra on
ecstasy with the shrink you've always wanted.  i tell story of how
recognizing boy in car of myself.  went for a drive to the beach with my
black doggie but stop at gary's first to smoke some pot.  leave black doggie
in car.  black doggie very unhappy left alone in car.  o i left in car by dad
going to bar.  i have car dreams driving backward very fast while i in back.
 i cry & go to beach with black doggie.  i say from reading juliana's book i
learn why i obsessed with cars.

This is good I think because I have to go into Rob Fitterman's class on Wed
to talk about poetry.  I'll read Creeley i know a man, my trip to nyc &
stress dug's car poem & and talk about cars and family early on in peoples'
lives.  then leaving family and getting new family of poets.  car carries
over cause we journey.

Next day is saturday, ear day, and I have placed two tapes inside jacket so I
don't forget.  Dug calls and wants me to pick him up on the service road just
before Brooklyn Bridge.  I not ready and always have to wait for dug so Dug
buzz me.  He buzzes, I hop out of shower and he comes up.  He opens windows
because he's hot.  It's freezing I say.

Drive to ear over Brooklyn Bridge and down FDR around the horn of lower
manhattan, best way to west side.  On way up West Street I tell dug last week
during the construction I see a diamond sign that says People Working.  He
thinks that's weird.  People are still working but People Working sign is
not.

At ear folks are there.  I setup tape recorder and mic and James Sherry is
having a discussion with George about speakers in the bar room.  They haven't
been working in bar room or George doesn't want them to be working in bar
room.  I tell James it's not an issue.  I like only having speakers on in
back room then people who don't want to hear poetry can sit in bar room and
won't have to talk loud over speakers if they working.  James writes Call
Martin in orange crayon on his paper table cloth.  James wants to know what
happens if big crowd comes.  I say that not an issue for my series.

Sitting in the back room are Jordan Davis, Stephen Malmude, Ange Mlinko,
Edwin Torres, Larry Fagin, Lee Ann Brown, Dan Luft, Mary Ann Vitale, Drew
Gardner, David Cameron, Douglass Rothschild, Joe Elliot, Brenda Coultas, Dan
& Elizabeth the couple who come to every reading but no one knows who they
are he has big mustache she writes poems.  i ask her if she likes her poems
and she says some of them make her happy.  Chris Stroffolino comes in tells
me how to introduce Ange (with Mick Jagger song) and talks about the trials
of getting his review essay of Moxley's new book published too long for a
review too short for an essay.  Others sit too.  Jordan shows me 100 NZ poems
and opens to Wynstan Curnow.  A good poem in there and Jordan says Wynstan is
60.  Laura Ranger tho is the best selling poet in NZ and she 8.

James is eager to start and I give Ange the 5 sign.  She is introduced, I
have taken Chris' advice and Lairball is agitated.  She reads with passion
and good poems take us over.  We hear words from Immediate Orgy & Audit her
Lift chapbook and Mass Ave Dan Bouchard's mag.  She reads Lush Life and I
can't remember where that's been published.  I want to see it in print so I
don't have to transcribe and screw up the line breaks.

Some arms do never fully close
like u turns to full stops
seem reckless personalities and branch endlessly
out like bell twirlers stroking shoulder straps
dropped like dreck beside the coffee stirrer.
Such a beat to the past tangles tonite's drummer
to touch there a handrail a danger. . . .
. . .
To not just be girls
under treaty like others we know
but sisters with secrets
under the cover.


Ange also reads a new poem called Driving with You:

This is such a lovely place to be
the blind spot of a truck
a cup tipped against your face
as you eat the ice loudly
where bridges mixed with the angel
wings of crossed fingers
built under supervision of children
from gifted classes
and always in life I hear
the woosh in my side
a door ajar at great speeds
more lemonade please . . .

Ange reads lots of good ones.  Pop Song is wow as is City Story as is this
she says it's from the chapbook.

YOU DRINK from the window the liquor's transparent
I don't take exception to a garbage truck on garbage day
Just tell me how I should pay you
to slide in, to funnel up, to light the torch
or ring the bell among the clockworks
Drink your tea & don't get high like an organ
Yes I finish the pot
because each successive cup's steeped deeper
lest I pour myself out
my reincarnation at age 25 will not be replete
with all the wisdom available to be troubled
None of the passersby am I or are me
all marriages dissolved today by decree
is my lion's rage at slow entropy.

Some fragrant steak cooks in my presence
It's Arabic here
were they to insist I wear a veil
it would be a dream should I agree

There is a short break and I inventory the people & collect three dollars
from each.  A guy is at the bar with some friends and I ask if he's here for
the reading.  Not really, he's here to meet some friends.  Are you John Byrum
I say.  He's John Byrum he says.

James again gives the signal to start and I give Edwin the 2 sign.  At the
mic I give announcements and then yell at John Byrum.  John Byrum I say give
me a potato!  John Byrum I want a potato!  Edwin reads very well with a lot
of performatives.  I've forgotten how sexy he is.  His fingers are very long
and they move like octopus tentacles as he rustles thru pages between poems.
 He reads A Fairy Tale for IE.

Wherein O

be come popular
like sticky skinny letters are
thingy letters be all the rage now
O the rage now
wishes it weren't so round
so large

Be happy where you O

Edwin likes it that we like his poems.  He reads the one about the comet
whose name he has trouble saying and I spelling.

Kahoutek

Kahoutek, I can barely pronounce you I love you.
What are you but some comet streaking the sky every 80 years driving us crazy
with apprehension.
Gonna see you gonna miss you too dark wrong position.
I love you and all your confusion
more confusing than any lover maybe
not.  What are you but some crazy streak
flashing in and out of my heart.
You never call me you never see me you big beautiful ball of fire.
You drive me crazy coming then going.
I wish we were together so I could break up with you.
I wish we were
but I can't wait that long.


There are so many good ones from Edwin because he can speak and command an
audience like Jackson.

The Begin of Maybe

Where does

After the reading I say come next week for Drew Gardner & Chuck Stein.  James
says nice combo.  I shut down the system and give the poets their cab fares.
 Edwin sells all his Lung Poetry & I hear things people haven't really said
chapbooks.  We go to brothers.  Jordan comes in and tells Larry to behave
himself.  Douglass comes in and says he's been talking to John Byrum about
post modernism for two hours.  Ange plays with her wedding ring and it falls
off.  She goes under the table to get it.

We go to Puffys and talk about blow job poems.  Lee Ann tells us about snow
cones.  I bet the ice melts pretty fast.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This is an important letter I have been asked to pass on, written by the
administrators of the listservs at SUNY-Buffalo:


Dear List Subscriber,

   We hope you are aware that we are in the process of migrating our
   IBM-based LISTSERV lists (@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu) to our new Unix-based
   LISTSERV machine (@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu).

   We have been testing this and making plans for quite a while now
   so that this migration will be as painless as possible and
   transparent for you and us.

   So, what does this mean to you?

   1)  The address for your list will change from
           poetics@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
       to
           poetics@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

   2)  The address for sending list maintenance commands (sub, unsub,
       index, review, set, etc.) will change from
           listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
       to
           listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

   3)  You may only interact with listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu
       via email.  So, if you have been using an interactive command to
       interact with listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu (such as: SENDFILE,
       TELL, LSVPUT, SEND, SEND/FILE, etc.), you will now have to send
       all commands in the body of an email message.  My online List
       User documents already use the email interface in the examples
       (http://writing.upenn.edu/computing/listserv/user/).


****

ALSO NOTE: questions about the list should now be sent to
poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu (not poetics@ubvms as before).

Hey Bill,
       So great to get mentioned in despatches, but tell Jordan he's
exaggerated my age somewhat, I'm only 57 (only 57!) and not a grey hair
and the name's Wystan not Wynstan ( Capilano Review made the same
mistake) but I'm glad your liked the pome. It's true what they say about
Laura's being the best-selling poet, and it has to be said we are very
supportive of young talent in this country ( most poets' sales peak
around age 10)  but you grow out of selling your stuff--I believe I've
given away more books than she has.
      Last time I was at the Ear it was to hear Kathleen Fraser and
Corine Robbins. Nancy Spero was there in the audience, also Charles and
Susan, Nick ( Piombino ), Jackson , and James. I can't remember any of
the lines. Afterwards we went to SoHo (Greene St), maybe Corine's loft
for some food. It was wet and I was jet lagged.
      Best,
        Wystan

I may be mistaken, not being an e-mail expert, but it looks to me like the
date that the poetics address was changing over was not listed for people

Dear Friends, Forgive the mass mailing, but I am wondering
if you have any clues on the poem below, or know of any
newsgroups where I might post this question? I'd be most
grateful for any ideas you might have about it, or whom to
ask about it.

Thanks, Dick

I am trying to find the original of the poem below, which
I give in a translation from Russian. The Russian poet,
Aleksey Pleshcheev, produced this text in 1877
"from the English, by an anonymous poet".
Tchaikovsky used Pleshcheev's text for his song
called "Legend", opus 54 no 5. I am collecting
and translating all Tchaikovsky's songs, and would
like to find the English original if possible. It has
never been identified by Russian scholars. Here
is a plain translation of the Russian text:

The Christ-child had a garden,
He grew many roses in it;
Thrice a day he watered them
To weave a garland of roses for himself.

And when the roses bloomed,
He summoned the Hebrew children;
They each picked a flower
And the garden was left bare.

Q"How wilt thou weave a garland now?
The roses in thy garden are all gone!"
Q"Don't forget,"QChrist answered themQ
"The thorns are all still left for me."

And  so they wove him
A prickly garland from the thorns,
And drops of blood, instead of roses,
Adorned his head.

***
Has anyone ever seen anything like this in
English Q or Scottish Q hymnals, or popular
collections of religious verse, perhaps
for children?

I would be grateful for any help on this.

P. S. The Q letter in the text of the poem
is a goof. This is an "em-dash", a long dash,
which doesn't print in the e-mail set of 128
characters. Sorry.

This story from the bourgeois press does not, naturally,
suggest how to do away with this exploitation of children. That's up to us!

The Saskatoon StarPhoenix     November 12, 1996

250 MILLION CHILDREN IN LABOR FORCE: ILO

GENEVA (AP) - From the brothels of Asia to the carpet factories of
Pakistan, nearly twice as many children are working full time in developing
countries as previously thought, the International Labor Organization said
Monday.

The latest calculations from the UN labor agency show that 250 million
five-to-14-year-olds are employed, half of them full time. That's up
sharply from earlier estimates of 73 million full-time child workers.

The new figures come after in-depth surveys and interviews in numerous
countries. Previous estimates were based almost solely on official
statistics.

The ILO report found nearly 153 million children are working in Asia, 80
million in Africa and 17.5 million in Latin America. It called for a new
international accord banning the harshest forms of child labor: slavery,
prostitution and work in hazardous industries.

Only 49 UN members ratified a 1976 child labor convention. Some nations
said its limits on paid work were too broad.

ILO Director General Michel Hansenne said child labor only perpetuates an
endless cycle of illiteracy and poverty.

"We all know that . . . many efforts over the years will be required to
eliminate it completely," he said. "But there are some forms which are
intolerable by any standard. These deserve to be identified, exposed and
eradicated without further delay."

Slavery or child bondage still is practised in South Asia, Southeast Asia
and West Africa, the report said. Children are either sold outright or
rural families are paid in advance by "contractors" who take children away
to work in carpet weaving, glass manufacturing or prostitution.

Child trafficking for the sex industry is increasing despite better

This story from the bourgeois press does not, naturally,
suggest how to do away with this exploitation of children. That's up to us!

The Saskatoon StarPhoenix     November 12, 1996

250 MILLION CHILDREN IN LABOR FORCE: ILO

GENEVA (AP) - From the brothels of Asia to the carpet factories of
Pakistan, nearly twice as many children are working full time in developing
countries as previously thought, the International Labor Organization said
Monday.

The latest calculations from the UN labor agency show that 250 million
five-to-14-year-olds are employed, half of them full time. That's up
sharply from earlier estimates of 73 million full-time child workers.

The new figures come after in-depth surveys and interviews in numerous
countries. Previous estimates were based almost solely on official
statistics.

The ILO report found nearly 153 million children are working in Asia, 80
million in Africa and 17.5 million in Latin America. It called for a new
international accord banning the harshest forms of child labor: slavery,
prostitution and work in hazardous industries.

Only 49 UN members ratified a 1976 child labor convention. Some nations
said its limits on paid work were too broad.

ILO Director General Michel Hansenne said child labor only perpetuates an
endless cycle of illiteracy and poverty.

"We all know that . . . many efforts over the years will be required to
eliminate it completely," he said. "But there are some forms which are
intolerable by any standard. These deserve to be identified, exposed and
eradicated without further delay."

Slavery or child bondage still is practised in South Asia, Southeast Asia
and West Africa, the report said. Children are either sold outright or
rural families are paid in advance by "contractors" who take children away
to work in carpet weaving, glass manufacturing or prostitution.

Child trafficking for the sex industry is increasing despite better
international awareness of the problem, the ILO said.

In Asia, child prostitutes number about one million and rising, the report
said. Numbers also are increasing in Burkina Faso, the Ivory Coast, Ghana,
Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

It identified international sex networks that take Latin American children
to Europe and the Middle East, and Southern Asian children to northern
Europe and the Middle East. Child sex markets also were well established in
West Africa, Europe and the Arab world, it said.

Among other things, the ILO found that:

?    Certain industries are exposing their child workers to pesticide
poisoning, lung diseases or even crippling their growing bodies by forcing
them to carry heavy weights.

?    In Sri Lanka, more children die from pesticide poisoning than from a
combination of other childhood diseases such as malaria, tetanus and
whooping cough.

?    Children are exposed to dust and fumes in repair shops, woodwork
factories and construction sites in Egypt, the Philippines and Turkey.

?    In glass factories, children are often forced to drag loads of molten
glass from glowing furnaces amid noise levels that could cause deafness.
Children as young as three were working in match factories where they were
exposed to dust, asbestos and other hazardous fumes.

?    Up to five million child domestic servants work in Indonesia,
including 400,000 in the capital, Jakarta.

NEW FOREIGN POLICY CREDO: BE PREPARED

                                          By Kim Holmes
                                      The Heritage Foundation
                                         October 24, 1996

        The 1996 election campaign has been conspicuously quiet on
foreign policy. Both major presidential candidates, catering
to a post-Cold War public glad to be rid of the constant nuclear threat
from the Soviet Union, have avoided the subject,
thinking they were following the prudent political course.

        I disagree: Leadership requires more than merely reflecting the
momentary concerns of the electorate. It requires not just
talking about what people say they are concerned about, but also pointing
out what they ought to be concerned about. And
they ought to be concerned about foreign policy.

        The truth is that the United States is handling foreign policy
challenges like Iraq, Bosnia, North Korea and Haiti on an ad
hoc basis -- without adequate contingency plans already in place when
trouble strikes. What this means is that it is only a
matter of time before America is caught unprepared and becomes
unnecessarily involved in another war or some other
international crisis.

        In the post-Cold War era, the United States has failed to set
clear and meaningful criteria for action, stick to those
criteria, and effectively communicate them to friends and enemies alike
so other nations can predict how we will respond in a
given situation. Without such guidelines, friends are left not knowing
whether they can count on us, enemies are encouraged to
test the waters to see what they can get away with, and our military is
involved in matters best handled by other countries or by
international social workers.

        The White House should be formulating its plans for dealing with
possible foreign policy crises now -- based on a clear
understanding of U.S. interests and capabilities to shape events -- not
after events start spinning out of control. Here is a
"top-10 list," if you will, of worst-case foreign-policy scenarios the
White House should be prepared to deal with should they
arise, arranged in order from least to most likely:

             Scenario #10    Civil war in Russia divides control of
Russia's nuclear forces between various political and military factions.
Based on false information that the United States is about to intervene
militarily, a rogue commander authorizes a nuclear attack on the United
States or U.S. forces in Europe. Unlikely, to be sure, but not
impossible;

             Scenario #9    Next year, China decides to turn up the heat
on Taiwan by establishing a naval blockade of that island nation or
threatening a ballistic missile attack;

             Scenario #8    Iran tries to close down the Strait of Hormuz
in the Persian Gulf, bottling up some 20 percent of the world's oil
supplies,
or helps topple the monarchy in Saudi Arabia;

             Scenario #7    An Iraqi-backed terrorist group attacks U.S.
troops in Kuwait with biological weapons -- anthrax spores, for example
--
killing hundreds of American soldiers. However, no one takes credit and
no
one is sure who did it;

             Scenario #6    Russia threatens the Baltic states -- Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia -- with military action in response to NATO's
decision
to include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in the alliance;

             Scenario #5    Boris Yeltsin dies and new Russian elections
result in the rise of an unpredictable, anti-Western president like
Alexander
Lebed. Or Yeltsin doesn't die, but becomes incapacitated, setting off a
dangerous succession struggle in the Kremlin that destabilizes
Russia;

             Scenario #4    Saddam Hussein shoots down a U.S. plane in
the newly expanded no-fly zone in Northern Iraq and takes its pilot
hostage;

             Scenario #3    North Korea decides to go down fighting,
invades the South, overruns most of the 37,000 U.S. troops along the
demilitarized zone, and reduces most of Seoul to rubble;

             Scenario #2    China decides to crack down on Hong Kong next
year after the former British colony reverts to Beijing's rule;

             Scenario #1    U.S. troops stay in Bosnia past the promised
December deadline for withdrawal, and dissatisfied groups decide to eject
the Americans by force, or radical Moslem terrorists launch attacks on
remaining U.S. troops.

       Does the administration have contingency plans in place should any
of the above scenarios arise? To judge from its conduct so far on the
world
stage, it is highly improbable.

        No administration, Republican or Democrat, should operate in the
foreign policy arena without clearly understanding how
America's interests would best be served in such crisis scenarios. Unless
U.S. policy-makers are prepared to act with
determined vision in the post-Cold War world, they place America at risk.

before that unless you like the cheap seats (which are just as free as the
others).

off the top of my head, i don't know what bravura means, but i'm sure both
readings will be a hoot.

Thanks, Aldon. So do I.

Actually, now that I've found the archives, I also find I don't need them.
Didn't realize they were strictly a photo archive. BTW: they now answer the
phone as "Corbis-Bettman."

The project I'm working on is the one I mentioned to you: the TriStar film
about Matthew Henson & Robert Peary. The writer, Robert Schenkkan, has given
me a list of incidents in Henson's life to corroborate. There's some problem
in obtaining the rights to a book and TriStar is trying an end run. The
owner of the rights, I'm told, is a real eccentric - some kind of Luddite
who insists on signing for Fedex packages by dipping his cat's paw in ink. A
job for ASPCA? Anyway, negotiations, as they say, are stalled.

Would you happen to know if Howard has any kind of archival material on
Henson? Or would anyone else out there? I know this ain't exactly Poetics,
but I'm stuck and would appreciate any leads. Backchannel, by all means. I
don't want to clutter the List with my lostness.

Tell your prof pal to contact Igor Satanowski and Inna Mattei of
_Koja_. Both are Russian editors and translators who specialize in
Russian poetry. You can reach Igor at the following address:
Isat@aol.com. As for Inna, I'll her address by tomorrow.

KOJA

All the best,

Rob Hardin

PS: Their inaugural issue contains work by Eileen Myles, Richard
Kostelanetz, Raymond Federman, and several new Russian poets of whom
I've never heard. The emphasis is on language play; Inna in particular

Bob Grumman in the recent Poetics Briefs refers to "infra-verbal" poetry

I forgot to mention in my last post that I also need permission to quote

Can anyone assist with this?

Please post.

Despite the much celebrated emergence of postcolonial studies and the curre=
nt academic interest in colonialism and culture, the cultural and colonial =
contours of the contemporary United States remain understudied.  Indeed, po=
stcolonial theory is largely Eurocentric and as a result has neglected colo=
nialism and culture in the United States.  At the same time, recent efforts=
 to push discussions of empire and everyday life in American culture beyond=
 the analyses afforded by cultural imperialism and internal colonialism hav=
e had an overly historical cast, denying in effect the continuing imprint o=
f imperial idioms in the contemporary United States.  In an effort to explo=
re the ways in which (post)coloniality clarifies and problematizes, legitim=
ates and undermines intersects and articulates with sociocultural formation=
s in the United States, I have initiated an edited collection on postcoloni=
al America.  I have received an advance contract, but hope before it goes t=
o press to enhance it.  The volume addresses postcoloniality and/in America=
n culture by studying the material conditions, discursive formations, socia=
l relations, and cultural patterns of the United States.  Although individu=
al contributions to the volume do not speak with one voice, they all proble=
matize common understandings of postcolonialism and America by using postco=
lonial theory to make sense of and reinterpret aspects of American empire a=
nd/or using aspects of American empire to make sense of and reinterpret pos=
tcolonial theory.  The contributors share, moreover, in a common project to=
 decenter dominant understandings of 'the American experience'. =20
I am seeking papers of 20-30 pages which address postcolonialism and/in Ame=
rican culture.  These should be original works, unpublished elsewhere.  Imp=
ortantly, the schedule for revisions is tight, as the manuscript needs to b=
e returned to the publisher in late spring.  The substantive focus of prosp=
ective papers is open, but pieces using examining the identities, experienc=
es, and/or imaginaries of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and =
EuroAmericans in light of postcolonial theories and themes or rethinking th=
e meaning of American empire in transnational terms are especially welcome.=
  Similarly, the theoretical perspectives of prospective contributors is no=
t predetermined; current frameworks include postcolonial, poststructural, n=
eo-marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist, and interpretive.  I would be happy t=
o corespond with interest scholars via email.

unless Bob is having us on, "infraverbal" could not refer to spoken word
-- like infrared or infrahuman, this should be some sort of poetics that
takes place below (or possibly? within) the verbal --

but it might just be infradig -- will wait to see what Bob says about it

Brakhage would ordinarily be contacted at the Film Studies Department of
the University of Colorado at Boulder -- He's on leave this semester due
to illness, but still gets his mail -- If you backchannel me with your
phone number, I'll pass it on to him -- (Maybe you should indicate what
you want to reach him about, so I can tell him?)

He appears to be in pretty good shape now, and is still meeting with his
Sunday night film forum here in Boulder --

(By the way, folks, a few of his films are available on video from Mystic
Fire at pretty good rates)

Bob has, for many years, been evolving an extensive neologistic taxonomy
for dealing w/ "otherstream" (qwertzblatz & co.) poetries...  this frm his
"Lexicon Grummaniacal", circa 1989:

     infra-verbal [is that] poetry in which the main events happen below
     the level of words, usually in the words' spelling...  there are four
     kinds: fissional (words chopped up to increase expressiveness, e.g.,
     Kempton's "just ice" or Kostelanetz's "the rapist"); fusional where
     words are joined to increase expressiveness (as in my own "nigthmarriage");
     microherent, or minimally coherent--fragments of words used for
     poetic effect--see much of Basinski; alphaconceptual where what is done
     inside a word is "equaphorically" highly significant--e.g., the placement
     of an extra silent "gh" in Saroyan's "lighght"....

this may have been revised since then...

If I understand Bob Grumman correctly (and I'm not suggesting that I do)
he's talking about a sort of post-cummings play of the signifier. Some
older examples would be Aram Saroyan's "eyeye" or the page with the word
"crickets" printed in a column past the margins to the top and bottom edges
of the page. Bob's piece "A New Poetry Anew" was printed in Teachers &
Writers Magazine a year or two ago, and at that point he was referring to
this kind of work as 'burstnorm' poetry. But as I say, I may not be getting
it, and Bob may be talking about something other than 'burstnorm' when he
talks about the 'infra-verbal'.

Michael has asked me to remind UK based members of this list that he
will be reading at Sub Voicive on 19 Nov (day of the Universities '
strike) at 8pm. Further details can be had by ringing 0181 251 2204.
I haven't got the address of the venue with me at the moment.
  On 22nd Nov he will be giving a seminar at Durham University. He
was here at Warwick on Tuesday, and though we could only arouse a
small audience for him he gave an excellent paper followed by a
brief reading. Those that came were glad to have arisen.

 Bill's noticed by now how we in NZ (read Aotearoa) are
 very family-like & on accurate first name terms. Hence
 Laura counts among us. And then, probably in the same
 100 NZ poems, is Wystan's dad, Allen. Actually he is
 among us the most reputed--some have said about the best
 living poet in English. A further of his Collecteds is
 due out soon. Bill, welcome on stepping into the family.

Subject:      infra-verbality

Thanks to all for infra-verbal info.  Sounds very funnygawackian.  Actually
it sounds a lot like Part III of my lung poem "White City", long in
Rhody samizdat.  Here's an excerpt from #96:

Well they garnered in the parch so mulch pigmeat
Corn that is that cornets unpenned Hen's blightless
Main dome.  Wasn't that a mirror, Rory?  Me?  Mores
Like a miraculosis than a mellow dram o'soul feet.
Ida never Ken wiz border yon boodle war, Maurice--
Maisie!  A miletown above the raypoint--no less!

All afore that gale on the balecorny ain't it?
She was hingled on some apocaloosa cardeacon
For a straight O-sphere thanksgiviver lovewar--
I reckon on your birdday, year; now the 4-corner
Liber tiehatcoateoteaparty's card's gamin again
Lovegonedolorosa excruises inner tuba gyrocockpit.

These distortions are sort of produced crypto-geometrically by allusions
to previous (& more conventional) sections of the poem.  One thing
I found interesting was that a STORY began to grow on its own out of
this kind of chaotic chance process.  "White City" became a weird narrative
poem in the last 15% based on chance-geometrical allusions.
My apologies for all this self-referentiality, people.- Henry Gould

Subject:      there was an excavation in Providence

Poet/translator Armand Schwerner spoke & read here last night, invited by
a comp. lit. class at Brown.  The event was part lecture part reading &
took place in the lead-cum-aluminum varnish colored stadium seating of
the unheated engineering building.  Poet/translator Edwin Honig & RI
poet fella Stuart Blazer were there alsaho.  Schwerner, garbed in a black
raincoat (like a negative lab coat) briefly outlined his writing beginnings
as a 9-yr old french-speaking emigre to U.S. & resultant anxiety/fascination
with translation & "native" speech.  Overhead was a majestic chart of the
periodic table; on the blackboard some barely legible/effaced equations
[Density Jupiter = *(&^T*( MU / 144 ], along with some moonray fluorescent
lighting.
Some enjoyable versions of Inuit & other Native American lyrics followed;
a pantoum; & readings from The Tablets, the author's intriguing sci-fi
scholarly transcription/excavation of a mythical ancient Near Eastern
culture.  Not having read this work beforehand I can't comment much but
Schwerner seems to have developed a long "poem" which makes good reading
 - have dived with relish with a mixture of Ecclesiastes & comic
book to re-create an imaginary clay summer in Sumeria where flesh & blood
combat the vast dry mummified desserts of history & clues are erased
("untranslateable") beneath the ziggurat of Ancient Blah.  & the
suspense mounts as the translator of ancient unreal texts tips
time into a hat of archaic shamanisms & the periodic table suddenly
manifests a 113th element : @~~++??PTAH -   [[eeeeeeeee....!!!]]

Does anyone know when Schwerner's translation of the Inferno will be published?
His reading from it at the NPF Orono event last June is still with me.  The
Tablets were a great way to clear the way for that descent in the maelstrom
of the vernacular.  Looking forward to it again.

Henry Gould asks what Bob Grumman is referring to by the
word"infra-verbal poetry"  in a PB article. Since I don't have my
grumman books in front of me, I cnan't tell you exactly.

I can,however, tell you that Grumman is one of the quirkiest thinkers
on the poetry scene today.  He reels out idiosyncratic taxonomies at an
astounding rate that are, for me, both humorous and strangely
compelling.

His major project is a book entitled OF MANYWHERE AT ONCE and is
available from Grumman's own Runaway Spoon Press.  I don't have the
address, perhaps someone else does.  You can probably also get it from
Books in Print or from an old PB.

Worth checking out.  But be ready for a wildly peculiar, yet ever so
carefully argued, take on poetry.

Jeff, for you and EB



Wasted in Epiphany


from "La Morte Amoreuse" by Theophile Gautier




You want to know, dear friend, if I ve had a love life? The
answer ... is yes. A marking, harrowing episode; although
I m sixty-six, it still feels a fearsomely present ember of
memory I hardly bear to breathe near. I will not withhold
anything from you; however, I would not so strive to relate
this for any soul less wise. This is an experience so heady
that it s almost incredible to acknowledge one had it. I, I
was the mark for a stunning , mephistophelean stitch-up. Me,
a modest country-priest, I dreamed taking on night after
night (and would to God that this had been only what I
dreamed!) a life of the fallen, a life of the backstreets
and Sardanaplus. my fleeting eyes too minded towards
dalliance flitted at bodies thinking to bring on the wreck
of my soul; however, in the end, with the intercession of
God and my particular patron saint, I fluked an exorcism of
the evil spirit that had been impairing me. My being had
been infiltrated by a night being not the same at all. Sun
up, being the Lord s official, untouchable, busily praying
and on the sacral businesses; sun down, starting from when
my peepers had sealed, becoming  a young lordship, top
expert in flirtation, in hounds and in horses, scattering
dice, quenching and, worse, cursing; and, as I would be
coming to at the tickle of dawn, things would always seem so
contrariwise, that I was sleeping and I must have been
dreaming to think I d ever been a priest. From my sleepwalk
came recall-bulletins of matters and mutters which I COULD
NOT SHUT OUT - albeit I never once had actually sortied
beyond the four walls of a priest s house, one would
conclude after hearing me now: that here is one sour of
obvious lifelong indulgences who, after which  begone  days,
is taking late orders in order to come to a stop nestling in
God s cleavage; not a threadbare trainee cleric who  has
wizened in a poky parish deep in woods and not in the
slightest contact with any of the workings of this century.

The answer is yes: I have had a love life, like nobody on
earth has had a love-life, out of a ruthless furies  love so
violent that I am awe-struck my put-upon heart did not
shatter. Ah, these nights, these nights!

PAUSE

Starting from tenderest babyhood, I had experienced my
calling to the order of priest; such that all my energies
were channelled in that direction and my whole life, till
twenty-four years of age, stood but as a long noviciate. The
theology done, I passed consecutively all the minor orders,
and my masters determined me up, regardless of my extreme
youth, to the final and unmistakable graduation. The day of
my ordination was set for that Easter week.

I had never travelled the world; the world was for me the
corral around my institutions. I vaguely gathered that there
existed this something you call sex, but I wasn t going to
stop to gather that too tightly; being of a perfect
innocence as I was. I wasn t visiting my old sick mother
more than twice a year. In that lay all the relating with
the outside world I was offering.

I was regretting nothing; I was not experiencing the
slightest collywobble before this unrevokeable commitment;
one would have been finding me flush with urgency and
fervour. No young fiancee watched the kettle boil more
febrile, more ardent; I was day-dreaming and night-dreaming
that it was me saying the mass; to be a priest, I was
envisioning nothing more beautiful the world could offer; I
would have put aside any of its crowns or its laureateships.
My ambition could conceive of no outside calling.

What I m giving you now is your proof that what came upon me
should not have come upon me, of what inexplicable mesmerism
I was the victim.

The big day upon me, I proceeded to church, on feet so
dainty that it felt as if I were buoyed on the breeze - or
I d got wings, off the shoulder style. I was appearing to
myself an angel, so was hit with the awful concerned
expressions of my retinue; for we were of a number. I had
spent all night at prayer, and I was in a state of the order
of what gets pretty close to an ecstasy. Bishop Veteran the
Venerable was coming to seem to me like Father God Almighty
shepherding eternity, and wasn t that the great firmament to
be seen through the high vaults of this temple?

I ll spare you all the details of an occasion you know well:
the benediction, the communion within both traditions,
anoint the palm with oil of Catechumens, lastly the
sanctified offering done in concert with the Bishop. I won t
verbalise stiflingly on and on about that. Oh, Job had it
right, that fellow s unwise whose regimen doesn t prioritise
the eyes. I happened to lift my head, which I d been until
then keeping down, and I spied before me - I could have been
near enough to touch, except this young one stood in reality
a way off on the other side of a guard-rail - a strawberry
blonde of such a rare beauty, awash in regal splendour. It
was as if I was descaled of my eyelids. I experienced the
clichi of the blindman immediately regaining sight. The
bishop, so refulgent when I d rared to go, winked out just
so; the candles guttered on their gold chandeliers like
stars snuffed at dawn; the whole church had been occulted.
The strawberry blonde alone stood out in this deep deep
shadow, like a pentecostal archangel. Alone appeared a light
source, to give daylight more than to take it.

I hung my lids, really set against ever again undrooping
them to surrender to the pull of worldly things; for the
magnet was pushing across and through my every border, and I
was barely aware of what I could have been said to be up to.

A minute on, I opened again, as, like a guard s torch beam
picking out the decor on the retinal back wall of an empty
building darkened with the venetian blinds closed,  I was
seeing this scintillating one strobe a procession of band
next to band of the colour spectrum through my blinds, and
all inside a mauve crimson edge glow, such as you see
looking at the sun.

And, oh, hello, good looking! The Greatest Masters who,
scouring heaven for beauty s ideal, midwife back on earth
Holy likenesses of the Blessed Virgin, don t come close to
the fabulous reality there.  Neither the bard s sonnets nor
the great masters  pallets can give you any idea of it. This
one was so tall, with the sculptedness and grace of a deity;
hair the strawberry and blonde of a dusk sun peeking over
the crown s parting, branching two gold rivers over the
brow; one would have said a monarch s fit crown; temples
like dry bright cloud spanning sturdy and light the
pediments of dusk brown eyelashes, the latter only there to
distinguish more the apple-green sea-green unbearable bright
fox-trotting eyes. Oh, such eyes; taking quick hold and
showing you straightaway to your destiny; they were living,
limpid-ing, ardour-ing, glistened as I have never seen a
human eye do; brilliance escaped from them in streaks
similar to arrows which I singularly saw sink into my heart.
I don't know if the hearthfire that spat them was heaven s
or hell s, for sure it was from one or the other s. My
strawberry blonde was an angel or a devil, and maybe both;
Eve s thirteenth rib! No,  this one just wasn t of the
mother we can all call mamma. Mother of pearl TEETH smiling
in very red lips, yes, tiny dimples putting themselves
around each expression of the mouth by the flexing of light
satin cheeks. The nose, that had a finesse and boldness
about it, come undeniably from nobility. Lustre of agate
played over the calm glowing skin of the nakedly shown off
collarbone and then globes of chunky pearls, blond pearls,
almost as blond pearl as the neck, laced down onto and over
the swell of the clothed torso.

The head of the owner of all of this was now and again
restoring attention to itself by looking up with the slow
ripple of a field snake, or a peacock that s strutting, and
was inspiring each time tiny shudders around a collar decked
with handstitched embroidery like a lattice of pure silver.

Had on a top in a velvet of red-orange, full sleeves with
ermine all the way through lining them and out of them
extended a patrician s hands of endless refinement, long
soft fingers of such a perfect translucence that they let
light just carry through them, as the fingers of dawn do.

PAUSE

All of these details stand to me still as closely as if they
dated from yesterday and, accepted that I WAS highly
afflicted, none of them got missed: the trivialest nuance,
the pinpoint of dark at the nook of the chin, the
unnoticeable downy hairs at the joins of the lips, the
velvet forehead, the fine shadow echo of the eyelashes over
the cheek, I caught everything with stunning perspicacity.

In proportion to the more I was observing, seeming to me
unlocking in myself were doorways that just before had stood
shut; bricked over skylights to each sense were unbricking,
letting enter in the unknown vistas; life itself to me
seeming designed altogether other; I was coming to my birth
in a new structure of ideas. An awful anguish was wracking
my heart; every sixty seconds melting away seemed one
second, and one century. The holy ritual was moving forward
however and I was being brought well away from the world in
which my forming sensuousnesses were passionately urging the
waters to break. I said yes however, though I was wanting to
say no, though the whole of me was uproaring and protesting
against the slapping down my tongue was doing against my
heart: a force of the occult was caesareaning out (to spite
me) their words, out of my throat. That s perhaps what goes
on while so many young women walk to the high altar with a
determined plan to reject in stunning style the husband one
sticks on them, and while not a single carries her project
through. That s undoubtedly what goes on while so many silly
novices take on the veil, set as they ruddy may have been to
shred it off when put on to pronounce its vows. One wouldn t
dare neither to be responsible for a so scandalous affront
to all present nor to disprove the assumptions of so many
people; all these willpowers, all that regard seems to sit
on you like a suit of iron; and then it s in ordered
proportion so organised, everything has been so regimented
beforehand, in a manner so self-evidently not for revoking,
that your reasoning capitulates under the bulk of the thing
and stoops, completely.

PAUSE

I had up oomph good enough to dig up a mountain, for yelling
out loud that I was not wanting to be a priest; but I didn t
get to the point; my voice stayed shut up in my mouth s
roof, and it was impossible to communicate my wishes by the
slightest body twitch. I was bright with insomnia, but in a
condition like one in a nigmthare, where you want to say a
word on which your life is hanging, and you don t get to the
point.

The strawberry blonde knew what martyrdom I was suffering,
and, as encouragement, threw me a glance strong with a
divine promise. The eyes were writing a poem in which each
image composed a song.

Saying to me:

PAUSE

 If you want to be by me, I will make you more happy than
himself the Lord in HIS paradise; the angels will be jealous
of you. Rip off this funeral winding sheet in which you re
going to wind; I am the beauty, I am the youth, I am the
life; come by me, we will be the love. What could Jehovah
offer you as an offsetting of that loss? We shall like dream
stream, kissing into eternity.

 Pour away the wine in that chalice and you are free. I will
escort you to the uncharted islands; you will sleep on my
breast, in a solid gold bed, under a silver canopy; for I
love you and I want to prise you from your God, to whom so
many great hearts pour away gushes of love, that comes not
to him.

PAUSE

I was seeming to hear these phrases over a soft translucent
rhythm, and the looks almost had sound, and the words these
eyes were posting were clattering on the mat of my heart as
if a ghost shutter had been flapped there. I was feeling
ready to forsake God, and yet my heart was  ploddingly
laying on the bricks of the Holy Ceremony. The babe shot me
a last eyeful so begging so hopeless, sharp rapier after
rapier crossed in my breast, I felt more stabs in my ribs
than does the mother of all sorrows.

In this spirit was it made, me being this priest. Did I hear
a low voice? The strawberry blonde vanished into the
community.

Comments: To: POETICS@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU

Loss passed on the word awhile back about the sessions he and I are
participating in at the MLA; I would like to add that we now have a
complete guide available on the web to computer-related sessions at
the conference:

  http://www.ach.org/mla96/guide.html

Precious few of these sessions and talks relate to poetry, of course,
but there are still a few such talks.  I would like very much to hear
from anyone who is speaking and who would like me to add links or
other information about their activities.

And, for those thinking ahead to the 1997 MLA Convention in Toronto,
the Association for Computers and the Humanities will be organizing
two sessions for that event: one on Spatial and Geometric Metaphors
for Text, and another on Computers and Theory; talk of poetry would be
welcome in both sessions.

I am interested in what ppl think about POETICS in relationship to an
audience outside of other poets.

e.g. the last few years with the Spoken Word trad. and Perf-Po musings:
obviously ALL of this is obsolete almost immediately. To infuse
social-anarcho change, using the role of the media/mediated and creating a
true discourse: do we have to come outside of the academy, even the NEW
academies like Buffalo, New School SF, and Naropa? Street poetics,
performance art slams, preaching poetics...

Bil Brown could you be more specific?
what is obsolete?
I checked with my manufacturer and I'm not supposed to obsolete until early 98,
have they rolled the production schedule up?

jord'n, that's expiration date, not obsolescence date.  98 is just when the
newest model will be out, but you should be good for AT LEAST a week after
that.

Not to worry, Jordan.  I was obsolete 15 years ago & my muffler still doesn't
work.

As far as the social change project: don't forget, as Rabbit Face puts it -
poetry is what escapes POETICS theories almost successfully.

Jordan,

I think yours is a planned obsolescence. I checked your specs.  Perhaps BB
means a sort of spontaneous archaism, a momentary phenomenon.

perhaps not an odd question...but at odd angles.  which media daemon?
(daemon or hydra?)  and at precisely what level is it desirable to break
into?  and is breaking into necessarily breaking up? (because breaking up,
as they tell us, is hard to do)

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        Just a note to let those who were concerned know that Ronald
Johnson read here in Chicago and floored at least half of a boisterous
crowd of 150 or so with readings from Ark.  Ron wore wide-wales and
hoop tortoise-shell specs that made him, as Peter O'Leary suggested, the
spitting image of Dr. Freud.  The reading went swimmingly *after* my indulgent
introduction (having talked abt Orphee with Ron the night before, I rambled
on how beautiful Jean Marais was)--Ron reading Beam 4, 30, Spire 34, 44, 49,57,
and arches viii (74), and ix (75).
        We also learned that Sun and Moon will publish in spring '97 *The
Outworks*
to ARK which will inlude the poem formerly known as Radi Os, now titled
*Dome Excised
from Paradise Lost,* and the "Blocks to be Arranged in a Pyramid, (in memorium
AIDS)."

cheerfully,
Joel Felix

[This document was prepared by Charles Bernstein (bernstei@bway.net) and
Loss Pequen~o Glazier (glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu).]
____________________________________________________________________

1. About the Poetics List

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to
keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to continual
redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a generalized
discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations,
and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received
forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein: contact him for further
information. Joel Kuszai is currently working on the administration of the
list.  For subscription information contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.


____________________________________________________________________

2. Subscriptions

The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or
unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject
line, to:

listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

the one-line message should say:

unsub poetics

{or}

sub poetics Jill Jillway

(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your
name to unsub)

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.

*
If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you can
substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.  If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from
your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is
part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider
obtaining a commercial account.

____________________________________________________________________

3.  Cautions

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics (especially
reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. (See section 7.)

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, please send the request or comment
to the individual backchannel, not to the whole list.

____________________________________________________________________

4. Digest Option

The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to
your account to each day!  If you would prefer to receive ONE message
each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to
                                listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

set poetics digest

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply
to this message!!

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:

set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________

5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may
lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily
turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to "listserv."


set poetics nomail

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 8 below.)

____________________________________________________________________

6. Who's Subscribed

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message
blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:

  review poetics

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.

Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.
____________________________________________________________________

7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

our URL is

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center
provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new
poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS
List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct
connections to numerous related electronic
RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about contemporary print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we
have an extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as
well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Pequen~o Glazier.
____________________________________________________________________

8. Poetics Archives via EPC

Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and
year or search them for specific information. Your interface will
allow you to print or download any of these files.

Or set your browser to go directly to:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive

____________________________________________________________________

9. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications
as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a
list of your press/publications to
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word processing
program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the address above
to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk. Though files marked
up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your
word processor ill save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is also highly
desirable

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.

Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

Dear Friend,                                           revised: 11/05/96

    We are writing because the Center for Campus Organizing (CCO) has set
up over a dozen free e-mail lists to promote communication among campus
activists.  This online project is called CANet -- short for the Campus
Activists' Network.  The Center for Campus Organizing (CCO) is a national
clearinghouse based in Cambridge, MA, USA, originally established in 1991
as the University Conversion Project.  CANET is only a small part of CCO,
a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote peace and justice
activism and investigative journalism on college campuses.

    We have not yet added you to any mailing lists.  We are asking you
to try one or more of the discussions described below.  Are all
moderated (actually the term we are using is "facilitated") by human
volunteers who are campus activists, so your mailbox will not be deluged.

    The Campus Activists' NETwork is currently divided into 16 areas that
you may subscribe to individually.  Some CANET discussions are cosponsored
with other organizations.  A list of topics we haven't addressed, because
they are covered better by existing lists, appears below.  Circulation
figures are included in parenthesis:

1   ACTION96 -- For planning coordinated actions at dozens of campuses, i.e.
    action on prop 209, or to "Challenge the Lie$" about budget priorities.
(300)
2   CAN-ALERT -- Action Alerts of the Center for Campus Organizing.  Not
    a discussion list; subscribe for very infrequent, "emergency" alerts.
3   CAN-ALUM -- Alumni Network.  For alumni who used to be campus activists,
    on supporting campus activism and remaining active after graduation. (NEW!)
4   CAN-AR -- Anti-Racism.  For campus activists involved in activities
    resisting racism. (120)
5   CAN-BC -- Boston Center.  Discussion for campus activists in the Boston
    area and those interested in a local center for student activism.  (50)
6   CAN-ER -- Educational Rights.  For people who are organizing against
    tuition increases and efforts to cut funding for higher education. (500)
7   CAN-FAC -- Faculty Activist Network.  Sponsored by CCO and Teachers
    For a Democratic Culture; responds to attacks on higher education. (180)
8   CAN-LABOR -- Student Labor Activism.  Discussion for students who are
    interested in labor organizing, on campus or when they graduate.  (150)
9   CAN-PEACE -- Peace Activism and Economic Conversion.  Students working
    to challenge militarism.  Cosponsored with Peace Action. (120)
10  CAN-POVERTY --NEW discussion for student anti-poverty activists.
    Cosponsored by Students Together Ending Poverty. (100)
11  CAN-RW -- Right Wing Alert.  A discussion about responding to efforts
    by well-funded Right Wing groups to dictate politics on campus. (500)
12  CAN-SKIT -- Creative Activism.  A place to share ideas for creative
    activist tactics, and to draft skits for guerrilla theatre.  (NEW!!)

These three discussions ask new subscribers to state their involvement
in campus activism, in order to help keep the discussion relevant.

1   CAN-YFN -- Young Feminist Network.  For people who are involved in
    feminist campus organizations or who want to start one. (150)
2   CAN-AJ -- Campus Alternative Journalism. Restricted to people who
    are creating alternative campus media or who want to do so. (100)
3   CAN-LAW -- Law Student Activists.  A network of law students interested
    in public interest law, legal cases affecting student activists.

With few exceptions, it is not possible to send mail to any of these
lists unless you subscribe first.  Since subscriptions on most of the
lists are processed by a human being, if you subscribe today it may take
a day or two before you receive a message saying you're subscribed!



----- SUBSCRIBING TO A DISCUSSION ------------

You can subscribe yourself to any CANET discussion by sending a message to:

canet@pencil.math.missouri.edu

with a subject of "canet" and a message body with ONLY the following:

sub  NAME-OF-LIST  Yourfirstname  Yourlastname

If your email software is set up to use a signature, turn this off before
sending a message to CANET; i.e. if Emma Goldman wanted to subscribe
to can-er, her email message should ONLY say:

sub can-er Emma Goldman


After a few minutes you should receive an acknowledgement and a request to
introduce yourself to other subscribers of CAN-ER.



----- CANCELING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ------------

You can unsubscribe yourself to any discussion by sending an email message
to canet@pencil.math.missouri.edu with a subject of "canet" and body:

unsub  NAME-OF-LIST



------ RECEIVING MAIL AS A "DIGEST" ----------

For each CANET discussion, you may set your mail delivery mode to
"digest" so that messages will be accumulated daily and sent to you
in a bundle.  You will receive instructions on how to do this as soon
as your subscription to any CANET list is approved.

For all discussions with over 300 subscribers, you will initially
start receiving mail in digested form, along with instructions on
how to turn digesting off so that you receive each message separately.



------ POLICIES ON ADDING NEW LISTS ----------

You may wonder why CANET provides forums on some issues but not others.
The reason is that we don't want to reinvent the wheel.  If an effective
campus activist-focused discussion already exists, we'd rather promote it
than compete with it.  Here are four discussions we promote:

AMNESTY-D       Serves Campus Human Rights Activists (Amnesty Int'l)
SEACNET         Campus Environmental Groups (Student Env. Action Coalition)
AFFAM-L         Discussion of Struggles to Defend Affirmative Action
QUEERCAMPUS     Serves l/g/b/o Campus Communities


Here are instructions on subscribing to these lists:

Name of List        Send the "subscribe LISTNAME YOURNAME" message to:

amnesty-d           amnestyd-request@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
seac+announce       listserv@ecosys.drdr.virginia.edu
affam-l             listserv@cmsa.berkeley.edu
queercampus         majordomo@vector.casti.com *

*for queercampus give an email address instead of your name when subscribing

Decisions about the future development of the CANET system will
be made by CCO's Campus Organizing Advisory Board, which is made
up of 25 students, 15 faculty members, and 5 youth activists.  If you
have questions or complaints about how CANET operates, please send
them to, via e-mail, to facil@pencil.math.missouri.edu



------ FOR MORE INFORMATION ----------------

When you subscribe, you will receive additional instructions about
sending mail, guidelines for discussions, etc.  If you want that information
now, send a blank email message to:  canet-info@pencil.math.missouri.edu

An archive of past discussions and additional resources for campus organizing
will soon be updated on our web page (see below).

Finally, since computers can only do a small part of what is necessary
to promote activism on campus, we want to let you know how to contact
our office, get literature from our office, and get human advice on your
campus organizing.  We now provide:

* Campus Organizing Guide for Peace and Justice Groups (16 pages)

* Mini-Guide to Bringing a Progressive Speaker to Campus (24 pages)

* Mini-Guide to Building a Permanent Multi-Issue Student Coalition (16 pp.)

Humans and humanimals in smoking jackets:

Is it my imagination, or has this listserv become a red light district
for hello-kitty stationery products? Have we all degenerated into
caffeine-addled telephone psychics in a booth in Amsterdam, and
if so, fellow thrill enthusiasts, why bother?

Do we spree-posting hydrocephaloids not realize that the word
*sex* can be used ironically--especially by existential hedonists
with jaguar-patterned sheets, coriander-scented waterbeds, and
several discrete handfuls of vintage mood elevators?

Who put the fluorescent orange codpieces in my hookah? Really, I don't know
which is worse--the vulgarity, the stench, or the lack of color
coordination. I only know that I miss my Automat Mattress playing
cards.

One might complain, but that runs contrary to the hedonistic impulse.
Perhaps it is time to create another list called
alt.slacks.sharkskin.dirty-presbyterians.

(Or perhaps not. In any case, it is time for my Daiquiri lozenges.)

Ruefully,

Bourbon Licorice

Tried to send this the other day under a pseudonym (see above) but
nothing happened. Don't tell me that someone was actually offended by
the subject header. That *would* impress the nine-year-old within to
the point of tittering.

Could explain my intention here, but really, since when do I owe you
favors? How often do you mow my dishes and fluff the Abyssinian?

best,

I would really appreciate any tips on anthologies from the 1950's -- both
those containing work by people writing then, and those reflecting the
editor's take on, say, _Early American Poets_ (a L. Untermeyer production
from  '52) or French stuff.  No tip is too obvious or banal, and any
descriptions of contents would be extremely useful. With thanks --Mike S.

Michael -- hard to know if these are of interest to you or not, without a

_Chicanos_ Tino Villanuevo (might have had a different title in first
edition)

Hello Poetics listees-
Another question from the bottom of the world - could anyone help ?
A subscriber to an Australian literary discussion group has asked -

"And, does anyone know whether the (US) Association of Literary Scholars
and Critics, whose members seem to be pushing for a return to the
study of literature (not necessarily canonical) in English departments,
is a neo-conservative front? "

Any answers welcomed
Thanks

If I recall correctly, some of the funds for the ALSC conference in
Minneapolis did come from conservative organizations, but the organizers
were very open about this, so the term "front," with all of its
McCarthy-era paranoid associations, doesn't seem quite right.  I don't
have the letter handy, but I seem to recall that John Ellis, one of the
main movers-and-shakers of the ALSC, mentioned in correspondence that he
was concerned that this "neo-conservative front" charge would come up
due to the source of the money (which wasn't available from other
quarters), and that the organization wasn't meant to have a specifically
conservative political bent.  One could argue that, in the final
analysis, those who pay the piper call the tune, but this seems a bit
reductive, especially with regard to a fairly loosely organized group of
scholars and critics.  One could also argue that the ALSC's focus on
literary rather than cultural studies is inherently conservative, but
there seems to be a movement in this direction in leftish quarters too,
lately  -- see the Marxian Frank Lentricchia, in a recent _Lingua
Franca_ piece, or the liberal Richard Rorty, in the latest _Raritan_,
for example. (I don't think either Rorty or Lentricchia has anything to
do with ALSC, though).

Subjectively speaking, my general sense is that ALSC members range
across the political spectrum, but do tend to be more conservative than,
say, the membership of the MLA as a whole.  At any rate, it seems a bit
extreme to call the organization a neo-conservative front -- I don't
expect to see members in jackboots kicking down the door of my office
and seizing my copy of Jameson's _Political Unconscious_.

(and I think I let my MLA membership lapse, too)

Dear Sheila Murphy,

You probably don't know me, but I seem to remember you accidentally sent
a copy of some work meant for the Electronic Poetry Review to the POETICS
list many months ago.

I'm just wondering if you've every heard anything from those folks. I
submitted some work myself, and on realizing how long it has been I sent
some emails off to the editors -- one was returned as being an invalid
address (the kswiggert or kwsiggart address), & the generic epr address
got no response. Their web site seems to have stalled in April as well.

I have a probably-overdeveloped sense of ethics that prevents me from
sending material out when it's under consideration elsewhere, so I'm just
trying my best to make sure EPR is really alive (or not) before I take
any other action with the work...

Anyway, if you happen to know anything I'd sure be interested...

Thanks,

David.

Can't forget all those oscar williams anthologies -- especially the ones with

shops in ages-- but oscar seemed to have the market down ib the period -- he
promoted dylan thomas (and thomas returned the favor by saying nasty stuff about
him) and even included joe ceravolo in some late anthology. bill berkson once
cliamed that to understand j. ashbery, one must read the O. w. anthologies, as
many of ja 's early peoms seem to parody the poets found within

Place the file below in your home directory. Call it "parent". Do chmod

./parent depending on how your account is set up. First, though, delete

I don't know about "front" -- but the ALSC is certainly designed as a
neoconservative organization -- the funding is much the same as the
National Association of Scholars -- which is to say that the organization
IS NOT formed and funded primarily by its membership -- Despite their
organizing materials claims to want to return to a "literary study that
has not been politicized," the mailings that I received from them had
quite clearly stated political agendas --

On the other hand, to judge from the papers presented at their first
conference, it would appear that they have failed miserably in their
efforts to abstain from theory, faddish or otherwise --

No, we probably don't have to worry about them seizing our copies of
Jameson -- but then again, the recently formed new accrediting agencies
that are supported by the same funding sources do present a clear and
present danger to academic freedom -- you don't have to take my word for
it, read their literature --

But the concert was among the best I've seen last five years --

The band plays LA next weekend, at Wadsworth -- don't miss it --

they don't seem to include any of the recitations that Mingus was so fond

a nagoyan friend Matthew Taylor, enthusiastic about Richard Dawkins's
"biomorphs" work and complexity theory in general, came
up with some stimulating defns regarding creativity:

: it presupposes a set of possibilities, 'search' or
  'design space'

: this space's hyperdimensional

: design space includes indefinitely large set of
  interesting or aesthetically pleasing artifacts (--'art')

: such artifacts exist within larger non-interesting and
  -pleasing set, that is a vast no. of desirable artifacts
  within much vaster no. undesirable ones (islands within sea)

etc

Matthew sums up:

"Creativity is efficient... [It] is moving through a space of
possibilities in an extremely fast and productive manner."

What do you think about this?

I think this is wrong; it is constructed like a semiotics or linguistics
of art and there are deep problems with that. For one thing, the "search"
space would be fuzzy, broken, etc. and not a "space" at all - nor does it
contain a _set_ - at least in any way I can think of defining the con-
struct.

To say it's hyperdimensional actually doesn't mean all that much within a
choice space - to the extent that any n-dimensional space can be mapped
one to one on any m-dimensional space. If Matthew means that the space in
total is parametricized - i.e. color/hue/whatever - then again, things
become immediately slippery.

What is an _artifact_ here? Would Barry's gas sculptures qualify? Buren's
events? Stelarc's body?

What Matthew is describing is formal decision-making and evolutionary
processes used in computer software and design work. But this has very
little to do with everyday art-making, and is so highly reductive as to be
almost a caricature. Further, even within the computer, decisions are made
beforehand in terms of programming, etc. - there's a larger space (you
might call it "meta" if you follow Bateson or whomever) where this occurs.

Art is not a language. It involves discursive formations, language/s, but
that is as far as I'd take it. If anything, art problematizes language,
and problematizes _choice_ or _domain_ as well.

I had a wonderful, stimulating experience at the conference last week.  It
was particularly heartening to meet so many people who are committed to justice.

I returned to my campus, California State University at San Marcos (in
Northern San Diego County) on Monday.  There, I found out from "hall talk"
that I  had become the lastest victim of hate crimes on campus.  Apparently,
the previous Monday (the fourth of NOv.), a police officer discovered my
name wrapped up in a swastika on a bathroom wall--along with a threat.
However, neither I  nor my family members were notified by University
officials.

As you may recall from things I said at our conference, these are not new
events on my campus.  And the late, inept responses of our administration
are not new either.  I feel like a moving target, and I feel terrorized.  I
wish they had told me while I was with you all--while I am getting a lot of
sympathy here, there are few warriors ready for action, few posed for
proactive agendas.  And among our students, what we see is a major back lash
going on.  The students are "tired of hearing about race" and "tired of
having race shoved down [their] throats."   They are angry about the
teach-in we held late last month on "Institutional Racism and Hate Crimes."
They feel attacked  when people of color tell them what we are experiencing.
To speak about racism is to attack whites, they think.

I am at a loss for strategies beyond daily survival.  I get up, go out, and
look over my shoulder. I have had to change the way I am, but I see no
institutional changes.   What the hell strategies/tactics are we going to
come up with to combat what appears to be a major, rapid return to the past?

I am heartened by your critical and immediate support.  I want to clarify,
to those of you who expressed concern, that my stance about this shit is
that I want it to be out there.  To the extent you can, I appreciate if you
will be  vocal about this and disseminate the information widely.  Let me
also clarify, that I am NOT the only target here; but perhaps I will be the
most visible and vocal about what has happened--others have been terrorized
into silence.  I cannot take that position.  Pray God something constructive
comes out of this shit!

There have been a series of hate crimes committed on our campus. They have
targetted mostly Blacks, but also Chicanos/Mexicanos and gays and lesbians.
The campus has been silent about most of them, and has responded only to
those that got "leaked."  Further, these hate crimes emerge in a climate
where the administration selectively provided information to the major
newspaper in San Diego that suggested Black faculty who spoke out about
institutional racism and hate crimes were misguided, errant, and/or
hysterical.  The editorial that resulted took that position, and
simultaneously exalted the campus and the Univ. president, Bill Stacy, for
their wonderful statements and practices of diversity.  This editorial was
followed with an article (while our conference was underway, so I missed it)
about another colleague who was targetted, an article that  criticized that
person for remaining "mum" about it.   Given the general climate, where
other acts of terrorism (skinheads "stomping" people in a store in Laguna, a
firebombing of a home in Imperial Beach, among others) exist north and south
of here and ALWAYS east of here, and where white racists feel powerful
because of their victories with "3 strikes you're out," 187, and Prop 209,
these events must be anticipated and swiftly countered.  That has not been
the case, clearly.

That's all for now.  Just understand, it is with my permission that you all
speak out/act out!

Subject:      infraverbal, pluralaesthetic
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Bob Grumman's use of the word "infraverbal" is tied for me with his
interest in what he elsewhere has called "pluralaesthetic" work.
Pluralaesthetic poetry is poetry that contains elements other than those
we traditionally associate with language arts--that is, along with words,
etc, pluralaesthetic work has a visual element, or a musical element
beyond that of the musicality of the words themselves. Sometimes the words
themselves form the visual element, sometimes they are mixed with pictures
and all sorts of other fun stuff. An absolute must-read, if Bob still has
copies available, is his pluralaesthetic book A VERY STRAYNGE BOOK, a
beautiful, hilarious modernist fable which includes, among other wonders,
a "bunnie who lookd lik a bear"--my paraphrase of his (mis)spellings here
probably is incorrect.

I'm not sure that
Bob identifies pluralaesthetic work anywhere as a "new" thing; rather, he
seems very well informed on the history of concrete poetry--not only the
range of concrete poetry of the 50s and 60s but also its more distant
precursors--Blake's visual poems, Max Ernst, Apollonaire, etc). Bob does,
however, suggest in a number of places some points about what makes a
pluralaesthic art an art of crucial significance in our historical moment.
Because pluralaesthic work breaks down boundaries between various forms of
art, pluralaesthic challenges the notion that there is any such thing as a
truly "singular" aesthetic in the first place--rather, aesthetic
sensibilities are mainly formed by a conjunction of visual, verbal, and
other aural experiences. Why, then, does art so often stick to a singular
art form in its presentation? Are there implications in such a practice
that poetry, for instance, must remain PURELY verbal, and not be
contaminated by mixing with elements "not of its kind"?

Bob's criticism in POETIC BRIEFS is directed at the recent Messerli
anthology (and I believe, but I'm no sure, because I don't have it in
front of me since I'm working in a computer lab) also at the recent Hoover
anthology because neither anthology, according to Bob, contains sufficient
examples of pluralaesthic work. He has no problem with this per se--all
anthologies have limits--but he does have problems with the way he feels
the Messerli anthology sets itself up as THE thorough anthology of
contemporary American Modernist and Postmodernist poetry. He quotes
Marjorie
Perloff, I believe, as making a claim of this kind for the anthology, and
simply wants to point out that he believes that the anthology is not as
complete as many have claimed it is. I'm not sure how justified Bob's
claims are, although he does seem to be pointing out some significant
omissions. But someone with more familiarity with all these anthologies
than I have would probably be better capable of making such a judgement.

I guess I'd like to add here that anyone who's looking for a classroom
anthology that does contain pluralaesthic work might look at the Pierre
Joris and Jerome Rothenberg anthology POEMS FOR THE MILLENIUM. Plenty of
pluralaesthic work there. I've already used the anthology once, with great
success, in an introductory creative writing class, and I'm going to use
it again. If nothing else, I've found that some of my students really LIKE
the fact that here's a poetry book with funky pictures in it too.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Joe Amato pointed out to me that I had mistakenly left the old listserv
address in section 6 of the Welcome Message ("review poetics") -- it should
have said send this message to listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu
       With the new listserv program, the automatic archiving of the list is
significantly improved.  You can find the new archives at

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics

This archive is up to the minute; that is, it will have this message as fast
as you do. It also give you many sorting features but it is primarily
organized around the subject header (it sort all messages with the same
header together), another reason to be sure to check that the subject header
is accurate when you send a message to the list. The archive covers March
1994 to present; earlier material (starting December 1993) will remain
available at the EPC of course.
        It seems to me that this may significantly change the use of this
list, since it makes the archive a viable alternative to the digest or
toggling between mail and nomail. And it makes the list much easier to read
for nonsubcribers.

some examples:

I wonder if there's a space where "pluralaesthetic" and anti- or post-
aesthetic meet?  A "poor" art.  I'm thinkin of the interesting essay
on Polish poet Alexander Wat in latest NY Review of Bks.  Wat began
as a sort of Dada experimentalist in 20s ("revolutionary", parodic
anti-art).  After surviving WWI & gulag, he began writing again in
late 40s, 50s.  His fascinating poetry is in one version in English I
know of.  According to C. Milosz, he turned against "difficult",
avant-garde art, finding parallels between the avant-garde artist
manipulating language & dictators manipulating peoples.  (This is
a simplification I'm sure on my part.) From the little I've read
of his poetry, he works with short lyrics as a form of compression
& intensity.  Not for art-effects, but to intensify & bring to
bear the ironies & strangeness of the history he's experienced.

The "problem" of the "artist" trapped in the aesthetic hall of mirrors
is a longstanding one.  I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether
a "plural aesthetic" would include a measure of _realism_ (not 19th
century or social realism but something else... experiential?).
Authenticity?  What's the word for the value of art-work that
transcends the categories of "art" & does something to spirit &
nature?  Becomes part of a wider conversation (or deeper)?
(or simpler?) - Henry Gould   (ethos, logos, pathos? - please,
educate, & "move"?)

p.s. I don't have Wat's poems handy.  But a harsh example of what
I referred to above: his short poem - a little narrative - in which
an executioner, axe still bloody, soothes a little child staring
at her father's head.  Then she carries it on a pole in a parade
under the banner "Progress for all peoples - Death to enemies".
The poem is dedicated to martyred friends & "thousands of others".
I believe it's called something like "20th Century" (could be wrong).

I'd like to announce the publication of the second volume in my series
on American Poets Since World War II in the _Dictionary of Literary
Biography_ series.  This is volume 169.  Once again, there are
substantial entries with biographical, critical, and bibligraphical
information on a number of poets of interest to the Poetics List.
Several entries were written by List members.  The table of contents for
this volume includes:

Kenneth Sherwood on David Antin
Loss Glazier on Charles Bernstein
Ed Foster on Ted Berrigan
Brett Millier on Elizabeth Bishop and Louise Bogan
Mike Basinski on Charles Bukowski
Loss Glazier on Robert Creeley
Willard Spiegelman on Irving Feldman
Peter Quartermain on Kathleen Fraser
Laszlo Gefin on Allen Ginsberg
Ashley Brown on Anthony Hecht
Eric Selinger on Ronald Johnson
Elizabeth House on Carolyn Kizer
Ashley Brown on Robert Lowell
Mark Scroggins on Nathaniel Mackey
James McCorkle on W. S. Merwin
Keith Tuma on Michael Palmer
Robert Friedman on Ishmael Reed
Joseph Conte on James Schuyler
Diane Middlebrook on Anne Sexton
T. C. Marshall on Ron Silliman
Susan Schultz on Cathy Song
Chris Stroffolino on James Tate
Steven Evans on Rosmarie Waldrop
Richard Calhoun on Richard Wilbur
Andrew Elkins on James Wright

As with _DLB 165_, this volume is published by Gale Research Press
(Detroit, MI) in hardback only, largely for sale to research, public,
and private libraries.  I think the price is close to $175 per volume.
Hopefully, there's a library near you that carries the _DLB_ series.
It's easy (an inexpensive) to photocopy the entries.

One final volume edited by me on contemporary poets has nearly been
completed and will be published sometime in 1997.  I'd be happy to have
suggestions and comments about the series backchannel.

Subject:      Armantrout Abacus

Wanted to trumpet Rae Armantrout's new Abacus "from _The Pretext_."
Armantrout's ability to lyrically access the daily tangents within
recognition's, well, what do I mean here-- something about abstract/concrete
-- for example:

"compact as the present/
in the mouth of an anchorperson."

There is a quality of _observation_ more than description. Description seems
to put the accent on the exterior-- Armantrout seems to work in that area
where the perception enters/alters the person-- many poets do but few with
such finite intensity. The question of the duration of that altering also
included-- and the multiplicity & response. Not a machine made of words. Too
exact to be a machine. One can't quote at length because the whole is also a
part in a way that rings because real. What it is-- ok, abstract/concrete --
credulity/incredulity _blurred_ into human being (being being a verb)-- "Hell
is unredeemed experience?"

"Just one/
knock at a door/
when usually it's three."

"Astronomers know/
a signal's/
not an answer."

Not glamorous, just amazing.

I think this is a great statement -- but bringsd into question ART AS
PROPAGANDA. LR films and such... which I'm sure we can agree are ART and
DIRECT PROPAGANDA.

A few years ago their was an anthology that put the politics of poetic form
into question. the idea that the art of this propaganda is <<part of a wider
conversation (or deeper)?
(or simpler?)>> is  very ODD to me.

The POINT of politics/poetics in this mileu, post language, post structure,
post post whatever seems to be OUTSIDE of these issues. Prose or poetry that
delves into these issues, revealing, whatever is PROPAGANDA is giving the
artists point-of-veiw as possessor of a knowledge that someone else does not
possess. I don't know if I can handle that, but it is done -- regularly. Esp.
at the open mic...

I wonder where glossalalia fits into propagandite poesy??

Hmmmmmm.

HELLO

I was working in the writing office and doing various other things and I want

know where the rest of you are!!

I am currently in Louisville, KY and working diligently to get this poetry
community to a standard that I see in the rest of the country. Recently, this
has brought me to be asked to start a POETICS PROGRAM at a community center
(directing & whatnot) and I want to bring people here, NOW.

I have been workshoping writers in Performance, Experiment, Ethnopoetics,
Investigative Poetics ... BUT I NEED MORE HELP.

It is very difficult to be the ONLY one that knows what the HELL I am talking
about here, outside of the university.

EMAIL ME, TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE NAROPA GRADS!!

Bill -

You post seems related to the that on-going thread about politics and
poetry so I thought I'd mention an article about the mechanism of poetry's
affect on politics - (I didn't know the citation of the piece at the time
of the earlier postings -) The author, Robert Kaufman is a reader of the
kind of writing represented on this list. The article is

"Legislators of the Post-Everything World: Shelley's DEFENCE of Adorno,"
ELH, 63 (1996) 707-733.

The article may also be seen to relate to John Gerat's mention of
complexity theory. The connection being that a thing does not need to be
seen or read by the maximun number of people to have an important, even
crucial, effect.

Maybe poetry is always already pluralaesthetic, in that through poetry
language gives poets a material to shape just as painters use paint.
& the "crucial effect" for the poet at least is inherent in the material.
The realized poem is sufficient & ready to provide its MOST crucial
effect: its reading. We go back to the chunk of puddingstone thrown
into the river, but since the river keeps moving, the ripple effects are
hard to measure (somebody keeps throwing the rulers into the water too).
Then we follow the rock down to the riverbed, only to realize that
the poem was actually something somebody just called across overhead,
didn't even touch the water.  Go fish. There may be a great
divide between what poetry means to poets & what it means to societies
at large.  But there's plenty of room in language for both of them
to get lost. - HG

The Electronic Poetry Review website is alive -- or at least available as

the more eclectic lit mags I've seen, with work from Armantrout, Giscombe,
Hejinian, Killian and other names familiar to this list alongside Bidart,
Jane Miller and others. They've really made an effort to represent the
spectrum, whatever that might be. To my knowledge, though, the site has
never been officially announced. The Web address was given to contributors
back in the summer so they could proofread their work, but the issue looks
finished to me.


P.S. to David & other EPR contributors -- I also have had poems pending
there for months (ditto for RIF/T, for that matter), and a review in the
first issue. (I also share your ethics, which means that I'm lucky if a
group of poems manages to be seen by more than one mag in a year.) If
Katherine Swiggart's address isn't working, try the one noted on the Web
site itself. (I'd copy it here, but it's written in tiny italics and my
glasses aren't handy.)

schizophrenics, children and poets: glossolalia, which in theology one sometimes
calls "speaking in tongues."  The plural marks precisely the utopia of a
universal language, comprised of everything, collecting and canceling all
languages at the same time, but also, due to this simultaneity, suppressing
language or at least its capacity to signify, to the profit of its sole sonic
envelope." (my translation)

Vincent is both a medical historian and a sound poet, which makes for some
rather amazing observations.  He'll also be participating, coincidentally, in a
performance/conference "spectacle" in Annecy, France on November 21st which
studies the case of the nineteenth-century medium Helene Smith, who spoke,
according to the brochure I have, Sanscrit, Martian, Ultra-martian and Uranian.

Not to devour a dead horse, but back in 1971 I did a long piece called
Typed Glossolalia - going into a trance-state and typing "randomly" for
around 8000 characters. The inner 4000 were then analyzed with time series
analysis among other techniques, looking for evidence of repetitive pat-
terns, beyond the doubled (jkjkjk etc.) of alternating fingers; none were
found. This was used in a critique of determinism in human and other org-
anisms. Part of the text & commentary were published in pamphlet. There
was no spirit come to haunt, flaunt, or daunt. Alan

If anybody out there has the information to hand, we're looking for a clean
copy (the typeset version) of Olson's Plan for a Curriculum of the Soul.
It's in our manuscript for volume two of Millennium and came out of my stack
of Olson books etc., but I can't for the moment put my hands on it and
very much need it for insertion (as is) into the finished book.

Back channel would certainly be okay for this one,

Subject:      sad news about Meridel Le Sueur

i am forwarding a note i received from my friend jo grant at bookzen.
meridel le sueur has died.

it is hard news, though she is very old and has led an incredibly rich,
giving life.  it is hard to think there will be no new stories, poems,
essays.  her work is, like that of tillie olson, judy grahn, adrienne
rich, pat parker, audre lord, an unflinching, careful, strong writing
of women's lives with a particular tender, lyric quality of its own.
i am sometimes reminded of sarah orne jewett when i read her gentle,
image-filled text, and yet her words also have the anger and social
ferocity of dreiser, of the vietnam poets and writers, of sharon olds
and dorothy allison.  i try and describe her in terms of other writers,
other texts, because i am trying to hold on to her, connect her so tha
it won't feel as if she has gone quite so far.

i know jo grant and her family would be moved to hear any words anyone
would like to send in tribute to, or memory of, meridel.  you may reach
them at the address in jo's mailing (appended).

Subject: Meridel Le Sueur: 1900-1996



Friends,

Very sad to inform the many Iowa Citians who were friends of Meridel
LeSueur that she died yesterday. For those who attended her last appearence
in Iowa City, at Old Brick, during her final Iowa Tour will remember her
telling us:

"I was born at the beginning of the swiftest and bloodiest century at
Murray, Iowa, in a white square puritan house in the corn belt, of two
physically beautiful people who had come west through the
Indian and the Lincoln country, creating the new race of the
Americas by enormous and rugged and gay matings with the Dutch,
the Indian, the Irish; being preachers, abolitionists, agrarians, radical
lawyers on the Lincoln, Illinois, circuit.

"Dissenters and democrats and radicals through five generations.

Meridel LeSueur - 1900-1996

That night at Old Brick Meridel spoke about the years of being
blacklisted by McCarthy and the difficult time she and her children
had trying to survive during the reign of the House UnAmerican
Activities Committee. At one point her agent told her she could sell
more books if she would write like Ernest Hemingway. She responded "I
would, but I have better things to do with my time than write about
fighting, fishing and fucking."

A feminist decades before the term entered everyday use, she spent her
life on the front line fighting for the rights of women, minorities,
Native Americans, gays and the disabled.

A review of her most recent book, THE DREAD ROAD, and an article about her
can be found at www.bookzen.com.  Both have been downloaded by newspapers
from around the world, along with embarassingly  few from the U.S.

The book review is at: <http://www.bookzen.com/books/0000066r1.html>

The article is at: <http://www.bookzen.com/books/0000066a1.html>

Both were written by Chuck Miller. When Meridel read them she was so
touched she cried. It was rare when anything as insightful as Miller's
article and review had ever been written about her. After many hours
of audio and video recording of Meridel over a period of 13 years it
was the first time I witnessed her crying.

But what a life...

As a young girl she marched with Mother Bloor in Colorado to protest
the massacre of miners and their families at Ludlow; during her early
teens lived with Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman; grew up a
prolitarian writer who counted as her friends: Agnes Smedley,
Josephine Herbst, Nelson Algren, Grace Lumpkin, Upton Sinclair, Jack
Conroy, Richard Wright, Zona Gale, Theodore Drieser, Kenneth Fearing,
Mari Sandoz...Boris Israel and too many others to name here. Her
grandfather, whose wife was identified only as a squaw--since the
state of Ohio didn't include names of Native Americans who married
white men--was a friend of John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed)....

I've gone on too long.

I'll close with this quote from Miller's article:

"Henry Miller, Keraouc and Bukowski are all dead. There is no one else
left of LeSueur's stature in American literature today. She stands
alone, a giant, waiting to be discovered by her own nation."

Amen to thjat, or rather, A(wo)men!

If anyone does not  have access to the World Wide Web E-mail me and I will
send the article and the review by return mail.

All of Meridel's books are in Special Collections at the main UI library
if the Iowa City Public Library doesn't have them.

Some people have contacted me and asked if they can share thoughts
about Meridel and have them posted where their friends could find them
and respond. We're setting it up with all comments being printed and
copies being placed in the LeSueur collections in MN, WI & IA.

E,
Don't hesitate to share this with any friends who know about Meridel.
Peace and love,

Subject:      Ear Inn Reading Report nov 16

Last friday night Drew Gardner had a cold.  He played drums at Biblios with
his hands.  The Poets watched and drank beer.  They smoked.  They read
popular magazines and Klaus Kinsky.

After jazz the poets went to Sophies, occupied the window and talked.  The
poets got a table and sat.  The poets sat in the window and kissed.  Urging
was done by the poets because one poet wanted to go home.  The poets bought
one poet more drinks.

Saturday morning the poets called in search of the blood brain barrier.  They
learned that one poet had made out with another poet who had made out with
Allen Ginsberg.  After the calling, they gathered and discussed psychological
testing.  Arguments were passed to the back end, the DSM was referenced and
poetry books with illustrations were consulted.  The poets who had headaches
were massaged, drank water & smoked more cigarettes.

In the Afternoon the poets saw themselves at the Ear Inn.  The workers at the
Ear Inn do not like the poets.  The bartender at the Ear Inn is a poet and
doesn't like it when the poets start readings late.

A poet pointed out that Armand Schwerner sat at a table.  Drew Gardner began
to read.  Once he said devil.  Another time the mind of god.  And before that
the arms of my lover.  His poems were described by one poet as about
thinking.  Another poet didn't have a comment.  The poets were pleased by his
beautiful changeups.

The poets put $3 in a basket.  After counting, there were $64 for the poets
and $25 for the workers.  The poets socialized.  The workers worked.

Chuck Stein was described as having written the Hat Rack Tree.  Chuck give
whale advice.  Drew invented this because he took esoteric classes with
Chuck.

Chuck explained his idea of a project not a long work but the things you do.
 He talked about small press publishing, Jack Clark and Hermes Coyote.

If it doesn't bite
don't believe its wolf teeth
gate the god speech

Chuck said how your old hat sits on the hat rack tree.  Now you go to buy a
new hat.  Should it be just like it?  One poet wore a raiders hat and hugged
another.  After Chuck, the poets were urged to come back next week to hear
Patricia Jones and Lydia Davis.  They were also urged to pay their bills, tip
big, and leave the room so the workers could set up for dinner.

The poets walked to the sitting area at Brothers and drank.  A few poets
walked around looking for one another and talked when they were found.  The
poets irritated the poets and made them laugh.

On Sunday the poets ate carribean food and went to the Brooklyn Moon.  There
were no snakes in a tree poem read by a poet.  Hundreds of tiny halos
surrounded the figs.  After the reading the poets talked about Michele
Wallace and irony.  One poet shaved his mustache and another poet won a
nickel.  The poets were very relaxed.

At night the poets took the F train to a party.  One poet left a hat on the
seat hoping that it would go to queens.  Another poet left one at the party.
 The poets went home, confessed & didn't get much sleep.

Comments: To: poetics@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A capacity crowd (110) turned up Thursday, November 7, 7 p.m., to hear
Eleni Sikelianos read with John Wieners. It was a good thing both poets
were there.

Eleni read for about twenty-seven minutes. She read eleven or twelve
pieces. She wore black platform shoes, black pants, and a peach silk top.
"I bet you didn't know you were in for some essays," she said, about four
poems into the reading. "Are you ready? There's no thesis statement," she
continued, launching into "No One the Washing Machine", "Now We Will Speak
of the Various Parties," "The Auto-Portrait at Half Day," and "Letting the
Blood Drop," among other essays. Although I was not the one to escort John
Wieners to the office, I was still somehow very nervous and could not take
notes. I caught the line, "I compare my state of being to the state of
Kansas," and then, "nothing to protect us from ambient creatures," but not
much else. Eleni was very poised. About halfway through her reading, she
asked the audience, "How are you doing?" A recovering-from-pneumonia Tim
Davis piped up, "Never better!" "Then get home!" Eleni said. John Wieners
himself led one of the two rounds of applause that met Eleni's reading.

There was an intermission. We sold several books. The calvados I brought
from home went like that. Among the milling were Tom Savage, Bruce Andrews,
Sam Truitt, Brenda Coultas, Brian Kim Stefans, Bill Luoma, Josh Galef,
Brigham Taylor, Brendan Corber, Rochelle Kraut, Steve Dalachinsky, Raymond
Foye, Kim Rosenfield, Rob Fitterman, Tim Davis, Liz Fodaski, Marcella
Durand, Rich O'Russa, Carol Szamatowicz and I think David Henderson. The
place was mobbed. Simon Pettet watched over John for me.

Enough time elapsed. Anna Malmude said "I am very happy to introduce John
Wieners." He read for eighteen minutes and fourteen seconds, according to
Raymond Foye. He opened with a request: "Billy." He read from his Cape
Goliard book. It was not easy to tell which parts of what he said were
poems. I spent most of the reading fiddling with the av equipment to try
and broadcast John's small wavering voice to the back of the room. There
was one burst of feedback, oops. And then there was a sforzando on the word
'Roses.' At four points during the reading, John interrupted his very clear
and pleasant metrics to carry lines way out past where one would expect
them to stop. That was beautiful. Some people told me they just had to
leave when he lit up during his reading. I don't know. I caught bits about
Copley Square (?) and other Boston geography. I couldn't say exactly why,
but I wanted very much to cry the whole time.

Afterwards, John signed a lot of books. Somebody was reading _707 Scott
Street_, John's late 50s early 60s journal transcribed by Lewis Warsh and
published by Sun & Moon, and John asked to see it, not having seen it yet.
John told Eleni that it was good he remembered her from the novel.

Bill Luoma helped me walk John back to the hotel, we said we'd catch up
with Eleni and company at the Cedar. On the way, some people in costume
passed by. I asked John what he went as on Halloween when he was young. "A
dog ... then Frederick's of Hollywood." Bill asked John a few questions,
and I did too. We brought John to his room, a suite on I think the eleventh
floor. Bill hugged him and gave him a kiss, and I hugged him. John asked
whether I'd be bringing him to Port Authority. The plane ride in was too
hard for a man as old as him, he said, and the train is "very nice, very
beautiful. Too nice." So the bus.

The Cedar's remodeling job is terrible. No smoking, no big group-style
seating accomodated. The skylights are all right, I guess, and the girders
that replaced the logs make more sense, are less disturbing. The waitress
was really difficult. Bill pegged her as a sociology grad student. Eleni
didn't know Anna and I were engaged, so we got that attention bonus. Karl
Parker and Seph Rodney were too far away for me to talk to them. Laird Hunt
was talking to Eleni and the others.

The next day, I met John at check out time. Raymond Foye had been by.
Pharcyde was checking out. John came out of the elevator, we signed out,
and caught a Honda cab. I told John his reading was very beautiful, and he
said "Well, you get used to the failures." I asked him if he would like me
to call someone in Boston to come pick him up from the bus stop, and he
said "No, it's good for me to do things like that for myself now and then."
Seeing a lucid interval open up, I asked him about some of the long lines,
and he said, "Yes, he was a stocky man who made hats, and was a
transvestite by the Canadian border." The cab arrived at Port Authority,
and he held the place on line while I bought him a pack of Kents. We waited
as the ticket clerks flirted with the teenage girls going back to Boston. I
got John a ticket about three minutes before the bus left, and we got down
to the gate as they were boarding the last five people. We hugged, and he
said, "You get home safely now. I'll see you again before long."

Does "sound great" on paper, which leads me to believe it would look, or
read great in performance as well.  I think that's the point -- to
synthesize eye/ear engagements with the word.  Can't imagine that would be
boring in any format.

i just received my copy of GRAIN today. i realize that this an american
based talkgroup but i must ask: the new poems i read today have a real
feel of landscape, climate and enviroment that become a very comfortable
parentheses within which the voice frolics and grooves.

my query is twofold. are there any western american writers that i could
read that use the harsh isolation as a springboard for verse.(i don't mean
cowboy poetry)?  (2) are there any prairie poets who,have been able to
transcend the lingo of the farm/slough/seasons/quanset(sp?)
hut/hockey/trapping/chiasmustic seasonal changes. as a transplanted gopher
chaser i am finding it harder to find a voice that somehow negotiates the
two.

cheers,
kevin

Subject:      queer beats

speaking of john wieners (thank you jordan for your lovely portrait) i went to
the queer beats symposium in sf this past weekend.  kevin k was one of the
convener/symposiacs and he looked lovely in a beige suit w/ his hair falling
debonairly over one eye.  hints of mod london era.  it was raining as it had
been in minneapolis but twas 30 degrees warmer which made a big difference.  i
fretted over lipstick color and bought a new one at a place called "escentuals"
which we don' have in mpls, but it didn't really work with my shirt, whose color
i keep mistaking for more brickish than it is, in fact its red is more bluish.
however nobody said anything derogatory about my lipstick at least not to my
face throughout the entire day.  so let's see: first panel: very smart earl
jackson jr who i barely recognized, who used to work at umn and now at ucsc,
talked about burroughs cutup as a specifically gay strategy. steve silberman
gave a sweet talk about allen g's relative "emotional blankness" during his
later erotic lyrics and other stuff, also a critique of kerouac's gay scenes in
cody.  bruce x (formerly boone) was touchingly abject speaking of touching
abjection, notably wieners, with much late-antiquity and some bataille musings
on the relationship of writerly and sexual masochism's place in religious
aspiration.  boone is a formidably well read person.  so is jackson. last but
first, the magnificent lenore kandel made a rare appearance and talked about the
trial of the Love Book, in which legal officials seriously argued over whether
angels have sex and if there was sex after death.  then there was lunch, which
were grilled vegetable sandwiches, good but too oily.  i palled around w/
michael davidson and met bob gluck, and kevin introduced me to scott watson who
had known russell fitzgerald who had known bob kaufman.  then the next panel
featured davidson, who gave a nice queerified version of his Orono paper that
had some guys behind me oohing and ahhing and saying that talk made the whole
conference for them.  a guy who looked younger than he was, in hiphop ski cap,
read a memoir about his friendship w/ burroughs.  ginsberg showed up in the
audience to hear him.  then a cute guy from dartmouth, ricardo ortiz, talked
about john rechy and jim morrison, postulating an aesthetic relationship between
them by way of L.A. hustler culture.  it was charming and fun but probably the
least convincing of all of the papers up to that point, not that its implausible
but that it was sketchy.  then harold norse, me, and scott watson.  harold read
from his wonderful memoir that has gone out of print like everything else he's
written, scott watson showed slides of north beach artists like fran herndon,
jess and tom fields etc, while postulating smartly and too modestly that gay
sensibility of the time was manifest in a reimagining of childhood.  i talked
about bob kaufman and russell fitzgerald, using plato's symposium as a frame.  i
did n't get to the second part of my paper, the "influence study" part, so was
mostly gossippy.  of course i felt that my paper was the weakest of the day but
i was having such a good time i didn't care.  then a nice dinner at gluck's
house, where i got to shmooze w/ kush, dodie, scott watson and bruce x, whom i
kept disappointing by not having read various late antiquity philosophers.  it
had stopped raining by the time i left bob gluck's and it was warm.  sf is truly
magical.--md --kevin, do you have anything to add?

 The interim decision was made by the licensing sub-committee of Westminster council after members were given a private screening at a central London theatre.  They have promised to review the ban later this year when the film, directed by David Cronenberg, is considered by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).  The board decides what rating the film, may have but it also has the power to ban it from British cinemas. <p>
 Westminster councillors made their decision despite a sustained campaign in support of the film by writers - such as Salman Rushdie. Fifty filmakers, including Mike Leigh and Duncan Kenworthy, the producer of Four Weddings and A Funeral, also expressed support for the production, which is based on a book by J G Ballard.<p>
 The council's decision dismayed the makers of Crash who said they will fight to have "this work of art" shown uncut in Britain. Chris Auty, the co-executive director, said he was optimistic that the final decision will rest with the BBFC.  "All we really want is that our work of art, which is how we think of this film from the bottom of our hearts, gets the opportunity to be seen in an uncut form by the British public," he said.<p>
 However, after watching the film, Cllr John Bull, the sub-committee chairman, said the BBFC should scrutinise three sections of the film: a sex scene with a woman in calipers, the final sex scene and the film hero's statement that car crashes were "fertilising" rather than destructive.  "The committee has serious concerns about the film," he said. "It is clearly better for the film to be awarded a certificate and we hope, therefore, the BBFC will properly address the councillors' concerns. However, the sub-committee would be reluctant for the film to be shown in Westminster in this form. Consequently, to preserve the council's position, we have decided as a purely interim measure to prohibit the film showing in Westminster."<p>
 Cllr Bull said that Westminster is not obliged to take the same view as the BBFC. "The council has the right, if they are still not satisfied, of looking at the film again and preventing it being shown in Westminster - if it isn't cut."  Asked if he enjoyed the film, he said: "It's a good film. It's exceedingly well made, you can't take that away. If you are asking me personally whether I enjoyed the film, I can be quite honest, I could live without it. I don't like all these sex scenes and car crashes. It's not me, but then you have to remember I am a senior citizen."<p>
 Cllr Anne Barns said she was also concerned about the film's content. "I am extremely worried about the impact it might have on 18- or 19-year-olds who think themselves very clever and tend to like fast cars, and probably put two and two together and possibly try things out," she said.<p>
 But Cllr David Avery disagreed. "I certainly don't think this is a film which will encourage crime or disorder or racial hatred against any section of society," he said. "I would have thought it was allowable viewing for adults if they don't mind degradation and violence towards women and dogs."<p>
 BBFC members have yet to see Crash, which stars James Spader, Holly Hunter and Rosanna Arquette. The film was given a British premiere under special licence at the London Film Festival and won the special jury prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival.<p>
 While those most closely connected to the film project insist it should be shown uncut, J G Ballard, who also wrote Empire of The Sun, took news of the temporary ban calmly yesterday. "Modest cuts are acceptable to me as long as they don't reduce the film to shreds," he said.  "If Chris Auty feels strongly that he wants to fight for the whole film to be shown, good luck to him. But I would like people to see the film and no film depends on two or three minutes." <p>

The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book has been out of print for many years, but Southern
Illinois has recently decided to resissue it. I think the new printing (with
a new color for the cover) will be out this Spring.

I have received several of the harrassing messages from chronotope.com but
don't know where they are coming from or why. I hit reply and sent the whole
messages back to the source asking that the sender stop sending out such

else it can be responded to it at this point.

This is Dodie Bellamy.  I wrote to the poetics list earlier about how to
stop these messages, but my message hasn't appeared.  The originator is not
from chronotope.com but from pair.com:

Looking at the content of these messages I believe they are from
filch--he's mentioned in them for sure.  Per the suggestions I gave to this

This is Dodie Bellamy.

To those of you fellow listservers who are being spammed by filch and want
to do something about it, this is what I've read you should do:

You send the message with full headers to <postmaster> at the origininating
account, in this case:

postmaster@pair.com

Frankly, I don't know if this will work with pair.com since they are
different than a regular service provider.  (If you ever get one of these
spams from aol, the address is <abuse@aol.com>.)

You should begin with something like the following:

I received the following unsolicited bulk email ("spam"), which apparently
originated from your site. Please take appropriate action to ensure this
doesn't happen again.

For some reason no poets (other than the dark barn variety) leap to
mind.  But the creative non-fiction work "The Solace of Open Spaces"
by Gretel Ehrlich uses the isolation of Wyoming to create a rather
incredible metaphor for devastation and healing.  You might check it
out.  Grain, by the way, is a lovely magazine.

when you ask abut western american writers, i think of richard hugo,
meridel le sueur, bruce weigl, lorine neidecker, joy harjo, carl sandburg
(i know it is fashionable to dump on him, but while there are some pretty
bad poems, there are some very lovely ones too.  when i have midwestern
nostalgia, i sometimes read him); for prose, raymond carver, tim o'brien,
larry heineman, laura ingalls wilder, frontier women's diaries, a book
about the infamous donner party by Ruth Whitman (that is poetry)...

NEW YORK CITY SEEKS EVICTION OF LOWER EAST SIDE ARTS SPACE

ABC No Rio is a community-based arts center, performance space
and gallery located at 156 Rivington Street in Manhattan. It has
been a fixture on the Lower East Side for more than sixteen
years, is internationally known as a venue for emerging artists,
and is committed to presenting alternative and non-commercial art
and performance, poetry readings, music and film & video
screenings. The space is available to the community for meetings
and workshops, and is home to the NYC chapter of FOOD NOT BOMBS,
an organization that serves food to those in need. For the past
two summers ABC No Rio has hosted art classes for neighborhood
children. Now this sixteen-year-old community institution is once
again threatened with eviction by New York City's Department of
Housing Preservation & Development (HPD).

Three times since June, 1995 ABC No Rio has, in court, thwarted
attempts by HPD to evict ABC No Rio and the tenants occupying the
residential units of the building. A fourth proceeding was
initiated by HPD this past June. At a hearing on August 23 ABC No
Rio's Motion for Dismissal was denied. An eviction hearing was
scheduled for September 30, but on September 17 HPD attorneys
submitted a Motion for Summary Judgement, an attempt to deny No
Rio a hearing on the matter of the eviction. In response ABC No
Rio legal counsel cross-moved to stay the eviction proceeding.
Following a hearing on October 17 Judge Leona Freedman "took it
under submission." ABC No Rio now awaits Judge Freedman's
decision.

Back in April, '96 ABC No Rio brought forth an Article 78
Petition in State Supreme Court seeking to nullify the City
Council resolution used by HPD to justify the eviction. On
December 7, 1995 the New York City Council declared that 156
Rivington Street, No Rio's premises, was a "blight" on the
community, "constituted a serious and growing menace," and
"impeded or arrested the sound growth and development of the
municipality;" they then approved the Urban Development Action
Area Project (UDAAP) promoted by HPD and sponsored by property
developers Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE).

ABC No Rio's Article 78 challenges this City Council resolution
on statutory and First Amendment grounds. The petition argues,
and the facts support, that the City has consistently acted in
bad faith in its dealings with ABC No Rio and that the intent of
the UDAAP approved for the site is retaliatory in response to ABC
No Rio's exercise of constitutionally protected speech.

Ever since its inception in 1980 ABC No Rio has been critical of
New York City housing policies and, in general, has supported
culture of dissent. In recent years it has held events to raise
funds for Lower East Side pirate radio, and for the East
Thirteenth Street squatters and provided its space to them for
their legal and strategic planning meetings. In its own
discontented relationship with the City and HPD ABC No Rio has
over the years staged protests and demonstrations at HPD
headquarters; aired its grievances to the press and to public and
elected officials; and sought redress and relief in the courts.

On August 8 No Rio's Article 78 was assigned to Justice Charles
E. Ramos. If the petition is not summarily dismissed it may be
possible to stay the eviction. On October 22 No Rio legal counsel
appeared before Justice Ramos for oral arguments, and now awaits
his decision as to whether or not a hearing will be scheduled.

On New Year's Day in 1980 a group of more than thirty artists
occupied an abandoned building on Delancey Street on the Lower
East Side and mounted the REAL ESTATE SHOW, an art exhibit
commenting on the skyrocketing rents for both housing and art
space, and the causes of that problem. The show was quickly shut
down by the police and the artwork confiscated, generating both
protest and publicity. Eager to avoid continued bad press, the
City, through the Department of Housing Preservation and
Development (HPD), entered into negotiations with the artists and
offered them the storefront and basement at 156 Rivington Street,
the space that would become ABC No Rio.

Over the coming years ABC No Rio was host to an incredible
spectrum of artistic expression dealing with war, poverty,
homelessness, drugs, sex, violence, and the politics of housing
and real estate. ABC No Rio was founded by artists committed to
political and social engagement and the space has retained those
values to the present.

In the mid-eighties ABC No Rio was part of the nexus of venues
for the burgeoning East Village performance scene, and in the
late-eighties was instrumental in the resurgence of spoken word
and performance poetry in New York. At the turn of the decade ABC
No Rio became active in the hardcore music scene and instituted a
policy of not booking racist, sexist or homophobic bands. ABC No
Rio is one of the best-loved punk venues in the world.

ABC No Rio enjoys neighborhood, city-wide, national and
international support. In 1990 Kunstlerhaus in Hamburg, Germany
mounted the show 10 YEARS, 7 DAYS, a celebration of ABC No Rio's
first decade. More recently, the founding of ABC No Rio played an
important part in the CULTURAL ECONOMIES show which was at the
Drawing Center in New York in the Spring of 1996. ABC No Rio has
been the subject of many articles in the press and dissertations
by critics and academics. In the summer of 1995 ABC No Rio
gathered more than 2,500 signatures on petitions and hundreds of
letters of support were sent on No Rio's behalf to the municipal
authorities.

This past September ABC No Rio organized ENDANGERED SPACES: ABC
NO RIO EVICTION ACTION WEEK-END, an event that included an
installation of visual art, music, performance, and a
demonstration/public speak-out at the steps of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. On that week-end,in solidarity with ABC No Rio,
artists and squatters in Prague demonstrated at the U.S.
Consulate there.

The residential units above ABC No Rio have been occupied off and
on for years as No Rio has become more and more connected to the
local squat movement. At present 156 Rivington Street is a fully
occupied building. Many squatters are involved with ABC No Rio
and No Rio has organized many events benefitting the squats. The
threat to ABC No Rio and the threat to the squats are one and the
same. ABC No Rio has always had a difficult and turbulent
relationship with the City and HPD. ABC No Rio and its supporters
believe that this attempt to evict is politically motivated and
retaliatory, an attempt to punish an arts collective for long-
term opposition to City policies.

The impending eviction of ABC No Rio takes place in the context
of escalating hostilities in the neighborhood. Over the years the
example of No Rio's seizure of land (the 1980 REAL ESTATE SHOW)
has inspired a whole generation of squatters. Today many of those
squatters are facing eviction. In August HPD evicted the
remaining squatters on East Thirteenth Street. The City and State
are moving towards privatizing public housing and eliminating
rent stabilization. Other cultural and community centers are
facing eviction. Recently the police arrested more than thirty
people in Tompkins Square Park for violating an unconstitutional
regulation prohibiting the assembly of more than twenty people.
The Lower East Side is once again under siege for the sake of a
Disney-fied bohemia.

Artists, activists, squatters and other ABC No Rio supporters
contend that places such as ABC No Rio are part of the "quality
of life" in New York City. Will the administration of NYC Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani allow ABC No Rio to thrive and survive? Or will
the bureaucrats and politicians commit another "quality of life"
crime?

odd but my yesterday-post re western poetas never seems to have it --
three such critters come to mind immediately : Lorine Niedecker, Ed
Dorn, Ken Irby. This last one is to my mind one of the most underarted,
under-read, neglected poets in the country. Bobby Byrd wrote some
interesting work around those western spaces early on (Here; North
Atlantic Books 1975) though i don't know the more recent work.

Don Byrd, though an East Coast resident for some 25 years by now, can't
get dem thar hills & plains out of his system, so they & the sense of
place & space they give keep popping up throughout his work. Here's the
opening of the poem _Aesop's Garden_ from the book by that title (see
also his _The Great Dimestore Centennial_):

"out
      under the blue stars
                                             Arcadia sleeps
                in the white farm house

                and fevered

                                                        reported

        satyrs dancing
                                     on the congealed
                                                inland
                                                                oceans"

....

        "America is a bowl
closed east and west
                                        by mountains
                        and this
                                        is the sky

For all those who claimed that the dildo thread was irrelevant to our
business here, here's a surprising connection from some recent reading:

Originally the leather dildo was worn by comic actors in the satyr
plays, through which it's connected to Dionysus and subversive, sexual
hilarity. It's also connected to the grotesque crone Baubo^ who
exposed her bare bum and genitals to Demeter, making the goddess laugh
and thus forget her grieving for Persephone. The name Baubo^ was used
for the dildo. One of Baubo^'s other names was Iambe, the origin
of "iambus", the limping meter.

So there you have it--poetics and dildoes have long gone together.

Mike is right.  And to help underline the suppressed connection between
poetics and dildoes, here's a poem that seems to have fallen--well,
between the cracks:

Ars Poetica

     A dildo should be palpable and mute
     As a globed fruit

     Dumb
     As old medallions to the thumb

     Silent as the sleeve-worn stone
     Of casement ledges where the moss has grown--

     A dildo should be wordless
     As the flight of birds

               *

     A dildo should be motionless in time
     As the moon climbs

     Leaving, as the moon releases
     Twig by twig the night-entangled trees,

     Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,
     Memory by memory the mind--

     A dildo should be motionless in time
     As the moon climbs

               *

     A dildo should be equal to:
     Not true

     For all the history of grief
     An empty doorway and a maple leaf

     For love
     The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea--

     A dildo should not mean
     But be


          Archiball MacLeash

Thanks, Rachel, for moving MacFlush poem.  I, for one, would love to get
away from the endless abstract pro-dildo anti-dildo debates, the rambling
personal memoirs & gossip on this list.  We need more close dildo readings!
When are we going to have some discussion of neglected poet Harvey Spamlife,
author of "The Dildo Passages"?  Or Louise Glug-glug of UPA (United
Pacified Colonies), whose remarkable oeuvre ("egg" in French, I've heard)
remains in dusty archives of the State University of Lower West Shambletown?
Why?  It's a disgrace. When will the "literary establishment" wake up
to the real advances of these writers of the soi-disant "Dildo School"?
I ask you?  And again - I ask you?

i just received my copy of GRAIN today. i realize that this an american
based talkgroup but i must ask: the new poems i read today have a real
feel of landscape, climate and enviroment that become a very comfortable
parentheses within which the voice frolics and grooves.

my query is twofold. are there any western american writers that i could
read that use the harsh isolation as a springboard for verse.(i don't mean
cowboy poetry)?  (2) are there any prairie poets who,have been able to
transcend the lingo of the farm/slough/seasons/quanset(sp?)
hut/hockey/trapping/chiasmustic seasonal changes. as a transplanted gopher
chaser i am finding it harder to find a voice that somehow negotiates the
two.

cheers,

At the risk of once again demonstrating my philistine sensibilities, I'd
have to say that I do admire quite a few of the Cowboy Poets--Bill Jones,
Rod McQueary, Bill Shields, Jon Forrest Glade, John Dofflemeyer, Laurie
Wagner Buyer. And it's a remarkable thing, these days, to be able to draw a
rodeo-size crowd (sometimes over 10,000 folks) to hear a poetry reading...
especially in a low-population state like Wyoming.  Quite a few of these
poets are working cowboys and/or ranchers. (Buyer gets up every morning
before dawn, and sleeps in the barn during calving season.)  A few of them
have MFAs (Jon Forrest Glade was for a long time the editor of the _Owen
Wister Review_), but many don't.  Most of them are storytellers as well as
poets, and I've always liked a good story.

I've been waiting for this film for a while too.  Not just 'cause I've
liked Crash since it came out (though, like Pierre I like some other
Ballard works better) but 'cause David Cronenberg is one of my favorite
directors.  He's a master of turning dread of the everyday into terror.

I'd heard that the US distributor had held off on releasing the film in the
States til after the election, not wanting to be the focus of another Dole
v. Hollywood rant.

Perhaps Ted Turner's response to the film has to do with Jane Fonda not
being cast as the Liz Taylor fetish-figure in the story.

You might look at the Jeffers/Rexroth/Everson/Snyder nexus. Soem of Micahel
McClure's work. Small parts of Duncan/Blaser/Spicer.  Much of Joanne Kyger.
 Diane diPrima's _Wyoming Series_.

Lyn Hejinian's _My Life_.  Bob Grenier's _A Day At The Beach_.

Ken Irby writes from landscapes of the West (CA--"Jed Smith & the Way"),
Southwest (early work) & Kansas plains.  Look for _Catalpa_, _Relation_, &
_Max Douglas_. Ed Dorn's early stuff on the plains & Rockies. Tom Clark's
_The End of the Line_ & _Short History of the High Plains_ have probably been
gathered into one of his Black Sparrow books, though I don't know which.

Lorine Niedecker, writing from the midwest though not quite the plains, has
come to be emblematic of the isolated writer.

Nathaniel Tarn & Janet Rodney's _Alashka_ & Tarn's _At the Western Gates_.

Here in Sacramento, Julia Connor often writes out of the landscape. Look for
_Corresponding Flowers_, _The Delta Poem_, _Making Tha Good_ & an extended
meditation on the Central Valley, _A Canto For the Birds_, where she writes:

bruce boone had adopted the x to see if it wd make him famous.  he's published
on gay stuff (i saw one article many years ago on frank ohara and gay language)
and probably other stuff i don't know.  translator, told me abt a french author
pascale ? he's translated for lapidus press.  others here probably know more
than i.  i was on an mla panel w/ him and m davidson lo thse many years ago on
robert duncan and gay community (in 1987); i was the only chick, and a grad
student too.  his paper seemed to be quite a bit of hermetic insider-knowledge
stuff about internicene poetry-politics that i didn't understand.  he's an
old-style intellectual with a wide range of interests and sources, not a young
groovoid or trendoid.  md

Yes for Dorn & Irby, but in what sense is Niedecker a "western" poet? I
always thought western meant at least west of the Mississippi, and
increasingly, west of the great plains states. But that's coming from
someone who grew up somewhere near the middle, in my case Oklahoma.

In quite a different way I would add Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, at least in
terms of using the western desert landscape, although "harsh" isn't the term
I would choose. Likewise for some of my own work.

Subject: Meridel Le Sueur: 1900-1996



Friends,

Very sad to inform the many Iowa Citians who were friends of Meridel
LeSueur that she died yesterday. For those who attended her last appearence
in Iowa City, at Old Brick, during her final Iowa Tour will remember her
telling us:

"I was born at the beginning of the swiftest and bloodiest century at
Murray, Iowa, in a white square puritan house in the corn belt, of two
physically beautiful people who had come west through the
Indian and the Lincoln country, creating the new race of the
Americas by enormous and rugged and gay matings with the Dutch,
the Indian, the Irish; being preachers, abolitionists, agrarians, radical
lawyers on the Lincoln, Illinois, circuit.

"Dissenters and democrats and radicals through five generations.

Meridel LeSueur - 1900-1996

That night at Old Brick Meridel spoke about the years of being
blacklisted by McCarthy and the difficult time she and her children
had trying to survive during the reign of the House UnAmerican
Activities Committee. At one point her agent told her she could sell
more books if she would write like Ernest Hemingway. She responded "I
would, but I have better things to do with my time than write about
fighting, fishing and fucking."

A feminist decades before the term entered everyday use, she spent her
life on the front line fighting for the rights of women, minorities,
Native Americans, gays and the disabled.

A review of her most recent book, THE DREAD ROAD, and an article about her
can be found at www.bookzen.com.  Both have been downloaded by newspapers
from around the world, along with embarassingly  few from the U.S.

The book review is at: <http://www.bookzen.com/books/0000066r1.html>

The article is at: <http://www.bookzen.com/books/0000066a1.html>

Both were written by Chuck Miller. When Meridel read them she was so
touched she cried. It was rare when anything as insightful as Miller's
article and review had ever been written about her. After many hours
of audio and video recording of Meridel over a period of 13 years it
was the first time I witnessed her crying.

But what a life...

As a young girl she marched with Mother Bloor in Colorado to protest
the massacre of miners and their families at Ludlow; during her early
teens lived with Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman; grew up a
prolitarian writer who counted as her friends: Agnes Smedley,
Josephine Herbst, Nelson Algren, Grace Lumpkin, Upton Sinclair, Jack
Conroy, Richard Wright, Zona Gale, Theodore Drieser, Kenneth Fearing,
Mari Sandoz...Boris Israel and too many others to name here. Her
grandfather, whose wife was identified only as a squaw--since the
state of Ohio didn't include names of Native Americans who married
white men--was a friend of John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed)....

I've gone on too long.

I'll close with this quote from Miller's article:

"Henry Miller, Keraouc and Bukowski are all dead. There is no one else
left of LeSueur's stature in American literature today. She stands
alone, a giant, waiting to be discovered by her own nation."

Amen to thjat, or rather, A(wo)men!

If anyone does not  have access to the World Wide Web E-mail me and I will
send the article and the review by return mail.

All of Meridel's books are in Special Collections at the main UI library
if the Iowa City Public Library doesn't have them.

Some people have contacted me and asked if they can share thoughts
about Meridel and have them posted where their friends could find them
and respond. We're setting it up with all comments being printed and
copies being placed in the LeSueur collections in MN, WI & IA.

For what it's worth, Wallace Stegner marks the west as beginning at the
100th meridian, which I believe falls right down the middle of Oklahoma (but
I don't have an atlas handy). Unfortunately, I can't remember why he
designates it this way.

Kevin's query begs the larger question of the relationship between geography
and poesis. Clearly, some poets feel compelled to confront "landscape", with
all that entails - psychologically, politically, culturally, biologically,
historically, etc. - in their work; but just as clearly, some poets would
write the same kind of poetry regardless of where they lived.

Engaging "the land" is really just a metaphor for engaging the self, isn't
it? "Harsh isolation" is just as much a factor of living in the Lower East
Side as it of living in Wyoming or Alaska. I wake up before dawn every day
too. And when the wind is just right - that is to say wrong - the whole town
of Boulder smells like a manure field. That's harsh, baby!

Yes for Dorn & Irby, but in what sense is Niedecker a "western" poet? I
always thought western meant at least west of the Mississippi, and
increasingly, west of the great plains states. But that's coming from
someone who grew up somewhere near the middle, in my case Oklahoma.

Have you any such faculty as Socrates had, who in every conversation could
bring his companions to his own purpose? How could you have it? You must
therefore be carried along by the crowd. And why are they more powerful
than you? Becasue they utter their corrupt discourses from sincere
opinion, and you your good ones only from your lips. Hence they are
without strength or life; and it is disgusting to hear your exhortations
and your poor miserable virtue proclaimed uyp hill and down. Thus it is
that the corwd gets the better of you; for sincere opinhion is always
strong, always invincible. Therefore before wise sentiments are fixed in
you, and you have acquired some power of self-defence, I advise you to be
cautious in your associations ... otherwise, if you have any impressions
made on you in the schools, they will melt away daily like wax before the
sun. Get away then, far from the sun, while you have these waxen opinions.

I'll second Charles A on Mei-mei as a western poet.  Whenever I read or hear
one of her poems I think I'm in New Mexico; whenever I drive in New Mexico I
think I'm reading one of Mei-mei's poems.  which are almost entirely
abstract (so it's no mean feets) : it's something about how the planes of
words are like the planes of mountains (plains of sky?) over in NM (I never
think of Mei-mei when I drive in AZ).

(and then there's /Tan-Tien/, which Charles published.  a whole NOTHER story.)

Interesting post by Maria Damon about last weekend's "Queer Beats"
conference.  Thank you, Maria.  I was one of the organizers and can report
we were all enormously pleased by what went on up on the stage and down in
the audience.

>kevin k was one of the convener/symposiacs and he looked lovely in a beige
>suit w/ his hair falling debonairly over one eye.

Please note this suit was by Joseph Abboud ...."hints of mod london era"
for sure.  As for Maria's lipstick it was beautiful and well applied.  So
was your talk, Maria, you do not give yourself enough credit.  I could feel
the audience gasp in surprise as point by point you outlined the main
points of the triangulated affair between Bob Kaufman and the painter
Russell FitzGerald, who was actually living with Jack Spicer at the time
and served as the model for his "Billy the Kid."  Anne Murphy was in the
audience (Anne, familiar to North Beach denizens, is famous locally as the
last girlfriend of Neal Cassady) and rushed up afterwards, "I knew Bob
Kaufman for twenty years and never knew he had sex with a man!  But it all
ties in!"

My own panel was on "Queer Identity."  I was the moderator but what a
difficult job.  On the one hand I had Michael Davidson giving a wonderful
talk on the Cold War poetics of the 50's...  seemingly unaware of Allen
Ginsberg's presence as he delivered one or two blistering remarks on
Ginsberg's 50's-style misogyny, etc; then when the lights came up and he
saw AG he seemed to grow pale.  "Don't worry Michael," whispered Mark
Ewert, another panelist.  "He's a big boy, he can take it."  And on my
other side there was Ricardo Ortiz with these huge forearms.  As Aaron
Shurin pointed out once you noticed the forearms there wasn't anything else
in the room, and Ricardo seemed to play with them like two big hams.

>a guy who looked younger than he was, in hiphop ski cap,
>read a memoir about his friendship w/ burroughs.  ginsberg showed up in the
>audience to hear him.

This was Mark Ewert, who is 24 and looks about 14.  He's writing an
autobiography about his relationship with Burroughs and Ginsberg and read
part of it on the panel.  I think it all went down very well.  Earl Jackson
Jr. spoke about the recent publication of "Jerome: After the Pageant" a
glossy coffee table-like book which reproduces many paintings by the late,
extravagant drag queen artist Jerome Caja, who died here in San Francisco
last year of AIDS, then launched into his deconstruction of Burroughs'
"cut-up" method, which persuaded many if not all.  Brilliant speech, and
Jackson Jr has new contact lenses which give his eyes a strange, eerie
cobalt X ray glare, as though Ralph Fiennes was playing an alien on the X
Files.

Lenore Kandel almost stole the show.  I don't know how old she is now, but
she exuded 10 tons of warmth and glamor and humor.  She is a fantastic
presence and altogether modest about her amazing career.  During the
question period I asked about about what it was like to work with Kenneth
Anger on "Lucifer Rising" (which she says she has never seen).  Those of
you who have seen the various versions of this film will recall that at one
point, in some versions of the cut, Kandel is seen descending a long
staircase, utterly drawn and stark and haunted a la Barbara Steele or Anna
Karina, carrying a goldfish bowl in one arm.  Kandel told us that this
goldfish was her own and she was too nervous about it to leave it at home
on this particular day of filming.  Thus from what accidents is born great
cinema!!!

It was a shame that Bruce X's paper was cut short by his own long
windedness just as he was apparently about to tie together the late 20th
century affinity for masochism, the disintegration of John Wieners under
drugs and electroshock, the way the paintings of Jay De Feo and Russell
FitzGerald seem to have been designed to fall apart gradually, and how this
all related to the gnostic philosophers, but I'm going on too long myself
and just want to add....

In one year's time we will be organizing a similar conference/symposium on
"Lesbian Beats" and if anyone has any ideas, or wants to help, with time or
money or whatever, please contact me or Dodie Bellamy at this e-mail
address, dbkk@sirius.com.  And thanks to all who attended and helped, etc.
It was great and all had an unbelievably good time.

Thanks!

For all those anti-dildo party-poopers who claimed that that thread
was irrelevant to our serious avant-garde business here, here's a
surprising connection from some recent reading:

Originally the leather dildo was worn by comic actors in the satyr
plays, through which it's connected to Dionysus and subversive, sexual
hilarity. It's also connected to the grotesque crone Baubo^ who
supposedly exposed her bare bum and genitals to Demeter, making the
goddess laugh and thus forget her grief. The name Baubo^ was also used
for the dildo, and one of Baubo^'s other names was Iambe, the origin
of "iambus", the limping meter.

So there you have it folks--poetics and dildoes have long gone
together.

Seriously,
Mike

I'd add Wendell Berry to poets living on the land well worth reading.
That condo complex off campus where Ken Irby lives is about as
"western" as the Ear Inn, but yes, you can (why not) get in god damn
big car and see the space if you're willing to go a few miles from Mt.
Oread in just about any direction.

I want to second Pierre on Kenneth as one of our most underappreciated
treasures.

When I was growing up in Berkeley, I thought "midwest" meant Reno.
Everything east of Salt Lake meant "back east." Now that I'm really
"back east," I hear people speak of Buffalo as the midwest.

ron, as a bred-in-the-bone californian who has only recently arrived on the east
coast, what are your impressions of its geocultural characteristics, i.e. how is
it "regional"? i'm curious since i'm such a bred-in-the-bone easterner and can't
see it as an ethnographer/outsider.--md

Buffalo IS the "mid-west", and in that light, another interesting and
underrated "western" poet is Sherwood Anderson. Check out
_Mid-American Chants_.

i was about to recommend (and was surprized nobody else had) alexi sherman,
adrian c. louis, and a few other _native_ americans... but as i thought about
their work, while certainly drawing on th expanse of  western landscapes,
they (broad generalization) seem more concerned w/ a sense of community with
and in that landscape, rather than "harsh isolation".  could be of necessity,
considering the general forces that actively disrupt native community; but also
a contrast to th traditional eurocentric vision of the western "wilderness" as
hostile other...

_Grain_ is a magazine from Saskatchewan (which should explain everything).
There are a lot of poets of land & inheritance out west in Canada; the
problem is what some of us have called 'prairie anecdotal' poems, which
seem not to move much beyond broken prose & unscarred narrative.
Another form that's done a lot in Canada is the 'documentary poem' & there
is an interesting example of that from Gary Holthaus, in his _Circling
Back_, full of documents about the settling/conquest of the American West.

Lineaments of Desire


The construct/gender program has become increasingly complex. Each line or
line-pair below represents a test-case. Because I concentrate on the code,
the actual entries become a matter of preconscious or autonomic writing.
The result is an odd self-portrait or production, more accurate than any-
thing I could deliberately produce. So indeed a different gender is con-
structed, one _across_ the entries, a matter of interpenetration or trans-
gression. The output is from the last three days.

If you're in New York, come to Poetry City tonight. Shelly Kraut will be
reading her poems, and Pam Grossman will be reading _her_ poems. As Kenny
Goldsmith's favorite street schizo poet Orion once noted, "Shelly Kraut is
the true Santa Claus." Pam is often found among the Unbearables. As usual,
the party part is as important as the reading part. It's at 7. Thanks,

Thanks for mentioning Jack Collom, Jay! He's a terrific poet and has indeed
addressed matters of landscape, ecology and the West in ways which no one, I
dare say even Gary Snyder, has handled with such acuity, wit & wildly
associative power.

Jack is gravely under-recognized, I feel, so I'll take a moment to plug his
latest books, _What A Strange Way of Being Dead_, (which I reviewed earlier
this year in ABR), and which is a sustained meditation on our relationship
to Nature; the uncanny, giddily lyrical _The Task_; and _Wicker_ , a
marvellous collaboration with Lyn Hejinian. All of these are published by
Rodent Press, which may now be defunct, I'm not sure. At any rate, they're
available from the Naropa Institute's bookstore: Ph # 303-444-0202.

Lyn Hejinian's new work A Border Comedy deals with the West, the
Frontier, and borders in exciting ways.  According to Kevin Killian she
recently read a portion of it in conjuction with an exhibit of archival
photos of the frontier at SFMOMA.  Jack Collom has any number of
wonderful poems in many forms about Colorado and the Western plains in
general.

... and why not mention as well Thomas McGrath? There are passages in his
work, in particular _Echoes Inside The Labyrinth_ ,which invoke for me the
most salient quality of The Region Formerly Known As The Great American
Desert, what Bachelard calls "intimate immensity," a term which both
complements and to a certain extent undermines the idea of "harsh
isolation."

I'd add Wendell Berry to poets living on the land well worth reading.
That condo complex off campus where Ken Irby lives is about as
"western" as the Ear Inn, but yes, you can (why not) get in god damn
big car and see the space if you're willing to go a few miles from Mt.
Oread in just about any direction.

I want to second Pierre on Kenneth as one of our most underappreciated
treasures.

When I was growing up in Berkeley, I thought "midwest" meant Reno.
Everything east of Salt Lake meant "back east." Now that I'm really
"back east," I hear people speak of Buffalo as the midwest.

In response to part one of "my query is twofold. are there any western
american writers that i could
read that use the harsh isolation as a springboard for verse.(i don't mean
cowboy poetry?"
What I think is difficult about this query is an assumed "harsh isolation"
definition of the circumstance of "western writing."
I suspect the idea of "harsh isolation" and "the west" is not about western
writing in any large geographic sense. For example it doesn't apply to the
Pacific Slope or the California  side of at least the northern parts of the
Sierra - which hisitorically has been much associated with notions of the
sublime, nature's land of plenty, Eden etc.  And it doesn't apply to the
southwest - New Mexico, Arizona, at least the geographic parts of those
states that that have strong non-Anglo Hispanic and Indian presences -
 Anastasi, Hopi, Navajo etc. - and all the attendant histories and myths.
  The "harsh isolation" gets more attached to Nevada's Great Basin - and its
various "high desert" extensions into Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Colorado,
Sothern California, etc. - where the "bleakness" appears to be much less
impacted by "cultures" - Indian, Anglo or otherwise. Though I'm not as
familiar with the plains states, from Dakotas to Texas, "The harsh isolation"
there perhaps has a different character. I would agree that Ed Dorn, Ken Irby
- students of Olson -  have purposely "lived" through the land (its history,
geological patterns and shapes, etc.) and written moving work within that
scope in which the individual, and his moves, are directly shaped, by the
facts of the landscape.
In terms of the Great Basin, however, the myth of "harsh isolation" - its
bleakness as a back drop or set to the personal
experience - belies the history of the use of the space. Most every square
inch of the Great Basin has been scoped and used for its mineral and
underground water wealth. Much less visibly the military (for nuclear
testing, bombing practice) maintains a huge presence across the terrain. (I
think the military owns about 80% of Nevada).The land's isolation is belied
by corporate, government and military habitation. Some of the prose writers
(Terry Tempest Williams) have gone after the cancerous nuclear consequences
of this impact. But I believe its the photographers (Robert Adams, Peter
Goins, Mark Klett - and other members of the "re-photography project - and
Richard Misrach ) who have done the investigating - some of it quite brave -
and taken a close look at the facts of what has occured within these parts of
the West. Among current poets, Laura Moriarty has some great stuff about some
of these landscapes. Occasionally I think Kirk Robertson - the current poet
laureate of Nevada - captures the character of living within "basin and
range."
This is a windy answer. Primarily I want to suggest that "harsh isolation"
puts a personal and lyric limit on a area of the west that is much more
complicated and pivotal (economically, culturally, etc.) in terms of national
consequence - and its probably a good question as to why more poets -- to my
knowledge - in the large have not touched on the subject, and photographers
have.
Yes -- re Kevin Killian -- the current show, CROSSING THE FRONTIER (Sandy
Phillips, curator), an exploration of the use of the land in 19th and 20th
Century photographs (from the 100th Meridian to the Pacific) is a wonderful
and disturbing show at SF Museum of Modern Art- of which there is a good
catalog published by Chronicle Books. Not without elegance, it is a
definitely a post-sublime view and interpretation of Western landscapes.

Maria,

That sounds like a very interesting approach to _The Heat Bird_,which I only
recently obtained and am loving. Some of what your student refers to is
covered in a book called _American Ground Zero_, by Carole Gallagher, which
is imperative reading - as sad a book as one cld read.

yes; tho' on the subject of abstraction; i had a student in a class, who was
actually a history student, who wrote a wonderful paper on The Heat Bird as
a
critique of nuclear power/bomb development and the wreckage it wrought in
the
southwest...good research on a group of women in (nevada? colorado? new
mexico?)
who have suffered severe reproductive damage...etc.  very very grounded in
history and context.--md

Just looking for a little information here:

1) Is there an English edition of Benjamin's -One-Way Street- either
in print or likely to be found used?
2) Does anyone know of a source for -tapes- (I need a tape, not a

children?
3) Are large chunks of the collected writings still untranslated,
i.e. some of the -Konvoluts- (notes for the Arcades Project)?

William Everson might help. Check out his poems (Black Sparrow has

Crash has been out here for some months now. It's brilliant. I still think
about it almost every day. Its discussion of technology and the body in
Euro-American culture is unsurpassed in its complexity and insights. And
the use of the form of the pornographic film--wow. Definitely a must see,
though not for the weak of heart.

I had a cold but I bundled up and went down to Canessa Park Gallery in
downtown San Francisco, vowing not to talk excitedly at anybody lest I send
an overabundance of cold germs at them.

MC Avery Burns introduced Etel Adnan and she read first, a diminutive,
timid, sweet Palestinian lady who lives in Sausalito.  She read a sequence
of what she called "returns" from her new book, _Manifestations of the
Voyage_, written in 1988-9.  They're returns, she said, to the earth, left
behind since 1969 when humans walked on the moon.  Some of the lines I
caught were:

"exile, immigration, the voyage are the stations of knowledge"
"There is another kind of silence.  It belongs neither to the leaves nor to
the dead."
"I love rains which carry desires to oceans"
"my hair spins with sunflowers"
"I stand on a ladder between two infinities.
I don't know whether I'm in this world
or into its mirror."
"happiness was fierce on the beaches in late afternoons"
"Death is like a talk show"
"we carry the burden of subversion and astonishment"
"I go with speed and love into the night"
"how shall we transform pomegranite seeds into alchemical vapors?"
"alarmed by their excessive sap, the sky runs to the rescue, as a woman would"
"I saw authority changed into an ape-like adolescent"
"words became my landscape"
"when dawn explodes far and away, my body is near elimination"
"all the nigaras unleashed on a single cell in my brain"
"then it was time for ice cream and biscuits downtown"
"I came back to the heart of the halogen light.  The Greek Empress moves
forward, forward"
"immobility has doomed the voyage to nothingness"

After a break, writer and Mills College teacher Stephen Ratcliffe read from
3 works, _Sculpture_, _Conversation_, and _Ideas Mirror_ (named after
Drayton's sonnet sequence of 1590-1610).  The distinctive element I came
away from Stephen's reading with was his exploration of the appositive,
particularly the adjectival appositive.  Some of his lines were:

"space, blank, may be said to divide lines on a page"
"waking up elsewhere, in brackets"
"three red shapes swimming in place of philosophy"
an epigraph from Heidegger:  "whatever lingers awhile becomes present as it
lingers in the jointure...between a twofold absence"
"like a bird in place"
"two arms pulling into her"
"person upstairs, for example, before thinking"

The audience included Pamela Lu (who's reading with Charles Cantalupo at
Canessa this Sunday), Mary Burger, Robert Grenier, Steve Tills, Eric
Selland, Renee Gladman, Barbara Guest, and Margie Sloan.

Yes, Benjamin's "One Wat Street..." is in English, London, NLB, 1978.  =
"illuminations," "Reflections," etc. as well.  No English Trans. of =
"Passagen-Werk," or "Arcades Project,"  (Konvolut V, i believe) though i =

my understanding is that _One Way Street_ is still available from Verso in
England, but that it's out of print in the US.  Some selections from it,
you may know, are included in _Reflections_ (Schocken).

Maria--do you think there's this same sort of historical specificity in
/Empathy/, say?  I'd guess not but I don't really know.

(I chaired a strange panel--my fault no doubt--at the Tucson Poetry Festival
some years back--Mei-mei was one of the poets.  I didn't manage to ask
anything very useful, I think, but mentioned a la Ashbery, I dunno quite in
what connection anymore, that Kennth Koch used to say (in class) that
reading Ashbery was like: going up to his doorbell and ringing, being let
in, being given a fascinating if kinda quick tour of the apt., being all
warmed up and ready to settle down for a good talk and visit, and finding
oneself suddenly somehow back at JA's front door, hand shaken, shown out.
Mei-mei averred as how she went to visit JA once, and that's exactly what
actually happened.  I like that.  koan for some strange nation....

I am glad that this serious subject has again found its way back into our

highly important poem , H.D.'s "Dodona"" Part XII begins

Are these ashes in my hand

I am confident that experienced HD readers (such as M. B.) will know what

Actually, Maria, I was born in the shadows of the Hanford nuclear
reactor plant outside of southeastern Washington (as was Michael
Amnasan), roughly one year after its most famous product was dropped on
the people of Nagasaki.

But it's true that my mother's family goes back in the Berkeley/Oakland
areas into the 1880s.

The differences between Philly and Berkeley are too many to catalog and
I'm still coming across them every week if not every day. Some of the
more obvious seem to me to be:

The sledgehammer shift of seasons, nothing like the gliding subtleties
of California.

The sense of history: families that have been here two and three
hundred years (especially out where I am on the Main Line) have really
consolidated their hold on things.

No decent Mexican restaurants.

NFL starts in the afternoon on Sundays and lasts until after midnight.

You can drive through several states in a single afternoon.

50 zillion colleges hereabouts really shifts the balance between public
and private higher education (not sure what it means, but it must mean
somethin'). [I've been invited to do more things at Penn in 18 months
that I was at UC Berkeley in the last 18 years.]

NO good bookstores. I realize how spoiled I was to live one block from
Small Press Distribution (sob). I had the idea that you could look at
and browse and touch a book of poems before you bought it.

No real reading series here at all. Too close to NYC in one sense.
There's a big gap, so far as I can tell, between writers still in
college (Josh Schuster, who's on the list, has been the major mover
hereabouts; hopefully Louis Cabris and Gregg Biglieri [from New College
to Temple] will step things up some) and the older "mid-career" types
who live in Philadelphia for reasons other than that's the big city
where they moved to become poets. (i.e., people don't move to Philly
for that reason, they move to NYC or SF)

Liquor stores as a function of the state. Automobile registration as a
mom & pop shop (closest thing down here to NYC's bodegas).

The mafia as local spectator sport (we're a two-team town; NYC is a 5
team town -- they take free agency VERY seriously).

The Mummers ain't the Cockettes.

Children out here are taught to call people "Mr" & "Mrs" and their
parents will get mad at you if you suggest that they use your first
name.

Flag day is taken seriously (Betsy Ross was a local and is treated as
same).

Ed Rendell IS Dianne Feinstein (they even look alike).

People think that Krishna using her maiden name is one of those "kooky
California" things and so they just call her Mrs Silliman anyway.

Much better radio. You don't realize just how lousy San Francisco radio
is until you hear the choices out here (now if only we had a Pacifica
station).

You get four times the house for the same amount of money.

The earth don't shake. I see the kinds of supports that freeway
overpasses have here and shudder to imagine what would happen when and
if....

Brick as a building material. The automobile tire as the standard unit
of litter.

Really solid local poets, Julia Blumenreich, Gil Ott, Eli Goldblatt, a
lot of the folks around 6ix (in that sense, not unlike DC or San
Diego), as well as us transplants.

Creeks that would be called rivers if they were in California.
Mountains that are no larger than Albany Hill.

No baseball scores from the west coast.

The Amish and Mennonites and Quakers as an active presence in the
community and region. Black buggies with big orange triangles.

Old stone farm houses everywhere (beautiful to look at but they have
small rooms and problematic fixtures [electricity and plumbing as "add
ons"]).

Email as your primary contact with other poets....

Shovelling snow or raking leaves as a "must-do" chore.

What else?
Ron

thanks ron.  i relate to the mr and mrs part, except that since my dad was "dr

nextdoor neighbors for a while when i was very young let their kids call them by
their first names.  their daughter, my age, also told me that they "didn't
believe in spanking."  i assumed she was lying. spanking was like eating, not
something one believed in, but something that happened.--md

William Everson's big collected poems from Black Sparrow Press is called
/A Prodigious Thrust,/ one of those tit(il)les that always stops me in
amazement and I smack my forehead and go "I-don't-be-LIEVE-he called his

yes, there is a U.K. Verso edition of _One-Way Street and Other Wrtings_,
this is also true of the Baudelaire book, part of which is in _Illuminations_
-- St Mark's used to get them on the sly -- some American booksellers (a few)
have ability to get British books -- Olsson's in DC, more than one Boston
store seem to have that "connection." A good book search service might turn
those up, or maybe Serendipity in Berkeley. . . Much of _One-Way Street &
Other Writings_ is in _Reflections_--
tho in the Brit you get all of "One-Way Street," "A Small History of
Photography" and
"Edward Fuchs, Collector and Historian."


Harvard is bringing out over the next several years a Collected Benjamin, the
first one slated for this month-- don't know what it includes-- certainly the
Arcades Project will be represented. Verso's also supposed to be bringing out
a biography of Benjamin that's been very well received in Europe, not at work
so can't get you the author. I'll let the list know when these are available.

Speaking up for the northwest corner-- there's William Stafford, Theordore
Roethke, and less know 'regional' poets like George Venn and Laura Winter
(both write of the northwest's high deserts).

Yes, I remember that in 1966 John Wieners would read for about 15 minutes.
Once in Montreal, he read for 15 minutes, then took a long break (in nearby
bar) and then read the same poems, for another 15 minutes. You know, it was
okay!

The Electronic Poetry Center is listed on p. 34 of the current _Poets &
Writers_ magazine (Nov/Dec 1996). This issue has a several page feature on
"Literary E-Zines". Somewhat of a skewed treatment I'd say. (Lines something
like - a hot spot for the emerging new writer to first see publication and -
accepts previously published work and simultaneous submissions! This last
comment painting the electronic press as a kind of bastard second to print
and an easy score ... )

Another note, my review of _Poems for the Millennium_ is just out in the
most recent issue of _Agni_.

Not possible.  Ohio is the east, and Buffalo is east of that.

Of course when I was growing up in NY, Ohio was the west.  And Staten
Island was definitely the midwest (this was before the Verrazano Bridge).

I too enjoyed the long and sweet Silliman post; and of course thought of
all sorts of differences.For one thing, Berkeley is west of Duluth, and
that must count for something.

Regarding Tenney's header: I once saw John Coltrane's whole classic quartet
lying on the beach in Oregon, sleeping in the sun. Under sheets of sand.

Relayed another one sometime back, but this time my Japanese creative
writing students did a somewhat different action poem. They
entered the room wearing opaque raincoats, opened brightly-coloured
umbrellas above their head, floral & geometric patterns, one plain.
They'd taped a crackly old version of 'Singing in the Rain' off a video and
this was playing on the tape recorder on the table. They circle
the room, weaving in and out of other students, desks etc, not
saying anything but kind of skipping & running. End of the 3rd circuit,
they stop at the front. First one: I hate rain, throws the
bright umbrella to the ground, Second: I hate rain too, umbrella on
ground, Third: I hate rain three, and throw. Next a cassette flies
across the room: First explains later to me that she'd retrieved it and
threw it down because their piece hated rain and it contradicted that.

world go by") you know you're looking at the midwest. In fact, Buffalo's
got more in common with Duluth (or Lawrence, for that matter) than it does
with Philadelphia--when Harvey Brown called his press Frontier Press he
was referring to the Niagara Frontier.

Yes, coming from west, the distinctive onion domes, mosques & pagodas of
Duluth certainly give a marvelous Oriental impression there by the shorss
of Gitchee Gumee.  But those of us who grew up in that region always
considered Duluth the last NORTHERN city.  Beyond was pine trees, loons,

having lived in both the midwest and buffalo, ny, I can unequivocably
say that buffalo is the eastern edge of the great lakes cities.
eastern in that many of its cultural influences are NYC rather than
chicago,  detroit, etc., and great lakes in that it is part of the
upper rustbelt stretching from milwaukee through gary to toledo and
cleveland.  it's an odd and wonderful place and i miss it dearly.

minneapolis is a trip unto itself.  we have an abundance of literary
magazines, many of which are quite good, yet few reading series for the
aesthetic tastes of poeple on this list.  the LOFT is huge and kind of
siphons the energy, i think.

great twin cities mags and presses include DISTURBED GUILLOTINE, POETIC
BRIEFS, the upcoming CROSS CULTURAL POETICS which will feature a
section on the often neglected WATTS WRITERS GROUP, the satirical
EXILE, COFFEE HOUSE, DETOUR,  jonathon brannen's beautifully produced
STEPPING STONES chapbooks, and a couple people doing audio tapes who
are soon to release an audio version of McCaffery's PANOPTICON.  Lots
going on; we just don't see each other very often.

Salon, anyone?

7 divided by everything is still 7, and always will be.
This, by the way, also resolves the perennial mind/body problem,
i.e., because it's still there.

Call for papers and proposals
--------------------------

The organizers invite proposals for papers dealing with various aspects of
the historical and contemporary interface between literature and the visual
arts.

Some of the topics include:
Technopaignia and the Classical Tradition;
Pattern Poetry, Heraldic Art and Visual Forms of Baroque Writing;
=46uturism, Constructivism, Dada;
Concrete Poetry;
Artist=BCs Books;

Papers may be submitted for oral/audio-visual presentation, or for display
in the "poster" format used at scientific conferences. In that case, the
texts and commentaries should be printed on separate sheets that can be
easily mounted on partitions 4 by 5 feet (1.2 by 1.5 meters). Submissions
of such "poster" papers will be accepted from individuals unable to attend
the conference in person, as well as participants who wish to forgo reading
their presentations. These "posters" will be available for viewing during
the conference, and will constitute part of its proceedings.

Sessions will be organized according to themes or periods, and suggestions
are welcome for both potential speakers and topics for discussion. Eye
Rhymes is open to presentations made in other media. The organizers are
especially interested in soliciting papers dealing with Canadian visual
poetry, as well as obtaining proposals from creative practitioners.

Abstracts should be no more than 300 words, and must be accompanied by a
one page resum=E9 covering relevant biographical and professional details.
Twenty minutes will be allowed for each oral presentation, though written
versions of papers may be longer.

Please indicate if you would require financial assistance to attend the
conference, or if your participation would be contingent upon your ability
to arrange financing from non-conference sources.

Provide all of your communication co-ordinates on a separate sheet: name,
complete mailing address, phone numbers (office and residence), fax number
and   e-mail.

The review of submissions is ongoing until the end of 1996.

A creative component will accompany the conference, with exhibitions,
performances, and panel discussions involving visual poets. The working
language of Eye Rhymes will be English. Additional information, concerning
publication and other details, will be provided in future communications.

Just fortuitous that the Wolverines beat Ohio State this weekend, crushing

little odd, coming from St. Louis, which, I find, Easterners tend to think
of as the South.  I never understood that until I finally saw the film of
Meet Me in St. Louis.  It was the south, but is now the industrial
midwest, just like Detroit/Ann Arbor.

Ron,

That was a truly beautiful litany. I'm just wondering, though: are the
Cockettes you mention THE Cockettes, as in the ones who used to feature
Goldie Glitters? Goldie was a good friend of my wife's. Last we heard, he
was in England doing something wonderful. I never met him, but we had a long
talk once on the phone when he was living in Venice. I had just finished
reading Rafferty's review of "Paris Is Burning" and was watching the first
game of the World Series where Kirk Gibson smashed one out of the park at
the last saving moment and the Dodgers went on to take the best of 7. What
does all this mean? I have no idea.

Actually, Maria, I was born in the shadows of the Hanford nuclear
reactor plant outside of southeastern Washington (as was Michael
Amnasan), roughly one year after its most famous product was dropped on
the people of Nagasaki.

But it's true that my mother's family goes back in the Berkeley/Oakland
areas into the 1880s.

The differences between Philly and Berkeley are too many to catalog and
I'm still coming across them every week if not every day. Some of the
more obvious seem to me to be:

The sledgehammer shift of seasons, nothing like the gliding subtleties
of California.

The sense of history: families that have been here two and three
hundred years (especially out where I am on the Main Line) have really
consolidated their hold on things.

No decent Mexican restaurants.

NFL starts in the afternoon on Sundays and lasts until after midnight.

You can drive through several states in a single afternoon.

50 zillion colleges hereabouts really shifts the balance between public
and private higher education (not sure what it means, but it must mean
somethin'). [I've been invited to do more things at Penn in 18 months
that I was at UC Berkeley in the last 18 years.]

NO good bookstores. I realize how spoiled I was to live one block from
Small Press Distribution (sob). I had the idea that you could look at
and browse and touch a book of poems before you bought it.

No real reading series here at all. Too close to NYC in one sense.
There's a big gap, so far as I can tell, between writers still in
college (Josh Schuster, who's on the list, has been the major mover
hereabouts; hopefully Louis Cabris and Gregg Biglieri [from New College
to Temple] will step things up some) and the older "mid-career" types
who live in Philadelphia for reasons other than that's the big city
where they moved to become poets. (i.e., people don't move to Philly
for that reason, they move to NYC or SF)

Liquor stores as a function of the state. Automobile registration as a
mom & pop shop (closest thing down here to NYC's bodegas).

The mafia as local spectator sport (we're a two-team town; NYC is a 5
team town -- they take free agency VERY seriously).

The Mummers ain't the Cockettes.

Children out here are taught to call people "Mr" & "Mrs" and their
parents will get mad at you if you suggest that they use your first
name.

Flag day is taken seriously (Betsy Ross was a local and is treated as
same).

Ed Rendell IS Dianne Feinstein (they even look alike).

People think that Krishna using her maiden name is one of those "kooky
California" things and so they just call her Mrs Silliman anyway.

Much better radio. You don't realize just how lousy San Francisco radio
is until you hear the choices out here (now if only we had a Pacifica
station).

You get four times the house for the same amount of money.

The earth don't shake. I see the kinds of supports that freeway
overpasses have here and shudder to imagine what would happen when and
if....

Brick as a building material. The automobile tire as the standard unit
of litter.

Really solid local poets, Julia Blumenreich, Gil Ott, Eli Goldblatt, a
lot of the folks around 6ix (in that sense, not unlike DC or San
Diego), as well as us transplants.

Creeks that would be called rivers if they were in California.
Mountains that are no larger than Albany Hill.

No baseball scores from the west coast.

The Amish and Mennonites and Quakers as an active presence in the
community and region. Black buggies with big orange triangles.

Old stone farm houses everywhere (beautiful to look at but they have
small rooms and problematic fixtures [electricity and plumbing as "add
ons"]).

Email as your primary contact with other poets....

Shovelling snow or raking leaves as a "must-do" chore.

What else?
Ron

the west has clearly moved west, based on what everybody around here is
saying... hell, and i thought *I* was from the west---syracuse ny!...

which obscures the fact that at some point---just prior to the west coast,
perhaps (though of course a flick like _one-eyed jacks_ would seem to give
the lie to this)---the west would seem to root itself in a particular
landscape... which hollywood and tv made an industry of...

driving east---from here, from chicago i mean---i still feel like i'm in
the midwest till i hit that imaginary "border" between ohio and
pennsylvania... strictly psychological, perhaps---but things *do* seem to
get a lot more hilly... same goes for driving west---though it's even more
abrupt... once i cross the nebraskan high plains, just as i enter into
northeastern colorado or southeastern wyoming (where on a clear day you can
see the rockies), why then i feel like i'm in the west... perhaps the
continental divide spells this out for me, whereas the mississippi
doesn't...

so from my easterner perspective, the midwest always seems to me to extend
from ohio ("the heart of it all"---as the signs say when you enter that
state) through nebraska and the 'great plains'... but as i move north and
south, i tend to think in terms of different sorts of regionalisms---"the
south" for me, as a "yankee" (in the more general sense of this word),
becomes anyplace south of pennsylvania, south of indianapolis, south of
iowa ("the land where they let the children cry," as kerouac wrote), etc...
and i think of the dakotas as strangely midwest/west---with montana, of
course, as west...

so just by my remarks i suppose you might say that i discriminate on the
basis of landscape and region...

It doesn't make sense but the Mississippi River separates Wisconsin from
Iowa. At Dubuque we caught the 20 and stayed its course across the state. In
Nebraska a Pierce County sheriff held up Brian's driver's license and asked
him about his hair color and his eye color. The sheriff also wanted to know
what was in California before he wrote out a ticket for doing 78 on
southbound US-81.

*


In the Dunes motel in Albion I heard Brian say Garden at 7:30 am and I said
what? He said he didn't say anything. I went back to sleep and dreamed of two
plenary women urging me to go to Tacoma. They were speaking in flappers. When
we woke up, the news was of a big quake in Joshua tree. We were watching as
the aftershock hit and the LA correspondent was describing it for us. She was
told to get under her desk.


*


The Butler cylinders got bigger in the middle of Nebraska. In the southern
part of the state I started seeing equally large Chiefs. I like the big
cylinders of the midwest. I think they were brought by the settlers.


*


Can you pull over I asked Brian because ditch weed was growing on the side of
the road. It's a good way to annoy Brian to ask him to pull over for an
unscheduled stop because it breaks one of his driving laws. Another one is no
backtracking. In backtracking, say you are traveling southwest and you
propose a route that puts you heading east for a mile, but you need that mile
of east to hook up with a good southerly route. Brian would consider the
proposed route bad form and would reject it on aesthetic grounds, even if
that route was shorter or more interesting than any number of alternatives.
Not that Brian's laws don't out of necessity or desire get broken. After
begging Brian three times to pull over, he finally gave in. When we got out
of the jeep I looked around and said hey, this isn't ditch weed.


*


Cambridge had a ballfield and we stopped to throw the rock. Some farm boys
were practicing on the field with a man who was the coach. We asked to play
and were allowed to with silence. The air had a diesel smell like big tuna.
The infield was spongy prairie and sheened. The plate was forty feet in front
of the low backstop. We shagged for them and then the coach made sure we got
some cuts. He was from SF and had grown up in the Marina and gone to Galileo
high with OJ. In his high school playoffs he used a 35 to hit the low and
outside pitch. I couldn't tell if the farm boys resented us, but one kid
started yelling at Brian that the point of bp was to keep the ball in the
yard. Why the coach had moved to Cambridge I didn't ask, but Brian asked me
if I asked him.


*


Well, I called Jim Budke and he wasn't home. Jim Budke owned the only jeep
dealer in McCook. He lost a couple of mechanics and I don't know how long
you'll be stuck said Marvin Lorentz. Marvin Lorentz was our designated tower
from AAA. He didn't want us to take the jeep to Budke's but we told him there
was a warranty to worry about. He had pulled up in a gray chevy nova with his
wife and she held a small lap dog. He tried to get the jeep in gear but the
stick wouldn't budge. It was bright and sunday. It was hot and it was dry.

*

We walked across the street and checked into the best western. Marvin phoned
us and came by with his wrecker. He jacked up the jeep and we hopped on back
and rode to Budke's. After letting the jeep down he drove us to a cash
machine and recommended some places to grind.

*

After dinner I called Douglass in NYC and told him how Nick the Dick had hit
the ball twice. Douglass wondered how Nick chose which ball to hit as his
vertigo condition would allow him to see at least two. Then Brian got on the
horn and told Douglass to watch out for Steve trying to lick the inside of
his thigh. Steve was coming down from Providence and was still into sexual
experimentation.

They put a baboon liver in some dude said Rodney. Rodney was our mechanic at
Budke's. He showed us the thrashed clutch plate made by Borg & Beck. Rodney
called it a ten and a half, fourteen, one. That means the clutch plate
measured ten and a half inches in diameter, had fourteen gear teeth or
splines and fit on a one-inch transmission shaft. On one side of the clutch
plate were displayed the words FLYWHEEL SIDE. Someone had installed the
clutch plate so that FLYWHEEL SIDE was up against the pressure plate. Not OK.
We wondered if it was Southern Motors or Dirk Waltz. According to Rodney, you
didn't need to take out the clutch plate to put in a new transmission, but
that didn't prove a whole lot.


*


Two 20-year-old skinny guys worked with Rodney in the garage and they worked
on motorcycles. They suggested we stay at a cheaper motel on the edge of town
and they were willing to drive us. One of the guys said he'd lived in
Phoenix, Seattle, and Denver. He liked Denver the best, but couldn't go back
there until the statute of limitations ran out. The other guy was also in
trouble with the Denver cops.

*

After another night in McCook, we got up and walked to the garage. When we
got there Rodney was not under the jeep fiddling but one of the skinny guys
was under there. We said hey, where's Rodney? The skinny guy said Rodney was
arraigned this morning for molesting a four-year-old girl. The skinny guy
seemed to think it was a bad rap because the girl couldn't identify the
tattoos on Rodney's stomach, which were of Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny.
Rodney's white pride tattoo had also gone unnoticed.


*


The skinny guy installed the new pressure plate and throw-out bearing and
after getting the flywheel turned at a local machine shop had installed it.
But he was having difficulty getting the new clutch plate to slide on to the
transmission shaft. At a certain point he realized what the problem was.
Spline mismatch. The transmission shaft had 14 splines and the new clutch
plate had 11. We cursed Budke's for ordering the wrong part but after some
research we found out we were wrong for cursing. For by all accounts - parts
books and phone calls to Dodge and Borg & Beck - the transmission shaft ought
to have 11 splines. Except ours continued to have 14. We got on the logical
trail of the splines and got lost. How did Dirk Waltz of Midland find a brand
new 14-spline transmission to fit the old clutch plate with 14 splines,
assuming that he left the old clutch plate alone when he installed the new
transmission, meaning that Southern Motors of Savannah had initially
installed a 14-spline transmission and clutch that weren't to spec? What
about the old transmission that was boxed up and sent back to Savannah?
Brian's father had returned it to Southern Motors who had sent it back to the
rebuilder, etc. To keep from glazing you, this is what we think happened.
Instead of a new one Dirk Waltz of Midland installed a used 14-spline
transmission into the jeep, ran into spline mismatch with the existing
11-spline clutch plate, dug up a 14-spline disc in some junkyard and then
stuck it in backwards to spite us on account of I took imaginary cuts at his
olds ornament.

*

The skinny guy got on the horn and drove around to all the parts stores
trying to locate our phantom clutch plate. The only thing that turned up was
a nine and eleven sixteenths inch disc that fit the other specs, 14 & 1. No
one was sure that it would work and such a procedure would void any warranty.
We said do it and they did. But they had trouble getting the transmission to
bolt down to the chassis because the mounts were thrashed. This time me and
Brian drove down to the parts store. The guys at Schamel's were nice and wore
overalls. We showed them the chewed up mounts as an example. They checked the
books but didn't have the part. They asked us if we were the ones who owned
the funny jeep with a 14-spline transmission shaft. We smiled and said yes
and asked how much it was to rent an apartment in town. After some searching
they dug up a pair of mounts that fit older model Chryslers. I said I had a
job to start in California in a few days. They said if I waited a few more
the whole state would be under water. Then Nebraska would be the west and
they could charge more for everything.

*

Prairie falcons became visible as we rolled into eastern colorado. They
battled the crosswinds along with the jeep. The new clutch plate was an issue
in our minds. We stopped in Wray for a little juice in case we burned up on
the range.

*

We made it to Denver and talked about nuclear physics. In the morning we met
Brian's mother & father at Stapleton and they were concerned about me getting
to my job on time. At some point I was just going to have to fly. I said no,
it's not like I could leave my wing man.

*

We had a lunch date in Boulder with Brian's mother's cousin Bud Shark and his
wife Barbara. We debated where the west was and whether Denver was the west.
Our hosts thought Denver wasn't, but Cheyenne was and Dallas was something
else entirely. When we hit No Name I knew we were in the west and there was
the start of the colorado river to prove it and a town called Rifle and
another named Parachute.


*


We got socked in the face through southern utah. It was dry and windy and
red. Fake thunderclouds dropped scarce water into the sunset. We pulled into
Green River and stopped in front of a mexican restaurant. I locked both doors
after Brian got out. Brian doesn't share my paranoia about locking car doors
and was annoyed when he realized he'd left his wallet in the jeep. He
unlocked the driver's side door but the handle stuck from all the dry. He had
to go in the passenger's side to get his wallet. In the restaurant Brian got
into one of his excited states where he says he's going to kick your ass
motherfucker if you don't quit blowing smoke in his face.

what does it mean that Chillicothe Ohio

Or put it this way, from ARK, The Foundations, Beams 21,22,23:

               I dream
     the sheaves sleep quiver speak in furrow
          to the mower by the depths
     I wait and watch for the morning from all eyes
             matter as swarm clothed with vision
                 each bud a lamp

          the heat stand in lightning
     wind out of throughout for ever for ever for ever alone
          out the water great lights stretched out
     divided into parts through the midst ever flesh
              rivers of willowsong

Scheduled to participate:  SONIA SANCHEZ, ADRIENNE RICH, ROBERT HASS,
AMIRI BARAKA, MIGUEL ALGARIN, POETS FROM THE NUYORICAN POETS' CAFE:

This interdisciplinary conference is open to the public and aims to
provide new understandings of poetry's participation in the public
sphere.   The last two decades have witnessed a resurgence of interest
in public poetry--readings, festivals, performances, films, television
series, and poetry slams.  In examining the way poetry affects and is
affected by social context, we will consider a range of contemporary
poetries in their public settings, including performance-oriented,
community-based, socially engaged, and formally experimental work.
Questions of audience and aesthetics will be central to our discussion
of poetry's active role in building, defining, questioning, and
motivating social and political communities.  Designed to bring a broad range
of people from inside and outside the academy into conversation, the conference
will feature roundtable discussions, poetry readings and performances, keynote
lectures, and panel presentations by a wide range of poets, scholars, and
activists.

We welcome submissions from anyone with an interest in poetry.  We
are currently accepting:

1.  Detailed two-page proposals for 15-minute papers, not limited to the
topics listed here.  (Feel free to suggest panel topics; however, we are
not accepting group panel proposals.)

2.  Detailed proposals for roundtable discussions (no more than four
people), to consist of five-minute remarks and a moderated discussion.
You may provide participant names  and brief profiles of chair and
three to four panelists, plus a two-page proposal describing the topic,
approach, and intended contribution of each discussant.  You may propose an
entire roundtable or may outline your contribution and suggest roundtables for
which it might be relevant.

Here are some possible topics for discussion:

  poetry and social movements   poetics of performance poetry
  politics of form              poetry and public sphere theory
  poetry as witness             poetry and community activism
  African American poetry            poetry slams
  poetry and popular culture    global poetry
  Latino/a poetry               poetry and identity politics

  spoken-word events            feminist poetry
  poetry and AIDS               rap-meets-poetry

(yasinski@rci.rutgers.edu). No proposals via email.  Thank you.


ACCEPTANCE NOTIFICATION

     If a paper or panel discussion is accepted for presentation at
the conference, the person submitting will be notified in February or
earlier.

MAILING LIST

     If you would like to be on our mailing list, please send an email
message to Kathy Crown (kcrown@rci.rutgers.edu) or Nick Yasinski
(yasinski@rci.rutgers.edu), or write Harriet Davidson at the address above.
Indicate whether you have a place to put a conference poster or need only a
registration form (saving us a little money).  Registration forms will be sent
by snail mail early next year, so please include your snail address as well as
your email address.

LOCATION

     The conference will take place on the campus of Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, NJ, which is an easy 50-minute train or
car ride from New York City (1 1/2 hr from Philadelphia by car, 2 hr
by local trains; 25-min by car from Newark Int'l Airport; 30-min by
train or car from Princeton).

SCHEDULE OF EVENTS (to be confirmed in early 1997)

The conference will begin mid-afternoon on Thursday, April 24 with
some of its most exciting and importance featured events, including
panels and roundtables with important poets and scholars, as well as
an evening reading by nationally known poets from the Nuyorican
Poets Cafe, organized by Miguel Algarin (names available soon, upon
final agreement).  We strongly encourage people to come for the
Thursday afternoon and evening events.  Friday and Saturday, April
25 & 26, will include a variety of panels, roundtables, mid-day
readings, and evening readings by Adrienne Rich (and others) on
Friday and Robert Hass and probably Sonia Sanchez (and others) on
Saturday.  The conference will conclude on Sunday, April 27, with
panels and a featured roundtable and discussion summing up the
conference, ending by early afternoon.

REGISTRATION

     The conference is open to the public.  However, people should
be advised that we may be obliged to give priority seating at some
events such as the featured evening readings to people who have
registered.  Registration fees have yet to be set but will probably rely
on a sliding scale.  Registration announcements/forms will go out in
early Spring, 1997.   Anyone submitting a proposal for the conference
will automatically be sent a registration form  (accepted proposals do
not exempt one from registration fees).  Anyone who does not submit a
proposal can be sure to receive a registration form by writing to
Harriet Davidson, Associate Professor of English and Director of
Women's Studies, P.O. Box 5054, Rutgers University, New Brunswick,
NJ  08903-5054, or by sending an email request for a registration form
to Kathy Crown (kcrown@rci.rutgers.edu) or Nick Yasinski
(yasinski@rci.rutgers.edu).  Include your snail address; forms will be sent out
early next year.

ACCOMMODATIONS

     A special rate of $59/night for conference-goers has been
arranged for a limited number of rooms at the very nice, full-service
Holiday Inn in nearby Somerset (a 12-min car ride from Rutgers) near
Rte 287.  Please call (908) 356-1700 and make sure to mention the
conference name and Rutgers.  We are hoping to arrange at least one
reception at the Holiday Inn, as well as daily shuttles to and from the
conference; for these reasons, we encourage anyone staying overnight
to use the Holiday Inn if possible.  The only hotel within walking
distance of the conference is the Hyatt Hotel (908) 873-1234 in
downtown New Brunswick; it is significantly more expensive than the
Holiday Inn.
     The Holiday Inn deal provides nicer accommodations (and most
likely at a lower cost) than the "moderately priced" options below; the
"more expensive" options are sometimes double the Holiday Inn price
and usually do not have much more to recommend them.  Options
include the Quality Inn (908-469-5050) in Somerset, 10 min away,
moderately priced; the Ramada Inn (908-828-6900) in East Brunswick
near NJ Turnpike Exit 9, 8 min from Rutgers, moderately priced; the
Marriot Hotel (908-560-0500) in Somerset, 12 min away, more
expensive (within walking distance of the Holiday Inn); the Windham
Gardens (908-980-0400) in Piscataway, 8 min away, more expensive;
the Hilton (908-828-2000) in East Brunswick near NJ Turnpike Exit 9,
8 min from Rutgers, much more expensive (JFK airport shuttle stop).

The Department of English at Rutgers University, New Brunswick
announces POETRY AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE:  A CONFERENCE
ON CONTEMPORARY POETRY, APRIL 24-27, 1997

Scheduled to participate:  ADRIENNE RICH, ROBERT HASS, SONIA
SANCHEZ, MIGUEL ALGARIN, POETS FROM THE NUYORICAN
POETS' CAFE, CHARLES BERNSTEIN, TRICIA ROSE, CHARLES
ALTIERI, MARIA DAMON, ALICIA OSTRIKER, CHERYL
CLARKE, CORA KAPLAN, RACHEL HADAS, MICHAEL MCKEON,
MICHAEL TAUSSIG, ELIN DIAMOND, ABENA BUSIA, SUSAN STANFORD FRIEDMAN
and many others.

This interdisciplinary conference is open to the public and aims to
provide new understandings of poetry's participation in the public
sphere.   The last two decades have witnessed a resurgence of interest
in public poetry--readings, festivals, performances, films, television
series, and poetry slams.  In examining the way poetry affects and is
affected by social context, we will consider a range of contemporary
poetries in their public settings, including performance-oriented,
community-based, socially engaged, and formally experimental work.
Questions of audience and aesthetics will be central to our discussion
of poetry's active role in building, defining, questioning, and
motivating social and political communities.  Designed to bring a broad range
of people from inside and outside the academy into conversation, the conference
will feature roundtable discussions, poetry readings and performances, keynote
lectures, and panel presentations by a wide range of poets, scholars, and
activists.

We welcome submissions from anyone with an interest in poetry.  We
are currently accepting:

1.  Detailed two-page proposals for 15-minute papers, not limited to the
topics listed here.  (Feel free to suggest panel topics; however, we are
not accepting group panel proposals.)

2.  Detailed proposals for roundtable discussions (no more than four
people), to consist of five-minute remarks and a moderated discussion.
You may provide participant names  and brief profiles of chair and
three to four panelists, plus a two-page proposal describing the topic,
approach, and intended contribution of each discussant.  You may propose an
entire roundtable or may outline your contribution and suggest roundtables for
which it might be relevant.

Here are some possible topics for discussion:

  poetry and social movements   poetics of performance poetry
  politics of form              poetry and public sphere theory
  poetry as witness             poetry and community activism
  African American poetry            poetry slams
  poetry and popular culture    global poetry
  Latino/a poetry               poetry and identity politics
  poetry and/as history         ethnography of poetry
  Native American poetry        gay/ lesbian poetry
  spoken-word events            feminist poetry
  poetry and AIDS               rap-meets-poetry
  politics of publishing        Asian American poetry

Basically I agree with Patrick Pritchett, however with regard to the following,

>Clearly, some poets feel compelled to confront "landscape", with
>all that entails - psychologically, politically, culturally, biologically,
>historically, etc. - in their work; but just as clearly, some poets would
>write the same kind of poetry regardless of where they lived.

I can't imagine place not having some effect on a writer, however indirect
or subtle that effect may be. And I think "landscape" must be considered in
all its aspects, including geographical, climatological, social, cultural,
intellectual, etc. -- to understand it. And some of these aspects are of
course dependent on the individual effected by it, and few of them are
without overlap. It all gets very sticky.

Mei-mei has spoken, in at least one talk I've heard, about the sense of
horizon where she lives, and a rather direct correlation between that and
the sense of space created in her poems, in part because of her line, but in
other ways as well. Does anyone know if she's published any essays or
writings which touch on this, other than the poems themselves?

It was a sunny Sunday in San Francisco (could be our last one of those for a
while), so Avery Burns waited a full half hour after our scheduled starting
time before introducing recent San Francisco arrival Pamela Lu.

Pam read about 11 pages from her novel in progress, which doesn't seem to
have a name yet and is also a meditation on contemporary culture.  To
preface, she read from a book called _Thirdspace_ a "definition" of Orange
County from one of its own tourist brochures.  Passages from Pamela's
reading included:

"'Me' was a different matter altogether."
"Who were we, anyway, and what were we doing without 'the rest of us'?"
"She moved like a body of possibility through the realm of the actual."
"The suburb was designed to bring about the death of mystery."
"We never wanted to leave our suffering for fear of losing awareness."
"We lived in a realm where the world was just barely possible, and yet it
was the only possibility."

There was a short break to give the audience (which included the jet-setting
Katie Lederer, Kevin Killian, Dorian Harding-Morick, Mary Burger, Spencer
Selby, Renee Gladman, Colleen Lookingbill and Eric Selland) time to grab
more cookies and tea, and then Charles Cantalupo read.

Charles' performance was incantatory, involving the use of strong vocal
cadences and hand gestures (though I later overheard him say he'd "toned it
down", feeling that this audience was "more finely tuned").  Both this style
of reading and the subject matter of Charles' poems are influenced by his
study of Africa (Charles is in town from Bethlehem PA to give a talk on
Kenyan writer Ngugi at the African Studies Association Conference).  He read
from his works _Eritrea_ and _Columba the Dove_.  Some lines I caught were:

"erasure so blankly off the tree of children"
"mixing up the gold and wax meaning"
"fucking leaves, fucking like leaves"
"to say yessss like a tree"
those ribs dug deep to begin this narrative"
"chewing handkerchiefs, eyes crying out of their sockets--ours"
"the mountains wrap themselves around their echoes"
"light the lights, light the lights, light the lights"

The next Canessa Park reading will be Sunday December 8 at 3 PM and will
feature David Bromige reading new work and Merdith Quartermain visiting from
Vancouver.  Canessa Park is located at 708 Montgomery St. at Columbus in San
Francisco.  Admission is $5.

I must say that it seems the equation 7 over 0 times the moist reminder of
density's phonic apparition equals 42 seems to me less than adequate. Perhaps
Wittgenstein's question "Is this foot _my_ foot?" can only be answered under
certain circumstances. Nietzsche's "Number as perspective form" also seems
still to reside in the question of belief. Still, we do know we aren't

Here is a copy of an email letter I just sent to the NYTimes Magazine, which
among its entries in a special issue on "Heroine Worship" yesterday,
published what I thought was a really awful bit on Gertrude Stein, written
by Cynthia Ozick. Perhaps silly to spend too much time on what the Times
publishes, but it just made me angry.

>
>While there was some debunking of heroines, and in general a mix of loved
icons & simply celebrities to be talked about, none of the featured subjects
of your special issue on "Heroine Worship" (Nov. 24, 1996) seemed quite so
dismissed by your authors as was Gertrude Stein by Cynthia Ozick. Ozick
writes that no one now reads Stein, despite the recent appearance of a
selected Stein (A STEIN READER, ed. by Ulla E. Dydo, Northwestern University
Press, 1993). She puts Stein down as a "copycat Cubist" despite ample
evidence that Stein is at least as much an innovator as any other artist
tagged with the Cubist label; and Ozick writes that the "silly" (although
she admits it's enchanting) "A rose is a rose is a rose. ..." is "almost all
that is left of Gertrude Stein." This despite an ongoing celebration of
Stein among writers, artists, and feminists, a growth in scholarship on
Stein, and the sense among many of today's most innovative writers, such as
Leslie Scalapino, that Stein's writing "is very much at the basis of current
writing" (Scalapino, interviewed by Ed Foster, in TALISMAN No. 8).
>
>In Stein we see writing revealed as a process, indeed *as writing,* as much
as a window onto something else, although with a great deal of insight into
the workings of the mind, as well as a unique and intricate accounting of
details in the world about her. In her development of abundant and
delightful possibilities for writing, I would imagine that Stein will
continue to be a germinal writer for many, for decades to come. Whether
Cynthia Ozick has some private (or public) axe to grind, or whether she is
deeply stupid, I can not say. But her comments are dangerous, as they would
keep other readers stupid as to the delights and relevances of Gertrude
Stein today.

Cutbacks at San Francisco State University

In a small step in the continuing restriction of access, reduc-
tion of public support, and a general backing away from public
responsibility for quality public education in California, the
English Department at San Francisco State University (a Califor-
nia State University campus) in November announced the mid-year
layoff of 14 lecturers. These non-tenure line teachers have
taught composition and ESL courses as part of a pool of experi-
enced instructors, as well as conducted research, produced
written work, given presentations, and designed curricula. They
teach "service" courses essential to the development of critical
literacy skills in a university with one of the most ethnically
diverse campuses in the United States.
     Without the protection of tenure or multi-year contracts,
the entire group of instructors at SFSU is subject to the whim of
administrative decision. A new "auditing procedure," implemented
by the CSU's administration, will, in theory, reduce the number
of junior-level transfer students from California two-year
colleges, thereby theoretically reducing the number of those
students required to take first and second year composition
courses. This is one rationale for the layoffs. It ignores the
fact that literally hundreds of students, every semester, pack
classrooms and line hallways, struggling to add the required
composition, ESL, and basic writing courses. Many of our students
take seven years or more to complete baccalaureate degrees, and
access to required courses is one of the reasons.
     A constant tension simmers between the rights and needs of
tenure line faculty and lecturers, whose rights and needs often
compete. Both are represented by the same union, though they work
under dramatically different circumstances. The work of composi-
tion lecturers, which is highly labor intensive with each class
demanding the thoughtful reading and grading of on the order of
175 essays (times 3 to 5 sections), revisions, and journals,
along with extensive use of conferences and other duties, is not
generally coveted, to put it mildly, by tenure line teachers,
although it is work that is highly valued by their students. To
some, the cost of providing such education would be better spent
on "program" courses, upper division and graduate classes in
literature and other "substantive" canonical endeavors. Composi-
tion classes at SFSU are generally courses in critical literacy
which, through often painfully achieved effort on the part of
both students and teachers, strive to ensure a level of critical
consciousness and literate ability demanded for full access to
the complex social and political contexts the students will live,
work, and create within. Lecturers at SFSU do not work  at the
fringes of students' intellectual development, but often provide
essential experiences in cognitive development for their stu-
dents.
     They are nonetheless seen as disposable, and with the ending of
affirmative action in the state, the rise in tuition levels, the decreased
numbers of courses, and more subtle restrictions of access, the good work
that they have for many years accomplished becomes more and more
endangered.
     The fourteen faculty members laid off in the current crisis
will face the prospect of finding teaching posts in the middle of
the academic year, part-time community college jobs or other,
even more tenuous positions in other far-flung places, when they
thought they had firm academic year commitments from their
university. Many of them may not find them, but instead be forced
to abandon the art to which they have dedicated their lives,
their educations, and their utmost commitment. Working outside of
education, these intelligent and talented people will undoubtedly
fare well--no doubt better economically--but at great cost to the
students they would have touched, often profoundly, in the
future.

INTRODUCTION

This issue of New Observations: "Ripple Effects" examines the relationship
of painters with language and other primarily linguistic source materials.
Painting was traditionally an art form privileged for its purely visual
qualities, although for much of its history it found its themes in
linguistic sources such as biblical narrative, mythology, allegory, and
history. In fact, painting and language exist in a field of interactive
ripple effects that productively enrich rather than disrupt the surface of
contemporary painting. Today many painters rely on linguistically based
sources for their work, increasingly bringing images of these sources and of
language into their paintings; also, some painters write about art or
collaborate with writers, thereby engaging in a complex, multilayered
practice, where art and language intersect. This is similar to the practices
of some of the most prominent members of the New York School of painting.
         As former co-editors of M/E/A/N/I/N/G as well as practicing artists, we
have been committed to engaging in such a dual practice ourselves: we have
often invited artists to write about issues and art of concern and relevance
to their work. "Ripple Effects" is in a way a ripple effect of that
involvement. We have invited some of the artists who first wrote for
M/E/A/N/I/N/G to participate in this issue of New Observations as well as
several other artists whose art practice involves language and writing as
either subject or image of their artwork or as a parallel practice, or
significant source of inspiration. We have encouraged them to extend the
basic premise of the discussion in any direction of particular present
relevance to their work.
        In the past, dictates of modernism =97 "Greenbergian" modernism, at least =
=97
have distanced painting from language. Even though the appearance of
language through the use of collage was an important turning point in the
development of modernist painting, as Brian O'Doherty observed in Inside the
White Cube, "Without going into the attractive complexities of the letter
and the word in modernism, they are disruptive." Certainly much avant-garde
art, other than painting, has benefited from that "disruption," and for a
while painting seemed to lose ground to these openly linguistic forms.
However, in recent years we have seen the infusion of popular culture and
multiple sources into the once sacred realm of the fine arts.
         The artists who are included in this issue have a variety of approaches to
the subject of art and language. Some of these artists represent language
directly in their work: Julia Jacquette writes of her first experience of
viewing paintings which represented writing and how that influenced her
subsequent work. Kay Rosen emphasizes the way typography and language
structure interpretation and discusses her desire to exercise the science of
linguistics in what for her is the more suitable field of visual art. Amy
Sillman distinguishes the importance of language as speech and her paintings
as figures of speech; Christian Schumann describes his sources, from comics
to concrete poetry; Mira Schor notes her initial political goals in
depicting language as a sign for female thought and her concerns for
imbricating writing language and painting language. Kenneth Goldsmith tells
how the purchase of a used copy of Abbie Hoffman=92s Steal This Book=
 inspired
his subsequent artworks. Rochelle Feinstein discusses her use of words in
painting and the grammar of painting. Jane Hammond explores painting itself,
including the construction of painting as a language. Tom Knechtel and David
Reed note the formative, constitutive importance of film, literature, and
opera to their work. Faith Wilding writes of her interdisciplinary practice,
where traditional painting language is but one of many languages used to
communicate political and theoretical concerns. David Humphrey zeroes in on
the relation of the concept of beauty to his paintings. Susan Bee writes
about her relationship to writing and editing and about her collaborations
with writers and how it has influenced her artwork. Lucio Pozzi discusses
the distinction between art and words and the development of his Word Works.
Pamela Wye narrates a parable about writing and art, while Richard Tuttle
contributes a manifesto-like list of sentences and a poem.
        Together, we think that these artists give some idea of the breadth and
depth of the contemporary artists preoccupation and possible obsession with
language and how it changed and influenced their visual work.

I've noted that a great way to search the archive is to limit by
author's e-mail address. This can help make a timely process somewhat
less timely. A good way to find out the e-mail address for someone is
to consult the online directory of poets available from the EPC home
page.

Charles -- I had much the same reaction as yours to the Stein piece --
but Stein was hardly the only icon to rteceive such treatment -- The Tina
Turner and Naomi Campbell pieces were certainly odd lots --  Does kind of
make you wonder what the editors thought they were up to with this issue --

Hepburn got short, though laudatory, shrift -- too

Well-done Charles! Writing those letters-to-the-editor is a drag, a drop
in the yawning bucket but at times necessary ? & Ozick's stupidities
merited it.

p.s. re West/poets: indeed essential to add to first  volley (I'll hold
on to Niedecker in some way as from out thar---) & indeed, from Welch to
Mei-Mei  via Rodney/Tarn -- it's a rich place & now I remember that i
forgot to mention Simon Ortiz --

anyway, as an ind?crottable citizen of Luxembourg, I guess I have always
defined the West as anything on the other side of Jersey -- & that means
the island, not the "New," while as a one-time New Yorker I cannot
forget the famous New Yorker's cartoon cover & its geographic
forshortenings.

Some years ago I translated & published Sam Shepard's _Motel
Chronicles_   in the "Collection Sixpack" I was editing for Christian
Bourgois in Paris.  I used a photo of Shepard standing next to a car in
the middle of a burg in the middle of the western plains for the cover ?
& wrote an introduction based on how different the american writer
relates/stands in his/her geography, the wide open spaces, etc.
(contrasting it with the traditional close-up  head-shot of the French
writer with cigarette against bookshelf), bringing in John Ford movies
etc.  When the book came out, the art director  had  without telling me
& of course without reading the intro cropped  the photo so that all you
could see was a medium-shot of Shepard with all the wide-open western
spaces cut out. I still wonder what people who read my intro & then
looked at the cover thought I was talking about.

Poetics List:

Here is a copy of an email letter I just sent to the NYTimes Magazine, which
among its entries in a special issue on "Heroine Worship" yesterday,
published what I thought was a really awful bit on Gertrude Stein, written
by Cynthia Ozick. Perhaps silly to spend too much time on what the Times
publishes, but it just made me angry.

>While there was some debunking of heroines, and in general a mix of loved
icons & simply celebrities to be talked about, none of the featured subjects
of your special issue on "Heroine Worship" (Nov. 24, 1996) seemed quite so
dismissed by your authors as was Gertrude Stein by Cynthia Ozick. Ozick
writes that no one now reads Stein, despite the recent appearance of a
selected Stein (A STEIN READER, ed. by Ulla E. Dydo, Northwestern University
Press, 1993). She puts Stein down as a "copycat Cubist" despite ample
evidence that Stein is at least as much an innovator as any other artist
tagged with the Cubist label; and Ozick writes that the "silly" (although
she admits it's enchanting) "A rose is a rose is a rose. ..." is "almost all
that is left of Gertrude Stein." This despite an ongoing celebration of
Stein among writers, artists, and feminists, a growth in scholarship on
Stein, and the sense among many of today's most innovative writers, such as
Leslie Scalapino, that Stein's writing "is very much at the basis of current
writing" (Scalapino, interviewed by Ed Foster, in TALISMAN No. 8).
>
>In Stein we see writing revealed as a process, indeed *as writing,* as much
as a window onto something else, although with a great deal of insight into
the workings of the mind, as well as a unique and intricate accounting of
details in the world about her. In her development of abundant and
delightful possibilities for writing, I would imagine that Stein will
continue to be a germinal writer for many, for decades to come. Whether
Cynthia Ozick has some private (or public) axe to grind, or whether she is
deeply stupid, I can not say. But her comments are dangerous, as they would
keep other readers stupid as to the delights and relevances of Gertrude
Stein today.

Ron and others east of here,
                      When I got to Philadelphia I thought I was in
Europe it was so east. I was genuinely shocked, I'd flown into San
Francisco, listened to Jimmy Smith at Shelly's Mannhole (??) got across
to Oakland somehow and trained I don't know four days and nights in the
same direction I couldn't believe that was possible and ended up in
Europe. I'd not been to Europe at that stage, so I couldn't be
completely sure, but everything was SO old and made of permanent
materials it hardly mattered.

discover that we nail houses together--which is what we do--differently,
using techniques developed in the midwest? And our suburban house
designs are mostly California derived? So  west is New Zealand  part of
the time.
                      On the other hand, if you want to be the first to

There is a ridge where the west commences!

I too found Ron's meditation a total delight!  As someone who moved the
other way (5 years in Philadelphia, then California), I was especially
amused at Ron's surprise (and his twins' surprise evidently) at the
Mr./Mrs. label.  As an Eastener, I found it totally shocking when I
arrived in LA in 1977 and an unknown real estate man called up and said
"Hi Marjorie."  And the students at USC and now Stanford call me Narjorie
without ever asking.  I kind of prefer the Philly address but even that's
not nearly as nice as in Paris where I'm called Madame.  That would be my
dream: to be called Madame all the time as in "Bonjour Madame,"  "bon
weekend Madame."  Ron, you'll end up finding the greater formality kind of
nice after a bit.

So, au revoir Monsieur.

situation?  At San Jose State we've been going through this for the last
six years, but this year's budget seemed a bit better, and we are
enrolling increasing numbers again (though we are not yet able to hire

But that is a little loopy. I have been to NZ several times, both islands
(both big islands) and I didnt see anything that looked like North America.
It all looked more like Australia or South Africa. Sounded like it too,
actually.

Except university buildings, eh? They are the same all over the damned world.

here is a poem--from quite a while ago--about spring and all, in
california's great central valley.
--shaunanne tangney


FLOODED

offering the soft spots
of poetry and underthigh
snapshots and inscriptions

i can't stand/do
masturbation because
first there are no kisses

the great central valley
opens all legs and wet
lies below me flooded

fertile and dangerous
is where our
relationship flounders

ragged asperagus
this year
nubs into

next year breedy
yielding yet another
cornucopia

of picked and packaged
handled
shipped and bought

i can't stand/do
masturbation because
there is no chance of

no danger of
produce the great
central valley

lies there can
only lie there
flooded like you

with me and petty
dismisals and
grand embraces

leave us leveed
high grounded
and dammed



(March, 1995)


pretty anthropomorphic, i know--but i always have that question of the
gaze of all "nature," "place" "landscape" poetry.
a tough question, and one i am not really trying to answer--just
thought i'd throw a poem into the mix--

Ah, but just wait until the monster east coast quake comes (and they say
it will come) to find out how solid and permanent all that brick is.

I realized I was a Californian (again, being seriously bicoastal) after
the '89 quake, when awoken by an aftershock, thought "Oh, only a 5.0,"
turned over and went back to sleep.

One of the most difficult problems I have encountered in writing my
dissertation on gender roles in American magazines from 1900 to 1950 is
trying to reconstruct the influence that advertisers had in shaping the
editorial content of magazines. I wonder if list members might steer me in
the direction of existing scholarship that addresses this general issue.

I am interested in two kinds of influence that advertisers may have had. The
first would be direct influence, in which an advertiser promises a certain
number of spots in exchange for favorable mention of his/her client's
products. The second (and for me the most intriguing) would be indirect
influence, in which the presence of ads with a certain agenda encourages the
editor to mold editorial content to somehow correspond, or synchronize, with
that agenda.

Any works that attempt to document or theorize this relationship would be
helpful. Also I'd be interested in further discussion with anyone interested
in exploring the topic further.

Thanks,

        In typically American fashion

        that Thanksgiving could be observed
        on some other day than
        the last Thursday in November.

        the cornucopia of chemical-rich comestibles
        political persuasion as a pre-nuptial line of inquiry
        unshakable faith in good old American know-how.

        I come from an apologetic nation
        devoid of the trappings of confidence
        explaining political turmoil through shiver-clenched teeth
        petulant in two official languages
        good old American protectionism her role model.

        My Thanksgiving traditions have consisted of
        overeating to the point of stupefaction
        thanks due and paid through taxes
        servitude to the gods of betrayal
        and abandonment of art.

        By a twist of fate that is the stuff of
        tales our grandchildren will tell
        long after our last breath has expired
        today I shall give thanks for the moment and
        in advance for all the years to come

        just to be on the safe side.

Yes, I agree. Particularly Tina Turner was insulted, I thought. In fact some
of the treatment made me wonder if there was some underlying agenda to
denigrate heroines in general.

Thanks for the thoughtful post Stephen. Your comments about the Great Basin
seem quite on the mark to me - it's history (and the West's in general) is
largely a history of ransacking and despoilment (nothing new  there, eh?).
The so-called "New West" historians, like Patricia Nelson Limerick and
Donald Worster, have written extensively about this, superseding romantic
narratives of cowboys and rugged pioneers with the history of corporate
mining interests, the struggle of land barons to control water rights
(without which hydrology none of us wld be here in the West right now) and
so forth.

In response to part one of "my query is twofold. are there any western
american writers that i could
read that use the harsh isolation as a springboard for verse.(i don't mean
cowboy poetry?"
What I think is difficult about this query is an assumed "harsh isolation"
definition of the circumstance of "western writing."
I suspect the idea of "harsh isolation" and "the west" is not about western
writing in any large geographic sense. For example it doesn't apply to the
Pacific Slope or the California  side of at least the northern parts of the
Sierra - which hisitorically has been much associated with notions of the
sublime, nature's land of plenty, Eden etc.  And it doesn't apply to the
southwest - New Mexico, Arizona, at least the geographic parts of those
states that that have strong non-Anglo Hispanic and Indian presences -
 Anastasi, Hopi, Navajo etc. - and all the attendant histories and myths.
  The "harsh isolation" gets more attached to Nevada's Great Basin - and its
various "high desert" extensions into Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Colorado,
Sothern California, etc. - where the "bleakness" appears to be much less
impacted by "cultures" - Indian, Anglo or otherwise. Though I'm not as
familiar with the plains states, from Dakotas to Texas, "The harsh
isolation"
there perhaps has a different character. I would agree that Ed Dorn, Ken
Irby
 - students of Olson -  have purposely "lived" through the land (its history,
geological patterns and shapes, etc.) and written moving work within that
scope in which the individual, and his moves, are directly shaped, by the
facts of the landscape.
In terms of the Great Basin, however, the myth of "harsh isolation" - its
bleakness as a back drop or set to the personal
experience - belies the history of the use of the space. Most every square
inch of the Great Basin has been scoped and used for its mineral and
underground water wealth. Much less visibly the military (for nuclear
testing, bombing practice) maintains a huge presence across the terrain. (I
think the military owns about 80% of Nevada).The land's isolation is belied
by corporate, government and military habitation. Some of the prose writers
(Terry Tempest Williams) have gone after the cancerous nuclear consequences
of this impact. But I believe its the photographers (Robert Adams, Peter
Goins, Mark Klett - and other members of the "re-photography project - and
Richard Misrach ) who have done the investigating - some of it quite brave -
and taken a close look at the facts of what has occured within these parts
of
the West. Among current poets, Laura Moriarty has some great stuff about
some
of these landscapes. Occasionally I think Kirk Robertson - the current poet
laureate of Nevada - captures the character of living within "basin and
range."
This is a windy answer. Primarily I want to suggest that "harsh isolation"
puts a personal and lyric limit on a area of the west that is much more
complicated and pivotal (economically, culturally, etc.) in terms of
national
consequence - and its probably a good question as to why more poets -- to my
knowledge - in the large have not touched on the subject, and photographers
have.
Yes -- re Kevin Killian -- the current show, CROSSING THE FRONTIER (Sandy
Phillips, curator), an exploration of the use of the land in 19th and 20th
Century photographs (from the 100th Meridian to the Pacific) is a wonderful
and disturbing show at SF Museum of Modern Art- of which there is a good
catalog published by Chronicle Books. Not without elegance, it is a
definitely a post-sublime view and interpretation of Western landscapes.

This short report by Michael Moore and his recent run in with Borders has

The Rorty article I mentioned is (provocatively, to some) called "The
Inspirational Value of great Works of Literature" and is in Raritan
XVI:i Summer '96.  Rorty doesn't renounce the thoerist's calling like
Lentricchia, he seeks to define a philosophical basis for the value or
privilege of literature, and positions himself against what he sees as
the excesses of cultural studies.

Pierre & all,

According to the latest New Yorker, "Crash" will open in the US next March.
Apparently, the Lords of Media at Time-Warner have overruled Ted Turner. But
this latest manifestation of censorship via media
congllomerate-consolidation is certainly ominous.

I wasn't involved in that thread, but I recently read a piece by Rorty
in the current issue of _Raritan_ XVI:1 (Summer 1996). The essay was
called "The Inspirational Value of Great Works of Literature". It may
be a different piece than the one mentioned, as this was intended as an
anti-Platonic,  pragmatist defense of the ideas of "inspiration"
and "great literature", not a renunciation of anything. Rorty writes:

        Inspirational value is typically _not_ produced by operations
        of a method, a science, a discipline, or a profession. . . If
        it is to have inspirational value, a work must be allowed to
        recontextualize much of what you had known; it cannot, at
        least at first, be itself recontextualized by what you already
        knew.

Later, he discusses the "endless attempt to make the intellect
sovereign over the imagination." I suppose that could be construed as
a critique of certain forms of "theory", or certain practices.

I actually found it pretty inspirational.

Jordan,
A decent book to start with is Stephen Cushman's William Carlos Williams and
the Meaning of Measure (Yale University Press: 1985).  Not the whole story

Jordan --

There's a nice chapter called "Syntax in Rutherford" in Kenner's _The
Pound Era_, where he analyses "Poem" (the cat & the jamcloset) line and
even word by word and line.  Mainly on the linebreaks.  For prosody,
dunno.  Just the other day read some scurrilous remarks by John
Hollander on the variable foot, lemme see: "Well, Williams probably
copied that variable-foot format [the three descending indented partial
lines of the late work] from Pound's earlier usage, except that what
Williams says about the variable foot is sheer garbage.  It doesn't make
any sense."*  Thank you, M. Hollander, for that clarification.  May
Williams return from the grave and piss on you from a great height.

Kenner, otoh, has this to say:

"He [WCW] struggled with the essay on Measure, could not subdue its
roughness, abandoned it finally for greatly edited publication.  An
iambic pentameter civilization had ended; that was the principle he
wanted to entrap, down among history's slow currents.  In the essay, as
elsewhere, he spoke of "the American idiom," a phrase whose virtu he had
discovered late in life, and of "the variable foot," which seems like a
rubber inch.  Such terms do not deliver meaning; they are points for
meditation.  Take his three-ply line; take the remarkable passage in
which he had first come upon it:

        The descent beckons
                as the ascent beckoned.
                        Memory is a kind

        of accomplishment,
                a sort of renewal
                        even

        an initiation, since the spaces it opens are new places
                inhabited by hordes
                        heretorfore unrealized,

        of new kinds --
                since their movements
                        are toward new objectives
        (even though formerly they were abandoned).

-- Did he mean, for instance, each line to take up the same time?  He at
once said, Yes; then he said, More or less."  Thus Kenner (pp. 541f.).

If you do find a good book on Williams's prosody, Jordan, do let us
know.

Hi Charles--

Great letter-- if they print it, they will call you first.  Ask if they
will tell you how exactly they intend to edit the letter.

I say this because my letter to the NYTBR protesting their treatment of
Burke's biography of Mina Loy was edited completely against the grain.

I wouldn't have thought the final text as it appeared there possible to
adduce from my own, but.

I wouldn't have believed the *review* as written wld appear there either.

Thursday night the poets gather to hear Jennifer Moxley and Lisa Jarnot read
poetry at the Segue space and the poets mill the room before the reading.
 I'm trying to figure out a way to kiss a poet girl when Douglass comes up
from behind and puts a box on my head.  It's a big box and it slides off my
head and falls to the floor.  It's a box with a new hat inside.  A new hat.
 It's not just like it.  I put the hat on and it's black with a broad brim
from Moe's on the Lower East Side.  Larry Fagin welcomes me to the
brotherhood.

We sit for Lisa and I put the hat on the empty chair and point it so that
catches the poems.  Juliana wonders.  Lisa announces this is an
autobiography.  Many people in the audience are captivated by her reading and
by her use of the word bird.  After the reading everyone tells her stories of
their personal favorite bird.  Also people want to know how "the piece" was
an autobiography since it was mostly about birds.  In Lisa's defense though,
there was a short letter to Jennifer in the middle, also some abbreviated
notes from Sea Lyrics, the deer in the headlights poem where she thinks hard
for us all, the fire in buffalo, and maybe the word Lewis.  Still, how could
this then be said to constitute a new autobiography?  People wanted to know.


The light on the bricks was bright on Jennifer when she read from her new
Imagination Verses and from the spoon and fork chapbook with the quote from
Marx which she didn't read:

". . . there develops the division
of labour, which was originally
nothing but the division of
labour in the sexual act. . . ."

Jennifer reads her poems very well and they put a space heater near your
head, like one of those crane constructions the acupuncturist uses.  After
her musings folks tell her how the poems work better on the page.  It's so
abstract they say!  And there's quotes around it!

The poets go to Lee Ann's for a book party celebrating Imagination Verses.
 Rob tells Juliana he really likes her new book and that he wants to write a
review of it.  It's so good it's like it's written by a machine!  Jennifer
talks about Poetry all night with Rob.  Kim Lyons has a good time with Laurie
Price.  People ask what's in my box.  A rabbit I say.  Lee Ann takes pictures
and shows people her photo albums.  I like looking at her photo albums and
when I do, I always ask who knows more people than Lee Ann Brown?

Friday night the poets meet for dinner at Byron's Steakhouse.  Douglass goes
on about love desire as a social construct.  The poets agree with Douglasses.
 Some attractions are too much for words I think and say pheronomes play a
role too.  O typical says Douglasss.  Once we agree to throw god out the
window, someone always tries to sneak biology in the back door.  I tell Dug I
didn't say anything about love desire as a social construct excluding god and
do an anthropological study.  I query the human database for information
about words.  The poets deem o god an appropriate repsonse and consider Drew
Gardner's line in the arms of my lover the mind of god.  Variants are
proposed as well.

The poets walk to Marlene's for discussions, hornitos, and bud in the can.
 Marlene lives across the street from Sophies the bar.  Marlene is a medieval
scholar and speaks in phrases that begin with The monks do this and The
scribes do that and is always quoting some obscure passionate text.  I,
however, do injustice to the rhetorical charms of Marlene de Grace; for her
sentences are far more fancifully applied and beautifully subordinated than
mine.  To wit Marlene de Grace was born in the year of the monkey.

Marlene is concerned about TMI and constantly evaluates expressions as
functions of this truth table.  For example, Marlene announces she has just
received two hot emails, but gallantly refuses to discuss them, denying
multiple requests.  She also denies Douglass whom she had promised to make
out with once he shaved off his mustache, and his upper lip is clearly naked
tonight.  Tonight where he sits in the bathtub and sips on a clear bowl
filled with Paul Masson brandy & complaints.

Marlene's point of her musings is missives and poses a question of email
approaching more tactile missives between distant lovers.  Shari is against
email and proves it by taking off her shirt and modeling her black bra.
 Shari is convincing to everyone, but Marlene still likes her hot emails.  We
drink to both.

Marlene says she likes the love poems I sent her.  She pretends to blush when
I ask if they excite her.  To prove she's not embarrassed, Marlene goes to
the cupboard and pulls out my love poems to read them aloud.  I get
embarrassed and ask if my love poems are TMI.  Anselm thinks not.  Marlene
reads one.

My lover & I kiss.
I put my fingers inside
my lover.  I put my fingers
inside my lover's mouth.
I think this is known as
basting my lover.

Shari thinks bad poem because it reminds her of baster.  Also, Shari's friend
calls her at 3 am when he's getting the latin word and Shari too is having
its compliment.  Apparently they exhort one another.  Marlene reads greed.

It's the last day
of my lover's visit
and she has gotten
herself all juicy.
I act greedy
& wipe the pillow
between her legs.
Greed does not
please my lover.

Stroffolino presents a lengthy dialectic about the pillow mediating and it
leads to Eliot.  Douglasses Shakespeare says the pillow is merely objective
correlative and gets out of the tub.  He goes across the street to get Marci
at Sophies.  If he gets Marci over to Marlene's & beer, then we won't go to
Sophies like we said, for everyone at Marlene's.

Douglass comes back with Marci starts calling everyone a Bee-atch instead of
a Bitch and is rambunctious.  Also, Marci's glamour dyke friends are at
Sophies and she wants us to follow like we said.  All go to Sophies in the
window.

We take off our coats & sit.  Juliana gets up to buy a round and Douglass
yells at Marci.  Too Smokie Too Bars and This Bar and Too Crowded and All
People Assholes and fuck you for Very Much.  I switch the period  into a
comma after Douglasses last word, and scream Bee-atch at Marci, as if to
second Douglasses nomination.  Changing Douglasses punctuation angers him
more.  My hat is knocked off.  He leaves and soon Marci leaves.  Juliana
brings back the round after Dug's wig.  All are punish ed.

Saturday the poets walk to the Ear Inn over the Brooklyn Bridge.  Crowded
inside and some will not hear the not working speakers at.  It's crowded
inside with energy.  Barbara Einzig is with her daughter and Hannah Wiener
and other daughters and Breadloaf friends & Patricia Spears Jones and Maureen
Owen and Lee Ann like a movie star & Julia Patton's coat and Janice Lowe and
Johanna Drucker and young admirers who have brought books to sign.  Susan Bee
there is with Charles and Felix & Emma.  Brenda Coultas is protesting K-mart.
 Juliana listens to Larry Fagin quote quote:  "We want it clear, god knows,
and we want it thick."

I introduce Patricia Spears Jones and say Brooklyn.  Patricia New York has
been a  long time and was fabulously thin when she came here now fabulously
thick.  She reads poems from Coffee House book The Weather That Kills.  Her
rock and roll poems the house.  A lot of different kinds of musics, but rock
and roll's her favorite.

I collect money for the poets and staff.  From the gate about 50 people
attend.  I tell Lydia 2 and read the protest that sparrow, Tim Davis, Brenda
and others performed earlier that day:

Dear K-Mart,
            We welcome you to the East Village.  We present you with all of
our love and courage--we, The East Village Militia, the only legitimate and
militant arm of the People.  The following are our non-negotiable demands:

1)   Free jazz concerts every Monday night in the greeting card dept., with
each musician to be paid $1000 per gig.  (We know for a fact you can afford
this).
2)   Poetry readings each Wed. night in the Sports And Recreation dept.  (The
poets will be unpaid.)
3)   For 15 min. every Tuesday, the entire contents of the store will be
free.
4)   Drag queens get a !0% discount at all times, with proof of gender.
5)   Every 6 months a noted East Village designer will create new K-Mart
uniforms.
6)   Flout archaic laws!  Sell heroin (cheaply) in your pharmacy!

          We cheerfully await a response to our non-negotiable demands.

                                                                    God Is A
Woman,
                                                                    The East
Village Militia

I introduce Lydia as being influenced by Brooklyn and as possibly of memory.
 She will read from her new collection of old stories called Almost No
Memory.  She is also going to translate Proust.  I always forget the name of
that book.

Lydia's little scalpel stories kill the audience.

Lydia ends by reading the piece about reading Foucault on a train and not
being able to get through a particular sentence while her pencil, the eraser
and marks stray and intentional do battle.  She prefaces the Foucault piece
by talking about San Diego and the old days and how she had doubts about the
efficacy of the then new Foucault piece before reading it at a reading there.
 I laughed loudly when she read it & she felt immensely reassured and
thereafter read with great confidence.  I flattered.  Poets laugh more in the
west I guess.  This surprises me because I thought New York was the capital
of funny poets.  For example, after I moved to New York and met Bernadette
Mayer, she said o you're the guy who laughs at readings.

The poets are satisfied with the days work.  I tell them to come back next
week for Ross Brockley's alternative comedy and Jim Krell's east village love
poems.  And if you're not watching north americans play football on sunday,
Anselm Berrigan and I are reading at the Fall Cafe in Brooklyn at 3:00pm,
Smith St @ President.  Finally I say Charles Borkhuis' Ear Inn series starts
on Dec 7 with Abigail Child & Ron Silliman.  Come early for lunch.  Stay late
for dinner.

I would agree that "hon" is more Chicagoese than what I imagine
indigenous(sp?) to CA.  In 41 years in Chicago, I heard "hon" daily,
weekly?  Haven't heard it since I arrived in CA 3 years ago.

Point Two:  How about Sam Shepard's plays and journals as Western poetry?

Point Three:  I teach in Creative Writing at SF State, so I can't report
on what's happening in English, but I know from how budget lines work that
many department are being given permission to add one or two more
full-time tenure-track faculty without being given new budget lines for
those positions.  Therefore, positions must be carved out of the existing
budget, which leads to a loss of part-time faculty.  In the case of
creative writing, we have an asst. professor of poetry position open for
next fall (deadline Dec 15).  We have no new $$ for this position, so we
have to somehow fund it ourselves.

Been lurking on this list for the last few weeks, so thought it's high
time I post something.  So: first, hello.  And secondly: was looking for
information on getting recordings of "performance-oriented"/improvised
poetry, particularly Steve Benson, David Bromige, FA Templeton, Bruce
Andrews.  I've got Mac Low's CD _Open Secrets_ on order from Verge but
that's all that's listed in their catalogue.  I ask from personal interest
but also because I'm trying to convince the folks on the board of a new
music/performance organization I belong to that bringing this sort of
stuff in is a _good idea_ (I'm trying to overcome some initial
resistance....). -- OK: thanks. --N

I wonder whether Michael B. knows this one. Years ago there was a woman at
Univ. of Toronto wrote a piece that convincingly demonstrated that the
line=breaks and the reading rhythm were different, and for a purpose.
That's all I can remember of that. That's my scholarship for tonight. I
have just been to the launch of Daphne Marlatt's new novel _Taken_, though.

This is weird.
At Daphne Marlatt's launch for her new book tonight I called her "Hon,"
having known her since 1961.

Then I come home and find this "Hon" string on the screen. I have never
been in Chicago, either. Once I drove by Gary, and once I stayed in a motel
near O'Hara. No one called me "Hon" there. But once on a Bus out of
Detroit, a woman I didnt know called me "Sugar".

puzzling language, this English -- "denigrate" means to blacken, but
"de-nigrate" means to unblacken, which is what Tina Turner was accused of
(though the author of the piece seemed a bit vague on what she was up to
in her first, longer-wigged period) --

I've recently been doing some work on _Paterson_ and have found Brian
Bremen's _WCW and the Diagnostics of Culture_ exquisitely insightful.  On
prosody see especially his opening chapter, but there is fairly consistent
coverage of it throughout, so you'll find finger-through to be worth your
while.

Patrick Foley noted some Kenner work.  This reminded me of casual note
which Mike Weaver slipped into his Williams bio:

"Hugh Kenner, who editied Williams' final essay on 'Measure,' has
suggested that Williams' use of the three-part line of the late poems
stemmed from his inability to read after the brain damage of his strokes"

    His eyes could follow a line but not jump back and locate
    accurately the beginning of the next line...I'm convinced
    that the 3-ply typography of his late verse was originally
    a set of helps (with the tab stops) for just such
    line-finding in rereading."

(Weaver, _WCW and the American Background_, 85-6)

Thought that was pretty wild when I first read it.  Still not quite sure
what to make of it.  Anyhow, there ya go.

yes indeed -- that's why I brought him up in my last post to the list --
& thus the European fascination with his work & a movie like PARIS,
TEXAS which tried to address those western scenes & scapes.

Hmm, come to think of it, one could argue that the art form of & for the
West(ern) is film more than poetry??

Nate -- meet Nate, i.e. get Nate Mackey's cd "Strick / Song of the
Andoumboulou 16-25" (Nathaniel Mackey with Royal Hartigan and Hafez
Modirzadeh), on _Spoken Engine_.  (They also have a good cd by -- hm,
can't get out of the Nates this morn -- Nathaniel Tarn called "I think
this may be Eden." Spoken Engine is trying to do a much needed job &
should be supported. Their address is: PO Box 771739, Memphis, TN
38177-1739.

For a non-Nate, try cris cheek's "skin upon skin" from Sound & Language,
which is cris with help, I think. as cc is on the list he may jump in &
give you more details.

Subject:      for Madam Perloff

Madam Perloff,

There is a scurrilous piece in the Sunday Philadelphia Inquirer by
Carlin Romano -- the books editor there -- that purports to be a review
of Wittgenstein's Ladder. If I understand Romano's reasoning rightly,
you fail to understand that there were two Wittgensteins -- the "good"
Wittgenstein (very tidy, the world in 7 sentences, passing over what
cannot be spoken) and his evil twin (untidy, wishing he could speak to
the lions) and, worse yet, make this confusion in the defense of a
"mediocrity" such G. Stein. I'll send you a copy.

Since Romano's a significant step up from Pat Holt of the SF Comical
(tho he's given to the outrageous gesture, as when he began a review of
a Catherine Mackinnon book in The Nation with a "thought experiment"
about what it would be like to rape her), this comes as a let down.

Newspaper book reviewers are their own breed. Or in-breed. Rather like
one of those X-File experiments gone bad.

When Holt took over the Comical job from William Hogan, she ran a piece
announcing that her intentions were to focus on serious writing and
regional (N. California) literature. The very next day, the Chron's
book review was of The British Book of Cats. It's been downhill from
there.

Hogan apparently gave a positive review to the first edition of Olson's
Call Me Ishmael and traded on that with the local poets for years as a
sign that he was "with it." When Dianne Feinstein declared Robert
Duncan Day on his 60th birthday, Hogan, who was on the city's arts
commission and rather into his dotage, read the official announcement
which listed Robert's books. Hogan thought the list was a poem and gave
it a rather dramatic reading before someone (Ruth Asawa?) corrected
him.

What we cannot speak about, we must pass over in irony,

Just call me,
Ron

You want to be called "hon," you need go no further west than Balto. If
being so addressed kept one w/in bounds, never would you get beyond
Pikesville agin (I say "agin" -- I'm a *Western* Jew you know,
saddlephardic).

More on Baltimore language might be supplied by Ron's wife (his hon)
Krishna Evans.

Btw, I missed Ron's original meditation (I don't read this list every

can anyone email me with date info for it? Thanks pohdner.

In Sam Shepard's new book of vignettes, "Cruising Paradise," he is being
interviewed by a Swedish journalist who says the landscape is the star of
American westerns and that Europeans view them for that reason alone.

Marisa, that was really interesting about how the NYTBR changed you letter
protesting the dismissive review of Mina Loy's work. I, for one, would
like to see you post both versions here. If you don't want to post them,
maybe you could send them to me privately. But I'm sure others would be
curious too, and it's the sort of abuse of editorial power we all need to
be aware of & fight against. thanks, Sylvester

Maybe called Mason and Dixon, due out in late spring next year.  Saw this

i'm picking up the west/shepard/filmic space thread piecemeal, but an
interesting take on western space from an american-european is sobin's
"road, roadsides, and the disparate frames of sequence" in _voyaging
portraits_: assembled from travel notes and dedicated to wim wenders
(_paris, texas_). to my mind, sobin's work is a fascinating meditation on
the intersections of language and space.

come to think of it i was called hon in a diner once. but diners is
different i think.  seems like even west coast diners model themselves
after more eastern diners from the movies.

i think i knew i was in the east when i stopped in a diner an hour after
arriving in albany and the waitress said "what can i get yaz?"  first time
i was ever called yaz before.

Maxine,

That's an interesting point, though it smacks a little of interviewese
glibness. Jane Tompkins, in her book _West of Everything: The Inner Life of
Westerns_ devotes a lot of time to the masochistic element in Westerns. You
could say that pain shares co-billing with landscape. The "star of the
Western" could also be the hero's subjection to and overcoming of pain, esp.
in many of Anthony Mann's great films, like "Man of the West," which don't
feature landscape very prominently.

In Sam Shepard's new book of vignettes, "Cruising Paradise," he is being
interviewed by a Swedish journalist who says the landscape is the star of
American westerns and that Europeans view them for that reason alone.

There's an even nastier attack on Marjorie's work in Walter Benn
Michaels's footnotes to his reponse to critics of _Our America_ in
_Modernism/Modernity_ -- Where Walter sniffs that he's not about to be
lectured to on poetry by someone who actually admires Charles Bernstein --

What class -- manages to make stinky remarks about two people in the same
sentence --

But then, to judge from my reading of Walter's book, he has a reading
problem-- perhaps he will write the next one in three-stepped lines--

(Well, I suppose I should give an example -- so nobody will think I'm
just being my usual snotty self -- here's one on a subject of which I
know something at least --

_Our America_ pg. 68

speaking of a well-known line in Benet's _John Brown's Body_:

"Benet's essentially pluralistic nationalism commits him more truly to
denying that he can represent the Negro at all than to representing him
well.  The discovery of the 'American thing' thus appears most certainly
in the assertion of what the 'American Muse' _can't_ sing: the Negro, the
alien."

Now, anybody who's actually read Benet's poem may find this a bit
surprising, since Benet represents any number of Negroes in his lines --
Walter can't seem to distinguish between represntation as speaking _of_
and as speaking _for_.  Benet offers representations of American blacks
all through the poem (that's part of the problem, how he does it!) --
what he declines is to speak in the place of black people --

Always seemed pretty clear to me, but what do I know, what do I know, of
academia's austere and lonely offices??)

Howdy. I hadn't heard about Pynchon, but I have it on good authority that
Orchises Press will be bringing out a new novel by J.D. Salinger (!)
soon. No kidding. Maybe this is old news to y'all (as we say here in

Jordan--Beyond what others have mentioned on WCW's prosody, Henry Sayre's *The
Visual Text of William Carlos Williams* (Illinois, c. 1983) has some good
stuff on his prosody as visual. And the distinguished Mme. Perloff (bonjour,
Marjorie, ma cherie) writes on his prosody in the context of contrasting it
with Oppen's in her essay in the NPF *George Oppen: Man and Poet* collection.

While I hate to find myself agreeing with John Hollander, I too tend to think
that most of WCW's theorizing about the variable foot, etc, is garbage. Now
his *practice* is a whole other matter . . .

Damn! Splat! Here comes Bill's pee, invoked by Pat. (How's that? Iambic
pentameter with an internal rhyme. John Hollander would love it.) While I'm
displaying my ignorance, here's a question that one(s) of you will know. Where
does Duncan describe himself as a derivative poet? (Outside of the NAP note
where he credits Helen Adam with helping him to acknowledge his own
derivativeness.) It's one of those that "everyone" "knows" about Duncan, but I
need a specific citation.

Thanks, and happy Thanksgiving to all.

Alan

One of those "things," that is, that everyone knows about Duncan. Except me,

Yes, Pynchon's novel, Mason & Dixon, due from Henry Holt in April,
200,000 first printing , the publisher says. A fictional account of the lives
of British surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, a story,
according to Publishers Weekly, that Pynchon fanatics have said has
been in the works for years.

set in pre-rvolutionary war america, according to pr stuff from holt, "that
will please pynchon fans."

Ray Roberts, pynchon's long-time editor, also noted that the book The
Letters of Wanda Tinasky, a paperback published in June, purported to
be the lettters Pynchon wrote to the Anderson Valley Advertiser, was
not the work of TP.

Al Filreis had sent me that Inquirer review (which he has, unaccountably,
put on line for his class) and I actually thought it was sort of
wonderfully funny :  this Romano person (who he or she?) complaining that
I dare link the crystal clear and easy Wittgenstein to the "murky"
Gertrude Stein (whom, he says, no one can read anyway!).  I felt I was in
good company with Gertrude.

But the Chronicle, Ron, had a lovely review by Peter Baker--so you're
wrong there.

More serious is the Walter Benn Michaels bit and I thought lurkers here
might like some background!  Bob von H organized a session for ACLA last
year where Charlie Altieri, Bob, and I were to "respond" to Walter.  I'm
afraid we were all pretty negative but Walter is unflappable and always
gets the last word (not easy with Charlie and me around!).

When I wrote my piece for M/M--largely revised from oral session--I must
say I felt I didn't see how he could refute the argument.  And when I read
his final response I thought it was surprisingly mild--till I came to that
footnote which made my heart sink.  Not only because he insulted Charles B
and me in a stupid way, but it was another example of academese.  Walter
purports to believe that there is no such thing as "good" or "bad" lit;
one reads it more or less for cultural information.  If a writer lived in
the 20s, anything he or she has written is of potential interest as an
"index" to the culture.  But woe to the living!  Charles Bernstein
evidently can't be a cultural index; he's just a "bad" poet and Marjorie
has no aesthetic sense because she thinks he's good.  This in an essay
that had zero to do with Charles or anything contemporary!!  It was
entirely irrelevant.

When I read proof, I called Bob and told him I thought he should (and
easily could!) remove that little footnote.  He refused on the grounds
that he thought it made for good debate (???) and that anyway since
Charles has an essay in the same issue of M/M, he is so to speak getting a
fair shake.  You figure it out!

Joe Amato caught it and wrote a good letter; I hope others will, not
because of me and/or Charles but because it's discouraging to see
scholarly journals, supposedly careful in their subjective judgments,
suddenly allow someone to say, "I don't like being lectured on aesthetics
by someone who thinks Charles Bernstein is a major poet."  Period.  No
reference to anything.

Walter is teaching at the Theory school at Dartmouth this summer; I wonder
what theory allows for this sort of thing.  But then, as Stein said,
"Remarks are not literature."

As a matter of curiosity, on the subject of the Western as poetic act,
how many have seen

The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance?
The Shootist
The Searchers
My Darling Clementine
Tombstone

Of those who've seen Tombstone, how many have seen more than one of the
others (and which)? As I say, this is a matter of curiosity (well, a
matter of basic culture in fact, but *I* am simply curious).

Those who used to read Cahiers du cinema way back when know, btw, that
it was chock full of essays on (much more than the landscape of) the
American Western.

And don't forget George Herriman's Krazy Kat, perhaps the greatest marriage
of text and image based on the Western landscape.  Also worth checking out
if you can find it is an old textbook by John S. Shelton, called Geology
Illustrated (San Francisco: W.H. Freemen &Co, 1966).  Shelton was an aerial
photographer who took all the pix for his very readable book.  On the cover
is an incredible shot of the Meteor Crater in Winslow, Arizona.  What better
peek at the catastrophic imagination of the Cold War!  The photos showing
fault activity and erosion are equally spectacular.  And to the list of
Westerns, I would add The Misfits, in which the spirit of Euripides descends
to the desert floor to announce the death of the genre.

I've seen all but _My Darling Clementine_.  But you've left out _Once Upon A
Time in the West_, in my opinion the most grandly poetic Western of all.
And _The Professionals_. And, of course, _The Magnificent Seven_ (which
might be more operatic, come to think of it).  But, of course, once we start
talking about film as "poetic act," we begin to lose the distinctiveness of
poetry as poetic act.

I count _The Searchers_ as a Viet Nam war movie (along with _The
Professionals_, _Ulzana's Raid_ and _The Wild Bunch_).  Check out Richard
Slotkin's _Gunfighter Nation_ for an interesting analysis all four films....

i've always had trouble w/ westerns.  as a youngster i cd never tell the main
guys apart on a black and white screen, where the only clues in any event would
have been clothing color.  they don't say enough to be able to distinguish them
by vocal mannerism, they were all white, about the same age, same hairstyle,
same clothing style.  so i'd miss the whole drama, not being able to follow the
plot. i also had trouble understanding what they did say when they said
anything, it was all a strange jargon about "stages" and "rustling," words that,
even when i could distinguish them in that strange speech, obviously meant
something different from what i understood as rustling (as in, the liquefaction
of her clothes) and stages. even now i have trouble w/ stuff like the x files
cuz the white guys in suits all look the same to me, i can't tell when we're
being introduced to a new character or just cutting back to a former thread
where we've already met the guy, and their speech patterns are not sufficiently
distinguishable.  i could usually tell the women apart because there was only
one.  at most two, the madame and the ingenue.  by contrast, i could tell the
marx brothers apart with no difficulty, and i could always tell the chaplin
character in a chaplin film.  and i could usually tell may west because of the
audience response on the rare occasion that my family would take in a movie,
always at a "revival house" (is that the right term, or is that a religious
term?) in cambridge.  it's obvious i'm media-challenged.

I thought this might be the time to mention: my own article on Perloff's
work is coming out in the long-in-production poetry issue of
_Diacritics_ (with work by MP, CB, and others).   I just got and returned my
page proofs, so maybe the issue will actually come out (with Diacritics,
you never know).

Like a typical _Diacritics_ piece, my own article is both positive and
critical.  I use her new book to read most of the work (with the
exception of the futurism book) since _The Poetics of Indeterminacy_,
with particular attention to the role (vexed) of "theory" in it.  I
actually think it's pretty positive, but Marjorie might disagree.  I
think it's more conversational that judgemental, hoping to push the
discussion of her work in a particular direction.

Everybody should get this issue of _Diacritics_ when it comes out.  I'll
be happy though to send offprints of my individual article to those who
would like one.

Cheers,
David

Marjorie,

What is M/M?

I used to hear that line about there being no good or bad writing back
when I was a student at Berkeley in the early '70s. It's an index of
people who either can't read or who really don't want to be involved
with literature, because they hate all of it.

I'll see if I can find your review in the Chron via the search engine
on The Gate.

Tom et al,

As to westerns, I was blown away by My Darling Clemintine the other
day, an utterly wonderful film (and not at all what one might expect
given that title -- a retelling of the Wyatt Earp/OK Corrall story). If
I saw Tombstone, I've forgotten it. I saw the others but for the
Shootist (I have a Marion Morrison allergy, and anyway actually think
it was a better name than the stage moniker "John Wayne").

My exposure to westerns really came on 50s TV where some of the first
series were just old Saturday movie shorts stuffed into the 30 minute
slots. Red Ryder, Hopalong Cassidy, Lash LaRue (who just died two or so
months ago), Sky King, Roy Rogers.

One of my favorite elements to those shows was how Roy & Dale would
shift time continuums from show to show. Sometimes they were back in
the 1880s in the "old west," other shows they had Pat Brady & his jeep
along for the ride. It may have been my earliest exposure to a
Brechtian device (unless one considers watching Pinky Lee's heart
attack on the air).

i don't know about this.  i've just been involved in a contretemps which
affected me very deeply, in which a poem i discussed for a paragraph was excised
from a 30-odd page essay i wrote because the poem is, by common consensus, a
"bad poem."  (the editor was considering not running my entire piece because he
had such an aversion to that poem, which i wasn't promoting as a "good poem"
--my work doesn't do that kind of thing --but analyzing in its public context).
now, i like this poem.  i can see why others think its bad, but the reasons they
give don't seem powerful to me.  and i think it's perfectly fine. my closest
friend in CA, whom i still talk to several times a week, was so upset that i
liked this poem that she started to doubt the value of having me like *her*
poetry, and said, among other things, that if "just anybody" could write poetry,
why was she doing it.  my response that she did it because she had a passion for
it didn't seem to cut any mustard.  she had to believe that she was "better"
than most people at it.  i need to find some way of theorizing this because it
is crazy-making to have this juggernaut --other people's taste --used as if it
were an objective, and furthermore, ultimate,  gauge of anything.  i really,
perhaps, do think there's no such thing as good or bad poetry, though i do have
my preferences.  some folks gave me grief about my essay called "tell them about
us," which is about the poetry written by some teenage girls in a boston housing
project.  personally i think it's the most interesting work i've done.  but
others prefer the stein, the kaufman, the duncan, etc., the stuff that's about
"real" poets.  i guess cultural studies and poetry have a long way to go to get
together.--md

i wouldn't even know where to start re westerns, i've seen so many of
'em... so this will be FUN (thanx tom!)...

*my darling clementine*, like ron sez, is just beautiful in terms of its
staging, use of landscape, incredible b & w cinematography (i happen to
like the acting lots too, but that's another story)... you can watch it
with the volume OFF---no shit... sergio leone surely learned from john ford
(in addition to kurosawa, i mean, who as all film buffs know learned from
american westerns that themselves imitated ETC.)... i don't have that wayne
allergy ron speaks of---i'll go for *the searchers* as his and director
ford's best western (wayne was so infuriating during the late sixties and
early seventies i can understand being allergic, ron)...

i've always loved *the good, the bad, and the ugly*, to add to kali's *once
upon a time in the west* as my two favorite leone westerns (and kali---i
just LOVE lee marvin's last line from *the professionals*!)... and we may
as well throw the recent (kevin costner) *wyatt earp* (not bad, finally) up
against *tombstone*, and throw in the older *gunfight at the ok corral* too
(given this latter's remarkable cast, and that john sturges directed, same
guy who did *the magnificent seven*---which latter i'm addicted to)... and
what about *the ox-bow incident*---a horse opera that's really about
lynching?... or *high noon*, or *the gunfighter*, or *duel in the sun*, or
*one-eyed jacks*, or *the big country*, or *red river*, or *shane*, or
*destry rides again* (the first destry), or *valdez is coming*, or *little
big man*, or *will penny*, or *high plains drifter*, or *butch cassidy and
the sundance kid*---

and how bout the early west, something like (the newest of FOUR versions,
with daniel day-lewis) *the last of the mohicans*?---

and how much do we want to bend the genre?  b/c *dirty harry* is clearly a
cowboy-cop flick (which eastwood and don siegel played with three years
ealier in *coogan's bluff*)---

and what about the silent era, from *the great train robbery* to harry
carey's one- reelers to tom mix and william s. hart and hoot gibson and---?
b/c the west played a key role here, before sound, in terms of landscape
and motif and early film 'language'---and around, say, 1915, the west was
still what many folks think of as the west---

but here's three favorites from that genre that haven't made it yet to
anybody's list... anybody ever seen *the ballad of cable hogue*, sam
peckinpah's one time surrealist western venture (with jason robards and
stella stevens)?... and how bout (and here i'm picking my favorite from a
half-dozen, on-location anthony mann gems) *the naked spur* (an older, more
grizzled james stewart, with robert ryan and janet leigh)...  and what
about, say, *johnny guitar*---sure to please those of you yearning for a
postmodern retrospective (leonard maltin always notes that the plot from
this flick was lifted for leone's *once upon a time*)...  mercedes
mccambridge and joan crawford  are remarkable...

and how bout one i haven't seen (been scouring the video stores for same),
jim jarmusch's *dead man*, with johnny depp (playing an accountant from
cleveland name of 'william blake'), gary farmer (as a native american
outcast name of 'nobody'), gabriel byrne, lance henriksen, robert mitchum
(yeah---short on women folk, like so many westerns (save for mebbe
*westward the women* or *hannie caulder*))... sounds like a winner, but
i'll have to wait to see... mebbe somebody out there has caught it,
wonderin what you think if so...

and to extrapolate from ron's remarks re tv westerns:  for me, early, b & w
tv IS the west...  from *the twilight zone* to *lost in space* to
*bonanza*, so much of it utilizes western (or west coast) landscapes that
when i first actually SAW the west (being from upstate ny originally), i
felt like i was watching tv...

maria, i think what happens when folks start talking about "good" vs. "bad"
*anything* is that everybody starts to, well, entrench...

mebbe what's necessary is to talk about assumptions here... surely to
question the nature of judgment is not to suggest that we don't "judge,"
right?... i mean, we judge all the time---in our least judgmental states

[insert quote from dewey's _experience and nature_]

[note that doing so constitutes judgment]

i mean, i'm not certain how i would presume to "respond" to somebody's work
[insert "INCLUDING MY OWN"] w/o presuming to understand that specific
aesthetic, while asking how and to what extent a work "works" given its
apparent appeals (which is always a risky endeavor, yes)... which could be
put in terms of what's good, not so good, etc. (a somewhat different
language perhaps from what's bad, not so bad, etc.)... so value is at least
two-pronged here---what we value [insert "and why"], and the appeal a work
makes to a given set of (aesthetic, social, personal, somehow
contextualized) values... along with further complications having to do
with why we might bother with work that seems not to participate in what we
value... all of which gets obscured by the word "taste," albeit taste as
such is not about to go away...

so provided we situate and are clear as to our own impulses---what we
value---and come to a given work in such terms, we might end up by saying
that a given work is "bad"... meaning, does not satisfy what we understand
to be its (appeal to) value... it's not an objective reality---and i think
few would say so (few around here i mean, on poetics)... but just b/c it's
subjective as hell, and fully socialized, doesn't mean we can't say that we
find something---a work of art or a grapefruit---"bad"... and doesn't mean,
i might add, that we *shouldn't*...

now if you don't like grapefruits in the first place, why then your take on
grapefruits may not be all that insightful... personally, i could care less
about grapefruits, but if you tell me you don't like italian food---you and
me, we got a problem!... judgment can be so fuzzy---kinda like that old
joke that woody allen uses someplace or other about the two old folks
eating at the restaurant---"the food is terrible here" says one, to which
the other replies "yes---and such small portions"...

anyway, i trust *your* judgment, maria!...

best,

joe, ready for another sweet potato

Tom:  I've seen 'em all, as you would probably guess --

When I moved East at age 12, I was astonished to find that my new
playmates had formed their image of the West entirely from films -- they
didn't belive me when I told them we had flown East in a plane! --

When I moved West, at age 36, I had the shock of visiting the backlots
where many Westerns were filmed -- finding that those disparate loclaes
were all the same locale --

anybody care to comment on how the conjunction functions in the
descriptor "country & western" ??

AND, for you music hounds out there -- There's a video titled "Times
Ain't What They Used to Be" that includes what may be the only surviving
film footage of Jimmy Rodgers, and a host of other rare clips of music

i have trouble with the "no good no bad literature" school.  it seems to
be part of the devaluing of writing, literature, reading in general.  for
example, we all (or we most) sing in the shower.  but we do not imagine
ourselves frederica von stadt and pavoratti, we do not write indignant
letters saying "why DOESN'T the metropolitan opera pay us thousands of
dollars and let us do our "Barber of Seville" rendition...  we don't play
our air guitar and then wax indignant that we are as good as any musician
in the boston symphony orchestra and anyway why HASN'T the orchestra
taken us up... we don't sew a torn moccasin up and then demand that
hospitals give us operating room privileges becasue we ought to be sewing
patients since we can sew moccasins...

in other words, i think writing poetry is a skill, just like playing the
violin, like dancing, like being a surgeon, and it deserves the same
respect.  there is a craft, there are more effective skilled ways to shape
something and less so...  within the craft, there is, say, the violinist
for the Cheiftans, and there is the BSO symphony violinist, and they are
both very good but very different.

everyone SHOULD be able to sing in the shower, sing with their friends,
sing in the car, use singing to express things best expressed that way and
enjoy the act, but why is it we can acknowledge that "yes, i sing in the
shower but no, i am not a brilliant singer" but if we write in a journal,
string some thoughts in a few lines with a rhyme, we have to be Profound,
Great Writers and No One Is Better Than Us... blah blah blah

i see universities trashing writing programs, english departments, students
trashing composition, and it is all, it seems to me, part of a slide into
insisting that there are no skills, no abilities, no craft, and anyone can
write and it is all great in complete denial of the number of books that
are trash books, books written for light, thoughtless consumption which do
not last beyond that reading -- barbara cartland fill-in-the-heroine books,
fad books, and great, strong, dense works like, of course, shakespeare
but also chaucer, edith wharton, sarah orne jewett, judy grahn, joyce,
etc. etc. which are read over and over, which hold so much thought and
craft and work and ability that each reading brings something new and
strong and true.

why is it so important to so many to denigrate writers and disrespect what
they do?  to trash the people who search and learn and think and practice
with words while we validate people who do that with engines, numbers,
hair, paint, singing?

e, only problem i have with the way you put things is your emphasis on
"craft," b/c it seems to me it's the "craft" tradition that's the
problem... esp. in "creative writing" classrooms, the master-apprentice
relationship permits for uncritical criticism of "creative" work...

i just picked up a flyer the other day for a new book, _the craft of
science writing_ or some such... and another for _the craft of research_ or
some such (this latter authored by joe williams, greg colomb and wayne
booth!---i may have the title wrong)...

"craft" is itself a crafty word, whose etymology (in this case esp.,
etymology needs to be considered) points to the difficulties of instating
it as the *institutional* means through which to establish value... i
understand what you're getting at, of course (hell, my dad was a craftsman
by all accounts) but i really do think we need to find a better language, a
language that gives us recourse to skills and talents and such like that
aren't predicated merely on transparency of same, 'handed-down' as
gospel... b/c esp. in these political climes, emphasizing craft is going to
be understood as saying that thus & so can be transferred from one head to
another (like technology---and with craft, then, we end up with the
romantic genius)... hell, it was to my dad's credit that he went against
the grain, so to speak, even as he became more proficient (and here i
refrain from saying he was an "innovator" b/c of what's been done to that
poor word)...

anyway, as a sort of friendly amendment, if i may...

     Dead Man?  Well, I don't know the first thing abt the west
outside of Cormac McCarthy novels--that's not true I drove thru the
desert one year and loved it like a Finn would.  Anyway, dead man--
the name "william blake" was incidental unless one counts the character
blake's visions as an equasion to the poet.  I thought the film careened
back and forth from parody of the Western to fable-making abt the west,
meaning that I would have laughed myself blue if Jarmusch's cinematographer
(muller?) hadn't been pulling the film into the direction of the sublime.
Which is to say it's like watching Weston or Addams at 24 picture frames
per second.  But that's Jarmusch in my opinion, a beckettian ad-mix of
mordant horror yuck-fest.  I thought the opening 15 minutes with Christian
Slater (did anyone else see him Karate kick david letterman with his
platform shoe in 1988, it was a seminal event in my late adolescence)
fantastic, moving, more exactly "dream-like" than any peice of filmaking I
have ever seen. But the total is a lot more than that, JJ side-glances
at jesuits and the implied machinery of the West-ward advance. And "Nobody"
the indian paints dying "willam blake's" face white as a skull but also
the white man is death for him and for the land. And the white man *is* and
*is* for Nobody by the end of the film, the last 15 minutes of which contain
a hair-raising mix of shlock and the sublime.
    But I saw this film with abt 15 friends 7 of them female
and only one woman cared for it much, and she with a shrugging off of the
fact that all this damnation in the movie stems from (1) capital (trade,
industry, land) and (2) the poor judgement of women.  I won't rehash the
plot here, but i'm curious if anyone else read the film as damn near
misogenist.

At the New Coast conference Thad Ziolkowski raised the question of taste &
was met with, well, not much. It may be that it's the wrong language-game. It
may be better to say "what's this piece of writing _doing_" & what contexts,
cultural/political/philosophical is it engaging, & how. This would still
allow for value judgements but hopefully would cause one to emphasize the
contingency of such judgements & to acknowledge the context(s) (also
contingent of course) the judgement is arising from.

This seems to me driven largely by economics-- a corporate ideology of
"there's not enough to go around"-- in many institutions there's plenty for
the computer lab, &/or research in disciplines that have short term benefit
to industry, often the defense industry.

I don't find this very tasteful.

I've encountered recently, from more than one friend of mine, the statement
"I hate jazz." This seems to me a very problematic exercise of "taste." To
cordon off entire cultural areas like this. & seems a fairly regular
occurence in this culture actually which may have replaced other sorts of
prejudice among those with some degree of education-- prejudice moved into
genres of culture rather than more crass expressions of prejudice. "I hate
reggae" "I hate opera" "I hate Bob Dylan"(he's his own genre ya know, or more
appropriate to say in dismissing him you're dismissing an entire tradition)
"I hate _____." It seems to me one has to _try_ & withold value judgments
when first encountering a work of art, music, whatever. Again, to see what
it's _doing_, yet people's reactions at times seem so _visceral_ -- they're
not willing to grant an artwork a valid context at all. They're wrong about
this.

It's interesting, to me, the relationship to mass media movies and
poetics. I wonder about that, TV, sitcoms, animated features, the
whole baulliraud (sp?) connexxition. Also cdrom and stuff in
relationship to the "word as image//image as virus", relationship with
contempoary poetics.

I mean, are we going to be taking apart films other than Brakage/Deren
in a few years and saying there is cinematic poetry there??

What about Star Trek (Anselm Hollo once recounted to me his "secret"
passion for sci-Fi films (although it was Solaris (after Lem's book)).
As a twenty-somthin', I find it really difficult to come outside of
media in my poetics, and find media (film/tv esp) really limiting my
sight/site on the Poetry landscape.

Maybe it's all glossalalia. These weird "languages" interupting
perception.

Maybe not.

Yeah man, but haven't you been to those HORRIBLE readings where it's
osmeone you have been waiting to see yr whole LIFE and they sound like
two fucking cans tied together with a cord (hey now that isn't a bad
idea). Or a silly juvi-40yrold that thinks thier genius is between
their head when it's between their legs (but IF I wanted to see that I
wd rent "Debbie Does Dallas".

Poetry needs CANDOR to survive as a fine art. The medium necessitates
mindfulness, if that isn't craft then it at least has to be duende.

Then again, my veiw of what is "good" and "bad" art is pretty
extended. I like most anything that doesn't put me to sleep. Maybe
that isn't so critical. I can be more critical, craft wise, in
workshops, and editing. The less obvious something is, the better.
That's the way I like MY art.

It's this kind of comparison that, I think, points up some of the weaknesses
in the "good / bad literature school."  Eliza, I don't know you, so please
don't read any personal judgement into my words--I'm just working with the
text you've placed on the screen.  The "good" music that you're comparing
the "bad" shower music to is all.... classical.  I might have assumed you
were using classical music only as an example (instead of the *only* good
music), except for the "air guitar" comment, which juxtaposes "(bad) teen
bad music" (rock) against "mature good music" (classical).  This "low
culture" / "high culture" split usually works to devalue the cultural
productions of nonwhite and working class people. Similarly, the "good / bad
literature" school works to devalue the writing of nonwhite and working
class people--except insofar as those people can master the writing styles
of the white upper class.

For me, the question always is:  "*Why* are people writing in a particular
way, about a particular set of subjects?"  Aesthetics are relative, and I am
bound to find rap music "bad" if I'm judging it on the same terms I judge
contemporary classical performances.  I can start to find rap "good" (and to
distinguish between "good rap" and "bad rap") if I understand rap's own
traditions, its connection to a rhythm-based West African aesthetic, its
ties to blues and jazz forms, its invocation of and Signifyin(g) on the act
of storytelling, its creation of the rapper as trickster figure (Signifying
Monkey), and its place in a long line of politically subversive acts
deliberately and self-consciously undertaken by an historically oppressed
people.  If I'm working within the rap aesthetic, I can start to understand
how brilliantly Ice T handles the medium (he's "good"), and explain why poor
imitations (like Vanilla Ice) are "bad."

I make my "good / bad" distinctions within particular, pretty clearly
defined categories, and I tend not to compare categories. (To me the
question of whether rap is "better" or "worse" than classical music is
simply not compelling.)  And even within particular categories, I temper my
"good / bad" judgements with a follow-up question.  "But, is it
*interesting*?" Something can be "bad," but still be interesting (because it
does something, because it means something), which implies that as a
cultural critic I ought to pay attention to it.  In fact, I often care more
about "interesting" than "good" *or* "bad".  Like most cultural critics,
I've pretty much given up the notion of some sort of fixed set of standards,
and operate on the level Joe (hi, Joe!) suggests, the level of trying to
understand "to what extent a work 'works' given its apparent appeals."

Again, I'll nod to Joe here, and note that craft guilds have traditionally
been exclusive, often for motives more economic than skill-related.  (For
example, black craftsmen were barred from Southern guilds and, later,
unions.)  These days I find that the writing "craft guilds" tend to enforce
a pattern of exclusion of writers whose subject matter or style doesn't
necessarily serve the interests of the "master craftsmen/women" who run the
"creative writing" programs and workshops, and who do the hiring of the next
generation of "master craftsmen/women."  In fact, I make it a practice to
publish poets who find themselves excluded by these guilds, or who reject
the environment and judgements of these guilds.  Not-so-coincidentally, most
of the poets I publish are working class and prefer to see themselves in
terms of the working class, rather than adopting the "professional" status
of the "literary" writer. Just as the level of working class voices and the
display of working class manners can make "genteel" diners flinch in
restaurants, I find that quite a few "guild poets" and critics flinch at the
bald intent of these working class writers to express themselves in the
language that is their own.  Frankly, I've got no patience for this, and I
think that such dismissals are more likely due to a refusal of the
privileged to pay attention to what the working class is *doing* than to the
poor quality of poetry produced by working class writers.

Subject:      taste & etc.

to move back towards maria's initial post in this thread, it seems to
me that what's revealed in a statement like
> i really, perhaps, do think there's no such thing as good or bad poetry,
>though i do have my preferences.
is a tension between 'taste' & all that implies (ie., the social constitution
of the 'individual' & so taste, etc.) and what use can be made of a cultural
artifact.  'taste' has its place [wants to say "inextricable"--see previous
parenthesis], ie., is [has no doubt] reflected in the choice of objects &
the critique itself (there is some'one' to steer and adjust, some'one' to
drive the car), but can't somehow invalidate an object qua cultural artifact.
as joe is quick to point out, 'bad' is only 'bad' within
>a given set of (aesthetic, social, personal, somehow
>contextualized) values,
which doesn't render judgement somehow 'wrong' (im not sure what this
could mean in this case--seems paradoxical), but does point up
its contingency.  what i find distressing about the editor you (maria)
mention is that he seems not to see this tension, misses the contingency of
judgement--or, more troubling, understands it and enforces "common
consensus" anyway.  leaving aside the question of whether you like
the poem or not, you use it (presumably) to enact a critique.  his
decision to excise it on the basis of 'common taste' [ beloved chimera]
makes as much sense as excising an analysis of, say, an episode of
"three 's company," because, well, no one ever really liked that show anyway.

incidentally i think the consideration of 'taste' vs. 'use' [wants to
say "exchange value" vs "use value"--but doesnt want to muddle the
issue] can be a fruitful one in terms of poetics.  im reminded of Charles
Bernstein's contribution to _Writing/Talks_, towards the end of which
he might be taken as [trying not to be reductive] pointing up this same
tension: "I don't think I manage to achieve as many possible
interpretations as I might like. . . . I'm very much limited by what makes
sense to me, because of this horribly mistaken but nonetheless ongoing
concern for the poem to sound right."

And in the late '70's in grad school in a class supposedly on approaches to
criticism I was taught quite seriously that "one should not write about
literature one likes, because one can not be properly objective" about it.
That is the remembered quotation, anyway. Strange workings, wouldn't one say?

I am in strong sympathy with the above, but must add:  art is short, craft
is long.   We cannot, must not confuse art with craft.  Art is short, craft
is long.  Many artists have worked hard to shed craft (e.g., Picasso,
Ginsberg, Cage, etc., etc.) in order to get more deeply in touch with their
art.   Art can be intimately tied to immediacy, spontaneity -- craft cannot.
And yes, "anyone" (meaning someone with little or no training) *can* produce
a work of art, even a great work of art.  But it takes many years of
dedicated work to produce even decent craftsmanship.  Great craftsmanship
can take a lifetime.

So:

1. skill and training are required for craftsmanship, not art.

2. Fine craftsmanship should by no means be regarded as inferior to art.

3. Most serious artists ultimately become fine craftsmen in any case, simply
because it requires craftsmanship to get what you *want* (as opposed to
something that is "merely" art).

4. Even if art is not craft, art criticism definitely is.  Therefore,
anyone, even a great artist, cannot simply declare her/himself a great
artist.  Nor can just anyone make judgements on art that are deserving of
our respect.  Only someone who has spent years perfecting the craft of
critical looking and thinking is in a position to pronounce a work of art
good or bad.

5. A really fine critic would know better than to pronounce a work good or
bad in any case.  Criticism is not a matter of opinion, but revelation.

One of the Great Westerns yes-certainly among the  2 or 3 most remarkable
spaghetti Westerns-but to me "grandly" poetic misdescribes the paranoically
tight close-ups (of sliding interlocked gazes, objects in rooms, sudden
glints and spills of sunlight, etc.) that so much of the film's psychology
relies on.  The viewer is not freely roaming in a vast plain (grand), but
always already anxious about sighting and being sited.  From another angle,
it's like a grafting of international anime techniques from comic strips and
animation back into one of their source genres.   Also, it's a Western w some
of the most effectively "true grit", as in the train scenes and the way the
light often seems to fight its way through a rough static dust.  Also
definitely reveals that Henry Fonda should have played more VILLAINS in his
career; I think it's his best role, aside from the young buffoon tycoon
playboy in... Can anyone help me w the title?  His co-star was Barbara
Stanwyck as a gambling cheat's daughter aboard an oceanliner-Preston Sturges
wrote the very witty script...
      In any case, I'd like to throw another Western title into the hat:
 Jodorowsky's _El Topo_, in which gunslinging, Zen paradox, Todd Browning's
midgets, Judaeo-Christian apocalypse, mystic quest tale, and frontier town
fuse (jeez, beginning to sound like J. Hoberman in the _Village Voice_) into
one potent hallucinogen, or at least that's the way I felt when I saw it
several times in college.  I believe that Jodorowsky's actors sat in a circle
and drank freshly drawn horse blood before each day's shoot in the desert; my
friends and I ingested other preparations before going to the theater and
hardly made it back to the dorm.  It's a Western in which the characters that
lose the duel win.

Q:  What's the title of the Western in which a young Wm. Shatner plays a
gunslinger who battles his twin?  It's full of mirrors.

I believe the "somebody" you are looking for is Gabby Johnson (at least
the last name is certain, as everyone in the town of Rock Ridge is named
Johnson - inbreeding I suppose).  You may want to double-check your

umm...  I've never seen Dead Man myself...  but I did see David Letterman

The River's Edge, was a true story about a murder in my home town of

I'm not a Letterman enthusiast and don't catch many of his shows, so I
don't know if Christian Slater attempted the same feat.  Wouldn't that be
interesting - cataloguing the guests who have taken swings at Letterman
(or how many wanted to)?

Originally sent a version of this just to Maria, but having read other
folks' stuff thought I'd throw this into the stew (Maria I changed it in
response to other comments):

How about meticulousness and attention to the genre (even if you're
inventing one on the spot, e.g., Stein, Cage, Bill Monroe, Bob Dylan -- no
hi/lo distinctions here!) as opposed to, say, self-expression (which notion
gives me the creeps)?  It isn't a question of wanting to be better.  It's
more a question of lineage, heritage, transmission (2 Buddhist words and a
Jewish one there, my standpoint is showing).  Once you place yourself in a
genre you run the risk of failing, at least comparatively, while if you are
not caring about genre you can't possibly fail.  Does any of this make
sense?  My cousin Deborah Kahn is a painter who spends weeks, even months,
putting paint on and scraping paint off the same canvas.  Why doesn't she
just stop the first time?  That's a very important point.

You're right about this, Walter.  "Grandly poetic" applied only to the
themes the film addresses, not to the cinematography/directing, which is
exactly as you describe it.  It's just that there's something so... grand...
about the Bronson/Robards/Fonda juxtaposition.  They are all three much
larger than life, a pantheon rather than a character set.  And when they're
all shot so close, it just makes them look bigger--sort of like Hopkins
surging out of his too-tight prison jumpsuit in _Silence of the Lambs_.

C'mon maria, we gotta see this poem.  *I* gotta see this poem.  We promise
to be nice.  Besides hardly anyone's here, they're all off on vacations.  So
now's a good time to squeeze it in.

I've had an experience a bit like Maria's -- The shortest rejection
letter I ever received for an essay said, and said nothing more about the
essay, that the two readers "couldn't warm up to the poetry" I was
discussing (which was by Steve Jonas) --

I seem always caught between people who want to assign their own
aesthetic principles to eternity ("there is a good and bad, measurable,
hovering out there beyond my own set of experiences somewhere") and those
who deny that there is any possibility of discussing the "goodness" or
"badness" of any individual work of art -- Why is it so often so
difficult to get a discussion going with each other about the nature of
our aesthetic judgements and how they got that way?

Worst recent example came during a discussion at PAMLA in Irvine this
month -- A professor of German rose to avow that there simply wasn't
enough time to spend reading contemporary works -- we should attend only
to those which have withstood the test of time -- and besides, he
announced, nobody could tell what was "good or bad" in contemporary art
anyway -- I responded that a refusal to read the contemporary was an
abdication of the very testing of time to which he appealed -- He was
later heard to refer to me as "one of those Cal State people" -- ah well,,,


I've got an essay in that forthcoming _Diacritics_ too (there's another
long story) -- a longer version of the talk I gave at Orono on Russell
Atkins --

no, but i heard of it. what's it like?  when my mother visited mpls recently i

Thinking of Danes, does anybody on the list know anything about a
contemporary Danish composer called Per Norgard (slash through the o;
small circle on a )-- he has done, so I am told, an opera based on the
life of the poet/paintert/schizo Adolf W?lfli, broadcast on Danish tv a

walter, one of only two flicks of shatner's that i *haven't* seen,
according to this film ref. i've got sitting here next to the tube, is
*hour of vengeance* (italian, 1968)... is this the film you're thinking
of?...

while we're at it:  those of you who haven't seen shatner as a racist in
roger corman's *the intruder* (1962) should run right out and try to locate
this one... powerful flick...

aside from the apt interpretations thus far rendered wrt leone's *once upon
a time*, i think one of the key elements that stands out is the sheer humor
of his work... it's bloody and balletic and alla that, and the close-ups
'sweat,' yes, but so much of it is so downright funny... in fact, i think
this is where/how leone redirects the traditional western mythos so that he
gets some mileage toward the sublime/grand... note the threes in his best
two westerns---bronson/fonda/robards and eastwood/van cleef/wallach... it's
the low-down dirty (gun)fighter---wallach (the ugly) or robards
(cheyenne)---who mediates twixt the bad (van cleef or fonda) and the "good"
(bronson or eastwood---bad when they're good, and better when they're bad,
to riff on mae west)... wallach is a bit of a clown, referring to eastwood
as "blondie," crossing himself every time he kills somebody, and setting up
(with eastwood) that phony bounty hunting-hanging motif that frames the
flick... and in robards' entrance he's trying to find somebody who knows
how to "play"... recall his shooting the guy in the train with a gun in his
boot... i nearly split my sides when i first saw that scene... but the
point is that the humor bumps right up against death---i mean, the guy
whose face is staring at the boot dies, robards dies, and if blondie didn't
have a sense of humor at the end of *the good, the bad, and the ugly*,
wallach would die too... even the punch-line of *once upon a time*, the
revelation of that harmonica tune, is a form of poetic justice that turns
on a certain sadistic sense of humor...

a bit too neat perhaps, but this is how i see the larger-than-screen-life
emerge--- naturally, it's the 'good' and the 'ugly' who bond against the
bad, the really bad... so both flicks are in essence buddies flicks, with
morality addressed only as figured in the extremes of evil, and comic
relief or smartassedness (like quips out of a comic book, yes) as a way to
neutralize (or punctuate, if you see it this way) both the homoeroticism
and the reality of death...

geez i really love those films!...

hi folks,

i hear another topic rumbling in the distance.  i'm curious to hear what
people think about teaching and awarding degrees in creative writing at
the university.  i've heard it argued (convincingly to my mind) as (yet)
a(nother) attempt by the academy to reign in and disseminate an "official
verse cultural" (is this charles b's term for it?), and also to respond to
the market shift for products (courses) more desirable /attractive to
students.  theoretically, an established writer brings prestige and
attracts talented students; but more often, a little-known writer with an
m.f.a. and several books gets hired to teach (scare quotes? can the
writing of poetry/drama/fiction be taught?) writing to students who will
be awarded an m.f.a. publish several books and hope one day to land a
writer-in-residence post themselves.

thomas, the teaching of creative writing in the (u.s.) university goes back
decades, as i'm sure you know... i mean, creative writing has an
institutional history, like technical writing, say... and sometimes it's
surprising to see how such fields were initially envisioned...

since i teach, i'm prone to making statements re creative writing from this
orientation, esp. b/c i know of *no* writers who aren't initially exposed
to 'creative writing' through the educational system (whether in grade
school, in the form of ostensibly innocent notions of poetry, or
college-level writing courses)... so i'm always hankering to find a better
way to teach creative writing, to counter the more insidious uses of this
curricular slot (so to speak) to generate its own internally
pseudo-consistent industry... seems to me much can be done under the
auspices of "creative writing" that generally isn't done... and every time
i see the words "national publication required" (and equivalents) in ads
for creative writing positions my stomach hurts---i see this as catering to
the notion of visiting talents who by their sheer presence (which relates
to a telos of presence in general) will somehow provoke more or better
learning... if this latter isn't simply a dodge, i mean, that obscures the
very real institutional influence that talent, perceived as such, can
wield...

anyway... one thing to note up-front:  that talk about creative writing
usually falters on the line between the history of writing instruction
(that's us academic-professionals) and the history of writing as such
(that's us poets who see ourselves as poets, but other writers around here
too of course, who may or may not appreciate the term "professional")... i
should have writ "histories" in both cases, as these relate to the various
genres... depending on how one situates oneself as a writer, one will
likely draw on a composite of such histories... personally, i wouldn't
ignore either, anymore than i would throw away the tag 'professional'
(which latter could stand some serious leftist rehab)...

but anyway, you get my point---i think that intervening in the
(institutional & personal) gap that tends to separate these two histories
may be a way to begin rethinking creative writing...

best,

I'm getting in on this thread a little late, but can't resist tossing in my
two cents. I've seen all the films Tom mentions and think they are great.
esp. the  Ford films (no one has ever married German expressionism to
Western landscape the way he has, above all in "Clementine"). Glad to see
others mention Peckinpah and Leone, and that Joe mentioned the great Anthony
Mann, who used Jimmy Stewart as well as any director with the exception of
Hitchcock in films like "The Naked Spur" & "The Far Country."

Thanks Kali, for mentioning Slotkin's _Gunfighter Nation_. Great book,
although his two earlier ones in the series in my opinion are even better:
"Regeneration Through Violence_, and _The Fatal Environment_. I'm using all
three to support arguments in a paper I'm working on about the function of
the Mexican border in Peckinpah's "Wild Bunch," "Alfredo Garcia," and "Major
Dundee" (Peckinpah's equivalent of Welles's "Chimes at Midnight" and
"Othello" - i.e. a mutilated masterpiece). I'm also thinking of throwing
"The Professionals" into the mix (a film wholly unmarred by Richard Brooks'
usual affectations and pretentiousness) as well as Robert Aldrich's way cool
"Vera Cruz," with Gary Cooper & Burt Lancaster, a film that in 1954
foreshadowed Peckinpah & Leone and effectively undercut the mythological
style of Ford et al. with its sharp critique of heroism and its cynical
humor.

I've always thought "Shane" grossly overrated though George Stevens has a
marvellous eye to be sure. Ditto for "High Noon." I prefer the Hawksian
riposte of "Rio Bravo." And "Butch Cassidy" is just for me, egregious beyond
belief, a thoroughly denatured Western (Sorry Joe). Compared to "The Wild
Bunch" which was released the same year - well there is no comparison. Wm.
Goldman raises my hackles while George Roy Hill got all the credit for the
famous cliff jumping scene that was taken shot for shot from Henry
Hathaway's much better 1939 "Jesse James" with Hank Fonda & Tyrone Power. (I
suspect Hathaway prob. stole it himself from some film in the silent era
when stunt doubles were routinely killed performing outrageous stunts). Hill
hardly strikes me as the postmodernist type (though his "Slaughterhouse 5"
is quite good).

As for Wyatt Earp, I'd take "Tombstone" over the Costner pic any day. I had
occasion while in Hollywood to read an unpublished MS. by Earp scholar Glenn
Boyer out of Univ. of Tuscon I think and though the film is fairly authentic
in all the details in the end it seemed nothing but details - I found it
unbearably tedious. Ford had the right idea - "print the legend." Or if
you're Leone & Peckinpah, deconstruct it.

Back to the leftovers,
Patrick Pritchett

i wouldn't even know where to start re westerns, i've seen so many of
'em... so this will be FUN (thanx tom!)...

*my darling clementine*, like ron sez, is just beautiful in terms of its
staging, use of landscape, incredible b & w cinematography (i happen to
like the acting lots too, but that's another story)... you can watch it
with the volume OFF---no shit... sergio leone surely learned from john ford
(in addition to kurosawa, i mean, who as all film buffs know learned from
american westerns that themselves imitated ETC.)... i don't have that wayne
allergy ron speaks of---i'll go for *the searchers* as his and director
ford's best western (wayne was so infuriating during the late sixties and
early seventies i can understand being allergic, ron)...

i've always loved *the good, the bad, and the ugly*, to add to kali's *once
upon a time in the west* as my two favorite leone westerns (and kali---i
just LOVE lee marvin's last line from *the professionals*!)... and we may
as well throw the recent (kevin costner) *wyatt earp* (not bad, finally) up
against *tombstone*, and throw in the older *gunfight at the ok corral* too
(given this latter's remarkable cast, and that john sturges directed, same
guy who did *the magnificent seven*---which latter i'm addicted to)... and
what about *the ox-bow incident*---a horse opera that's really about
lynching?... or *high noon*, or *the gunfighter*, or *duel in the sun*, or
*one-eyed jacks*, or *the big country*, or *red river*, or *shane*, or
*destry rides again* (the first destry), or *valdez is coming*, or *little
big man*, or *will penny*, or *high plains drifter*, or *butch cassidy and
the sundance kid*---

and how bout the early west, something like (the newest of FOUR versions,
with daniel day-lewis) *the last of the mohicans*?---

and how much do we want to bend the genre?  b/c *dirty harry* is clearly a
cowboy-cop flick (which eastwood and don siegel played with three years
ealier in *coogan's bluff*)---

and what about the silent era, from *the great train robbery* to harry
carey's one- reelers to tom mix and william s. hart and hoot gibson and---?
b/c the west played a key role here, before sound, in terms of landscape
and motif and early film 'language'---and around, say, 1915, the west was
still what many folks think of as the west---

but here's three favorites from that genre that haven't made it yet to
anybody's list... anybody ever seen *the ballad of cable hogue*, sam
peckinpah's one time surrealist western venture (with jason robards and
stella stevens)?... and how bout (and here i'm picking my favorite from a
half-dozen, on-location anthony mann gems) *the naked spur* (an older, more
grizzled james stewart, with robert ryan and janet leigh)...  and what
about, say, *johnny guitar*---sure to please those of you yearning for a
postmodern retrospective (leonard maltin always notes that the plot from
this flick was lifted for leone's *once upon a time*)...  mercedes
mccambridge and joan crawford  are remarkable...

and how bout one i haven't seen (been scouring the video stores for same),
jim jarmusch's *dead man*, with johnny depp (playing an accountant from
cleveland name of 'william blake'), gary farmer (as a native american
outcast name of 'nobody'), gabriel byrne, lance henriksen, robert mitchum
(yeah---short on women folk, like so many westerns (save for mebbe
*westward the women* or *hannie caulder*))... sounds like a winner, but
i'll have to wait to see... mebbe somebody out there has caught it,
wonderin what you think if so...

and to extrapolate from ron's remarks re tv westerns:  for me, early, b & w
tv IS the west...  from *the twilight zone* to *lost in space* to
*bonanza*, so much of it utilizes western (or west coast) landscapes that
when i first actually SAW the west (being from upstate ny originally), i
felt like i was watching tv...

Pat, this is Kevin Killian.  You are right about "Wyatt Earp" with Kevin
Costner but about George Roy Hill you are tragically wrong!

He after all is the man who made "Thoroughly Modern Millie," not a western,
but an *unmutilated masterpiece* on the order of Welles' "Citizen Kane,"
however, many do not care for it at all, or so I've found.  But what it
does not say about gender relations, modernism and post modernism no one in
the last 30 years has said either.  Robert van Hallberg, you should be
planning a special issue (double issue) of "M/M" around this film's
upcoming 30th anniversary.

As for "The Professionals" and "Once upon a Time in the West," hello-o!
Why has no one mentioned that the latter is a kind of sequel to or loose
remake of the former, each based upon the *captivity narrative* of Claudia
Cardinale, the creative genius behind both?

"Once upon a Time in the West" also benefits from that wonderful music with
those same 3 themes (by Morricone?) played over and over again in different
combinations.  I don't know what they're called, but I always think of them
as, "Claudia--Unhappy," "Claudia--Hope of Freedom," and "Claudia--Resolute"
and I'm sure others do too.  Finally, must acknowledge the ingenious
back-story plot of "Once upon a Time in the West" written by Dario Argento
and Bernardo Bertolucci, tho' the flashback lynching sequence late in the
film, which explains all the actions of the little boy who improbably grows
up to be Charles Bronson, must have been invented by Argento alone.
Thanks!

Kali,

For that matter, Ford's "Fort Apache" (1948? - one of my faves) cld. also be
considered as a Viet Nam war movie. Slotkin actually thinks that Ford was
making a statement about Douglas Mac Arthur, under whom he served.
Ironically, the same MacArthur who advised JFK to "avoid a land war in
Asia." Which is to say, "every war creates its own cinematic precursors"?
This is Slotkin's thesis - that the ideology which made Vietnam possible was
already well in place by the 19th Century and owes its formation to initial
European contact with Native Americans, as expressed in captivity narratives
by people like Mary Rowlandson,etc.

I've seen all but _My Darling Clementine_.  But you've left out _Once Upon A
Time in the West_, in my opinion the most grandly poetic Western of all.
And _The Professionals_. And, of course, _The Magnificent Seven_ (which
might be more operatic, come to think of it).  But, of course, once we start
talking about film as "poetic act," we begin to lose the distinctiveness of
poetry as poetic act.

I count _The Searchers_ as a Viet Nam war movie (along with _The
Professionals_, _Ulzana's Raid_ and _The Wild Bunch_).  Check out Richard
Slotkin's _Gunfighter Nation_ for an interesting analysis all four films....

My dear Kevin,

I don't mind in the least being "tragically wrong" - one gets used to it
after a while, you know. I don't mind GRH so much as I dislike "Butch
Cassidy." Haven't seen "Millie" though.  Is that with Julie Andrews & Rock
Hudson? I may have seen part of it - can't recall.

Great point about captivity narratives in "Professionals" & "Once Upon A
Time." Which is also the theme of "The Searchers."

patrick, loved *vera cruz* ever since i was a kid!... always identified
with burt's grinning opportunism...

we can disagree about *butch cassidy & the sundance kid*, that's ok!... but
consider that horseback scene that lasts nearly 25 minutes---with butch &
sundance being chased by the hired guns... very few scenes like it in
western cinema that maintain that intensity, and it really conveys a sense
of terrain (speaking of which, excellent cinematography)... i mself do
enjoy the mock-heroic aspects of the flick (again, the humor), and the way
it anachronistically calls attention to its cinematic devices... love the
use of pop music too---only a few aspects of that film seem dated to me in
a bad way, and these have to do with what was hip in 69, so i'll cut my
nostalgia some slack!... but i mean, that entire sequence with strother
martin is so memorable, no?...

as to comparing with peckinpah's *wild bunch* (precursor to cormak
mccarthy's _blood meridian_), i dunno---peckinpah's flick is astounding in
so many ways, but there are moments too where peckinpah seems to indulge
himself in the seriousness of his incredibly macho vision, which in so many
ways butch & sundance undercuts... i saw an interview on tv with ernest
borgnine a while back, who explained that at the point in the flick where
he confesses that he wouldn't ride with anybody other than holden (or some
such), he settled back and waited for the cut, and it took a while before
he heard a faint "cut" uttered from peckinpah, who was sobbing at the male
bonding of it all... seems to me that summarizes the problem with
peckinpah's passion rather neatly... but the film, esp. having seen it
recently restored on the big screen, is nonetheless amazing, yes, incl. the
performances...

i like kevin's reading of claudia---i was feeling remiss mself for not
mentioning her!...

yeah---costner's earp is pretty boring... i own a copy of *tombstone*, i
liked it that much... but although i find costner at times the "bland
megalomaniac" (i think it was) pauline kael called him (with re to *dances
with wolves*) i was still impressed by his attention to detail...

and hey, i've always preferred *eldorado* to its predecessor *rio
bravo*---i think mitchum's performance in the former is a real hoot, and
again---much more lighthearted than dino's more sobering drinking
problem...

best,

and while we're at it, what about some of the more blatantly comic
westerns, such as the james garner pieces, *support your local sheriff!*,
*support your local gunfighter*, (w/elam's final crack) and *skin game*
(which was serious too)... or---dare i mention them?---the sinatra

People in San Francisco who still watch "Butch Cassidy" and "The Man who
Shot Liberty Valance" do so to enjoy the marvelous themes by Burt Bacharach
for each picture.  On the face of it, who would have thought to hire BB to
write theme songs for any Western?  And yet that is the genius of the
Hollywood system.  When I was a little boy my class was actually watching
"Liberty Valance" when the lights came on and this teacher came in and said
President Kennedy had been shot.  So ever since then I have never been able
to hear that menacing, high-hat staccato phrase, "who shot" (if any of you
recall this tune you will be nodding in agreement) without confusing myself
that this was a film about Lee Harvey Oswald.  Some of my friends have
argued that the films "Casino Royale," "A House is Not a Home," "Lost
Horizon," and even "The April Fools" contain more quintessential Bacharach
music, but I always hold out for the Westerns. -- Kevin K.

Century Poetics" at the First Unitarian Church on Thursday, December 5, at
7:30 p.m.  This is a project of the Poetry Center of San Francisco State
University.  These lectures do not have to be specifically on Oppen's work,
tho' many have in the past, and to celebrate this occasion, Dodie Bellamy
and I have made a special issue of our monthly magazine, "Mirage
#4/Period[ical]" which features four (4) unpublished letters by Oppen, as
well as new work by Craig Brock (a San Francisco poet who's kind of the
Stevie Smith of AIDS issues), Lawrence Braithwaite (also from B.C.,
Braithwaite is the young, Black, gay, terrifically talented novelist who
wrote last year's incredible novel "Wigger") and by Barbara Guest, the poet
and actress.  Her piece is called "Hieroglyph Acres."  So come one and all
to these events, say you saw this post and get a free copy of "Mirage
#4/Period[ical]" #63 (December, 1996).

More later.

I don't think my experience is as unique as you think.  I was exposed to
creative writing some time ago.  The idea that there was a write way to
right was one of my reasons for leaving academia.  It has only been recently
that I have begun writing again.  The idea of courses raises for me the
spectres of "good"/"bad" and a single correct upper middle class media
culture.  <><>shiver><><

_skin game_ was indeed both comic and serious, a "civil rights" western,
just like the awful _buffalo soldiers_ (originally titled _soul soldiers_)
which starred raeffer johnson, the great decathalon man.  there was a genre
of black westerns which ranged from grade c flicks (like _joshua_, which
starred fred williamson, of _hell up in harlem_ fame) to more serious
studies like _buck and the preacher_ (sidney poitier and harry belafonte).
woody strode was featured in many of these "civil rights" westerns (_the
professionals_ can be counted among them, as well as being counted as a viet
nam war film).  it's an ongoing tradition--just take a look at the very
interesting _posse_ (directed by mario van peebles) which is framed by woody
strode, who tells a tale that features both contemporary rappers (big daddy
kane), and blaxploitation stars (isaac hayes, pam grier).  poetry, indeed.

kali, yeah, i thought van peebles' *posse* was interesting in this regard
too... not to be, CAN'T be confused with kirk douglas in the earlier (1975)
*posse*...

hey, didn't van peebles do that newer soi-disant women's western starring
drew barrymore/andie macdowell/madeleine stowe/mary stuart masterson?...
can't say much for this latter...

to add to the list david composed, i'd throw in kirk's *lonely are the
brave* (one of my favorite contemp. westerns, better than, say, redford in
*the electric horseman*)... and *there was a crooked man* (with fonda)...
and kirk's self-spoof in *the villain* (don't stay up for this one)... and
a personal favorite, *hombre* with newman... and if we're talking humor,
how could i NOT mention lee marvin in *cat ballou*?!...

as to hopper, yeah, he was in SO many westerns, it really is a 'theme' of
his...

and then there's *the wild wild west* to consider (at least, this was my
favorite tv show as a fifteen-year old james bond addict)... and the new
made-fer-tv 'realist' westerns, like *conagher* (w/sam elliot and katherine
ross)...

what a 'genre'!...

Hi Folks,

Geoffrey Young of The Figures has asked me to pass this special book offer
along. However, he has no E-Mail yet, so S-Mail or call him.


           ********************************
                   The Figures
                   5 Castle Hill Ave.

                   413-528-2552
         ********************************



The Figures proudly announces the publication of three new limited edition
books,  for a one-time only three-fer deal.  Rather than pay $28, this
offer urges you to snatch them up while you still can, for twenty bucks,
which includes postage.

(Single copies available at list price, postage as per above.)

_____________________________________________________________

Tilt, 75 prose poems by Gillian McCain, with cover painting by Trevor
Winkfield, 96 pages,  5 1/2 x 8" $10.00  (One of ten copies signed &
numbered is $20)

      Gillian McCain is the former Program Coordinator of The Poetry
Project at St. Mark's in Manhattan.  As Harry Mathews says about the author
of Tilt, she "takes us on high-velocity spins to the four corners of what
we thought was a familiar world."
     Her lines are smart bombs that go off: "My lap crawled in places I
didn't even know existed.  Aruba, for instance."  What is revealed in these
poems, each titled with a single word, is a verbally incisive, resigned yet
defiant, ambitious yet humorous portrait of the contemporary woman.
McCain's works are, in the words of John Ashbery, "like urgent telegrams
from next door, or oddly but brilliantly cropped snapshots of the life that
is going by."
     Besides Tilt, Gillian McCain is the co-author (with Legs McNeil) of
the recently published Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk,
Grove Press.

Arts & Letters, 16 prose poems by Michael Friedman, with 16 drawings by
Duncan Hannah,  40 pages,   6 x 7 1/2"    $10.00 (signed edition is $20)

     Arts & Letters is a true collaboration; its poems and drawings derive
from and support each other.  If Michael Friedman's theme is "flux in a
wild finesse," as David Shapiro as written, "his generally immaculate snaps
and subtle caresses are formal, private, and discrete," (in the words of
Stephen Rodefer).  In Duncan Hannah, who shows his work at Tibor de Nagy
Gallery in NYC, he has perhaps the ideal artist to work with, since
Hannah's abiding subject is affinity.  "He understands how great a distance
separates him from the past he has chosen as his age of mythic origins.
This understanding generates the melancholy of his art."  Carter Ratcliff

_____________________________________________________________

Pockets of Wheat, Geoffrey Young,  illustrations by James Sienna 4 1/4 x 6
1/2"    $8.00   (signed edition is $16)

     How many words, or lines, or ideas does a poem require?  How much
music?  The author of Subject to Fits and Rocks and Deals, Geoffrey Young
keeps his answers to a not inarticulate minimum.  A part-time gallerist,
teacher and art-consultant, as editor of The Figures, Young has published
more than eighty books of poetry, fiction, and art criticism, since 1975.
     Thirty-nine year old James Siena is a New York artist whose most
recent work is presently on view at Pierogi 2000 in Brooklyn.   In the
spring of 1997 he will exhibit new work at Cristinrose Gallery, in Soho.

No. 111 2.7.93-10.20.96, Kenneth Goldsmith,  620 pages,   5 1/2 x 8 1/4"
$17.50 (February 1997 release)

   The Borscht belt meets concept art in this delirious digest of obsessive
gaiety, this useless collection of perishable information, this wily
catalog of everyday life, this alphabetic bestiary of the ribs, joints,
sinews., and bones of language's alluring lore.  Kenneth Goldsmith has
written what could be the longest, and maybe the last, list poem of the
20th Century.  On the way, he has reinvented prosody-counting by 1, 2s, 3s,
and up-as he inventories the roaring rush of rippling, or is it ripping?,
words: inchoate yet coalescing, a fractal romp on just this side of virtual
reality.
                                                       -Charles Bernstein
