Subject:      Bob Perelman's "JOKE"

The recent Jerome Rothenberg event in Philadelphia is where he told his
"joke" about younger poets, and you can listen or watch (MP3 or video) at
this link:

http://writing.upenn.edu/~whfellow/rothenberg.html

You will want to use the link to the second day for the Rothenberg
conversation and Q&A with Al Filries. Perelman appears about three quarters
through, or more. BUT PLEASE LISTEN TO THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION AND Q&A, it'=
s
TERRIFIC! (In particular I liked Lee Ann Brown's question for Rothenberg,
you'll want to hear this entire event!)

But when Bob Perelman tells his "joke" Rothenberg is talking about the fact
that having been involved with poetry for a very long time that it's hard
for him to keep in touch with everything that's going on now. He then says
to Perelman sitting close by that after his own generation, and Bob's
generation, that the newer poets=85 And then Bob finishes Rothenberg's
sentence for him with, "--you mean that they all write alike!"

I was sitting in that room with the rest of the audience. There was a gasp,
and I know that it wasn't my gasp alone!

Rothenberg then shakes his head and laughs nervously and says NO NO NO NO,
they don't all write alike, that's not what I'm saying!

And then Al Filreis says, "You heard it here first, Bob Perelman says you
all write alike, that's P-E-R-E-L-M-A-N."

Bob takes the microphone at that point, and the first thing he says is that
he was just JOKING when he said younger poets all write alike. Then it's
forgotten.

But not forgotten.

I remember very clearly the tone he used, which is why it was an arrow
strike. But maybe that WAS part of the "joke." ? I listened to it again
online just the other night, and it was pretty much fashioned like a quick,
pointed statement.

Could it be that the reaction he was feeling from the rest of the audience,
and Rothenberg's reaction, and Filreis's reaction, made him turn it into a
joke?

Am I accusing Bob Perelman of lying? Well, maybe a white lie. A save-face
lie.

BUT MAYBE HE'S NOT LYING. OK, maybe it WAS a joke.

Let's suppose it WAS a joke. HOW is such a joke funny, and who was it funny
for I ask? Why would it be funny? Is it funny because it's something he has
heard before and he DOES NOT AGREE with it but is MOCKINGLY saying younger
poets all write alike IN DEFENSE of younger poets?

Is Bob Perelman the GREAT champion of younger poets? Is he coming to the
rescue by making a joke of the joke of others who are ACTUALLY NOT joking?

And who are these others, if there are others?

Hmmm. Who is saying such things in Perelman's presence that would upset him
so much he feels compelled to joke TO DEFEND YOUNGER POETS!? Is Bob Perelma=
n
thinking, "Well, they're simply NOT reading younger poets if they think
THAT!"

Because clearly, in my mind, SOMEONE is NOT reading younger poets if they
think that, because I read a lot of poets my age and younger, and there's N=
O
WAY I would ever say we're all writing alike! But WHO is thinking this, and
saying this out loud in front of Bob Perelman? We need to THANK Bob of
course for making that "joke" on our behalf. AND SO PUBLICLY I want add,
into a microphone while the video camera and sound equipment was mowing dow=
n
his sound particles to SEND HIS BRAVE message to those who would DARE attac=
k
the younger poets!

What is ACTUALLY funny about the joke for me is how over the years I've
defended Bob and his friends when people have said that the LANGUAGE Poets
all write alike. This is something I've heard consistently. I heard it when
I was a teenager before I knew who they were and what they were thinking an=
d
writing. Lucky for me I've always been someone who wants to check out what
everyone is being such a Hater about.

Eventually I had read enough and was prepared enough to confront this
statement, "What are you talking about!? Who have you read!? What have you
read!?" Not once did one of these parrots have an answer which led me to
believe that they had ACTUALLY read a single LANGUAGE Poet! They were merel=
y
repeating some bullshit statement their bullshit poetry workshop leaders
(who ALSO I'M SURE did not read ANYTHING by a single LANGUAGE Poet!) had
said.

BECAUSE, REALLY, if you think they all write alike have you actually READ
THEM? If you sat down with poems by Armantrout, Silliman, Pearson, and
Hejinian, and there were no names on the poems, you would know who wrote
what, or at least would notice these to be four very distinct voices. Poetr=
y
is a tea party to some, it seems! A fancy luxury instead of indispensable
investigation! I say it seems to be this to those who would make such
ridiculous statements about LANGUAGE Poets for being LAZY readers and
half-assed, half-interested poets! And now I also say it to those ill-read
gossips behind Bob Perelman's "joke."

In the end younger poets must learn to persevere, like the LANGUAGE Poets
have, because I FOR ONE feel poets of my generation and younger are writing
some pretty damned HOT poems! I wouldn't trade this time with any other!

FUCK THE HALF-INTERESTED LOUTS!

The denial of Exit Visas to the Palestinian students with Fulbright Grants
to study in the US, as well as hundreds of others denied attendance at
Universities and schools outside Gaza--
is part of the efforts to demolish education for residents of Gaza.  For the
last two school years, the Israeli Government has not allowed any new
textbooks, paper, pencils, erasers and other school supplies to enter the
the world's largest prison.

The hundreds of road blocks, checkpoints and searches make even attending a
local school more and more difficult.  There were also the periods of a year
and more when curfew was imposed and no school at all could take place, as
the entire population was under house arrest.

Plans are being made to develop a system of tunnels for Palestinians to
"travel" on foot- while over their heads motorists drive on what remains of
their lands on the Jews Only roads and highways.
 The drivers will not have to see a single Palestinian,  as they are driven
underground and effectively buried alive.

The Siege on Gaza Continues: Israel Denies Exit Visas to Would-be Fulbright
Scholars

Dear David-Baptiste:

Today the news reported that the U.S. State Department has withdrawn the
prestigious Fulbright grant from seven Palestinian students who live in the
Gaza Strip because Israel will not give these students exit visas to leave
the country. The Fulbright grants - which are funded by our tax dollars and
issued through the State Department - would enable these students to earn
advanced degrees abroad. The Israeli government controls Gaza's borders and
sees all Palestinians as threats to Israel, including these students; as
yet, the United States government has not used its leverage to demand that
Israel release just a handful of exceptional students from the prison
created by the Siege on Gaza.

One student who lost the Fulbright because he was denied the visa,
Abdulrahman Abdullah, was quoted in the New York Times saying "If we are
talking about peace and mutual understanding, it means investing in people
who will later contribute to Palestinian society," he said. "I am against
Hamas. Their acts and policies are wrong. Israel talks about a Palestinian
state. But who will build that state if we can get no training?"

Even some Israeli lawmakers are disturbed by Israel's actions. Rabbi Michael
Melchior, chairman of the Knesset's education committee, said, "This could
be interpreted as collective punishment...This policy is not in keeping with
international standards." Further, he invoked the traumas of Jewish history,
saying that Israel's actions are not in line "with the moral standards of
Jews, who have been subjected to the deprivation of higher education in the
past."

We can learn from the past; this tragedy can still be reversed. The
Fulbright grants are controlled by our State Department. Condoleeza Rice
said today she would "investigate" this issue. Please email Condoleezza
Rice. Encourage her to investigate and ask her to insist that Israel issue
the necessary exit visas so that these students can receive the
opportunities they deserve. This is one small but important way to open a
window into the prison of Gaza.

Thanks!

David,

"I find in thinking with what a Conceptual Poetry might be, that I've
begun with a point of view of paradox.  That is, considering the
conceptual to be the absence of a material object, a conceptual poetry
would be the absence of the poem as a "realization" of its "idea."  If
"the poem" as an object is not to be realized, in what ways may it
then be said to "exist"?"

When the idea becomes the "thing in itself," it becomes a conceptual poem.
To say a conceptual poem exists in itself is to say that ideas exist. The
conceptual poem is the most platonic of all poems, the actual  "poems" bein=
g
illusions.

"One may also ask=97since language is the material of poetry, if
one is to create a conceptual poetry=97does this mean then that the
absence of language is involved?  That the poetry is not in language,
but found elsewhere?

The poetry is in the space between/among words. Words, in a conceptual poem=
,
are demarcations (or thinned out scratches), pointing to outside themselves=
.

In a "purest" conceptual poem, the signifier (the word) turns into a
signified for which the signifier barely exists (only as a relic, in your
case, as a found, deserted object) . The heart of a conceptual poem is, in
my view, in that disappearance.

Ciao,

Murat

David,

" The predominant view of conceptual works in art and poetry is that it
is written language which becomes fore grounded, most often as the
'realization' and presentation of various directives, with their
various forms of pre-conceived constraints, and sets of instructions.
Yet does not the written language itself, as an object which
'constitutes' the directives and instructions, contradict the
'concept' of the 'Conceptual?'"

The reverse is true. In a truly conceptual poem, the written language moves
towards disappearance, in your words, "absence."

bachelor rooms.
sweat shops.
stairs where the light turns off automatically.
numbers fade
from the face of buildings. (*The Structure*, "A Homage to M. Proust)



"{See Appendix B below for some other "Science Fiction" aspects of
Conceptual
Poetry in Relation to the Work Place.)"

The question of "The Spiritual Life of Robots (Replicants)" relates to the
spiritual (conceptual, rather than actual) life of words.

"The directives themselves, expressed in written language, become road
blocks to the Conceptual which is supposed to be "activated" by their
instructions.

  To use written language then to create a conceptual poetry is
not in a strict sense "conceptual" at all, if it produces yet another
object in written language."

f one realizes that the "instructions" constitute the poem itself, then the
"realizations" become phenomenal obstructions, obfuscations
for which the truly conceptual poet, in my view, has very little patience


"It becomes instead a piling up, a massing, of materials
(language, words) which have "walled out" as it were, the conceptual.
Are the words then simply a gravestone or monument to a now absent
concept?"

I think yes. *The Structure of Escape* is my attempt to recapture, to
real-ize that absence. "A La Recherche of Recaptured Absence Absence."

Ciao,

s, these "haunting=0A> questions," are found among Conceptual Poets who emp=
hasize an=0A> "impersonation" via performance, camouflages, costumes, the u=
ses of=0A> heteronyms, pseudonyms and anonymity.=0A>=0A>    In "The Painter=
 of Modern Life," Baudelaire is the first to=0A> define Modernism and does =
so as a conjunction of the eternal and the=0A> ephemeral.  To find that ele=
ment of the eternal in the ephemeral which=0A> Baudelaire saw as embodying =
modernity, he turns to an emphasis on the=0A> particular form of the living=
 art/art as living of the Dandy.  The=0A> Dandy is the non-separation of ar=
t and life in the conceiving of one's=0A> existence as Performance Art.  Th=
e Dandy becomes not an expression of=0A> Romantic personality and individua=
lity, but a form of becoming an=0A> animated Other, an impersonator going a=
bout performing the actions of a=0A> concept,=0A> rather than producing the=
 objects of a conception.=0A>=0A>  This  stylized impersonating, non-produc=
ing figure begins to appear=0A> "dramatically"=0A> in the works of Wilde an=
d Jarry and in many ways in the "life and=0A> works" of a Felix Feneon, who=
 "creates at a distance" via anonymous=0A> newspaper faits divers (discover=
ed to be his and republished=0A> posthumously as Novels in Three Lines), ps=
eudonymous articles in=0A> differing registers of language (working class a=
rgot, standardized=0A> French) in Anarchist and mainstream journals, unsign=
ed translations, and=0A> the barely noted in their own pages of his editing=
 of journals featuring=0A> the=0A> early efforts of  rising stars of French=
 literature.  Quitting his=0A> camouflaged and concealed writing activities=
, Feneon works the rest of his=0A> life as a seller in an art gallery.=0A>=
=0A>  The actual "works" of Feneon, then, are not written objects per=0A> s=
e, but anonymous actions, ephemeral pseudonymous "appearances in=0A> print,=
" and the works of others which he affects a passage for in his=0A> editors=
hip and translations, in his promoting and selling the art=0A> works of oth=
ers.  This "accumulation" which one finds "at a distance"=0A> in time as hi=
s "complete works," is often unobserved and unknown to his=0A> contemporari=
es, who know of him primarily via his "way of acting," his=0A> manner=0A> o=
f dressing, his speech mannerisms, and as the public triptych of images of=
=0A> him existing as a painted portrait by Seurat, a Dandy-pose=0A> photo a=
nd a mug shot taken when tried as part of an Anarchist=0A> "conspiracy."  F=
eneon's "identity as a writer" does not exist as "an=0A> author," but as a =
series of "performances," "appearances" and=0A> "influences," many of them =
"unrecognized" and "unattributed."=0A>=0A>=0A>  Ironically, it his most "cl=
andestine" activity=E2=80=94his Anarchist=0A> activities=E2=80=94which=0A> =
brings him the most in to the public and tabloid spotlight.  As one of "The=
=0A> Thirty" accused and tried for "conspiracy" in a much publicized trial,=
 it=0A> is=0A> Feneon's severe mug shot that for a time presents his "publi=
c face."=0A>=0A> The severe mug facing the viewer is actually producing a C=
onceptual Poetry=0A> "at a distance." By not penning a single line, by simp=
ly "facing the music"=0A> to which others pen the lyrics, Feneon, in doing =
nothing more than facing=0A> the camera "capturing" his image,  proceeds to=
 enact a series of dramas=0A> "projected" on to him, a series of "identitie=
s," and "revelations" which=0A> use=0A> the documentary material to produce=
 a series of mass-published fictions.=0A>=0A>  The possible prison term fac=
ing the "Felix Feneon" in the inmate-numbered=0A> "anonymous"  mug shot, "p=
resents its face" to the viewer, a face "taken,"=0A> "imprisoned" and "caug=
ht" by the image and its publicity.  This publicized=0A> face  facing camer=
a and viewer and possible hard time, is "taken to be" the=0A> photo of the =
face of a being from whom the mask of the clandestine and=0A> conspiratoria=
l have been torn off, revealing "the cold hard truth" of Felix=0A> Feneon.=
=0A>=0A>  Facing trial, however, all that is learned of this imprisoned fac=
e is that=0A> it is "the wrong man, an innocent man."  This fixed image, ac=
quitted of its=0A> "sensational" charges, is revealed not as a truth, but i=
nstead as simply a=0A> mask, a mask operating like a screen or blank sheet =
of paper, onto which=0A> are=0A> projected  the dramas, fictions and "think=
 piece"  writings of others.=0A> Nothing is revealed other than an "identit=
y" which shifts, travels, changes=0A> from one set of captions to another. =
 It is via these captions written by=0A> others under his image in the pape=
rs and placards, that Feneon continues=0A> his=0A> "writing at a distance."=
  Simply by facing the camera, facing charges,=0A> "facing the music," faci=
ng his accusers at trial and facing the verdict and=0A> judgment, Feneon is=
 "writing" a myriad captions, breaking news items,=0A> commentaries, editor=
ials, all of which change with wild speeds as they race=0A> to be as "up-to=
-minute" as the events themselves are in "unfolding."=0A>=0A>=0A>=0A>  The =
professionals, these writers, these journalists and reporters of=0A> "reali=
ty,"  chase desperately, breathlessly, after the unfolding drama in=0A> whi=
ch the mug shot is "framed," and in so doing produce texts of=0A> "speculat=
ive fiction," a serial Conceptual Poetry with as its "star player"=0A> a wr=
iter whose own texts are deliberately written to be unrecognized,=0A> hidde=
n, camouflaged, unknown. And all the while, this writer writing=0A> nothing=
=0A> is producing vast heaps of writing via the work of others, as yet anot=
her=0A> form of camouflaged clandestine Conceptual Poetry, "hot off the pre=
ss."=0A>=0A>=0A>    Rimbaud writes of a concept of the poetry of the future=
 in=0A> which poetry would precede action=E2=80=94which in a sense he proce=
eds to=0A> "perform" himself.  If one reads his letters written after he st=
opped=0A> writing poetry, one finds Rimbaud living out, or through, one aft=
er=0A> another of what now seem to be "the prophecies" of his own poetry.=
=0A> That is, the poetry is the "conceptual framework" for what becomes his=
=0A> "silence" as a poet, and is instead his "life of action."=0A>=0A>     =
 In these examples, one finds forms of a "conceptual poetry"=0A> in which t=
he poetry is in large part an abandonment of language, of=0A> words, of mas=
ses of "personally signed" "poetry objects," "poetry=0A> products."  One fi=
nds instead a vanishing, a disappearance of both=0A> language and "poet" an=
d the emergence of that "some one else" Rimbaud=0A> recognized propheticall=
y, preceding the action--in writing=E2=80=94in the=0A> "Lettre du voyant," =
 "the Seer's letter"=E2=80=94as "I is an other."=0A>=0A>        An interest=

Like all jokes, it has a kernel of truth. Jokes are, of course, not THE tr=
uth, but
exaggerations, diminishments, and other distancings from the truth. It's n=
ot true that
ALL of that generation "write alike", but enough do so that one can joke a=
bout it. Of
course, it's true of every "poetry generation" -- because if people didn't=
 "write alike"
there could be no categories called "poetry generations".

My father used to say that difference between having a sense of what's fun=
ny and
having a sense of humor is whether you can laugh when it happens to you in=
stead of
to some other guy.

You don't want to be the first poetry generation whose distinguishing char=
acteristic is
that it's more like the first feminist generation than any other poetry ge=
neration: lacking
a sense of humor, do you?

In short, lighten up; learn not only to laugh at yourselves but to make fu=
n of yourselves.

Elizabeth--

The first exhibition of Insider/Outsider works shown together--and on an
equal footing, too--
was also the first massively attended traveling art exhibition.  This was
the "Entartete Kunst" (Degenerate Art) Exhibition organized by the Nazi
Party in 1937.  Beginning in Munich, it traveled to nine other cities in
Germany and Austria and overall attendance was estimated at two million
persons.

   Since the beginning of the 20th Century, artists had begun to look
"outside' "Art'  for forms of inspiration not yet  "recognized" as such.
Kandinsky turned to children's art around 1905,  around the time that
Picasso was turning to African sculpture for models, and in a few more
years, Marinetti was turning to  machines and  their speeds, in particular
war machines.  The Dadas used found typographies and images--first done by
Picasso and the Cubists, to a  lesser extent. The use of Found
objects--Duchamp's Ready Mades--is also found in Schiwtters' Merzbau and hi=
s
collages of items found in the streets.  Russian Zaum "Trans-Rational"
Poetry sonically drew on Pentacostal and Shamanic "Logolalia" and emphasied
the use of hand written texts written by poets and then "drawn" by artists,
and often made into books using sections of wall paper "left overs" and
other cast off remnents and detritus.

        The longing for an "outside" with which to make contact  for
"drawing" inspiration and examples with/from, as well as the increasing
interest on artists' and writers' parts in the new understandings of the
unconscious being explored via psychiatry, found  its Rosetta Stone
so to speak with the 1922 publication of Hans Prinzhorn's Bildnerei der
Geisteskranken (The Artistry of the Mentally Ill). This large and well
illustrated tome drew on Prinzhorn's study of over five thousand works,
which he assembled from the Heidelberg asylum where he worked, as well as
via letters sent to colleagues asking for any they might know of, and,
foretelling the methods of Dubuffet in organizing the first Art Brut
exhibits---traveling to asylums and other areas of potential in several
countries. (Prinzhorn was knowledgable in art history and had connections
with Kandinsky and his circle in Munich. Many of the works and artists he
found continue to be "classics" in the history of the awareness of Art
Brut)  The book caused such a sensation that within a year it had gone into
its second edition.
        Less noticed had been Dr Walter Morgenther's 1921 Ein Geisteskranke=
r
als Kunstler (A Mentally Ill Person as Artist) known today in English as
Madness and Art:  Life and Works of Adolf Wolfli, and the first such study
of what post-Dubuffet's late 1940's Art Brut shows and monographs,  has
become known as an Outsider Artist.
     Prinzhorn's book had a huge effect on many artists, especially Paul
Klee, and was also a hit with the artists and poets who were soon to found
Surrealism.

       There is often a confusion in that many people associate Outsider Ar=
t
only with the mentally ill.  Neither Prinzhorn nor Morgenthaler considered
the works of theirs and others' patients as "compulsive activities of
mentally ill persons who make things revelatory of psychoses," but on the
contrary studied them as artists first and foremost.  This approach was not
taken by the Surrealists--Andre Breton having been a medical and psychiatri=
c
student, was in search of the marvelous, which for him could be found in th=
e
subconscious, dreams, automatism in writing and painting, the finding of
mysteriously talismanic objects at flea markets and investigations into the
occult. For Breton, "outsider art" as it is now called, was considered to b=
e
"authentic" only if the creators were clinically mentally ill. Madness and
the subconscious, the automatic, were the outsides of conventional
approaches to art as they came from the areas of the usually suppressed
irrational, the areas free of the chains of the daily "reality" of the
bourgeois world.

 Breton's approach is a large-scale  systematic group/collective as well as
individual application of Rimbaud's famous line re "after a long, reasoned
derangement of the senses . . . (the Seer) arrives at the unknown."

       (if you think about it, only a French person or a person much
influenced by the traditions and history of French culture, would envision
"a REASONED DERANGEMENT"--)

      After WW2,  for a period Breton worked intensely with Dubuffet in the
early development of Art Brut, and then the two had a violent split--(as
often happened with Breton, anyway)--over whether or not Art Brut is limite=
d
only to works of the insane.  Breton being an Absolutist said the line had
to be drawn at the gates of the asylum--while for Dubuffet Art Brut is made
by all kinds of persons regardless of their psychiatric case histories or
complete lack thereof.
     In the early Thirties, the Surrealists had organized a few small shows
which also included works of the mentally ill, but these were not displayed
as being on  an equal footing.  The Surrealists' works took center stage,
with the works of the asylum dwellers being used as examples of a sort of
"scientific" "control specimen" "measure" by which to gauge  the "gains"
made by a Surrealist practice in all the arts.

        The Nazis, however, were aware at some level of the ideas of
Morgenthaler and Prinzhorn--that the works of the mentally ill were actuall=
y
art--and this was proven because of the effects they had had on some
contemporary artists, as well as that the work of many artists of the times
seemed from their point of view to have much in common with the productions
of the insane.

 Either way, these formulations added up to the equation Modern
Art=3DInsanity.  Therefore--obviously a form of "Degenerate Art," which, li=
ke
"Degenerate Persons," should be put on public display as examples of what
the Nazis wanted to purge their "Pure" world of.  By treating Modern Art as
equal with that of the Insane--the public would see "loud and clear" what i=
t
was that was "degenerate" about both "Modern Art" and insanity, and be glad
to see them wiped out of sight and mind and existence in the Purity the of
Reich.

       The "degenerate" Frenchman Breton saw the work of the insane as
proto-examples of what the Surrealists aspired to, while the Nazis saw  bot=
h
the art promoted by Breton and the art of  insane persons as being equally
"degenerate" and thus"sick" in the psychiatric sense.  In the Eugenics sens=
e
so important to the Nazis, this meant both kinds of artist, the Modern and
the Insane--needed to be expunged---from not only the galleries and
museums--but from existence.

        The myth of the aftermath of the touring show of Degenerate Art is
that the Nazis had it all destroyed.  In actuality, since it was wel known
by then that the works of Kandinsky, Klee, Beckmann, Nolde et alia were
worth something in the Degenerate Art World beyond the Reich's borders--man=
y
works were quietly stashed away and used when needed to raise some cash via
being shipped to auctions and collectors abroad.

         Even now there is a lot of ambiguity surrounding what is or is not
an "outsider" artist, and for many still, there is at once the attraction
and the repulsion of associations with mental illness, and the works of the
mentally ill remain at once "art" and "not real art," making "Outsider Art"
a denizon still of a Limbo Land, shuttled about depending on the ideas and
tastes of curators as unsettlingly at once "a part of" Art and "apart from
it."

          The person with the widest and most open approach has been
Dubuffet, who did not draw a line between "Art" and the "Art of the Insane"
in presenting Art Brut   His primary criteria were that the Art Brut is the
creation of persons who are untaught in the arts and are creating for
reasons outside the spheres of the "art world," which  often is unknown to
them, or simply not considered as a professional endeavor.  The "outside" o=
f
Art Brut is in its relationship with energies and forms which are present i=
n
what is standardly thought of as "Art," yet which has no part in any of the
standard conceptions of what "Art" "is" when made using these energies and
forms.

 The attraction of the artist Dubuffet is to that "outside" which Kandinsky
began to find in the art of children--creative activity which is alive
"before" there is the concept of "art" imposed on it.
    Paradoxically, to "recognize" Art Brut as just that--Raw Art--it
requires the eye of an  "artist" who comes at least a bit from "Inside" and
is longing to find a way Out of what Dubuffet called an "Asphixiating
Culture."

     Can Art Brut then be made by "artists" who long to "de-generate" into =
a
"Raw State" with regards to "art?"

       One example of such an attempt was made by the poet Paul Eluard, who
like many of the Surrealists had become very passionate about an embrace of
madness. Desiring to reach "madness" itself,   Eluard produced an article,
which he accompanied with the drawings and writings of an "insane person"
whose identity, following common practice,  was concealed. The article's
appearance was widely praised and caused a small sensation.  Unknown to the
approving critics and public, the "poems" were actually made by various
Surrealists and most of the drawings--10 out of 13--were made by Robert
Desnos.

         The success of the  article with critics and public proved to the
artists that their mission had actually failed.  If works by non-mentally
ill persons could be hailed as being "surprisingly good works"  by a mental
patient, it meant they had not created "real" "art of the insane," but an
art perfectly acceptable to persons who were judging the works in terms of
the standards of "art." In others words, they had not created Art Brut at
all, but simply works of "art" easily embraced as such, and inspiring none
of the uneasy skepticisms regarding works of "mental patients," or, for
Dubuffet, the non-mad Art Brut artist.

    Art Brut presents a conumdrum not unlike the art of children does in
some ways. In order for both to be recognized as "art," there has to be the
Concept of Art on the part of the viewer.  This Concept the creators
themselves for the most part are oblivious of. This situation introduces
some very interesting questions for the relationship of the artist/viewer
(and this includes also poets and workers in other media)  with what it is
that is seen and not only seen, but "recognized" or not, which in turn
raises the question of Naming, labeling, cataloging etc.

 Does one see or hear only what is named in order to call it a poem or art?
Is one seeing and/or hearing "artlessly" --or simply identifying things
which are named and so is convinced indeed that they are "present" as poems
or art?

Duchamp with his Ready Mades introduces the Concept that if one is "an
Artist,"--or, for Emerson, a Poet in his essay of that "name"----one may
look at anything and "call it Art." Like Emerson's Poet, Duchamp's Artist i=
s
"the Namer." The Artist, the Poet, confer an "artistic/poetic" value on
things, and so things not previously seen as having an "Art" or "Poetic"
value now do. This means that anything can be called Art or a Poem , be
named so, by an Artist or Poet, and so an Anything can become a Something,
and that Something then become "an object of significance, of value"
aesthetically and in turn economically.

This is the genesis of Warhol's Concept of the "fifteen minutes of Fame:" i=
f
Anything becomes Something, then Anything can for an allotted time be
allowed to be the Number One Something as an Object of Fame--that
is--contemplation, adulation, significance, value.

Anything being considered in this formulation to be the same as Anyone.

Anything and Everything can become valuable, as on Antiques Roadshow, simpl=
y
by being given a Name. " My God!!--this poem written on a napkin from the
first McDonalds to open in the city of New York--could it be--could it
really be--one of the lost Lunch Poems of Frank O'Hara's??!!"

A very different Concept is also written of by Emerson.  In "Nature," (whic=
h
preceded "the Poet"chronologically),  the Poet is the one who sees a
"property in the landscape" which is a property that belongs to no one,
though the  "properties" being seen may belong to X or A and so have "a
name."

In "Earthworks:  A Sedimentation of the Mind," Robert Smithson proposes tha=
t
the glance of a "great artist" in "the art of looking," can create a work o=
f
art as great as anything that is given a name and produced as an "art
object." Smithson, too, is using "an art of looking" to find a way Out of
the "art world" and its namings. For Smithson, to create by a glance is to
create something as real as any "art object," yet by not being an object, i=
t
remains free of being taken possession of, of becoming a property which can
bought and sold. This is much like Emerson's "property in the landscape,"
which the Poet sees, yet which belongs to no one.

For Smithson, not producing an object which is named and has a value set on
it, means that the "time of the artist" is not enslaved by  the production
of art objects and the naming by art dealers and critics which "sells" them=
.
The artist is able to work "Outside" the "art systems" and languages of
art.

This is the paradox of Art Brut--on the one hand it exists, it creates,
like Smithson's great artist's glance, Outside of the systems of "art
objects," outside of "art" namings, and outside the systems of "art values,=
"
and on the other by being "recognized" as an Art Brut--Art in a Raw state,
similar to children's art--it begins to be part of the systems of art
objects, art namings and languages.

Dubuffet struggled for years with this problem--on the one hand his "great
artist's glance" saw Art Brut--yet by saying that he saw it and naming it,
presenting it, writing about it, using it as an examplar for his own work,
he had also placed it at the edges of areas in which it was possible for Ar=
t
Brut to no longer be "Art Brut" as such, "in the wild," but perhaps had
brought it dangerously near the boundary lines where its existence  might
become someday that of  "an endangered species."
     It is often remarked of children's art, including one's own children's
art--that it is so incredible, so free--and then at a certain point,
socialization takes over--and the art like a butterfly--vanishes--even in
the work of many artists and poets who go on past childhood--
and actually become artists and poets--the childlike and the Art Brut are
long gone.

Yet children are continually being born, and Art Brut creators are also, so
while it may not survive in an individual, or even in an Art Brut artist's
relationship with the systems of art, it nonetheless continues--

And it also is continued in Smithson's "great artist's glance"--

which has still elements of childhood and the Outside alive in it, as
Baudelaire writes:


   In The Painter of Modern Life, Baudelaire writes:

But genius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will . . .
consider
      . . . (the artist) . . . as a man-child, as a man who is never for a
moment without     the genius of childhood=97a genius for which no aspect o=
f
life has become stale.

These are just a very  few ways of thinking about the Insider/Outsider--

Apologies for cross-posting.

I wanted to alert you to a public furore that has been exercising the
Australian media for the past week, after an exhibition by Australian
photographer Bill Henson was raided by police, and the gallery, the artist
and others threatened with prosecution for child pornography and obscenity.
Bill Henson was widely accused of being a paedophile. The police raids and
confiscations were followed by others, including on the National Gallery of
Australia. How over the top these accusations are is underlined by the "G"
or "very mild" censorship ratings given out today after police referred the
images to the Classification Board. The police have referred their case to
the Director of Public Prosecutions, and a decision on whether to prosecute
will be made in the next few weeks.

I've had emails from curators, academics and others outside Australia
expressing their concerns about the implications not only for artistic
freedoms but free speech, and it occurs to me that some of you might be
interested in the issue.

With a number of prominent Australian artists, I released an Open Letter
last week at the height of the talkback hysteria which defended Henson's
work (and refers to a couple of other recent exhibition closures, one of
which was of photographs about Palestine after a visit from anti-terrorism
police). The letter was widely reported (and misreported). After many
requests, the Open Letter is on the internet for others to put their name to
if they desire, at http://billhensonletterofsupport.blogspot.com/

Barry,

Very sharp observation. If conceptual art means a movement away from the
traditional material of art, oil, stone, etc., toward words, conceptual
poetry means a movement away from the traditional material of poetry, which
is words.

Ciao,

Murat

i'd only have one of these open at a time (for the sake of your computer's
speed). give your browser all the screenspace you know how to give it for
these. most of the images are 1280x1024.

the first pass through an image sequence is as fast as your internet
connection bandwidth will allow. subsequent passes through the fully-loaded
image sequence are quicker. it's like viewing an animated gif while it loads
one frame at a time and then once it's fully loaded it speeds up. each frame
needs to be interesting in its own right and the difference between
consecutive frames is greater than in 'normal cinema'.

you can adjust

1. the delay between images. each of the above has its own custom preset
delay that i felt showed the sequence best. though it's probably different
on different machines.

2. you can pause it/unpause (the "On/Off" button)

3. the checkbox (by default it's checked) determines whether the sequence
will loop or exit at end to the thumbnails page for that sequence.

the ^ button takes you up a level in the project's tree structure.

the < and > buttons let you browse through the project at the current
project level.

i'm working on a new feature in dbCinema where one may do screen recording
into a sequence of bitmaps. The bitmaps could then be played by
slideshow.htm or imported into premiere/final cut and so on.

What is a failed poet?=20

can be found on Boston Area Small Press and Poetry Scene=20=20
http://dougholder.blogspot.com



I posed this question to poets of my acquaintance: "What is a failed poet=
?" I=20
hear the term used all the time, but what does it mean? How do you define=
 a=20
failed poet? Is there such a thing? Below are some very thought provoking=
=20
answers to this question I posed:



A failed poet can be a mainstream adherent who buckled to society's press=
ure=20
against artistic commitment and stopped producing work in order to "act l=
ike a=20
grownup" or "get a real job." Worse than this type of poet, however, is t=
he=20
practicing, productive poet who never reaches his or her full potential o=
ut of=20
fear of offending readers or popular poetic figures and theorists.=20

An artist who holds back, obeying current rules or trends whether or not =
they=20
challenge or showcase individualized craft, generally frustrates readers =
as well=20
as himself by writing safe for decades. An artist who lacks personal inte=
grity is=20
the worst poetic failure of all.=20

--Mignon King (co-editor of Bagel Bards 3 Anthology)



Just off the top of my head, a failed poet is one who doesn't write.

--Tam Lin Neville ( editor =93Off the Grid Press=94)


Even Faulkner, you know, described himself as a failed poet. Raymond=20
Chandler, failed poet, found his talent late in life...writing crime nove=
ls. I was=20
not familiar with the term. Sounds like a good subject for a funny poem.

--Ed Meek ( author of =93Walk Out=94 )



Thanks for the prompt. A quick search turned up Wordsworth, Faulkner,=20
Raymond Chandler, J Alfred Prufrock (Eliot by extension?), and Alexander=20=

Wilson, father of American ornithology all as "failed poets."
There is something a little precious about the idea of calling oneself a =
failed=20
poet (Oh, I couldn't possibly...), and most of the above (admittedly=20
abbreviated) list used failure as a catalyst for something else. What is =
a=20
successful poet?

--Valerie Lawson ( coeditor of =93Third Coast=94 magazine)


To answer your question, first let us ask what is a failed human being. I=
f the=20
question promotes strict answers then we will have strict answers to the=20=

question =93What is a failed poet=94.=20

But then let us particularize the query to other categories as well and a=
sk the=20
question:


What is a failed flower?
What is a failed kitten?
What is a failed cow?
What is a failed elephant ?
What is a failed worm?

And then ask:
What is a failed baby?

And then ask again:
What is a failed planet?
Or what is a failed solar system?
Or what is a failed galaxy?

I have a preferred answer. It is that if anyone of those things had cause=
 to=20
exist and have fulfilled their existence in any way, according to any pla=
ce on a=20
range of some Platonic ideal that listed things from low to high, good to=
 bad,=20
quick to slow, sweet to sour, heavy to light and so forth, then they woul=
d=20
have to be called successful. That is: they would be successful if they=20=

performed their state of existence along any particular position in the e=
ntire=20
range of their performance.

I often quietly reflect on of Grey=92s Elegy In A Country Churchyard. We =
are all=20
are unknown and our Fulfillment is unknown. We all deserve quiet=20
contemplation and fond consideration. It seems harsh to speak of a =93fai=
led=20
poet=94. Might it be more a reflection on us who ask the question then on=
 the=20
thing the question is being asked of?

I tell my workshop students that there is no such thing as a bad poem, as=
=20
long as the poet is happy with it. It's all about what purpose the poem s=
erves=20
for the poet. I've learned from students that there are multifold reasons=
 to=20
write poetry: Some are closet poets who write strictly for themselves; so=
me=20
like to journal with poetry; others want to write social/political commen=
taries=20
in verse; one student wanted only to write poems for his girlfriend; anot=
her=20
wanted to write poetry in order to become a better, more concise newspape=
r=20
reporter. The list could go on. So who outside of poets themselves, is qu=
alified=20
to determine how well a poem executes the purpose for which it was writte=
n.=20

If one wishes to write for publication, there are of course standards, bu=
t=20
these vary drastically, depending on editors' likes and dislikes. Poets=20=

sometimes feel "failed" if they keep getting rejections from editors with=
 a=20
different definition of merit than they have. That doesn't mean there are=
n't=20
editors elsewhere who would like and publish the same poems.

And getting published doesn't always mean the poet is satisfied that her/=
his=20
work is good either. William Faulkner said, "I'm a failed poet. Maybe eve=
ry=20
novelist wants to write poetry first, finds he can't and then tries the s=
hort=20
story, which is the next most demanding form after poetry. And failing at=
 that,=20
only then does he take up novel writing." Yet both Faulkner's first natio=
nally=20
published works, the poem =93L=92Apres-Midi d=92un faune," and his first =
published=20
book, The Marble Faun, were poetry. Was his poetry good? At least his=20
publishers thought so. But it was Faulkner's own expectations that compel=
led=20
him to consider himself a failed poet.

It's easy for those of us involved in the publishing part of poetry to de=

stringent definitions of excellence. And where has this gotten poetry, wh=

it?

When I announced to my mom that I wanted to be a writer she wearily told=20=

daughter) and I had a long debate about it. Our conclusion is that a fail=

lasting results. We all know poets who thrive on being =93poets=94 withou=

There is no such thing as a failed poet. What gives someone the right to =

maybe a failed poet is one who doesn't attempt to capture what s/he feels=

Eytan Fichman ( professor Boston Architectural Center--Boston, Mass.)


Maybe a more sensible question is what is the definition of a poet? What =
is=20
poetry? And who has the qualifications to make these definitions or=20
determinations? What makes a succesful poet? Sales? Media attention? The=20=

number of publications you are published in? Pimping yourself? I dare say=
 there=20
are not that many poets around who have read the work of Gene Ruggles,=20=

considered by many to be an important poet, but who had only one book=20
published (Lifeguard In the Snow, University of Pittsburg Press). Does th=
at=20
make him a failed poet? I think not!!! And the idea that everyone is a po=
et is=20
absurd, just as absurd that if you write a poem and you are happy with it=
,=20
that this somehow makes you a poet.

I think the suffering of those people in Burma and China are far more imp=
ortant=20
than an exercise on what is a failed poet.

a.d. winans ( founder of Second Coming Press-)


I think the worst version of a failed poet is one who has never tapped in=
to his=20
or her deepest private self and it inside-out for the public. Like diggin=
g deep=20
past the skin, the tissue and the muscle for the humming tuning fork in t=
he=20
marrow and letting it resonate on the page for the whole world to see....=
if this=20
is not accomplished then the poet has failed and his poems are soulless a=
nd=20
the equivalent to crossword puzzles.

--rob plath (author of poetry collection "Ashtrays and Bulls")



I've been giving more thought to failure. It seems to me that failure is =
an=20
inability to achieve what one has set to accomplish. And the concept that=
 if=20
one is satisfied with one's own work and chooses not to publish, they too=
=20
might be a success. I have a friend or two who's shrink told them to writ=
e=20
poetry and/or memoir as a method of dealing with their issues. If it help=
ed and=20
they never sent them out, are they success or failures? Then there is the=
=20
poet who sends poetry to magazine "a" and is rejected, but magazine "b"=20=

accepts. What does that mean for the poet? Your question is an interestin=
g=20
rhetorical exercise with no right and no wrong, no answer to success or f=
ailure.

this is fascinating.  i wd describe myself that way but i'm trying to
re-understand failure, esp the concept of the "failed career" by
contemplating, among other things, the career trajectory of iggy pop.
for a while i used the term "poète manqué," because it had a sonic
resonance with "poet-monkey," adding a light touch.  i think "failed
poet" is a term used for people who may have had aspirations to be a
poet in the most conventional sense but ended up channeling their poetic
energies in less obviously generic ways; novels, scholarship, everyday
life, child-rearing, etc.

isn't it possible that he was making a joke out of what everyone used to

Yes, of course, the other side of equal footing: instead of saying both are
equally good, say both are equally bad-- calling people dogs rather than
calling dogs people would be an analogue.
One could certainly go back earlier than the beginning of the 20th Century
to find artists taking inspiration in 'outside' 'art' perhaps not recognized
as such. We can think of Byron's interest in Oriental architecture, costume,
etc., and he is merely the most obvious example from his time. The Muse,
too, could be viewed as a figure for the outside from which some artists
wish to draw inspiration.

As for Breton's approach, there's something quite troubling to me about
placing authenticity in clinical mental illness. Does it not give the power
of identity to the ultimate insider, the psychiatrist who already holds so
very much power?

(Forgive me if some of this is unclear; we've been suffering a wave of
electrical storms, and while the lights are gorgeous, the pressure changes
are playing havoc with my head.)

BETWEEN CUP AND LIP

Miami University Press is pleased to announce the publication of Peter
Manson's Between Cup and Lip.

Between Cup and Lip, Peter Manson's first American book publication,
contains 18 years of previously uncollected work. The book forms the
missing link between two collections published in Britain, For the
Good of Liars (Barque, 2006) and Adjunct: An Undigest (Edinburgh
Review, 2005), demonstrating the continuum between the
prosodically=96dense, endlessly considered poetry of the former and the
procedural work of the latter. Manson has taught at Cambridge
University and other institutions. He lives in Glasgow, where he edits
the small press Object Permanence.

"'Ah more eh=85oh oh'. In the light of Faraday's candle Coleridge
channels Loewenhoek and Whalen (I was thinking) as Peter Manson shakes
the frayed carpet of culture and, as a fearless Duprat caddis fly
larva, makes jewels from the motes. Even the bits of themselves the
poems create make interesting shadows. 'Groups of words which didn't
describe the image but which were it'. Yes. Wit, intelligence, a
dispassionate view of self: plus images that are not words. Nothing to
want for in this excellent book that moved my chitin heart."
=97Tom Raworth

"Peter Manson is the language veterinarian, elbow-deep in the

Dear Murat and Barry:

"does that makes "conceptual poetry" poetry that likewise foregrounds
language? But in that case, what distinguishes "conceptual poetry" from jus=
t
"poetry"?

re conceptual poetry being  not in words--

 This is exactly what the very second paragraph of my piece asks--

" One may also ask=97since language is the material of poetry, if
one is to create a conceptual poetry=97does this mean then that the
absence of language is involved?  That the poetry is not in language,
but found elsewhere?"

This is why I write of how often i think of al the persons through thousand
snd thousands of years who cerated poems without words, paintings without
paint--art with out materials at all--
because they were not allowed to--even learn how to read and write, or to
paint--
nor exposed to any of the ideas re painting, poetry--
and yet nonetheless i believe there must have been tousands of greate
artists and poets who created works continaully--
and as i write--these have vanished "without a trace"--
nor fragments--as never were "objects" or "signs"--
because they did not exist as objects, texts--

yet--
one may ask also, as i do--
may not these works--becasue they have been thought imagined,seen,
heard--formed--
exist--
not as traces or objects-recognized as "poems" and "Images"--

but elsewhere--
all around one--
in stones' forms or clouds' shapes-in a sound out of nowhere that one
hears--

things which in their taphonomic states carry the disintegrating orders of
those which had elsewhere in another time been the concepts found by those
poets and artists who did not write not paint--

"the shock of recogntion"--the uncanny encounter--with these--which
"recognize one" and find one--

"involuntary memories" "out of nowhere"--which are triggered by the movemen=
t
of a car out of the corner of one's eye suddenly shooting out of an alley
way, from out of the shadowy dark blotch at the margins of the eye's
peripheries-- into the bright sharpness of light-and gone--

yet--"whose" involutary memories--?--

i didn't set out to write a paper at all, just to ask a few questions--and
had to cut it short--as what one begins to think on re conceptual poetry is
a swarming --of a myriad ideas and things, sights, sounds, movements of
dance, gesture of a hand, flicker of lighter in the wind--smoke that drifts
into cobwebs filled with corners, the drifting of dust motes--

i've lived in situations where one could not do all manner of things--so on=
e
begins to create poems plays stories paintings al manner of things--

which are "conceptual"--and as just described--to create when/with/in
watching the drifts of dust motes which one sees due to their being reveale=
d
in the shadowy room only by the spaces in between the cheap "venetian" styl=
e
blinds, the cracked and faded plastic --
these motes which as one is watching bring out of the chaos and non meaning
"time" one is living "in"--confined in--

that which is--
to be present at the conception of a conception--
emerging "before/be for one's very eyes-"


the paper is thought of as hopefully suggestions along the lines of various
ways of thinking of what a conceptual poetry might be--and this is but a fe=
w
of the suggestions that have come to mind--

as what one has the sense of--and persons on Harriet Blog have written of
this--is that the Symposium rather than being an "opening of the field"--wa=
s
enacting in effect the placement already of monuments--while at the same
time  introducing a set of rules and regulations in a sense, for the design
and production of "Conceptual Poetry"--as though it is something "already
over with" while at the same time "being proclaimed as New"--

this is why the word "Questions" is in my title--to indicate that this is
simply an opening of questions--
rather than an "unquestioning"--"acceptance"--of  "what one is told"--
nor do the questions by any means constitute or ask for their own
"unquestioning acceptance"--

Conceptual Poetry has been performed, theorized, created, published, video
taped, photographed, recorded, for forty years in Latin America--and in
Russia already there are several decades of Conceptual Poetries--

this is why one thinks that "Conceptual Poetry" is something that is alread=
y
existing in a myriad forms and wants to ask further questions, rather than
"going by one definition" or a small set of examples--

for example--the conceptual "conceptions"--are not soley "ideas from within
the mind"so to speak--on the contrary--the ideas which are those of things,
events--OUTSIDE of one--bring these--

* *{"conceptual conceptions"--"conception" is another area one may address
"along these lines"-not to mention "contraceptual poetry, biceptual poetry,
perceptual poetry, -extra sensory perceptual poetry--deceptual poetry----}
**one may ask--if from Outside--the conceptual poetry by not having come
from words--may not be manifested into words--as its way at that moment of
making itself "known"--it is not myself alone that finds the found--the
found finds me--is what i write of being my experinces when working--on the
rubBEings, clay impression spray paintings--

so in what they may choose to "appear"--may be as "someone else"--that is,
what was not words now "appears" "in the guise of" words--

which may then be quickly enough "no longer words'--but something or some
one else--after effects, impersonators, ghosts--actors in "the Globe
theater" of Shakespeare's in which "all the world's a stage"--and a
Conceptual Poetry is a "play house"--wherein the Conceptual poetry is
"playing house"--

in terms of Emily Dickinson's "Nature is a Haunted House, and Art a House
which tries to be Haunted"--

to be Haunted by that which provokes the essay  ("tries:"-- essay as an
essay, and as "essaying" in the sense of trying--)  at being Haunted--

in the excerpts from one of the El Colonel stories presented as Appendix
A--, "El Ojo de Dios"--El Colonel --does not write down these writings of
his--many events occuring in the stories it is not really sure--at what
level of reality/fiction they are "happening"--as by the way he
"writes"--itis in such a way as to create moment by moment not
singularities--but the simultaneity of many aspects of time al of them at
once writing/reading/making notes that are beforehand and afterwards and
endlessly finding the inextricable ongoing energies and movements of these
moving away from, around, back, inside out-etc--with each other--

(in another story, El Colonel opens his one of his "notebooks" to study wha=
t
he is working with --to take a-look --there is nothing written on the cover
nor anywhere inside--this to him is a private joke on his unwritten writing=
s
--not only "unpublished"--but unwritten--yet at the same time as he is
reading over his unwritten texts he is writing his further commentaries in
the writing which is not written "down"--)

the writing also "takes place"--as a performance piece--

With studied and precise, angular movements, El Colonel begins to arrange
himself in the correct position in which to be found by his "immanent and
eminent visitor."


El Colonel permits himself a barely audible and very brief laugh as "he
takes possession of himself the better to assiduously arrange the head, the
torso, the limbs, the folded hands, as though he were in the process of
preparing a stuffed and mounted specimen of a representative example of a
Colonel, whose taxidermist he himself was."


El Colonel's "writing" which is not only "unpublished" but unwritten is
described in this story as:

Habituated to an imaginative isolation, El Colonel's intellectual companion=
s
are his "compositions" with their attendant "commentaries," "asides,"
"digressions," and "annotations." By means of this "ironic distancing" he
continually invents "a hitherto unknown and as yet unpublished form of
writing, never before seen nor heard."

("Never before seen nor heard" is an alllusion to one of El Colonel's
favorite lines from one of his favorite books--Lazarillo de Tormes, whose
author literally is "Anonymous"-

*Yo, por bien tengo que cosas fan seneladas, y por nunca oidas ni vistas,
vengan a noticia de muchos y no se entetierren en la sepultura del olvido.*

--*Lazarillo de Tormes*
is the line, cited in the story "El Colonel Smiles" on line at Otoliths and
Dusie Kollektiv--

-El Colonel's odd readings are due to their being found--in places, homes,
offices--whose occupants on his missions he "takes possesion of"--in some
cases--"in other words"--his reading is not planned out--but found--and,
literally --in some cases--stolen--"plagiarized texts"--already, before he
uses them in his unwritten writings--)

the description continues--

El Colonel smiles. This writing is a method of creating for himself a reade=
r
who is in turn accompanied by his own doubling as a writer. Where there had
been "no one with who to share his most intimate thoughts, the fullness and
agility of his life," there is now not only such a companion; there is also
a recorder of "his deeds and exploits." In such a way El Colonel
simultaneously acts, writes and reads both for himself and to another, who
is also both a reader and an other author in turn, providing El Colonel wit=
h
his own role as a reader. By these means his life takes on an aura of
legend, and he acts both as though creating the performance of something
which is happening, and of something which has happened "already." By the
latter means, his life is taking place in a futurity in which it is read,
and in a present in which it is written. The simplest acts and words are
invested with the immediacy of a drama "taking place," the glow of "great
acts having taken place ," and, to heighten both drama and aura, the
precisions of a prefatory "about to take place," which allows for the
insertion of the necessary commentaries, directions, and asides. "For the
benefit of the listener, for the pleasure of the reader, for the background
material necessary to the writer," as El Colonel describes it with relish i=
n
a self-penned blurb . . .

I hope the paper suggests a great many further conceptions of Conceptual
Poetry!!--

Hello all
See below for details of an upcoming symposium on Susan Howe's work.
Apologies for x-posting.

> SUSAN HOWE: A CELEBRATION
>
> Birkbeck, University of London
> Saturday 21st June, 9.25am-6.30pm
>
> Susan Howe is a unique figure in twentieth-century poetry.  Her
> work came to prominence in the early 1990s in association with the
> American Language poets, but quickly set its own agenda outside
> these parameters.  From her first career as an artist, Howe brought
> an intense sensitivity to the visual dimensions of the text,
> producing a diverse body of work that has continually probed the
> borders between poetry and other disciplines and media.  In its
> unorthodox readings of the American canon, its obsessive interest
> in history and what the official narratives of history exclude,
> and, more recently, in her collaborations with the experimental
> musician, David Grubbs, Howe's work is unrelenting in its capacity
> to surprise and stimulate us.
>
> In this one-day symposium, we aim to recognize the impact Susan
> Howe's writing has had on contemporary poetics, and to provide a
> focus for new critical approaches to her poetry.
>
> The conference begins with the keynote lecture by Elizabeth Willis

To register by credit card,  call the Columbia Ticket Office at the
number above, or register online at:

A limited number of hotel rooms are available at the Homewood Suites
by Hilton Chicago-Downtown, 40 East Grand Avenue, Chicago.  This hotel
is a very short cab or subway ride from the Columbia campus.  The
Homewood Suites prepared a special link for us to book online.  Just
click below and you'll find directions for reserving a room:

It's important that you book your room as soon as possible, as the
Chicago Marathon is taking place October 12.  (We only discovered this
convergence recently, after we'd already booked the featured
readers.)

A Visitor's Guide for the Beat Symposium is pasted below, with a list
of nearby hotels.  Columbia College Chicago is located downtown, in
the heart of the city's South Loop neighborhood, and is easily
accessible from these hotels by foot or cab.  All major subway/El
trains come into the South Loop, too, so it's possible to book hotels
in other parts of the city and make it to the Symposium without
difficulty.

Mention that you're a Columbia College Chicago visitor to receive
discounted rates at some of these hotels.  It's crucial to book as
soon as possible because of the marathon.

For more information, contact Tony Trigilio at ttrigilio@colum.edu
(312-344-8138).


VISITOR'S GUIDE:  THE BEAT GENERATION SYMPOSIUM

Airports:
O'Hare Airport (western suburbs) and Midway Airport (southern suburbs)
are the two airports servicing the Chicgao area.  They are
approximately equidistant from Columbia College.

Transportation:
 >From Midway Airport, take the Orange Line elevated train to Adams
Street. From there, walk south on Wabash until you reach Congress
Parkway. From O'Hare Airport, take the Blue Line to La Salle. Walk
East on Congress (away from the Chicago Stock Exchange Building, which
you'll see upon emerging from the subway) until you reach Wabash
(about 5 short blocks).

Use www.transitchicago.com's<http://www.transitchicago.com's/> free
Trip Planner service to plan the rest of your trips while you're here.
 Simply enter your starting point and destination, and Trip Planner
gives you detailed directions. As of 2008, fares are $2.00 one-way
with a $0.25 transfer. Each train station has kiosks where you can buy
transit cards and reload them (cash only). The Blue Line and Red Line
run 24/7; the other lines stop running for a few hours late at night.

Taxis are available throughout the city. From Midway Airport to the
English Department, cab fare would be approximately $25 and from
O'Hare Airport cab fare would be approximately $50. If you need to
call a cab, call (773) or (312) TAXICAB.

Metra Trains service suburban areas.  Visit

siddhi pose-performance by Nikuko


This is preparation for object attachment. Fashion: Silhouette for posing
in combination with minimal blue pattern for orientation.

Object attachment buries avatar bodies. Spatially, the body is lossy;
dynamically, behavior remains to conjure the semblance of purposeful
action. Here, Nikuko orients herself, poses periodically.

The pose is drawn out of the dynamics; the spectator, in the pose, pro-
ceeds as if the narrative moment continued literally for all intents and
purposes. The pose is the ridge or hinge of movement, the pause designat-
ing the other, the viewer, designated by the viewer - part of a system of
distribution. The pause ensures the viewer that the body is not the locus
or victim of seizure. Every pause is a pose, every pose a pause, both
intertwined with intentionality.

The pose is given as a gift, is for the other, is oriented; the orienta-
tion of the pose defines the stance of the other in inverse relationship
to occidental landscape perspective in which the vanishing-point might be
considered the locus of the viewer as well. But the pose draws in, puck-
ers, the vanishing-point, which becomes a plane and punctum of intimacy.

Nikuko poses, there is no one in sight, but there is the camera, here
literally one of obscura, that obscure little object A of desire for and
by Nikuko, above all for Nikuko.

One of us moved the other, one of us aroused the other to action, to the
recording-booth, to the wide-screen, to the embrace of the other who is
identical, not equivalent, to the self-selving occurring, not to mention
the dynamics of the same.

Ah, I reply, I can finally see her face.

OH GEORGE, but I thought you were BORED!  HEHEHE!  SO BORED you had to come
back for seconds!  There's no one I LOVE to see swoon under the expanse of
his own song as YOU, BIG BOY Bowering!

But for those still interested:

This reminds me a bit of the first time I met Jonathan Williams, and I had
been corresponding with another elder poet at that time, someone I was
arguing with quite a bit through the mail.  Jonathan liked that I was
arguing with this other elder poet, and not JUST accepting his word as
Gospel, which clearly he was very much used to having his word taken as
Gospel, this poet.  In fact Jonathan said to me after hearing me unload my
anger, "OH Yes, he's one of those poets who wants you to write just like
him, only not as well!"  We laughed hard and long at the truth in that one!

The thing is, Bob Perelman spends a LOT of time with young poets in creative
writing programs, etc., and if I were one of those kids I would ask him:

)What did you mean by that joke exactly?  I mean, HOW are we all writing
alike, if in fact you meant it?
)If you DIDN'T mean it and it WAS a joke, then how was it a joke?  Is this
what OTHERS are saying?  And if so HOW do they say we all write alike, if in
fact they mean it?

NOW DON'T THINK I'M SHITTING ON CREATIVE WRITING PROGRAMS, because it turns
out I have a lot of friends who are either IN THEM currently, or have been
through them, BUT, my hope is that there's room for disagreement, room for
challenging whatever needs challenging in these programs, if need be.

Oh, and from the looks of a few of the back channeled emails I've received
about this topic WOW, there are some poets who have been angry at Bob for a
LONG time, and have been waiting to unload it!  I for one don't hate Bob, so
please send your angry e-mails to him directly, GEESH!  But on the other
hand, GLAD I WAS ABLE TO HELP YOU GET THAT SHIT OFF YOUR SHOULDERS!  Life's
much shorter than can possibly be realized as it turns out!  So, in other
words, DON'T HOLD ONTO THIS SHIT!

Alan,

The pause is where the action stops, and meditation begins. But the
meditation occurs in the viewer, the pausing becoming a pose (photographic
gesture) from the other (a la camera obscura) relaying intentionality, a
moment of intimacy between the seer/reader and the other.

Look at these photographs, particularly the section called "brothel":

Perelman wasn't joking. He was accidentally honest. All young writers do sound alike, and it's because few if any of them know anything about writing poems. They have been told that rules are passe or elitist, and so everyone ends up writing the same stuff the same way. The fact is that if you write using some sort of form, you will develop a style and a voice all your own. Form forces you to do this, just as it also forces you to make choices you would not have originally made. It can result in poems that you realize are actually better than anything you could have otherwise written. I've seen it happen, not just with my own poetry, but with the poetry of others. Perelman said it was a joke because he heard all the gasps -- but he wasn't joking. More, he was right.

Now, before everyone here attacks me, let me suggest the following experiment. Take one of your free verse poems and turn it into a sonnet. Or Sapphic verse. Or blank verse. Or some other form with a steady rhythm and rhyme scheme. Or, better, take the same poem and put it into several forms. See what happens. See if it doesn't make it into a better poem. Or a more interesting one. See if it doesn't force you to make better, more interesting choices than you had before.

All I ask for is that your responses be educated by experience.

Troy Camplin

to arrange=0Ahimself in the correct position in which to be found by his "i=

 audible and very brief laugh as "he=0Atakes possession of himself the bett=

ecimen of a representative example of a=0AColonel, whose taxidermist he him=
self was."=0A=0A=0AEl Colonel's "writing" which is not only "unpublished" b=
ut unwritten is=0Adescribed in this story as:=0A=0AHabituated to an imagina=
tive isolation, El Colonel's intellectual companions=0Aare his "composition=
s" with their attendant "commentaries," "asides,"=0A"digressions," and "ann=
otations." By means of this "ironic distancing" he=0Acontinually invents "a=
 hitherto unknown and as yet unpublished form of=0Awriting, never before se=
en nor heard."=0A=0A("Never before seen nor heard" is an alllusion to one o=
f El Colonel's=0Afavorite lines from one of his favorite books--Lazarillo d=
e Tormes, whose=0Aauthor literally is "Anonymous"-=0A=0A*Yo, por bien tengo=

to their being found--in places, homes,=0Aoffices--whose occupants on his m=

n--"plagiarized texts"--already, before he=0Auses them in his unwritten wri=
tings--)=0A=0Athe description continues--=0A=0AEl Colonel smiles. This writ=
ing is a method of creating for himself a reader=0Awho is in turn accompani=
ed by his own doubling as a writer. Where there had=0Abeen "no one with who=
 to share his most intimate thoughts, the fullness and=0Aagility of his lif=
e," there is now not only such a companion; there is also=0Aa recorder of "=
his deeds and exploits." In such a way El Colonel=0Asimultaneously acts, wr=
ites and reads both for himself and to another, who=0Ais also both a reader=
 and an other author in turn, providing El Colonel with=0Ahis own role as a=
 reader. By these means his life takes on an aura of=0Alegend, and he acts =
both as though creating the performance of something=0Awhich is happening, =
and of something which has happened "already." By the=0Alatter means, his l=
ife is taking place in a futurity in which it is read,=0Aand in a present i=
n which it is written. The simplest acts and words are=0Ainvested with the =
immediacy of a drama "taking place," the glow of "great=0Aacts having taken=
 place ," and, to heighten both drama and aura, the=0Aprecisions of a prefa=
tory "about to take place," which allows for the=0Ainsertion of the necessa=
ry commentaries, directions, and asides. "For the=0Abenefit of the listener=

BETWEEN CUP AND LIP

Miami University Press is pleased to announce the publication of Peter
Manson's Between Cup and Lip.

Between Cup and Lip, Peter Manson's first American book publication,
contains 18 years of previously uncollected work. The book forms the
missing link between two collections published in Britain, For the
Good of Liars (Barque, 2006) and Adjunct: An Undigest (Edinburgh
Review, 2005), demonstrating the continuum between the
prosodically=96dense, endlessly considered poetry of the former and the
procedural work of the latter. Manson has taught at Cambridge
University and other institutions. He lives in Glasgow, where he edits
the small press Object Permanence.

"'Ah more eh=85oh oh'. In the light of Faraday's candle Coleridge
channels Loewenhoek and Whalen (I was thinking) as Peter Manson shakes
the frayed carpet of culture and, as a fearless Duprat caddis fly
larva, makes jewels from the motes. Even the bits of themselves the
poems create make interesting shadows. 'Groups of words which didn't
describe the image but which were it'. Yes. Wit, intelligence, a
dispassionate view of self: plus images that are not words. Nothing to
want for in this excellent book that moved my chitin heart."

"Peter Manson is the language veterinarian, elbow-deep in the
mysterious interior of our discourse, groping intimately to clutch the
dark beauty of its palpitating offals, approaching the apparatus of
its speech-making from entirely the wrong direction. If every word was
once an animal, then every animal was harmed in the making of this
book."

Subject:      What is a failed poet?
In-Reply-To:  <POETICS%200806030000587115.0051@LISTSERV.BUFFALO.EDU>

The post "What is a failed poet?" is a blast.  What a neat and fun post!

My own first impressions in response to the topic/post: One, well of
course the question itself, or the actual asking of the question (or
such a question) reveals more about a given poet, a given person, a
given writer, or a given "contemplator" than many answers to the
question will.  Why then=20
would one ask such a question, or what would one gain/engage in asking
(oneself) (or others)(or "Posterity") such a question, or that question
particularly?

Particularly after yesterday afternoon's travails, I myself feel like "a
failed golfer."  Especially considering the fact that on Sunday I must
have
hit 3-4 hundred practice balls (in a field out back of the local high
school that I went to as a pre-adult and where I can indulge in my
obsession free of charge and in endless and intoxicating "bliss of
solitude").  But I will nonetheless go straight back to more "Golfing"
this evening, or as soon as I can, whether I am a failed golfer or not.
Hmmm, that says more about what=20
floats my boats (but not the entire flotilla) than it says about
"success" and "failure," I suppose...  And even then it still doesn't
tell me what the whole effing mystery is (all about); how to achieve the
"mastery" I so stubbornly (and psychotically) pine for; what on earth
I'm really doing out there in a field, and the same field year after
year, golf season after golf season, anyhow; why I feel that I could die
out there and it would be "a dying" while engaging in the one thing that
most feels meaningful though it is of course utterly "meaningless"; how
narcissistic and self-absorbed I truly am but NOT precisely whether my
narcissism and self-absorption are personally, spirtually, or morally
"wrong" (for me); or whether, when someday (if) I am on my deathbed and
depressingly reviewing my life and what I did with my "brief hours and
weeks," I wasted what time I was blessed to have had.

Two, there is of course a big difference between asking the question in
reference to "judging Others" or in reference to analyzing/evaluating
whatever track one is, oneself, on or pursuing.  Personally, I don't see
a lot of value in, and therefore would not hope to spend a lot of time
concerning myself with, evaluating or judging others as poets (the whole
enterprise is tedious and purely, obviously, just marketplace
competition).  At the same time, anybody and his or her brother or
sister knows "a bad poem/poetry," or thinks to know such, or finds such
knowing useful and necessary, on any given occasion.  And, sorry to be
so almighty disrespectful or irreverent or simply unwilling to worship
the saints and angels of the past, but even a given "Faulkner"
self-describing himself/herself as "a failed poet" strikes me as being
self-serving, just, for the most part, the kind of thing "an artist"
says to sell books, self, Self, and selves.  Another "artist" might say
something like "I was a failed novelist.  I simply could not find within
myself the integrity of my beloved Tolstoy or the discipline and fervor
of dear Fyodor Dostoevsky.  I hadn't the stomach for such heroic
morality and suffering and sacrifice.  And my longest attempts in those
first five wretched novels were but mere short stories compared to the
epics my two great models from Russia wrote, so naturally I turned to
short forms, Poetry, and there I was well-received, and I didn't have to
bother so much with explaining why this character was evil or that event
was catastrophic.  People simply liked the way I turned my musical
phrases and how funny and fun and beautiful and New my little white lies
and sacriledge of Truth were, and I found my calling.  It was to unfold
and deconstruct the foundation of grammar itself, peel away the
seemingly infinite obstacles that keep us from accessing all that
Morality is built on to begin with."

Three, does one write (one's "poetry") TO BE a successful or a failed
something or another, or does one write one's poming for very different=20
"experience" in one's life, experience that has nothing whatsoever to do
with being in a/the public eye, competing in the myriad world/historical
marketplace(s), partipating in any given cultural and social
games/interactions/mirroring/movements/activities?  Does one write in
order=20
to achieve or actualize an image of oneself, "a Self" that can be said
to
occupy a rank or role within a pecking order of selves/types called
"poets"/successfulPOETS, an image that one needs in order to believe one
has fulfilled certain human potential one had an instinct or a lust or a
need or a directive to fulfill?  Does one write in order to "make a
thing" or "resolve an issue" or "feel a feeling" or "experience an
aesthetic pleasure" or "actualize a potential, new aesthetic
experience/form" or "access a desired but largely uncharted
psychological frontier," or does one write in order to be called the
Poet who did such and such that Everybody, or Somebody, regarded as
"art" and ultimately revered him/her for?

Four, there are probably NOT a lot of "failed Answers" to the (in some
cases Very SILLY question) "What is a failed poet," but I am sure that
there are some ways of approaching that question which are fruitful and
some ways of concerning oneself with such questions that are nearly as
ridiculous and crazy as this particular Golfer and Pomer's insane
questions about achieving
Satisfaction and Nirvana and Fulfillment and, always the really really
Great
Waste of Time in Life, PERFECTION in his golf game/pursuits...  Geeez...
Life is so damn perfect all by itself, and then we have to come along
and
try to make ourselves better and such...

Anyway, Very Fun topic/post, and really fun and stimulating checking out
various "others" responses to the question...

Steve Tills

P.S. Golf, "a good walk spoiled," somebody, maybe Mark Twain, said.
Poetry, thus, "a good thought foiled?"=20

P.S. II  Shoot, I am "positively" certain that I am both "a failed
Pomer" and a "a failed Golfer" MUCH of the time, and this is, believe
me, thoroughly aggravating and distressing.  But for christ's sakes, of
course I would not ever willingly or happily give up my golfing or my
poming, and NOT because sometimes the efforts are delightfully
satisfying and rewarding and fulfilling.  Rather, simply because these
are things that I myself dig doing, engaging in, spending my "Time"
with. What really matters?

P.S. III  By the way, Golf is a lot harder than Poming.  Anybody who
tells ya different is a complete fool, and NO, there is no such thing as
"a failed poet," except within the heads of those whose self-image, or
livelihood, or what the best psychologists call "self-image
actualization" (as opposed to plain and Real self-actualization) depends
on how one ranks oneself among=20
fellow poets in the marketplace of SELF and Material Life.     =20

Well this is a hell of a joke! It would help to put up poems
and an argument for how it is you believe whether younger
writers write alike, if you do, if you do not.

The Anarekeyology of the Found Hidden in Plain Site/Sight/Cite--

continuously is turning up such "treasures troves"--
the recent book on the history of the Arbus "trove" found --
the finding recently of a Fifties Painting  "treasure" in the trash--
the film "Who the F---is Jackson Pollock?" on the Pollock (or not) found at
yard sale--
a Van Gogh that had sat "unnoticed as such" for years on a mantelpiece in
Milwaukee--
no longer the sole provenance of the garbage dumps of the ancient worlds --

yard sales, dumpsters, "conventional homes," barns--
are "producing Major Finds"--
of the very recent past already having a status and value with any of those
of the very remote pasts--

while eBay and "Antiques Roadshow" help create whole new categories of
increasingly valuable "collectables," "original
versions," "first run model series" --

these are the "Happy Faces" of cultures which can find the treasures of
their own backyards and attics--
the dumpster down the street--the yard sale on a peaceful afternoon --

the more things which can be produced with built in obsolesence, the more
structures demolished for new condos--
the more communities converted into prisons--

the more such Happy Finds will be made--"close to home"--
the more nostalgia there is created--

the more valuable becomes an object which "embodies" the moments of its
"original" sentiments--

nostalgia, being hazy--requires a "clear image," a "real object" to bring
itself into focus--
to "demonstrate" and "prove" the reality of its existence--

a sign of an increasing "amnesia"?--
a tribute to the continual revisioning effects of increasingly mediatized
"history"--?

is the "past" one "remembers"--
one's own memory of it--or one now provided for it--

requiring the possesion of an object from that past-
to reassuure one that what one remembered was actually something "really
there"--?
and reassuring one that one oneself also was "really there"--?

If the New Worlds can yield such treasure via their own detritus--
what about the Old, thought to have been "used up" as it were--?

Rather than waiting for centuries for the Old Dumps to yield New treasures-
why not simply create whole new areas, countries, of New Dumps in Old
Places--

for the finding of Old "treasures" both New and "Anew"--

the more landscapes bombed into craters-
the more people displaced--disappeared--

the more destruction there is--
the more disappearance of once mass produced and popular items--
in deliberately dismantled societies--

the more scarcity created--
the more desperation--

the more valuable ever more recent things will become--
as well as the things of remote pasts already found and "to be found"--
New and "Anew" alike--

not only on the Black Markets for locals--
and Security forces--
--but in the Global markets for collectors--

In Iraq, the farmers whose lands are being destroyed are put to work digging
them up in search of "treasures" for the collectors of the world--
when the farmers are thought not trustworthy enough--privatized security
forces employ imported  laborers in a form of near-slavery--
to dig up the "treasures" of an annihilated culture-- for the pleasure of
eyes of investors in the war machines and security corporations--

the NY Times runs "heart warming"  photo-stories of Palestinian children
digging out of the rubble objects they can resell for the survival of their
families--
the very same bombs and bulldozers that destroyed their homes--
now provide the homeless with "employment"--
and an increased value in things previously commonly found--

as the landscape they live in steadily disappears--
and they themselves disappear--

"Old New Orleans" begins to produce things of value for the decoration of
the new condos--
while former residents are scattered to the soup kitchen winds--

To destroy, to make intentionally temporary--
becomes not at all a "waste"--
but the creation of ever more markets of "collectibles," "treasures,"
"nostalgia items," for every occaision and every situation--
the home, the dashboard, the gallery, the museum, the private yacht, the
corporate board room--
the office desk top paper weight--

To purchase and posses the signs that in a world ever more rapidily
vanishing--
one not only exists now, but has indeed been existing--
through times one "seems to remember"--

histories one is told and shown "that happened"--

(not unlike the situation of person's in Orwell's 1984--whose "reality" and
"history" is changed daily--so that it appears to have always been
exactly what one is told that it has been--)

OK. So maybe Troy's recommending the new formalism. But I'm going to
act as if he weren't. Then the proposition makes some sort sense. At
least the proposition that form forces decisions on a poet. I'm
considering poetic procedures as form here, not just villanelles and
pantsuits and those other forms that I was encouraged to try in
workshop.

My initial response was bilious too, but if I pretend I didn't hear
the "young poets write alike" bit, then I can make something useful
of the comment.

I taught three sections of intro to poetry this semester for a total
of something like 96 students. I assigned two creative projects, two
poems. In each case, there were some fairly large groups of people I
could say were writing "the same." That is, I could easily categorize
poems. I noticed that it was an urge to dismiss that led to
categorization. I got tired of reading about the agony of adolescent
love, the joys of beer, the profundity of the personal experience of
Jesus Christ. What I wanted to dismiss was accounts of experiences
that don't interest me. Yet those are of great immediacy for the
people writing and reading them, since I take the audience of the
poems to be the other students in the class.

I can't read Perelman's mind, but maybe it was a similar urge to
dismiss, a similar impatience, that inspired his "joke."

I caught myself today sneering about students in general elective
courses at my institution, sneering at them for not being as literate
as I'd like. It was a pretty low point and a low blow. But it's a
blow born of frustration and ideals. Maybe Perelman's outburst was an
inverted advocacy. Maybe not. JP

Hi everyone--

I'm sorry for all the posting the past couple days on this, but I
should've written more explicit guidelines for how to register online
for The Beat Generation Symposium.

I've pasted, below, instructions from the Columbia College Ticket
Office. Thanks--

Best,
Tony

How to register for The Beat Generation Symposium online:

1. Go to www.colum.edu/tickets and click on the orange “Buy” button.

 are names for concepts. Poems are made of words. Thus poems are made of co=

Read any issue of Poetry Magazine -- they almost all sound alike. They all deal with the same issues in the same ways, investigating little in way of language or expression. Most of it is prose with line breaks.

Well this is a hell of a joke! It would help to put up poems
and an argument for how it is you believe whether younger
writers write alike, if you do, if you do not.

joining in late here, so pardon me if I repaet what others have said --

it is certainly true that "turning your free verse poem" into some other form
can be an interesting experiment (see EXERCISES IN STYLE by Queneau) -- but
there are huge flaws in the reasoning here, beginning with the assumption that
it will make a "better" poem -- try the Red Wheel Barrow as a sonnet -- though
I guess that's not free verse in the first place -- so try Song of Myself as a
Miltonic free verse poem -- better?

and where does this idea come from that it's the same poem in another form?

likewise, I doubt that LET ME NOT TO THE MARRIAGE OF TRUE MINDS ADMIT
IMPEDIMENT would be better off in trimeter -- Geroge Starbuck I think it was
had a riotous good time rerendering famous translations of poems -- like:
Where's last year's snows?

Subject:      re "Joke" and "Failed Poets"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

The "Joke" and "Failed Poets" threads provide an interesting way in which
two "recieved ideas" take the same "subject" and see it from "opposite"
points of view.

In the "Failed Poet" thread, in many of the examples cited, it is the
"failed poet" who describes themself in that manner.

In the "Joke" a single poet is understood by many to be describing a whole
generation in a sense as "failed poets."

In what ways then are "failed poets" due to the sense  on a writer's part of
having "failed as a poet,"and on a reader's part to have "failed as a poet?"


Is a "Sucessful Poet" finding other poets to be "Failed Poets," necessarily
a "Succesful Reader" also?

And on the part of a writer who recognizes themselves as a Failed
Poet--might this not mean that they are themselves "Sucessful Readers"?
That is, they are good enough readers of poetry to understand that their own
is not up to their standards as readers of poetry to go on writing it?

While the "Successful Poet" may be a "Failed Reader" in reading poetry that
does not conform to his standards for himself, yet may succeed in terms of
poetry beyond his particular personal "take" and "tastes"?

The "Success" and "Failure" of poets and poetry is not only a question of
the writing, but of its reading(s).

The history of poetry and writing is littered with examples of poetry which
was "Failed" during fairly short or quite long times due to its readings.
Then, in the well known "plot" of this familiar story,  one fine day the
poetry and writing finds a Reader who recognizes its "Success," and the work
becomes that strange  twin of the "Instant Classic"--the "Neglected
Masterpiece."

I've been working on a series of essays on "The New Extreme Experimental
American Poetry," a poetry which is regarded by many, in the title of one of
the pieces (a phrase from Roberto' Bolano's Distant Star)as "Non-Poetry for
Non-Readers." (The essays also discuss other poetry and poets considered in
other ways.) A number of these are concerned with the readings of the Poems
from Guantanamo book, judged as  "bad poetry" by "bad poets"  who are also
"bad people" by a great many of the non-readers who have entrusted their
judgement to primarily a handful of reviews or comments.

There are many reasons for the "state" in which the Gunatanamo Poems have
appeared, among them that of a new "extreme experimentalism," which is the
introduction of old and new forms of torture as methods of not only the
detainee poets  "forcing to speak" but also  "forcing them  to write."

Now--in seeking to extract "confessions" from these poets--will they write a
confessional Poetry?  Will they write a form of  "coded" Code Poetry in
order to attempt to send out "hidden messages" to those out in the world who
will understand and decode them?

In "singing the body electric" via the "Shock and Awe" of electric current
torture applied to all parts of the body--will they produce a New Hybrid
Human-Electric Interface Poetry?

Indeed, what will be the productions of what is a New American Poetry
produced via torture, via censorship and self censorship and  translation by
non-literary translators under strict super vision of the military?

And--will there be American readers who will be capable of reading this new
form of American writing?

Not simply as "failed poetry" or the often assailed "Poetry of Witness," or
"Prison Poetry," but in terms of its being the expression of indeed an
American Extreme Experimental Poetry--
simultaneously "forced out of" and "forced upon, "  censored and self
censored, not allowed "literary translation," and yet ---

Since the entire "experiment" may be viewed as one set up to produce
"negative" results--how might the poets themselves have attempted to write a
poetry within a poetry received as a "non poetry for non readers?"

The essay "Non Poetry for Non Readers" will be in the forthcoming Kaurab
and another piece on "Waterboarding and Poetry"
is on line in Wordforword #13
the current issue

here is an example of some of the difficulties which "failed Poetry"
encounters in terms of readers and readings--:

i'll give you a joke as an example--
my sister, who became a chemical engineer--told me this--
when we were in high school--

a group of scientists was conducting experiments with a frog--

they lined a big old frog up at a "starting line" and cried out as though in
one voice----Jump Froggie Jump!!

the frog jumped--and pretty damn far!!
the scientits were quite impressed--

the leap's distance was duly measured and entered into the experiment's
logbook-

the scientists then cut off one of the frog's legs-

Jump Froggie!!!  Jump!!! -
they cried to the now three legged frog at the starting line--

and Froggie jumped!--
soared through the air--
but not quite as far as the first time--

the measurements were made,the distance noted down--

now the scientists cut off a second leg and placed the frog again at the
starting line

Jump Froggie!! Jump!!

the frog gathered itself together with al its might on though on only two
legs--

and --leaped!! --nonetheless--

again, the distance was measured and noted down in the log in the spidery
hand writing so prevalent among scientists--

this time when the scientists cut the frog's leg--but one remained--

a nice Froggie leg--to be sure--but so alone!--

Jump Froggie!!!  Jump!!

the great cry of encouragement and command rang out in the expectant
laboratory air--

and as all attentively leaned forward to observe--

the one legged frog, with all its will power and its whole body vibrating
alarmingly  with the effort--

managed to somehow move itself forward--just a bit--but enough to entail a
measurement  another entry in minuscule, blot-free, spidery handwriting in
the crisp paged logbook--

the scientists once again wielded yet another freshly sterilized
scalpel--and the frog was deprived of its last leg and set down at the
starting line--

Jump Froggie!! Jump!!--

as all eyes watched with a heightened interest in the concluding stage of
the experiment--

the frog ---despite an immense strain--did not move at all--

the torso and head sat still at the line--pulsing with thwarted power and
energy--

the experiment was repeated, after a brief break,  just in case Froggie
might have been too  winded from its last efforts to move on this first
attempt--

again the chorus of excited scientific voices rang in the anti-septic tinged
laboratory air--

Jump Froggie!! Jump!!

again, the frog did not move at all, for all its heartbreaking determination
and efforts--

Satisfied that they had completed in full their experiment, the scientists,
after entering this last non-distance traveled as the final measurement in
the log book--

wrote out their conclusion based on all the evidence they had gathered:

"Frogs with no legs can't hear"

As to what Bob meant, a lot of the mystery could be cleared away if
someone were to ask him.

Re: the individuality of formalist poets. It's helpful to remember
how awful the vast majority of the poetry written during all the
centuries when all verse was formal has been. The wonderful poetry
that I hope we all know was written by 10 poets per decade at the
outside (name ten English poets active 1800-1810. Then convince
yourself that reading more Robert Southey will change your life).
Most of the rest is pretty indistinguishable. Which is to say, form
in itself carries no magic.

Preoccupations of adolescents. How about asking for a tighter focus?
Not the love of one's life, but his or her toenails, wrists,
whatever? (It also wouldn't hurt to tell them that we all pretty much
know what an orgasm is like without their help).

I've even heard some of these young writers aren't completely sincere
when they swear to defend the constitution from enemies foreign
domestic when taking positions as composition teachers, and that they
are known to have unprotected sex with complete strangers. Total
anarchy!

Oh Troy, everyone knows that only barbarians write in rhyme. It would be
totally inappropriate for citizens of the new Rome like myself to use it.

Now I'll grant you that occasionally transforming a poem into a form can
provide for interesting possibilities for revision. That is to say, it is a
useful exercise, but an exercise and a poem are not (usually) the same
thing.

You've asked for responses to be educated by experience. It seems, however,
that for your comments to meet that requirement, you would have to be
familiar with the work of all young writers. Are you? Or are you simply
making generalizations based upon your opinion of free verse?

(for those who have written, no I'm not sick, that's very sweet of you.  but
no, that was me being obnoxious, I'm only sick with my own sarcasm.)

But really, Troy, c'mon!

Grant's call to KILL the wild buffalo was an investment in taming Native
Americans.  The systematic slaughter of millions of people and animals was
done in the name of words like
EXPANSION and
PROGRESS
but expanding and progressing by pulling back and killing what is living
free Outside acceptable and respectable boundaries is rather illogical.

I prefer the word "illogical" in such matters for its marvelous prefix.  A
prefix even I would fondle in front of my not so subtle mother.

We're to write in the same forms so our poems can be different you say?
Neo-Formalism has always bothered me, I mean, what is it?  The New Old?  New
at being Old?  Huh?  In the end to me it's nothing more than new words for
old weapons.  THIS is where poetry is NOTHING but political to me!  We might
as well be talking about genocide!

I would rather write the letter "R" and NOTHING ELSE from now on!  R!

rrr r R!

r r r r r r r r r r r rr r r r r

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Modeling, filtering, resonance, transmission (in recent work?) and bad
theory -

Bad theory: Because distorting concept and process, constructing 'fit'
where most likely there's none at all.

I want to transmit this. I am transmitting this.
I am applying a filter to this. I am filtering this.
This is resonating. I want to make this resonate. (I am resonating this.)
I am modeling this. This is a model. This is continuou modeling.
  -- I am continuously modeling this.

These terms are interconnected; they assume energy pooling and structure,
and are processes with process control. The control structures divide the
configuration into semantics (with internal syntactic control) and syntac-
tics (with external semantic control). The latter is the control structure
proper - a formal program or filter whose semantic control is an intention
to harness, modify,, transmit, or otherwise control the former. The former
might loosely be considered 'content,' i.e. on the plane of content, which
necessarily emphasizes semantics - the sememe of the content - that relies
on internal syntactics to configure the sememe for others. This is a false
model of course since the content seeps through both semantics and syntac-
tics, but these domains are still 'somewhat' uncoupling; similarly, cont-
rol structures are entangled between intentional semantics and process
control itself. All of this is clear in transmission and filtering; the
latter might be considered a form of transmission itself, although it is
usually taken to refer to a cutting-away of tranmission contents. Like-
wise transmission can be considered a form of dynamic filtering which
parcels and configures content dynamically from one to another site.
Resonance is an internalized filtering and transmission tending towards
the best of all possible (local) worlds; it achieves this as a steady-
state maintained (other than at temperatures near absolute zero) by an
external energy source which keeps the resonance alive. Otherwise reson-
ance, like transmission, is dampened and dies out. Filtering in this
regard may be considered passive; a filter need not consume external
energy for maintenance, but may just gate whatever content comes through.
Finally, modeling - not models - may be considered a continuous process of
adjusting to the world; resonances are appearances of entities that seem
somewhat steady-state. Modeling transmits a series of models-in-process,
behavioral dynamics, flux; filtering is at the heart of modeling, shaping
whatever raw data comes into the process. It would be literally fitting to
establish a procedural dynamics moving from (modeling filtering) through
(transmission resonance) but this seems problematic; all that can be said
is that these processes are all involved in situating the subject dynami-
cally in the world, and are intentionally configured and active within the
digital. (Resonance itself is analogic, I think; while it operates digit-
ally, through positive feedback it might break out of any potential well
designed to contain it. Of course this depends on the variety of resonance
- and all of this points, I believe, to the above as bad or broken theory,
groping at something and groping in the wrong direction.

Subject:      Audio Interview with John Hollander by Nigel Beale

Born in 1929 in New York, educated at Columbia, John Hollander is a poet =
and literary critic. He has written more than a dozen books of poetry, =
and seven books of criticism, including Rhyme's Reason of which Harold =
Bloom said: "[it is] on all questions of schemes, patterns, forms, =
meters, rhymes of poetry in English, the indispensible authority." and =
why I was so keen to interview him. According to New York Times, =
Hollander stresses the importance of hearing poems out loud: "A good =
poem satisfies the ear. It creates a story or picture that grabs you, =
informs you and entertains you."



His honors include the Bollingen Prize, the Levinson Prize, and =
fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, =
and the National Endowment for the Arts. A former Chancellor of the =
Academy of American Poets he is the current poet laureate of =
Connecticut, and has taught at many different universities, including =
Yale.

We met recently at the Philadelphia Book Festival. I spend most of this =
interview relentlessly and unsuccessfully trying to badger him into =
identifying, comparing and describing the differences between great and =
bad poems. To name names. We do get to some of the great (Rossana =
Warren, Shakespeare, Browning, Swinburne, Rossetti, for example) but he =
will not go anywhere near the bad. Toward the end, clearly tired from =
the day's activities and my uncalled for bullying, he reads a =
beautifully funny and thoughtful poem, based on a quote taken from =
Boswell's Life of Johnson, found in his most recent collection, A draft =
of Light.

I'm going to call this one, Charless Sloat, because it reminds me of
him. We sometimes write differently.

Charless Sloat

Poems are made of trolls.
Poems are made of images of trolls kersnoodling
Poems flicker are made of images of kersnoodling trolls images
Poems imagine claims that trolls even kersnoodle
Claims hope their handlers know to kersnoodle
Claims provide trolls poems with even images
Therefore, trolls are what poems made of kersnoodling.

What's so wrong with failure? As the saying goes, success teaches you
nothing.

yes, and poetry magazine is well known as the voice of the young
turks of american poetry. and isn't run by a middle aged new
formalist. at all.

Yes, so, which young writers write alike?  All.  THAT uncountable theorem, =
four or four thousand.  And older writers do not?  Let's suppose, who?  Say=
, Charles Bernstein, Bob Perelman, Bruce Andrews.  Whoa.  But these are all=
 men.  Add in Alice Notley, Bernadete Mayer, Marjorie Welish?  Writing alik=
e?  There is reason to doubt.
=20
And what would either variety or sameness be FOR, anyway?  Since myth is de=
ad, and the gods are dead, the vital element in writing would have to be on=
e's individual volition in being different, perhaps terminally so.  I mean,=
 does all this artiface go to build up anything but the edifice of "a canon=
"?  Which would include the notion of "variety" as a kind of campfire, with=
 the wagons drawn 'round, to keep the REAL savages out.  Who remain
=20
local, and territorial.  "A boy alone in his room is sure to go astray."  L=
uckily. (and eventually come-on to the world like Diogenes . . . ? ).  But,=
 not to go too far out of our mutual way,
=20
older writers.  What about the anonymous ones?  The auther of the Iliad, th=
e Book of Jonah, and/or The Journey of Ishtar Through Hades, for example?  =
Are these "the same"?  Of course they are.  Because they constitute a world=
 story.  Or a part of the continuous completion of one.  Or acknowledgement=
 that there actually IS one (a world) beyond one's own supple comprehension=
, that one must go outwardly toward.
=20
The "problem" with post (-whatever date) poets, is that none of them seem c=
apable of rising above the Blue Lodge . . . the basic state of initiation. =
 Who will find some way out of the uncountable grains of sand both underfoo=
t and overhead in the grandiose American emotional desert that constitute t=
he "beat" of the first poetic - our wholly absent water, in memory alone?
=20
Is it any wonder we are being led by idiots?  And deadly ones, to boot.  Fr=
ench-fried ice cream.  Shake your fanny.  Et al.
=20
Is Homer free verse?  No.  Certainly not in Greek.  And who anyway could ve=
ry likely be Isis, Bilqis . . . or even Tina Turner.  THAT
=20
at least, would . . . help clean the pigeon shit out of the birdcage.  That=
 it's full of shit.  I mean, like, there's no bird.  The shit just prolifer=
ates of and by itself.  So it isn't just a question of verse practice, but,=
 much more a trace of, as CA Conrad says, the slaughter of animus.  New for=
malism
=20
is just the same old way of milking it.  It's occultism.  Using the energy =
got from killing toward an endless thesis of the Self.  Which never ends.  =
Who of you is REALLY against (the) War
=20
while remaining secretly in love with Heraclitus?  Those of the privileged =
castes have always enjoyed a bloodbath.  And poets are nothing, if not priv=
ileged.  I say, admit it, and reign.  Difference achieved always involves a=
 painful degree of slaughter.
=20
Which, of course, is the nature behind ANY "joke".  I'm clean . . . how abo=
ut you?  Of course, the first slave ships in the 17th century came into Bos=
ton harbor, not Charleston.  Reputations do not simply "occur" . . . they a=
re made.
SE

failure is v interesting, whatever it is. in the 60s and 70s we wanted
the "right to fail" in our educations. that was an instance of economic
expansion, i.e. we could "afford to fail," or experiment.

Charles Sloat or, All Poets Write the Same Way

Poems are made of trolls.
Poems are made of images of trolls kersnoodling
Poems flicker are made of images of kersnoodling trolls images
Poems imagine claims that trolls even kersnoodle
Claims hope their handlers know to kersnoodle
Claims provide trolls poems with even images
Therefore, trolls are what poems made of kersnoodling.

Phillip Schultz's book was well-titled, don't you think?  And quite a compelling read, i.m.o.

While I agree with you, Murat, it is unfortunate that the threat of failure is so central.  In this regard, I like to side with Hart Crane and identify with poems that are more grounded in opportunities for success and spiritual growth.  Not dogmatic, but nominative spirituality.  What does the poem make possible?

Poems should present a more positive potentiality to distance ourselves from history's shadows.

But I don't want to should all over myself.

On my blog I argue something perhaps similar, Murat. Namely, that the
good/bad scale shouldn't be equated to success/failure in writing (or
anything else, necessarily). Capitalism's, and really all structures'
quests for efficiency, have made it so. And it has made us so, too.
Now, I'm not saying that I solely blame capitalism for necessarily
ruining our chances at equality in the wide world of poetry, but that
our values have  been forged by our systems to read poetry along
certain lines...

Where does the experiment fail?

I basically argue that the American poem creates a parallel and contra space
to the cycle of production. It is a talk I gave on the subject of poetry and
class about ten years ago. It can be found in the web in the following
address:
http://home.jps.net/~nada/murat1.htm.

Ciao,

PLease explain all the failed poetry in pre- or non-capitalist countries throughout the history of the world. I see little evidence connecting poetic ability and economic system. In fact, it seems that free markets have opened it up so that far more people can write poetry. To the extent that more people are wealthy enough to have the leisure to write more bad poetry, then perhaps capitalism is to blame for the high numbers of failed poets -- but that is just because more people are trying. If more people try, more people fail.

On my blog I argue something perhaps similar, Murat. Namely, that the
good/bad scale shouldn't be equated to success/failure in writing (or
anything else, necessarily). Capitalism's, and really all structures'
quests for efficiency, have made it so. And it has made us so, too.
Now, I'm not saying that I solely blame capitalism for necessarily
ruining our chances at equality in the wide world of poetry, but that
our values have  been forged by our systems to read poetry along
certain lines...

Where does the experiment fail?

THAT the Buf List inspires posts like this is evidence that its dynamic
poetics is generative of truly delicious and thoroughly uplifting
Thought.  Love this post of yours, Stephen!

Yes, so, which young writers write alike?  All.  THAT uncountable
theorem, four or four thousand.  And older writers do not?  Let's
suppose, who?  Say, Charles Bernstein, Bob Perelman, Bruce Andrews.
Whoa.  But these are all men.  Add in Alice Notley, Bernadete Mayer,
Marjorie Welish?  Writing alike?  There is reason to doubt.
=20
And what would either variety or sameness be FOR, anyway?  Since myth is
dead, and the gods are dead, the vital element in writing would have to
be one's individual volition in being different, perhaps terminally so.
I mean, does all this artiface go to build up anything but the edifice
of "a canon"?  Which would include the notion of "variety" as a kind of
campfire, with the wagons drawn 'round, to keep the REAL savages out.
Who remain
local, and territorial.  "A boy alone in his room is sure to go astray."
Luckily. (and eventually come-on to the world like Diogenes . . . ? ).
But, not to go too far out of our mutual way, older writers.  What about
the anonymous ones?  The auther of the Iliad, the Book of Jonah, and/or
The Journey of Ishtar Through Hades, for example?  Are these "the same"?
Of course they are.  Because they constitute a world story.  Or a part
of the continuous completion of one.  Or acknowledgement that there
actually IS one (a world) beyond one's own supple comprehension, that
one must go outwardly toward.
=20
The "problem" with post (-whatever date) poets, is that none of them
seem capable of rising above the Blue Lodge . . . the basic state of
initiation.  Who will find some way out of the uncountable grains of
sand both underfoot and overhead in the grandiose American emotional
desert that constitute the "beat" of the first poetic - our wholly
absent water, in memory alone?
=20
Is it any wonder we are being led by idiots?  And deadly ones, to boot.
French-fried ice cream.  Shake your fanny.  Et al.
=20
Is Homer free verse?  No.  Certainly not in Greek.  And who anyway could
very likely be Isis, Bilqis . . . or even Tina Turner.  THAT at least,
would . . . help clean the pigeon shit out of the birdcage.  That it's
full of shit.  I mean, like, there's no bird.  The shit just
proliferates of and by itself.  So it isn't just a question of verse
practice, but, much more a trace of, as CA Conrad says, the slaughter of
animus.  New formalism
is just the same old way of milking it.  It's occultism.  Using the
energy got from killing toward an endless thesis of the Self.  Which
never ends.  Who of you is REALLY against (the) War while remaining
secretly in love with Heraclitus?  Those of the privileged castes have
always enjoyed a bloodbath.  And poets are nothing, if not privileged.
I say, admit it, and reign.  Difference achieved always involves a
painful degree of slaughter.
=20
Which, of course, is the nature behind ANY "joke".  I'm clean . . . how
about you?  Of course, the first slave ships in the 17th century came
into Boston harbor, not Charleston.  Reputations do not simply "occur" .
. . they are made.

The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry has awarded the Griffin Poetry
Prize Lifetime Recognition Award to Ko Un.

Instituted in 2006, the Griffin Trustees present the Lifetime Recognition
Award on a periodic basis to pay tribute to the work and achievements of
international artists working in poetry.

The winners of the 2008 Griffin Poetry Prize, awarded at the same ceremony
held in Toronto yesterday, were John Ashbery (international) and Robin
Blaser (Canadian). The $100,000 Griffin Poetry Prize, the largest poetry
prize in the world for a single volume of poetry, is divided between the two
winners. The prize is for first edition books of poetry published in 2007,
and submitted from anywhere in the world.

From "Art and Artist", in the chapter on "Success and Fame", by Otto Rank:

"Success is therefore a stimulus to creativity only so long as it is not
attained---which means, as long as the artist believes he can regain life by
his success and so free himself from the bondage of creating. Bitterly,
then, he finds out that success only strengthens the need for creating and
that fame, which is the end of it, leads to depersonalization during his
lifetime and is of no use for life if it comes after death. The artist does
not create, in the first place, for fame or immortality; his production is
to be a means to achieve actual life, since it helps him to overcome fear.
But he cannot get out of the bypath he has once trodden, which was to lead
him back by means of his work to life. He is thus more and more deeply
entangled in his creative dynamism, which receives its seal in success and
fame....Success and fame thus complete not only the work of the artist, but,
far more than that, a vast circle in the eternal conflict between individual
and group. The individual tries, by taking over a collective ideology which
he creates anew in the personal sense, to assure his own immortality, and
this is manifested in success; but the community, by the bestowing of fame,
annexes for itself the immortality which had really been won by the
individual, makes itself eternal in the work, and offers the artist in
return its collective glory."

  The Breast Cancer site is having trouble getting enough people to click on their site daily to meet their quota of donating at least one free mammogram a day to an underprivileged woman.

  *** It takes less than a minute to go to their site and click on ‘donating a mammogram’ for free (pink window in the middle). ***

    This doesn’t cost you a thing. Their corporate sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to donate mammogram in exchange for advertising. Thank you!

Neither. By selecting texts through acts of plagiarism, you fundamentally

Jim,

Very interesing slide show. How does a digital work like this differ from
Stand Brackage's hand painted films, which also, come to think of it, can be
thought of as slide shows.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear  Friends,

On the chance any of you may be in Providence, RI, please join me for the
opening of my new exhibit
Thursday, June 19, 2008    5:00 =96 9:00 PM (Providence Gallery night)


Best,

*
PETER CICCARIELLO: Recent Work
Uncommon Vision at the Gallery Above Providence Optical*

Providence artist Peter Ciccariello spends much of his time recording and
cataloguing the rich, transient textures and urban glyphs of New England.
Ciccariello is an interdisciplinary digital artist and poet whose Limited
edition fine art pigment prints are palimpsests of perception, incorporatin=
g
aspects of sculpture, photography, and painting techniques.

These fragmentary glimpses of environment make their way into an alternate
world; a 3-D, virtual, second-life world that journals real world,
first-life experience in a way that reflects the personal passage of time. =
A
spot of light on a stone wall in Providence transitions into flotsam and
jetsam on a Bristol beach. A passing storm cloud above Hope Street is found
peering out from behind surrealistic mountains in a world that does not
exist.

Dear Poetics-L:


RE: http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

The Poems of Mao Zedong

Mao Zedong was born in Hunan Province in 1893, son of an impoverished
peasant. In October 1949, he founded the People's Republic of China,
which he led until his death in 1976. Willis Barnstone is
Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature at Indiana
University, the author of many books, and a noted translator.


http://go.ucpress.edu/Mao


Mao Zedong, leader of the revolution and absolute chairman of the
People's Republic of China, was also a calligrapher and a poet of
extraordinary grace and eloquent simplicity. The poems in this
beautiful edition (from the 1963 Beijing edition), translated and
introduced by Willis Barnstone, are expressions of decades of
struggle, the painful loss of his first wife, his hope for a new
China, and his ultimate victory over the Nationalist forces. Willis
Barnstone's introduction, his short biography of Mao and brief
history of the revolution, and his notes on Chinese versification all
combine to enrich the Western reader's understanding of Mao's poetry.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is
available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Mao

Troy,

You're missing my point altogether. I'm not arguing that capital
allows more writers and thus more failures or its opposite. What I'm
asking, or gently positing, is whether capitalist measures of worth
have somehow affected (or contaminated) our standards of working/not
working in relation to objects other than goods and services. I'd say
pretty much that the answer is yes, and that poetry shouldn't be
judged this way. The idea of a failure as a career of a poet which
really isn't a career seems strange to me. I mean, how many poets
aren't other things when they're being careerist?

I teach English. That's my 'career.' So...does the poet fail on terms
of their vocation/hobby/passion/whatever you call your writing if your
writing isn't your job? How can success be measured in a field
virtually incapable of paying the bills? And if it does pay them, does
that mean you're successful?

In fact, it seems that free markets have opened it up so that far more people can write poetry. To the extent that more people are wealthy enough to have the leisure to write more bad poetry, then perhaps capitalism is to blame for the high numbers of failed poets -- but that is just because more people are trying. If more people try, more people fail.

Don't let my undergraduate students get wind of this -- but in case you're short of cash, Elizabeth, you should market your observation to "Sparknotes" and other such sites.  Then the next time I catch someone plagiarizing her or his research or response paper, they'll be able to bleat out, "But plagiarism means I fundamentally altered these texts!"

Fortunately, they aren't sufficiently well-read or adept to quote Isidore Ducasse on the matter.

So does that mean if I take one of your books of poems and reprint it with my name on
it that I have made all your poems my poems?

I'd like to think this is some kind of joke, but then again, maybe it's the first in a series:

The University of California Press is pleased to announce the
publication, in large, full-color format of:

THE COMPLETE PAINTINGS AND WATERCOLORS OF ADOLPH HITLER

"Hitler was an artist of extraordinary grace and a colorist of vital intensity.  In these mesmerizing artworks, collected and reproduced here for the first time, discerning viewers with the courage to free themselves from the burden of historical prejudice will be richly rewarded with a rare glimpse into the soul of a true heir of German Romanticism."  - M. Heidegger

The University of California Press is pleased to announce the publication of

JOSEPH STALIN: THE COLLECTED WRITINGS ON LINGUISTICS

"Ought to shake up the entire moribund field of literary study and put it in the Gulag where it belongs."  - S. Zizek

"Language Poets, take heed!  This is the real cutting edge, Lubyanka-stylee."  - A. Badiou.

Murat,

i haven't seen the brackage work you refer to. i presume it's fairly
abstract.

the dbCinema images you've seen so far (
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky/slidvid.htm ) are mainly meant to be
read one at a time. there's a stop button in slidvid.htm and "<" and ">"
buttons to go back and forward among the images, and the "^" button takes
you up one level in the project where the stills are dealt with on their
own.

i created the images in dbCinema (the 'db' is for 'database'), a graphic
synthesizer program i'm writing (using Director). there's a screenshot of
the dbCinema interface at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky3/intro/graphics/screenshot.jpg . in
dbCinema, one creates and configures one or more simultaneous 'brushes'. one
assigns each brush a concept in the form either of a search string or a
local directory of images. if the concept is a search string, dbCinema
downloads images from the net somehow related to the concept (via a Google
and Yahoo image search) and uses those images as 'paint' sort of like a
music synthesizer uses samples of other music in the creation of new work.
the samples can be as big or small as you like, and many other properties
are also configurable. a musican typically plays several 'notes' or samples
per second; dbCinema typically renders several 'strokes' per second. a music
synthesizer can use samples from many instruments at once; dbCinema lets you
use many images at once in a compositional activity that produces a
painterly movie and screenshots of the movie.

The images are 1280x1024 screenshots from movies generated by a newer
version of dbCinema than is currently online. Most of them were produced by
typing in the title of the series (such as "Kandinsky"). dbCinema then
downloads images from the net somehow related to what was typed in and
generates a painterly movie from those pictures. The graphics are
screenshots from the resulting movies. The series in
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky/slidvid.htm are chronological from
oldest to newest; it shows how the idea has developed.

one can move rather fluidly between representation and abstraction. the
images in http://vispo.com/dbcinema/saint are abstract but are mainly made
of pornography. that isn't obvious; it's quite abstract. whereas the images
in, say, http://vispo.com/dbcinema/notredame are far more represenational.
you can almost tell what the underlying images were. whether dbCinema
produces abstract or representational work is a matter of degree and how the
brushes are chosen and configured.

dbCinema produces moving pictures in real-time. you create and configure
'brushes' and then the brushes get at it. you can also adjust the brushes
while they're 'painting'. each frame of the 'movie', each brush renders one
'stroke'.

dbCinema is not instant art. there is a generative element to it, but it
requires creativity from the user in how they select the concepts of the
brushes, select among the resulting downloaded images, and configure the
brushes. you can see there are quite a few parameters to consider in the
screenshot of the interface. it's somewhere on a continuum between
photoshop, say, and instant art programs. photoshop doesn't really produce
anything for you. it gives you lots of tools to produce stuff yourself.
dbCinema produces stuff for you, but if it's going to produce anything
interesting, yer the man.

i just finished a dbCinema feature where one may do screen recording every x
ms. into a sequence of bitmaps. that is basically why i developed the
javascript engine in slidvid.htm to show animation. in the future, i'll be
showing such recordings, ie, sequences that are meant to be seen as
animated, not stills.

i've written something preliminary about dbCinema at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky3/intro

part of the original motivation for dbCinema was to try to do something
interesting with google+yahoo++ image search. it's fascinating that we may
now type in a concept and, bingo, one has a thousand images directly and
indirectly relevant to the concept.

but one does not have to use google+yahoo image search in dbCinema; the
concept of a brush can, instead, be a local folder of images (you can use
your own images). or one may let brushes simply paint with color rather than
with image. that's the case with http://vispo.com/dbcinema/color1 and
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/color2 .

the idea is to combine strong abstract generative art with a strong
representational dimension. when generative visual computer art is strong,
typically its strength is its strong abstract appeal. it's easier to get a
computer to do interesting things with abstract shapes and color sets than
it is to get it to do interesting things with representations of things in
the world. that requires intelligence, for the most part. but dbCinema's
image search capabilities provide it with an interesting representational
dimension. and the program itself is very interactive, configurable,
demanding of human creativity, human intelligence, human direction.

it is a written thing. erm hand written.

" Close those goddamn doors!: An Afternoon with Louisa Solano: Memories o=
f=20
the Grolier Poetry Book Shop"At the Wilderness House Literary Retreat=20
http://www.wildernesshouse.org

On Aug 6 2006 at the Wilderness House Literary Retreat Louisa Solano, for=
mer=20
owner of the Grolier Poetry Book Shop held court for a few hours of casua=
l=20
conversation concerning her experiences running the famed Harvard Square=20=

bookshop for over 30 years. It seems that almost every major contemporary=
=20
poet passed through these doors at one time. Here is a sampler of what=20=

Solano had to say about the times and poets she knew:

Gordon Cairnie: (the founder of the store)

=93These goddamn browsers, close those goddamn, doors!=94 This was a=20
declaration often heard by Solano. Cairnie was =93quirky,=94 and did have=
 a temper=20
according to Solano. Solano said, =93After I bought the store I had a who=
le line=20
of people who told me that Gordon ruined them emotionally. It was the way=
 he=20
talked to them.=94 Cairnie in part was reacting to the browsers who never=
=20
bought a book, and the ones who shoplifted. Obviously keeping people out =
of=20
the store was not good business sense. But Solano felt there was a prevai=
ling=20
attitude at the time that poets were abused by society, so poetry and=20
commerce were viewed as totally separate entities. After he died Solano=20=

recalled that many folks thought it was a =93sin=94 that she took over th=
e store.

Solano on shoplifting:

=93According to a study 98% of people steal. People steal because it is a=
n=20
adventure, a high. It=92s like shooting up; you have to do more and more.=
 You=20
become an expert on justification.=94 Solano said that studies indicate t=
hat=20
shoplifting is highest among people in religious orders. She recalled tha=
t a=20
monk with a flowing robe ripped her off. She said, =93His robe was a litt=
le less=20
flowing when he went out."

Solano on Harvard Square:

"Whatever part of the country people come from, the suburbs or little wor=
king=20
communities, they come to the square and reality diminishes. She=20
continued:"People are walking in a state of grandeur. I remember being=20=

accompanied down the street by someone who said he was going to kill me=20=

because I was a Harvard capitalist!=94

Solano on Robert Lowell:

=93I met him twice. I thought he was homeless. He was carrying two bags f=
ull of=20
newspapers, and he was disheveled. The first time he said to me: =93Young=
=20
lady. I want you to know that Gordon talked too much, and you should neve=
r=20
do that.=94 He walked out of the store. A week later he came and said, =93=
Young=20
lady. You are not following Gordon. You don=92t talk to customers.=94 I f=
ound out=20
later that this was Robert Lowell.=94

Solano=92s favorite poet:

=93Philip Levine. He has always been my favorite. I think his approach to=
 poetry=20
is wide open. He loved an audience. He was a great standup comic. I loved=
=20
the love he had for the Jewish community. I really love him.=94

Solano on the small press:

=93I always thought the small press was the most interesting part of poet=
ry.=20
When I took over the store there was a big small press movement going on.=
=20
This was the 70=92s. Some magazines were printed on colored tissue papers=
,=20
different sizes, etc=85 Most of the bigger presses were publishing Lowell=
, Sexton=20
and Plath. They were not particularly democratic. Diana Di Prima was firs=
t=20
published by a small press and then started her own, and it is still goin=
g=20
strong. She has done translations, and poetry publishing.The University o=
f=20
Texas/Austin was wild about the small press. They probably now (besides t=
he=20
University of Buffalo) have the best small press collection.=92=93Black S=
parrow=20
Press=92 started out selling books with three or four poems for a dollar.=
 Most of=20
the bookstores today would not accept these.=94Even if you were published=
 just=20
in the small press; the fact was you were in a book on a public shelf. Th=
en if=20
things went well you would do another small press book. If things continu=
ed to=20
go well, you would get known.

Solano on Charles Bukowski:

"He sent his poems out virtually everyday to every small press magazine o=
ut=20
there. This totally demolished the myth of him as a disorganized drunk. H=
e=20
wouldn=92t be able to do this if he was."

Solano on Ed Hogan founder of =93Aspect=94 magazine and =93Zephyr Press=94=
:

=93Ed was brilliant. He had a lot of energy. He talked endlessly and rapi=
dly. He=20
got a great group of local poets together, and got the magazine out.=94

Solano on Allen Ginsberg.

=93I loved Allen. When he died I thought the world would cave in. He visi=
ted the=20
store when he was quite ill. He looked yellowish and diminished. I was=20=

shocked. I thought of him as immortal. He brought poetry in the open from=
 a=20
very closed 1950=92s America."

On Jack Kerouac:

=93When I first met him he was sitting down at Lowell House. (Harvard=20
University.) He was wearing a checkered shirt, and sloppy chinos, partly=20=

because he was so fat. The audience loved him because he was what they=20=

expected. He was the crazy writer. At the end of the reading, Desmond=20
O=92Grady, a wild Irish poet (I was madly in love with him), and I escort=
ed him to=20
a bar in Cambridge. There was a young woman who announced to Kerouac=20
and all the guys around him that she wanted a =93multiple lay.=94 Kerouac=
 didn=92t=20
do anything and just waddled off to the bar. We got him back to where he=20=

was staying and he passed out. The next day we met him at the Oxford Gril=
l=20
on Church St. in Harvard Square. The news came out that Plath committed=20=

suicide. Desmond threw his arms around Jack and very dramatically said =93=
We=20
are the only ones left.=94 Jack said,=94 Stay away from me.=94 He was hom=
ophobic.=20
The last we saw of him he was walking down Church St. with two Harvard=20=

undergraduates looking for the perfect =93Gold,=94 --
marijuana. "

PETER CICCARIELLO: Recent Work
Uncommon Vision at the Gallery Above Providence Optical*

Providence artist Peter Ciccariello spends much of his time recording and
cataloguing the rich, transient textures and urban glyphs of New England.
Ciccariello is an interdisciplinary digital artist and poet whose Limited
edition fine art pigment prints are palimpsests of perception, incorporating
aspects of sculpture, photography, and painting techniques.

These fragmentary glimpses of environment make their way into an alternate
world; a 3-D, virtual, second-life world that journals real world,
first-life experience in a way that reflects the personal passage of time. A
spot of light on a stone wall in Providence transitions into flotsam and
jetsam on a Bristol beach. A passing storm cloud above Hope Street is found
peering out from behind surrealistic mountains in a world that does not
exist.

A person working in an artform should always learn about the =20
artform's history, and that includes studying received forms. And a =20
person working in an artform should always study the building blocks =20
of that artform, in poetry's case, that means studying prosody, =20
morphology, grammar, and semantics/semiotics.

however, I don't think that one best learns prosody, morphology, =20
grammar, and semantics/semiotics through writing poetry in received =20
forms. In fact, there are a number of bad ideas about prosody built =20
in to a number of received forms, the sonnet not being the least of =20
offenders in this case, that i think are detrimental to a thorough =20
understanding. Much better I think to study those things from the =20
scientific linguists point of view and find their application in =20
poetry through work of poets like Jackson Mac Low, Gertrude Stein, TS =20=

Eliot, Ted Berrigan, and Ezra Pound. At least, that's what I did, and =20=

I think I'm very good and don't sound like other poets of my =20
generation at all. Nor do I think that Jessica Smith, for example, is =20=

at all similar to Joseph Massey, or for that matter that Mark Leidner =20=

is anything like either of them, and I don't think any of those three =20=

write anything like me, and none of us are anything like Anis Mojgani =20=

or Rachel McKibbens, or Elizabeth Switaj or Marty McConnell or Geoff =20
Gatza. And that's just a list of poets more or less my age that I've =20
had personal interactions with, all of whom are excellent poets. So =20
who exactly are all these younger poets who all write alike?

<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=3D80757> , who has
struggled with hypertensive disease, had a stress-induced stroke leaving hi=
m
with vascular and neurological damage. While Tom=B9s mental acuity remains
quite intact he is still experiencing physical difficulty.

Circumstances involving the abrupt closing of the New College of California
<http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2008/02/28/BAT3V9LUJ.DTL>
where Tom Clark taught for 21 years have compounded his health problems. To
add insult to injury, Tom and his partner Angelica were not notified that
New College had allowed employee health insurance to lapse due to unpaid
premiums, leaving the Clarks without adequate access to healthcare at a tim=
e
of urgent need. While Tom is fighting stroke-related problems, Angelica is
recovering from hip surgery performed earlier this year. Without either
reliable healthcare, including physical rehabilitation services or a salary
(severance, other compensation including back wages have been withheld by
New College) the Clarks are in precarious straits. This is certainly not a
scenario that they expected after so many years of dedication to both New
College =AD as an institution with a mission of social change and equality =AD
and the scores of students who came through the school=B9s Poetics Program.

A group of Tom and Angelica=B9s friends, as well as, former students are
trying to secure immediate =AD and long term =AD support for the Clarks. A fund
through the auspices of Giorno Poetry Systems, an organization with a long
history of supporting artists and writers in crisis administered graciously
by John Giorno, has been established to channel financial assistance to Tom
and Angelica. If you would like to make a contribution to assist the Clarks
during this difficult time, please send checks, payable to =B3Giorno Poetry

No, it doesn't. And the Supreme Court has ruled on this:
http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article1579277.ece

As long as the genre/context is changed, it's really not plagiarism.
In ruling, the court reversed the quote Elizabeth mentioned below (or
above, depending on your email service): If you fundamentally alter
texts, it isn't plagiarism.

In the case Marcus brings up, then yes, see you in hypothetical court.

Christopher
thank you very much for these forthcoming volumes and their blurbs by the
appropriate Philosophes--

While Zizek and Badiou are reviving the Glories of Stalinism and the
Cultural Revolution--(which would have done in the very intellectuals to
whom Badiou appeals--and shipped the Philosophe off to spend several years
shoveling manure--so that now perhaps he is a successful businessman  in the
new China--running  a huge fertilizer empire--)

in Italy there is a massive revival of Il Duce and the Glories of Italian
Fascism--the demands to force al the "nomad" peoples out--the Gypsies and
illegal immigrants and refugees--groups re-donning the old Black Shirts
garb--the old songs being sung again--

the USA continually  moves towards an ever more Corporate-State fascism as
Mussolini thought of it--

The President is basically a snap of the finger under the new laws passed
with such alacrity and carelessness since 9/11 from declaring martial law
and suddenly rounding up great lists of persons--

I remember in Jr High School having the Little Red Book with the old plastic
red cover-and also those volumes of Mao's poetry then kicking around--

little books also--from china--
the Cultural Revolution wasn't so surprising coming from a poet-party
leader--
who had grown up in a peasant family--

it is amazing to read Badiou's versions of Mao and Maoism--
like being in a weird time warp

i think a lot of Mao's ideas and actions are better understood via reading
of Macchiavelli--

"Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" for example--a work of genius!!
the flowers come forth and blooming show themselves-
and then the grim reaper knows where to cut them down

shades of the Italian Renaissance as well as Sicilian "Political" Thought
lurking about among the destructions of the old Chinese culture--
further ensuring the enshrinement of the Leader--

while other countries and their leaders quaked before "rebellious
youth"--Mao himself created a rebellion for rebellious youth--and used it
for his own ends--

he was "on the side of" the young!!
as he had himself basically "created them"--"called them into being"--

maybe there will also be an Anthology of French Poetry According to Pol
Pot--
 an avid poetry reader whose favorite was Verlaine--

and a new updated edition of Menachem Begin's classic work on Terrorism--
The Revolt--with a forward by one of the old Al Queda crew who used it for
their early training camps--

perhaps the Lee Harvey Oswald Edition of Basic Marxist-Leninist Writings--

as well as choice selections made by John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzalez
from the books on democracy and Law by various American politicians,
Presidents and their advisors--

When Oliver North--not to mention that other Historian, Oliver Stone-- is
the Narrator and expert for Fox's History series--
you know the Twilight Zone has begun to be considered the Norm--

Watching the speeches yesterday it dawned on me that the USA may be the
first country to elect a Black President who has to keep swearing eternal
allegiance to an Apartheid Regime in another country--

What kind of "change" is that supposed to be?
Is the USA experiencing a new era of re-colonizination--at the same time
that it attempts to maintain its shaky grasp on being an Imperial Power?--
it's like the merry go round scene in Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train
which was shot with the camera zooming in as it dollied out at the same
time--
moving in--as it moved out--
creating a very disorientating effect--

to move forward and backward at the same time--
in a Cinema of Catharsis--
 a merry go round soon to crash---

Yeah, seems weird, but if you visit China, you will find not only the big portrait of Mao in front of the Forbidden City, but also in Wuhan, a large rock with a copy of some of his elegant calligraphy, and citations of his poetry carved into stones in many places.

Have you seen the cook book, "Blow jobs of US presidents"? :((JFK and others)).

But that's nothing like Ms Switaj's claim, which is way more straightforward than that.
She says the ACT OF SELECTION is all that's needed, and no change in genre or
context is necessary.

This ruling is irrelevant to Ms Switaj's claim, which is a litcrit claim, not a legal one. The
litcrit claim is obviously ludicrous on the face of it, since no one is really going to claim
in the real world what Ms Switaj pretends to claim when she says

"By selecting texts through acts of plagiarism, you fundamentally alter them."

Ms Switaj's claim here is that the very act of selection is the means that alters the
poems so fundamentally that Ms Switaj's poems would actually be someone else's if
someone else put his or her name on them. Her position seems to be that there can
be no such thing as plagiarism, because the very act of selection from among all other
possible poems to copy is an act of creation as original as writing the poems in the first
place. Ms Switaj leaves no room for legal quibbles: she says that the act of putting
someone else's name on her poems would "fundamentally alter" them. So on litcrit
grounds, and on moral grounds, Ms Switaj leaves herself no room to sue.

I've always wished to test the "No shoes No shirt No service" sign by entering the
premises clad in only shoes and a shirt, but I've never had the nerve or the bail money.
Ms Switaj's declaration creates a similar desire, to simply take her poems, create
"MarcusBalesPoems.com", and post them as "by Marcus Bales" -- but though I have
the nerve in this case, I still don't have the money. So another postmodernist piece of
cant will stagger on, ugly, useless, and dumb.

Marcus

Jim,

I had see the Kandinsky series as individual, single pieces before. This
time, when I opened the site, the images followed each other in very quick
successions, creating rhythms, waves, etc. To me, seeing the images in this
dynamic way is much more interesting. It brings out the thought pattern, if
there is any, the instinct behind the selection of the algorithm which
created the sequence. Speed may may make an invisible pattern visible, once
again, if there is any.

I am referring to some later work by Brackage, such as, Eye Myth, Mothlight,
Glaze of Cathexis (particularly this one), The Dante Quartets. In Glaze of
Cathexis, light exists as a separate dimension from color, hangs around.
It's really wierd and wonderful. In this film, Brackage says, he is trying
to register the most detailed picture of the shifts of light in nature. Of
course, unless I am very mistaken, there is no light in the digital. Where
is the sun in the digital?

The other three, Eye Myth, Mothlight and The Dante Quartet, consist of
acrylic hand painted film frames, at a furious pace, following each other,
creating movements similar to what happens in you piece, *as a slide show*.

At one time I wondered, if you Kandinsky sequences consist an essay, a
meditation on Kandinsky's colors, rather than a means of using or
reproducing them through the means the computer gives you? What do you
think? To me, the former alternative would be the more interesting. Of
course, you may not be doing any of it.

Ciao,

Murat

I think you're half right. You should do all those things. But I also think=
 that you could not possibly understand the sonnet form, no matter how much=
 you studied it, unless you learned how to write at least a passable sonnet=
.. The same with various other forms. The same with rhythm, rhyme, and patte=
rns. If I could recommend the perfect set of studies for a poet, I would re=
commend studying the artform's history, learning how to write in each of th=
e forms, prosody, morphology, grammar, semantics/semiotics, rhetoric, music=
, etymology, linguistics, cognitive science, poetics, and theory. =0A=0A=0A=

              Vol. 2 =?Windows-1252?Q?=97_?= Call for Work
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=Windows-1252

Thought I'd forward this to the Poetics list:

*****

Hi, Here's a big call: Please, pass this along!

Electronic Literature Collection, Vol. 2 — Call for Work

The Electronic Literature Organization seeks submissions for the
Electronic Literature Collection, volume 2. We invite the submission
of literary works that take advantage of the capabilities and contexts
provided by the computer. Works will be accepted from June 1 to
September 30, 2008. Up to three works per author will be considered;
previously published works will be considered.

The Electronic Literature Collection is a biannual publication of
current and older electronic literature in a form suitable for
individual, public library, and classroom use. Volume 1, presently
available both online (http://collection.eliterature.org) and as a
packaged, cross-platform CD-ROM, has been used in dozens of courses at
universities in the United States and internationally, and has been
widely reviewed in the United States and Europe. It is also available
as a CD-ROM insert with N. Katherine Hayles' full-length study,
Electronic Literature: New Horizons for the Literary (University of
Notre Dame Press, 2008).

Volume 2, comprising approximately 50 works, will likewise be
available online, and as a cross-platform DVD in a case appropriate
for library processing, marking, and distribution. The contents of the
Collection are offered under a Creative Commons license so that
libraries and educational institutions will be allowed to duplicate
and install works and individuals will be free to share the disc with
others.

The editorial collective for the second volume of the Electronic
Literature Collection, to be published in 2009, is Laura Borràs
Castanyer, Talan Memmott, Rita Raley and Brian Kim Stefans. This
collective will review the submitted work and select pieces for the
Collection.

Literary quality will be the chief criterion for selection of works.
Other aspects considered will include innovative use of electronic
techniques, quality and navigability of interface, and adequate
representation of the diverse forms of electronic literature in the
collection as a whole. For volume 2, we are considering works of
electronic literature in video.

Works submitted should function on both Macintosh OS X (10.5) and
Windows Vista. Works should function without requiring users to
purchase or install additional software. Submissions may require
software that is typically pre-installed on contemporary computers,
such as a web browser, and are allowed to use the current versions of
the most common plugins.

To have a work considered, all the authors of the work must agree that
if their work is published in the Collection, they will license it
under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0
License, which will permit others to copy and freely redistribute the
work, provided the work is attributed to its authors, that it is
redistributed non-commercially, and that it is not used in the
creation of derivative works. No other limitation is made regarding
the author's use of any work submitted or accepted.

To submit a work, prepare a plain text file with the following information:

    * The title of the work.
    * The names and email addresses of all authors and contributors of the
work.
    * The URL where you are going to make your .zip file available for
us to download. The editorial collective will not publish the address
of this file.
    * A short description of the work — less than 200 words in length.
    * Any instructions required to operate the work.
    * The date the work was first distributed or published, or
"unpublished" if it has not yet been made available to the public.



Prepare a .zip archive including the work in its entirety. Include the
text file at the top level of this archive, and name it
"submisson.txt".

Upload the .zip file to a web server so that it is available at the
specified location. Place all of the text in the "submisson.txt" file
in the body of an email and send it to elc2.elo@gmail.com with the
name of the piece being submitted included in the subject line.

The Electronic Literature Collection is supported by institutional
partners including: Brown University, Literary Arts Program; Center
for Program in Contemporary Writing at the University of Pennsylvania;
Duke University, Program in Literature; Hermeneia at the Open
University of Catalonia; Maryland Institute for Technology in the
Humanities; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Program in Writing
and Humanistic Studies; nt2; Pomona College, Media Studies Program;
UCSB, Department of English; University of Bergen, Department of
Literary, Linguistic, and Aesthetic Studies, Program in Digital
Culture; University of Dundee, School of Humanities.

Institutional sponsorship opportunities are still available. If your
organization or academic department is interested in more information,
please contact helen DeVinney, Managing Director of the ELO, at
hdevinney@gmail.com.

The fact is Bob Perelman is wrong.

When Jessica Smith asked me to help gather poets for an anthology she wanted
to put together of younger poets it was one of those times where I got to
SEE a list, a running list of names which brought poems and faces to mind,
and it was TERRIFIC being able to hear/see/do that!

There really is NOT another time in history's past I would trade with this
one, for poetry's sake.

But I keep getting e-mails from people watching the video because, as one
person wrote the other day, "I had to see it for myself because I couldn't
imagine Bob saying such a thing.  But he sure did!"

It was a cranky Bob Perelman moment maybe, but wrong nontheless, VERY WRONG!

AND I BELIEVE WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVE HIM WRONG!

Marcus,
There's no reason to have to put your money where your mouth is.
There are plenty of free hosting services. Hop on over to blogger or
another of them, and have at it. Or are you also guilty of "cant"? JP

 Governor Patterson opened a phone line to determine how much support there is for his directive to recognize all legal same-sex marriages from other states and countries.

I just called and it’s really easy and it took under 5 seconds.

You call 518.474.8390 and say you support the governor's directive.

The lady who answers the phone is really nice.  She'll ask you for your zip code and wish you a good day.

Please take five seconds to voice your support!

518-474-8390 -- "I support the Governor's directive to support same-sex marriage!"

Oh my god, this is so sad...

=20

"Satisfied that they had completed in full their experiment, the
scientists,
after entering this last non-distance traveled as the final measurement
in
the log book--
=20
wrote out their conclusion based on all the evidence they had gathered:
=20

"Frogs with no legs can't hear"

=20

This Froggie story, David, Great story!  Reminds me of time my family
and I were at my parents' friends' house in Fairport (then, to my mind,
"the suburbs," versus "small town" that I was used to).  Anyway, I was
about 8-9-10-11-12, and fairly sensitive about certain things.  I was
playing with the children my own age there.  We went across the street,
and the kids across the street had a poor little toad, or frog, in the
driveway.  They took their bikes and started driving their bikes over
the poor little toad.  Of course, they "smushed" it and killed it and
splattered it insides out, and it was brutal and painful. =20

=20

Naturally, I felt so terrible for the poor little toad.  The spectacle
horrified me, and I hated those kids.

=20

"Naturally?"  What IS "natural" here?  My budding compassion or their
heinous cruelty?  I suppose both, but the real ANSWER, then, is that
it's either my values or theirs, and Fuck asking whether one is
"natural" or not.

=20

Blah blah blah...  I hate the scientists of your story, too, as you do,
of course, too.  And the same with "some" EXPERIMENTAL poetries, and at
moments briefly, their poet producers, including myself, at times -
whose "experiments" aim at only one thing, the "success" that, as Nick
Piombino's Otto Rank explains, is illusory, or, Unconsciously, a dead
end. =20

=20

And to what END?  Loss of Hearing?  And Then What, as that would be
almost an end of Life and/or interest in Creating, anyhow, right?  Blah
blah blah, I'm starting to ramble (as usual, Ha!)

=20

One other thing, though: One time my therapist/analyst observed (this
was about 12-15 years ago) that my "Creativity" was in my Golfing.
I.e., she saw my Golfing (and my obvious obsession with it) as the
source or "playing" field of my "creativity."   Hmmmm, this observation
of hers has always made me lament that "I'll never get better," that no
matter how hard I "work on my game," I'll always keep Failing on the
links and getting "disappointed."  Which may be True...  Shoot!  Damn! =20

=20

Oh, another thing - Michael Murphy, the founder of the Esalen Institute
out at Big Sur, California, had one of the "characters" (I think Shivas
Irons, the wise one) in his book _Golf in the Kingdom_ remark that we
never "improve" or that we can never really "improve," and/or that that
quest is misguided or nonproductive.  The point (or at least one of the
points) of that notion, I think, is that (1)we're already "perfect" just
the way we are, or the notion of "perfecting" ourselves is silly; (2)it
isn't "improvement" that our psyches really seek, or there is no such
thing as "improvement," or what we Really, Really seek is optimal
immersion in the moment, and Out Of Our Egos, and into what we ARE (or
the greater Depths of WHAT WE ARE, CAN BE, ummm, d-o-i-n-g, er, is that
BEING, Not doing; (3)we should "let go" of the notion that we need or
require "improvement," or that focusing on that notion splits us up
between Person imagining concept of Improvement and Person having
demands to improve thrust upon himself/herself.

=20

Ditto, "success" and "failure" as poet, or in Writing, etc.  Isn't the
act, or engagement in, Writing the REAL thing, the thing that one really
wants?  Okay, yeah, some other sorts of things, too, what would
"success" OR "failure" be for this person and what would they be for
that person?  And to what degree does honest concern about one's
(presumedly very personal) sense of "success" OR "failure" aid one in
engaging one's own truest and most "rewarding" actualization of writing
potential?  Blah blah blah, I'm really all over the place now and
starting to get bored with these ramblings... =20

=20

Steve  :-)  =20

If you were to reframe Elizabeth Switaj's poems you would be putting
your own spin on them. They would have a different significance and ask
different questions. Your original question "Would her poems be mine?"
implies this new significance. I'm not familiar with Elizabeth Switaj's
poems, but--either in a new light or to a new degree--you would be
raising questions about what it means for a poem "to be yours." I think
you (or one) should get credit for raising such questions.

We should maintain a distinction between plagiarism and appropriation.
If you did have enough money to appropriate/plagiarize Switaj's work you
would have to decide whether to leave the "by Elizabeth Switaj" line on
the poems. Whether you left her name on the poems would determine the
distinction between plagiarism and appropriation, and moreover it would
be one of the many choices you would have to make while you did your
work. Selection, as Switaj says is one of these choices, and is no
different than the choices any artist goes through when creating a work
of art.

No one here, yet, has claimed that this would be an interesting
experiment. Similar projects have been done before... Charles
Bernstein's Kenneth Goldsmith's Weather and Sherrie Levine's After
Edward Weston. To me, it seems silly to maintain that appropriating or
plagiarizing a work of art does not change it. If the new appropriation
is interesting or enlightening the new artist should get credit.

In your case of appropriating Elizabeth Switaj, I think the motivation
behind the selection is pretty clear. But say you were to appropriate
her work of art to prove that appropriation does not indeed make her
work yours. Would this example of appropriation that disproves
appropriation not have a new significance? Would it not seem to be
contradicting itself?

Of course, my "claim" was only in response to one particular poet's use of
plagiarism and selection, but it's convenient to ignore that so that you can
argue against a broader case, isn't it Marcus? Honestly, I wouldn't bother
arguing with you, since I know from experience that your only interest is in
believing yourself to be the victor against the evils of postmodernism or

I'm afraid that I can't tell you precisely. It is, by its very nature, an

the benefit of the doubt to the artist. Giving such doubt is, to my mind,
useful and beautiful. If it is mute, I do not mind, since quiet has its
place (and I am not fond of ableist language).

Give me a list of contemporary poets to read that you don't think all sounds the same.

I wouldn't trade this time in history for any other, ether -- primarily because we have gone through Modernism and Postmodernism, having been informed and educated by them, are beginning to reject their worst elements, combining their best with the past, and beginning to move into far better poetry. At least, the best poets are doing that.

The fact is Bob Perelman is wrong.

When Jessica Smith asked me to help gather poets for an anthology she wanted
to put together of younger poets it was one of those times where I got to
SEE a list, a running list of names which brought poems and faces to mind,
and it was TERRIFIC being able to hear/see/do that!

There really is NOT another time in history's past I would trade with this
one, for poetry's sake.

But I keep getting e-mails from people watching the video because, as one
person wrote the other day, "I had to see it for myself because I couldn't
imagine Bob saying such a thing.  But he sure did!"

It was a cranky Bob Perelman moment maybe, but wrong nontheless, VERY WRONG!

AND I BELIEVE WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVE HIM WRONG!

subverting the lyric: essays
rob mclennan
Toronto: ECW Press, 2008

My book of literary essays is finally out. Here's information from the
publisher's catalogue:

	One of the most prolific and engaged book reviewers in Canada over the
past fifteen years, Ottawa writer rob mclennan has slowly been moving into
longer forms, producing essays on the works of such diverse Canadian
writers as George Bowering, Jon Paul Fiorentino, jwcurry, Margaret
Christakos, and Barry McKinnon.

	subverting the lyric: essays works through mclennans years of writing,
thinking, and blogging through literature, as reader, writer, performer,
editor, critic, reviewer, and just plain fan of the art. In these fifteen
pieces, mclennan writes about travel, Canadian poets in general  and some
very specifically  as well as his own investigations of the writers craft.
Together, they remap our literary and linguistic landscape, the contours,
rifts, subductions, tectonic plates of the medium in which we exist,
inscribing a poetics of geography, process, and culture that is at once
strikingly new and refreshingly communal. The breadth of mclennans take on
Canadian poetry, alone, is remarkable: his ability to reconcile the
concerns, successes, and failures of both the mainstream and the fringe of
our literature urges  and begins  a critical overhaul thats been long overdue.

table of contents:
1. Dubliners: Irish Utaniki
2. Not Exactly Two Cents' Worth: jwcurry's 1cent
3. What's Love Got to Do with It? Margaret Christakos' wipe.under.a.love

4. Train Journal: Vancouver  Toronto
5. A Life Built Up in Poems: Intersections with Some of George Bowering's
Lines
6. Yes, I Have Published a Lot of Stuff: A Dozen Reasons Why I Will Not
Apologize: A Schizophrenic Text for a Talk I Will Probably Not Follow
7. Tads: An Appreciation
8. Sex at Thirty-One, Thirty-Eight, Forty-Five, Fifty-Two, et cetera
9. A Displacement in Reading: Meredith Quartermain's The Eye-Shift of
Surface and Other Writing
10. Jon Paul Fiorentino's Transcona, Winnipeg, and the Poetics of Failure
11. The Trouble with Normal: Breathing Fire 2, Pissing Ice, and the State
of Canadian Poetry
12. One Selected, Two Selected: Changing on the Fly: The Best Lyric Poems
of George Bowering
13. Some Notes on Narrative and the Long Poem: A Sequence of Sequences

Your voices are more cooperative than my voices, but why aren't you putting
the voices' names on the paper instead? Don't you know that they might sue?
(Or are they filthy postmodernists?)

for further information on the works and artists whose works are presented,
see the ennouncement following my comments-

(which of course one is free to "surf past"--!)


In 1962, George Maciunas declared Fluxus: "anti art, concept art,
automatism, Bruitism, brutalism, Dada/ism, concretism, Lettrism,
nihilism, indeterminacy=97Theatre, happenings, prose, poetry,
philosophy, plastic arts, music, cinema, dance." *


Many ideas and works here re Fluxus' Conceptual works, scores,
performances--
as noted below, Fluxus --and soon after Mail Art via the influence of
Maciunas and Latin American Visual Poets/Mail Artists like Clemente Padin
and Edgardo Antonio Vigo--are 45 years  ago involved with Conceptual
Poetry--

Unlike the "concepts of the conceptual" recently presented at the Symposium
on "Conceptual Poetry and its Others," the Fluxus, and Latin American and
Russian (Prigov for example) "concepts" are directed towards Performance,
action in time and space--
making of the scores and their performances a "mis-en-scene" of Baudelaire'=
s
definition of Modernism as the conjunction of the Eternal and the
Ephemeral--which leads to
what Maciunus calls Mail Art:  The Eternal Network--made of Ephemera and
Ephemeral actions--
inspired by Ray Johnson's response to the New York School as the New York
Correspondence School--
Art that is in circulation via postal addresses rather than gallery and
other Official art systems--

Many of the Conceptual Poetries which are being promoted at present in the
US seem to be oriented not towards performance and the ephemeral/eternal
conjunctions---but towards the production of "art/poetry objects"--

many aspects of Fluxus and Mail Art and the Conceptual Poetries related wit=
h
them--are based on an exchange of communications not confined to words--and
deliberately performed, "mailed" and exhibited without any exchange of
Capital--no money involved--

the ephemeral and the "anti-art" anti- capitalist aspects of its
circulations in an Eternal Network and/or via "actions, Happenings"--among
the principles of these Conceptual Poetries -emphasizes the presence and
performance of Time in the works--

this is Time, as Robert Smithson writes of the "time of the artist"--that
refuses to have a value put on it as an "art/poetry object" does--

the production of "art/poetry objects" which can have a value assigned to
them--is still involved with, perpetuates,  the imprisonment of the time of
the artist inside the object--

the object is "of value" rather than the Time of the artist--

the production by a Conceptual Poetry of objects, texts, data to be filed,
sorted, copied as "masses of words"--
with claims to impersonality, boredom, "unoriginality,"--takes on the
character of an aesthetization of the labor of others  who are employed, as
on an assembly  line or as a  "temp clerk" or "low skilled office worker"--
in the production of the texts-objects of "Conceptual Poetry" which are of =
a
"unique value" in the sense of being part of a "New Line" of Poetry items--

the "production time " of the artist is shifted to others--impersonal,
unoriginal, bored--
allowing the artist/poet to function instead as a PR spokesperson and
Consultant to Corporations in the creation of the work space as a
"productive" Conceptual Poetry aestheticization of labor--

workers, now no longer workers, but tinged with the glory of being
themselves aware of themselves as aestheticized  components in, participant=
s
in, their unoriginal, boring, impersonal  contributions to Conceptual
Poetry--

are turned into spectators of the spectacle of their own impersonal, boring
unoriginality, the producers of copies--of data masses for the filing
clerks,  the box packers,  the shipping departments--

a scene not unlike those near the ending of the original film of Invasion o=
f
the Body Snatchers--
with the now impersonal, unoriginal former humans in their new replicated
bodies functioning as drones for the loading and shipping of the pods which
are the coffins of the Person and the womb to the Impersonal body-double
which replaces, is substituted for, the now "unneeded, unwanted" Person--

the  new Conceptual Poetry workers will become happier, more
productive--less troublesome "members of the team"--and as everyone
knows--"there is no 'I' in 'Team' "--

just as--

*"There is nothing that bean bag chairs cannot do."*
this aestheticization of the corporate work place is put to use by Jenny
Holzer, who provides gigantic Holzer-designed bean bag chairs for the the
spectators inside the immense gallery-hall of the "Projections" exhibition
at Mass-Moma--

after all:

*"Bean bag chairs are becoming more and more widespread in the world of
business as research companies have declared them conducive to a more
productive environment than regular chairs."*
another perhaps not at all unrelated form of the New Extreme Experimental
American Poetry also makes use of the Conceptual Art/Poetry approach in the
"pacification" of "unruly workers" who can begin to find themselves at once
"more productive" and "more creative" and "happy" via "following the rules
and instructions" of Conceptual Poetry and Art--

although these unoriginal bored and impersonal workers have yet to be
provided with bean bag chairs--
nor the presence, heartwarming and inspiring, of the Conceptual Poet as
advocate and exhorter--

although perhaps "Colonel Vargas" may be seen as a form of Conceptual Poet
in creating the new Conceptual Poetry and Arts environments for "those who
do the Time" work of the artist in this New Extreme Experimental Conceptual
Poetry:

*Guantanamo Detainees Offered Classes and Movies


The Associated Press, interview with Army Col. Bruce Vargo *

Vargo, who commands the military's Joint Detention Group at Guantanamo, say=
s
it is important to give the detainees more to look forward to each day.

Some of the best-behaved detainees now get TV night, with DVDs of movies an=
d
TV shows shown on a high-definition Sony TV. A classroom in Camp 4,
designated for the most compliant detainees,

has metal desks and plastic chairs, (not yet the vaunted Holzer bean bag
chairs--)

although detainees remain shackled by the leg to the floor in class.

Language courses have begun in English, Arabic and Pashto, Vargo said in th=
e
interview last week. He intends to soon offer classes on subjects as divers=
e
as oceanography.

"If we can get them to focus on humanities programs, if we can get them to
focus on recreation, then their sole focus is not going to be on the guard
force," Vargo said. "It is my thought that if they are focused on those
things, then the level of assaults and things of that nature will go down."
Conceptual Poetry and Art as a pacifier of labor unrest in the creation of
new environments, new ways of training the workers to see themselves as
simultaneously spectators and the "subjects producing the spectacle"--

(their own body doubles--watching themselves watching each other--"from the
outside" as it were?--a reproduction of doubleness by reflections in each
other's eyes--proliferations  as the copying of oneself as a copy which
copies its copy of the copy which was copied ----)

To convince subjects that their boring, impersonal, unoriginal Time spent i=
n
the production of other's "objects of value" and "security" and Conceptual
Poetry texts, Conceptual Art "receptions"--
is in fact "a service"--
which is not entirely "unhappy"--

to make easier and more palatable--bean bag comfortable--the doing of Time-=
-

Is this not a situation in which the Conceptual Author is indeed the one
with the Authority to be The Authority----is indeed The Authority -
the Foreman the Director, the Boss--El Jefe, El Patron, El General--so to
speak --of a cell block, a gallery space, a corporate work space--a factory
floor--a class room--
in which the inmates, workers, students, junior executives, lower rank
soldiers and guards, the  "subjugated spectators" of "Projections"----
by being "sold on" their Conceptual Poetry and Art  roles as unoriginal,
impersonal, boring "Lifers"--
are completely pacified--
and then
"allowed to be the producers of their own meanings"--
which now being "boring, unoriginal, impersonal"--
are the meanings which belong to the Authorities--
and are controlled by them,
 despite the mocking "generosity" of "allowing them the production of their
own meanings"
all the impersonal boring unoriginal ones are doing is copying--
the works of the Author, the Artist--

who in fact they might even be the proliferating body doubles of--

Now it is not the Poet or Artist who is imprisoned in the Poem or Art
Object--
no--
it is the masses of boring impersonal unoriginal drones
producing/reproducing the works of the Poet and the Artist--
worker-prisoners--
"occupied" by the directives of the consultants and promoters who create
Poetry and Art for the pleasure of the Corporate -State Sponsors--
by aesthetizing the de-humanized boring unoriginal impersonal Time and
bodies they control and in effect own--
as "works of Conceptual Poetry, of Conceptual Art"--

"There is nothing that bean bag chairs cannot do."

In 1962, George Maciunas declared Fluxus: "anti art, concept art,
automatism, Bruitism, brutalism, Dada/ism, concretism, Lettrism,
nihilism, indeterminacy=97Theatre, happenings, prose, poetry,
philosophy, plastic arts, music, cinema, dance." *

Fluxus Scores and Instructions, The Transformative Years: "Make a
salad." looks at the armature of the movement to think about the
function of scores - what they are, how they work, what they lead
to=85. Some are scores in the traditional musical sense, some are
instructions for events or performance, some describe set-ups for
situations or installations, and some are the work itself - that is, the
concept.

We invite visitors to come into contact with material that has all too
long been unknown to the public, hidden away like the secret recipes of
chefs or grandmothers. Fluxus is often described in a two-dimensional
way, as a movement of repetitive gestural performance - leaving the
extraordinary range and conceptual framework of Fluxus, for the most
part, unacknowledged.

"Make a salad." brings viewers close to the actual scores, to
read and interpret them for themselves, to take ideas away from the
museum and try them out on their own, in the privacy of their homes or
in public places. Most of the scores and instructions are complete
original manuscripts or the earliest printed versions of the works.
There are also performances of scores recorded in photographs and
realizations presented in other forms, alongside scratchy audio from the
1960s and blurry films of early Fluxus performances. The exhibition will
also include germinal pre-Fluxus scores by George Brecht, John Cage,
Marcel Duchamp, Yves Klein, Walter de Maria, Yoko Ono, Karlheinz
Stockhausen, and La Monte Young.

The exhibition will include work by: Bengt af Klintberg, Eric Andersen,
Arman, Ay-O, Joseph Beuys, Michael von Biel, George Brecht, Sylvano
Bussotti, John Cage Giuseppe Chiari, Henning Christiansen, Philip
Corner, Robin Crozier, Walter de Maria, Willem de Ridder, Marcel
Duchamp, Nye Ffarrabas, Robert Filliou, Albert M. Fine, Fluxus
Collective, Hi Red Center, Geoff Hendricks, Dick Higgins, Toshi
Ichiyanagi, Terry Jennings, Yves Klein, Milan Knizak, Alison Knowles,
Addi K=F8pcke, Takehisa Kosugi, Shigeko Kubota, Gy=F6rgi Ligeti,
Jackson Mac Low, George Maciunas, Yoriaki Matsudaira, Pierre Mercure,
Heinz-Klaus Metzger, Yoko Ono, Robin Page, Nam June Paik, Benjamin
Patterson, James Riddle, Terry Riley, Tomas Schmit, Dieter Schnebel,
Paul Sharits, Mieko Shiomi, Daniel Spoerri, Karlheinz Stockhausen, James
Tenney, Yasunao Tone, Ben Vautier, Wolf Vostell, Robert Watts, Emmett
Williams, La Monte Young, George Yuasa and Marian Zazeela.

The exhibition catalogue includes new, original texts by Eric Andersen,
Anna Dezeuze, Letty Eisenhauer, Yoko Ono, and Susanne Rennert, as well
essays by Marianne Bech and Jon Hendricks. La Monte Young has written a
separate text, to be published in conjunction with the exhibition.

The exhibition is curated by Jon Hendricks, with Marianne Bech and Media
Farzin.

"Make a salad." is the score for Alison Knowles'
Proposition, first performed during the Festival of Misfits, ICA London,
October 24, 1962.

* George Maciunas, "Fluxus Brochure Prospectus," was distributed
during the first Fluxus concert, June 9, 1962, "Kleinen
Sommerfest/`Apr=E8s John Cage'," in Wuppertal, West
Germany.

Fluxus Scores and Instructions, The Transformative Years: "Make a
salad." is supported by Danish Arts Council Committee for
International Visual Art, the Oticon Foundation, the Augustinus
Foundation, The City of Roskilde and Manden med Cameraet.

Taping Ray
by Nicholas Maravell

I attended a friend's bad taste theme party one evening during the
winter of 1982. Thinking there might be something interesting
happening I lugged along a dinosaur of a reel-to-reel video recorder.
Unfortunately, I never could get the old machine to work as the night
was cold and it had stayed in my car too long. It was at this party
that I met Ray Johnson.

Creative party favors were given out to everyone there and in my
surprise package were small rolls of silver adhesive tape. At some
point after meeting Ray, it seemed to me the correct thing to do was
to wrap adhesive tape around him. I also wrapped tape around myself
and several of the other guests. While video taping didn't occur that
night, I was able to adhesive tape Ray.

The first time I did successfully video record Ray was five years
later in 1987. He and I had run into each other at a New Year's Party
and, as always, it was so interesting to talk with him. Realizing that
these moments would come and go I mentioned that I had recently
purchased some better quality video equipment. I then asked Ray if he
would be interested in being recorded, to which he agreed.

A friend, Nadine Palumbo, helped with the first video tapings
scheduled just days later at Hofstra University where I was then
teaching. Ray arrived with a cardboard box full of artwork and I
brought the video equipment which included a television monitor that
we kept on live throughout the recordings. Drawings and collages were
documented first, and in no time, we realized what more could be done
with video based upon seeing Ray on the screen.

During the year and a half that followed, Ray organized fifteen more
video sessions. For these meetings, he and I would go to specific
locations pertinent to the nature of each video. Ray always had
something in mind to tape and we were always open to allowing whatever
else might happen to be included as part of the recordings.

With great care I tried to take images of him that accurately showed
him as he wished to be recorded.

Not long after Ray's death, public interest in these videos began to
develop as I had a collection of the few recordings of him to exist.
An edited Sampler tape, a compilation sampling of all of my video
material, was presented at Ray's Memorial at the Friends Meeting House
in Manhattan, N.Y. on April 29, 1995. The Sampler was then shown at
Jonas Mekas' Anthology Film Archives two months later on June 17 and
18, 1995. In addition, several minutes were continuously played at
Ray's 1999 Whitney Retrospective. Over four minutes of these videos
were included in the 2003 Andrew Moore and John Walter documentary
film "How to Draw a Bunny". After this experience, my friend Bob
Rodger suggested we make available the entire seven plus hour video
collection to help give a more complete sense of Ray's presence.

This idea motivated me to organize the original VHS tapes I had of Ray
by importing them into a computer. Once there, I added subtle fade
ins, fade outs, and informative titles that included the dates and
locations of each recording. Digitizing the material also made it
possible for me to clean up the audio and picture quality. I was
pleased that I could do all of these video procedures myself as I felt
it my responsibility to preserve the artistic nature of what I had
recorded with Ray. The next step was to copy everything to dvds and
make them available through the website that Bob so brilliantly
created. Without Bob Rodger's great help and vision, the entirety of
these recordings would still be relatively unknown.

A failed poet is someone who thinks he or she is a failed poet, probably because some boor or inconsiderate, self-centered elder has told him or he that she has failed.&nbsp; Regards, Tom Savage

Please, let's move on,  this is beyond a joke! Can't we discuss the state of
the universe and how poetry can move it on a little.  Don't forget the
influence of a few well chosen  words on the evolution of mankind - I thionk
Bob Perelman fades into insignificance in the face of this, don't forget
that poetry can be lifechanging - Basho: "For a while I yearned for earthly
success, but poetry thwarted that, for a while I thought of enlightening my
foolishness, but poetry broke that off. Finally , without talent or skill I
simply follow along this one line". Humility and spontaneity are the key to
all this. Let's go for poetry pure and simple!  Have a good weekend.

Yes. The motion of the brush is evident in some of the animations, for
instance.

Someone wrote me that the series was too chopped up already to be able to
see how the images grew. And that's true; the sequences are screenshots
separated in time by a manual process, on my part, of taking a screenshot
when I figured it looked interesting and was different enough from the last
screenshot. The screenshots in a given series were not all necessarily done
during the same session, either, or with the same brush. The 'concept' (the
search string) is the same, though, when there is one. When there isn't,
such as in http://vispo.com/dbcinema/color1 , there's a 'concept' of a
different type; not a search string but an exploration of color and brush.
After I'd do a session, I'd review the screenshots and throw most of them
out.

I think it's interesting to be able to look at things in different ways; the
multi-perspectival, which is important to growth and maturity. You can look
at a series via the clickable thumbnails at, say,
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky2 . This focuses on the stills. Or you
can look at the series via a slideshow such  as
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky2/slideshow.htm (same series). I've
changed this so the slideshows have a 4 second image interval (though you
can select a different duration). This doesn't blank the screen between
successive screenshots but still focusses on the stills while introducing
more relation between them. Or you can look at a slidvid of the concatenated
series via, say, http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky2/slidvid.htm . The
image interval here is typically quite short, particularly after the first
pass through a series, and after a few cycles it moves on to the next
series. This focusses on the moving picture and also on an overview of all
the series together.

I expect it's been done, but imagine a form of cinema that's meant to be
viewed or 'read' in a variety of ways. Frame by frame, looking at the frames
as stills. And perhaps there are links and secret passageways at this level
of viewing that aren't accessible when it's speeded up. Perhaps I'll put
some of those in as they occur to me if they're worth it. documa. cinement.

I wonder if any of this is on ubu.com? I'll have a look. Thanks, Murat.

Same place as in painting and photography. Up in the sky.

Painting has its techniques concerning light. So does photography. So does
the digital.

The monitor is quite an interesting thing. The number of different colors it
can display dramatically outstrips the mechanical print process. Monitors
can display 2^32=4,294,967,296 different colors in 32-bit color. And they do
so via glowing. It's a bit like stained glass that way. One is 'painting
with light'.

In the dbCinema images, the brushes are 'masks'. Photoshop, say, uses the
notion of the 'mask'. A 'mask' reveals part of an image and hides other
parts. A mask is a greyscale image X. The black parts of X reveal some other
image Y. The white parts of X hide parts of Y. The grey parts of X reveal Y
at some opacity different from 0% and 100%. That's one way in which opacity
enters the picture. Opacity is also adjustable in dbCinema; that's another
level at which opacity enters the picture. Also, the brushes are made so
there are lots of gradations of opacity; that's important to the sort of 3D
dimension of some of them.

Also, as a dbCinema brush traverses a curved path, it may repeatedly paint
one pixel more times than another pixel just because of the path it's
traversing and the rotation of the brush itself and the change in the shape
of the brush (the brushes often are animated). Consequently, lines of
opacity and shading emerge in dbCinema.

Nature is total, encompassing. Thought, on a computer monitor, stares at you
from every pixel. All those engineers of color and electronics. Hard to get
them all to work for you.

Well, both. I haven't encountered any material, with the possible exception
of Klee, that I'm drawn to as much concerning using it with dbCinema as
Kandinsky's work. At first, it was just, you know, wow, this works great.
But over time, I've started to undertand it more. "Color is the keyboard,
the eyes are the hammer, the soul is the piano with the strings"
(Kandinsky). He writes about his ideas in a lively way. And it's an
elemental approach. Points, lines, curves, triangles, and so forth, a
geometrical approach. Which of course is also crucial in generative computer
art. The sun and the mind, creating some harmony there.

Thanks for checking it out, Murat!

be got here: http://ypolitapress.blogspot.com/search?updated-
max=2007-06-06T21%3A29%3A00-07%3A00

Rachel McKibbens and Marty McConnell are all over YouTube (they're
performance poets), here they are performing together: http://
www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ9zt5fUS00

Jeremy Richards's books Drowsy Samurai and Pushing Monks can be
purchased here:  http://jeremyrichards.googlepages.com/jeremyrichards-

And not to blow my own horn over much, but here's a sample of things
you can read and don't have to buy anything: http://www.blazevox.org/
08sp-jfq.pdf

and finally, another performance poet, Anis Mojgani: http://
www.youtube.com/watch?v=znIXyFh6dsI

There are lots of others. These are just people I kind of know who I
think are awesome. Plus me. I don't think they all sound alike.

Thought this might be of interest to those of you who are learning more
about China.

1- Police are now making surprise checks of flats in which foreigners
dwell
2- Foreigners are being investigated for making remarks "insensitive to
the feelings of Chinese people"=20
3- Visas for foreigners are now being denied or durations unusually
limited=20
4- Chinese troops have been entering India and there is concern about an
invasion following the olympics, something similar to China invasion of
India in the late 1960s
5- The Chinese govt issued a statement saying Tibet=92s living Buddhas
have been banned from reincarnation without permission from China.

On the road in Sikkim, India

who labels us as such we don't i'm caslled a post-beat poet a jazz poet
etc
everyone on this list has the balls to call themselves poets to begin

too much learning is as dangerous as too little
write a sonnet  write an epic right a wrong
ah the odyssey are we not all informed by that journey

for profiles named after a randomly-selected tag, and displays the
profile details for this person. I think of this work as a dynamic,
kinetic poem; as the words and images dance and collide, associations
are formed, and the result is a work that scans, appropriates and
recontextualizes the zeitgeist surrounding each tag.

Thought this might be of interest to those of you who are learning more
about China.

1- Police are now making surprise checks of flats in which foreigners
dwell
2- Foreigners are being investigated for making remarks "insensitive to
the feelings of Chinese people"=20
3- Visas for foreigners are now being denied or durations unusually
limited=20
4- Chinese troops have been entering India and there is concern about an
invasion following the olympics, something similar to China invasion of
India in the late 1960s
5- The Chinese govt issued a statement saying Tibet=92s living Buddhas
have been banned from reincarnation without permission from China.

Eras/sure

What we're doing produces (is the production of?) artifacts (processes?) -
video, audio files, live video and audio performance, online video and
audio performance, live performance, texts, programs, images - everything
in other words that doesn't rely on offline material construction on the
order of photographs, etchings, paintings, engravings, sculpture, instal-
lations, multiples, offline books. What we're doing relies on both process
and electronic transmission; the Access Grid works for example are proce-
sses resulting in various digital formats and copies but other- wise no
hard copy. What we're doing is scholarly to the extent that it examines
the self-body-image - not the image in terms of symptomologies or emotion-
al processes, etc., but the very inhabiting of the body itself - something
that it's almost impossible to quantify or describe, Levinas, Husserl,
Merleau-Ponty notwithstanding. The work reconfigures the very foundations,
backgrounding, of experience. What would a world be like within which
movement and memory structures were drawn out by the substitution of tan-
gent for sine, structures that were then redrawn in to the experiential?
We have no interest in display or aesthetics beyond that which tilts or
topples presuppositions. Our scholarship as applied to examination is
irreducible, irreproducible, irresistible, irregardless; our scholar
requires your presence, near or far, in relation to the camera, micro-
phone, screen, performance space, online node. What we're doing is neither
science nor psychology, but an intermingling which insists on the history,
memory, and inhabiting of the human or otherwise body. We will use any
available technology and performativity to arrive at the place of this
body, the place of mind, history, and memory. We will eliminate the
preposition 'of' in phrasing 'memory of,' 'history of,' 'psychology of,'
'philosophy of.' We will conjoin coupling into flux, striation, flow,
emission, spew. We will consider sources only as aftermath, and destina-
tions only as they disappear in the rearview mirror of the mind. We insist
that our knowledge is populist, open to everyone, that memory may be
seeing, that looking my be thinking, that observing may be philosophy,
that observing is always philosophy. We emphasize the look of the world is
its origin all the way down, that looking requires nothing whatsoever,
neither technology nor organ. We will dwell within breathing, breathe all
possible worlds, collapse them with a gentle insistence on continuous
withdrawal. We present artifacts and processes from the flattening of
these and other surfaces. We understand that artifacts are carapaces, that
a certain hardening always occurs in transmission, that hardening is never
the thingings or processings themselves, nor thingings or processings
otherwise. We neither consider this an aesthetics, nor an aesthetics of
withdrawal, not even a silence or silencing; instead we might murmur some-
thing about background once again, not even that, except under erasure. We
operate under erasure, our work is under erasure, always beyond the Pale,
always beneath consideration. Consideration is under erasure, everyone
operates as if the Pale has disappeared, thought is under erasure ...

Jim,

You can find all these films on DVD's, through netflix.

I think the etymology of "color" has the idea of "cover" under it, color
implying color?

Can a digital work (a prpcess) make mistakes?

Ciao,

Murat

When I sit down to write a poem, that's exactly what I do -- just write. Bu=
t of course I'm not just writing without all I've learned and internalized.=
 More, to use an writer's cliche, all good writing is rewriting. One must a=
lso always keep in mind what one is trying to accomplish with this particul=
ar poem I'm writing (Danto suggests that all art is a form of rhetoric), an=
d if it's going to be successful in doing what I want the poem to do. That =
means I do have to attend to what I understand about language, grammar, how=
 the brain works, etc. If I understand that poems with line breaks at aroun=
d 3 seconds long make them easier to remember (the short term memory slot b=
eing 3 seconds long), then I can use that knowledge for certain kinds of wo=
rks (like deciding to write a play in verse or not). If I understand that a=
 steady rhythm of some sort in a poem allows the poem to map onto the brain=
's rhythms better, and I want people to both enjoy the poem (that
 is, I want the poem to be for more people than just avant garde poets) and=
 to remember the poem, then I will want to choose to write my poem in a rhy=
thm of some sort. Knowledge of the effect of sound can help one to choose a=
 rhythm, because you can use that rhythm to create emphasis and thus influe=
nce how the line or overall poem should be interpreted. The musicality of t=
he poem too carries information (a kind of information many who are actuall=
y writing prose with line breaks lose). And if I want my work to carry mean=
ing, then I will have to have repetitions of words, sounds, etc., since we =
know that people attribute meaning to repeated elements. Knowing that peopl=
e attribute causality between lines, images  and sentences put together (Se=
ntence A, therefore, Sentence B) can allow us to understand the effect of p=
utting two unrelated lines together, and tighten up our language by leaving=
 out unnecessary "because's". =0A=0AAll this aside from the fact that the p=
oet really needs to know a lot about the world if he's going to write about=
 anything other than his barely understood inner world.=0A=0ATroy Camplin=

Roy, I think you miss the point then, sir.  THIS IS A CONVERSATION IN THIS
UNIVERSE!  And it's one that doesn't get talked about very often!

DO YOU REALIZE HOW MANY YOUNG POETS THESE DAYS ROY ARE IN WRITING PROGRAMS!?

We NEED, very much NEED young poets to EXPRESS how they feel when these
elder poets who instruct in such programs say such things.

IT'S A VERY GOOD THING, PLEASE SEE HOW AND WHERE THE MERITS OF THE
CONVERSATION FIT DIRECTLY INTO THE LARGER UNIVERSE!  (and university)

This is not just saying something stupid though Sarah.  In my original post
I tried to make clear that this was VERY MUCH part of a bigger
picture.  Bob's statement (which he LATER wanted to clean up as a joke) was
said with such ease that either HE MEANT IT, or, it's something that his
friends are saying when there are no younger poets around.

It's very important Sarah, this conversation, BECAUSE, Bob Perelman and his
friends spend a lot of time, and make a lot of money teaching younger poets.

If we want to talk about WHICH elder poets openly respect, encourage, even
champion younger poets, THAT'S EASY ENOUGH.  Ron Silliman spends A LOT OF
TIME reading the work of younger poets and writing about them and their
work.  We may not all AGREE with everything he says, but the fact is he
takes a lot of time and a lot of care to investigate, and he spends so much
time doing this that it would be very hard to believe that he would agree
with Perelman.  Otherwise Silliman would have given up doing so a long time
ago and just written about poets his age.

When Lyn Hejinian read at the Kelly Writers House a few years ago I
confronted her during the Q&A about allegations made through the Poetry
Project Newsletter, statements that THEY made claiming that SHE made about
how younger poets are not involved in being open against the war, not
involved in anti war protests and marches etc..  SHE seemed glad that I
brought it up and said quite openly that that issue of the Newsletter
irritated her because it was all taken out of context.  She then went on to
say that she has A LOT OF RESPECT for younger poets, you should try to find
that recording, up on PENNSOUND.

Charles Bernstein (sticking with the Perelman crowd) is one of the most
generous, active bodies in poetry in our time, hands down.  No one is
working harder at making poetry the center of the universe.

And I have a lot of respect for Mark, but I think he also missed the point
that Bob Perelman WAS confronted with what he said, right there and then, by
both Rothenberg and Filreis.  Rothenberg wanted to make it SUFFICIENTLY
CLEAR that Bob was NOT going to put those words in his mouth, did you watch
the video to see what I made clear with his NO NO NO NO NO, waving his arms
in the air?

THIS IS NOT ABOUT SLANDERING SOMEONE, you miss my point entirely Sarah.  I'm
talking about BOB saying something about a whole group of people INTO A
MICROPHONE!

He didn't say this on the bus, or over cheese and crackers, he CHOSE to say
this into a microphone for something HE KNEW was going to be saved on
digital file for the Internet for many years to come!

And by starting this conversation I'm trying to get US to talk about US
measured against that statement.

POETRY means everything to me, it's in my life every single day!  My closest
friends (most of them at least) also take poetry JUST as seriously as I do,
and I am not about to sit back while Bob Perelman who has received just
about every laurel there is to receive at this point smirks and makes some
NASTY JOKE about younger poets.

MOST SINCERELY,
CAConrad

  about China.

  1- Police are now making surprise checks of flats in which foreigners

  3- Visas for foreigners are now being denied or durations unusually

  4- Chinese troops have been entering India and there is concern about =
an
  invasion following the olympics, something similar to China invasion =

  India in the late 1960s
  5- The Chinese govt issued a statement saying Tibet's living Buddhas

SoundEye 12
a festival of the arts of the word

Cork, Ireland
July  3 - 6, 2008

Ireland's  premier festival of poetry, the avant-garde, and text-based
art and performance,  continues to grow in size and scope. This year,
the international group  of almost thirty poets visiting Cork City
include Kenneth Goldsmith, founder  of the cult website Ubuweb, who
will also give a presentation on electronic  curation, as well as Tom
Raworth, Tom Pickard, Alison Croggon and Catherine  Wagner.

The Alternative Cabaret will include a viola da gamba consort,
performance  from the London-based Bonney =96 Kruk =96 Lindsay =96 Robinson
axis, art-noise band KFDS, a twenty-minute opera, the ever-popular
Polskadots  and many more. New this year is an exhibition of
text-based art, with  work from Nissan Prize Winner, Dan Shipsides,
and from Maggie O'Sullivan  and Justin Katko. Add to this an Open Mike
session, transferred from a  regular slot in Providence, Rhode Island,
with MC Mair=E9ad Byrne,  and Cork can look forward to an exciting four
days of art, poetry and  exchange.

SoundEye happens between Thursday July 3rd (when the exhibition opens
in The Black Mariah gallery on Washington Street) and Sunday 6th. The
Firkin Crane will host most readings. The Alternative Cabaret will
kick  off at 8.30 p.m. in The Other Place, Paradise Place (between
Washington  Street and North Main Street) on the 4th of July.

The Quarterly Conversation--Issue 12

http://www.quarterlyconversation.com/current-issue.html

Issue 12 of The Quarterly Conversation published Monday, June 2.

Issue 12 is headlined by an essay on Borges's mentor, Macedonio =
Fernandez. Little-known among English-speakers, Fernandez is considered =
by many Latin American critics to be the major influence on Borges's =
writing. The essay relates the two men's long-standing friendship and =
teases out the connections between Fernandez's writings and Borges's. =
The essay also discusses Fernandez's highly experimental novel, Museo de =
la Novela de la Eterna, which will be published in English by Open =
Letter in 2009.

Read the essay: The Man Who Invented Borges

Issue 12 also has an essay on the diaries of Simone de Beauvoir, the =
second volume of which has just been published in France. It covers the =
years leading up to Beauvoir's meeting of Sartre, demonstrating that =
many of her philosophical and feminist ideas were already developing =
before the two met. It also discusses Beauvoir's adolescent years, early =
influences and mentors, and her evolving relationship with her family.

In addition, there is:
an interview with the French translator of Pynchon, Gass, Gaddis, and =
Vollmann
Ravi Shankar on post-postmodern poetry
the low-down on the print-on-demand industry from a longstanding author =
who has chosen to go POD-only
an essay on Donald Barthelme
and 7 reviews of new fiction, including work from Roberto Bolano, FC2, =
and Antonio Lobo Antunes
The Quarterly Conversation is a journal primarily of literary criticism. =
It publishes four times per year, usually with 10 - 15 reviews and 5 =
features. For any inquiries or comments, please contact me at this email =
address.

I am hosting a poet's retreat in Hot Springs, NC
at Sunnybank JULY 11-13th 2008
  I have mentioned to you in the past -


In solidarity with poets who need a retreat
 - I am changing it from a workshop exclusively led by me

to a more collective retreat of poetic enjoyment - I will have plenty of info and ballads and guests and such lined up as well as an opportunity to perform in our new space - please forward to anyone you think might be interested -


Here's the description:


In the Laurels:  Living the Poets Life

     Poetry can be a daily activity that can inform the ways we live, and can serve as a lens with which to engage with others and with larger world issues.  This weekend poetry retreat will mindfully integrate reading and writing poetry into daily activities at Sunnybank Inn and around the Hot Springs area.  There will be time for private writing as well as group workshops and activities, such as a mountaintop poetry walk along a portion of the Appalachian trail, incorporating observations of the natural and human world into new poems.
      Sunnybank has a long poetic history and atmosphere:  English folklorist Cecil Sharp in 1916 collected ballads in the "Laurel Country."  Jane Gentry who supplied many of the songs lived here.  We will work with the ballad form, and explore the relationship between the traditional ballads and writing new poems using traditional materials.
       We will focus on poetry which ranges from the contemplative to celebratory, traditional and contemporary, and from local and world traditions. We will draw inspiration from the being together in the atmosphere of this retreat home, which cultivates contemplation and serves as a meeting place free from hectic aspects of the modern world.  Collective dinners, a library throughout the house, a music room and that each guest room is supplied with a volume of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, and the Tao de Ching are examples of the spirit cultivated here.
      There will be private time for writing as well as collaborative projects, and group workshops.
     For night practice, methods of incorporating dreamwork into our writing will be demonstrated.  In addition to daily sharing, we will have a chance to read or perform our favorite new pieces at the close of the weekend.
      No prior experience is necessary, just a willingness to be open to experimentation, to share some of what you write with others, and to be ready to listen to what we may learn from others' work and from the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains around us.

YOU ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS A BEAT POET. IS THIS A FAIR=20
CHARACTERIZATION?: INTERVIEW WITH CHARLES PLYMELL=20

INTERVIEW WITH CHARLES PLYMELL: A POET WHO REFUSES LABELS.

With Doug Holder


Recently I sent out an email asking poets what does it mean to be a =93fa=
iled=20
poet.=94 Poet A.D.Winans hooked me up with poet Charles Plymell who (tong=
ue-
in cheek) offered to teach a seminar in this arcane subject and requested=
 a=20
hefty paycheck, and or a stash of drugs in payment.

Charles Plymell is a poet and writer who is often overlooked for his invo=
lvement=20
with the BEAT literary scene in the 50=92s and 60=92s. Plymell, originall=
y from=20
Kansas City, moved from New York City in the early 60=92s, to San Francis=
co and=20
shared a house with Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady on Gough St in 1963.=20=

Plymell, although in the background to such BEAT figures as Jack Kerouac =
and=20
Allen Ginsberg, was very influential. Under his =93Cherry Valley=94 small=
 press he=20
published such Beat writers as William Burroughs, Robert Peters, and Herb=
ert=20
Huncke. Ginsberg credited Plymell as the first person to introduce him to=
 the=20
music of Bob Dylan.=20

Plymell had a huge influence on the underground comic scene, and printed =
the=20
first issue of ZAP COMIX on his printing press in San Francisco. Plymell =
said he=20
worked feverishly over this interview with his wife, the avant-garde publ=
isher,=20
and cofounder of =93Cherry Valley Editions=94, Pamela Beach, on a scorchi=
ng June=20
day.=20






YOU ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS A BEAT POET. IS THIS A FAIR=20
CHARACTERIZATION?

It beats not being known at all, I guess; therein lies the rub. Tag fame =
when=20
you can, or cast your mind about the shadows. Burroughs said he never=20
thought of himself as beat. He always knew the literate way to say things=
. I=20
never did, so I=92m always stuck in the semantic swamp. It is =93fair=94?=
 I suppose it=20
is, in a historic literary sense where labels serve as quick designations=
 when=20
they take on broader connotations toward social history. For instance, I =
was=20
reluctant to contribute to Kevin Ring=92s Beat Scene all these years beca=
use I=20
could never think of Bukowski, Fante and many others he publishes as beat=
;=20
but the broader brush, however thinly, feathers the label purposely, so t=
hat=92s=20
that. To argue for my reluctance would seem silly. But no, personally I h=
ate to=20
be eclipsed by a scene. As a fervent outsider, it is always a signal that=
 my=20
work has remained around the edges of a group. That is by my own design a=
s=20
well, though, I was always reluctant to jump into another=92s scene (for =
more=20
than a night).=20

YOU HAVE SAID THAT KANSAS CITY IN THE =9150'S WAS YOUR FAVORITE=20
SCENE, EVEN OVER THE HAIGHT IN THE 60's. WHY?

For many reasons my youth was spent seeing all the greats of jazz, race=20=

music, rhythm and blues across the tracks, and traditional songs by the g=
reats=20
at the honky tonks for a dollar cover. The youth of the Haight didn=92t h=
ave that=20
cultural education. We were also able to get all the Peyote we wanted and=
=20
had youthful rituals on the riverbanks. No one was aware of anything=20
happening except us, so there wasn=92t any trouble. When I write about my=
=20
long-time friend, Rapid Ronnie, alias Barbitol Bob reading me Pound in Zi=
p=92s Club=20
that was way before we had heard of the Beats. We were ignorant of the=20=

latest cultural phenomena of Life and Time, but we didn=92t need it. Our =
nights=20
were spent on Benzedrine and Boo, making the rounds of clubs with the ban=
d=20
members and club entertainers like Mickey Shaughnessy, the actor, making=20=

the rounds talking, laughing, goofing until breakfast or driving across t=
he=20
tracks to see and visit and smoke and drink with the likes of Fats Domino=
 in his=20
49 Caddy from New Orleans in a little club with a few people all night lo=
ng. We=20
had something peculiar to the Midwest that we got high on for days at a t=
ime,=20
bought at the drugstore that was much stronger than the amphetamines that=
=20
Kerouac used while writing. I have never heard it mentioned at all in oth=
er=20
canons of drugs and literature. Bob and I were in the Wichita jail togeth=
er as=20
high school dropouts and petty pill head gangsters, but we always read gr=
eat=20
literature and had the famous names in music always available to hang wit=
h at=20
Mrs. Dunbar=92s Barbeque. There are some things that are meant for place =
and=20
time, never to come that way again. We even studied Zen and the New=20
fucking Age!

I can remember the years and what I was doing by the cars I had. In 49=20=

though I was up in the Dakotas operating a caterpillar (Neal (Cassady) la=
ter=20
claimed part of that story for a riff) near the reservation and borrowed =
a =9148=20
Dodge from a friend of my father=92s that had to got back to Texas. There=
 was=20
no such thing as a driver=92s license at that time in that state so I dro=
ve it down=20
to Oklahoma and joined my mother who was working on an auto daredevil thr=
ill=20
show ramping over a row of cars and driving through a board wall of fire.=
..that=20
sort of thing. I had a new =9151 Chevy in San Antonio that I drove to Sou=
thern=20
California to stay for a while. Then back to Kansas and down to Guadalaja=
ra=20
and back and a trip to Baja for Bennies and Boo packing my 38 special and=
=20
then followed the rodeo and rode Brahma Bulls and bareback broncs. Worked=
=20
on the pipeline, then to Hollywood for a while and bought my =9153 Roadma=
ster=20
Buick there and went up to Oregon to work on a dynamite crew building a d=
am=20
on the Columbia River. I bought a tugboat to live on and named it =93Litt=
le=20
Toot.=94 Then traveled Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming with my sister who=20
worked the towns as a prostitute. Then to Kansas City, and Wichita for=20=

Peyote rituals and worked for the Santa Fe then back through Denver over=20=

the pass I had driven as a kid in my Mom=92s =9139 Buick, and back to San=
=20
Francisco. Those are but a few highlights of the years when I had new or=20=

fairly new cars that corresponded to my travels in those years. I met Nea=
l=20
in =9162 and that=92s when he read me some of his highlights from the boo=
k.=20
Understandably, I wasn=92t that enthralled, so he only read two or three=20=

passages. I liked to drive with him and take him to work on my motorcycle=
.=20

So, by the time I went back to San Francisco again (right turn north off =
the=20
Benzedrine Highway, Rt 66, my commute and Kerouac=92s discovery, in 1962;=
 I=20
was living on the first block up Ashbury off Haight St. A couple other fr=
iends=20
from Wichita and those they knew were there. Conner had a show at the=20
Batman Gallery, and Rapid Ronnie was living with his family in a =9152 Ch=
evy, I=20
worked as a printer and printed some stuff on the side. I made collages a=
nd=20
had a show at the Batman and made a couple of 16mm films, which were all=20=

the rage. They were in Ann Arbor Film Festival, through my Wichita friend=
s, we=20
had Sandoz LSD and later, Owsley. =93Acid=94 hadn=92t been coined. We als=
o had=20
pure Mescaline from a laboratory in England. Brautigan and I sat in a caf=
=E9 and=20
watched the neighborhood change. It had been an old Russian neighborhood=20=

with great cafes serving pirogues and good food=85unfortunately that all =
was to=20
be trashed, I reflected that the new comers didn=92t have much street sma=
rts=20
and most of them didn=92t have formal education as did the beats who had =
made=20
an earlier scene centered around City Lights and national attention=20
over =93fuck.=94 So I asked Brautigan what would become of them. He got r=
ight=20
into their trappings. Neal reminded me of the people I hung with in the 5=
0's=20
from Denver to K.C. I got along with him well, and later when Ginsberg=20=

returned from India in =9163, he and Neal shared the Gough St. flat with =
me. I=20
think Ginsberg knew Neal=92s wild side and saw me as a stabilizing force.=
 So I=92d=20
take Neal to work at a Goodyear tire shop on Van Ness on my motorcycle an=
d=20
go on to my job at the print shop like the squares of the 50's the young=20=

people now talk about. Well, with the circus in town, that didn=92t last =
long!

Someone just sent a notice that Bo Diddley died. He was from the old rhyt=
hm=20
and blues and race music I listened to in the 50's. He was one of many=20=

originals who didn=92t get his due, at least to the fullest. A snapshot a=
propos:=20
We were living a block or two from the Avalon Ballroom in a pad where we=20=

printed Zap and had nude parties and someone came to visit who said to=20=

come over and meet the band he=92s managing. A strange name: Pink Floyd.=20=

Another =93strange name=94 was playing the Avalon during that era where t=
he=20
usual band had sell out crowds of hippies with psychedelic music blasting=
 and=20
strobe lights flashing. One night the lights were down and there was a do=
zen=20
or so in the crowd. Bo Diddley took a place off stage towards the front o=
f the=20
ballroom and began by saying: Mercy, Mercy, Mercy, and here I am now,=20
playing for YOU as if to punctuate the lack of cultural, educational, and=
=20
streetwise heritage of the youthful arrivals. Of course, while living at =
that=20
same place, we had complimentary tickets left at City Lights to attend Ja=
nis=20
Joplin and Big Brother at the Filmore a few blocks in the other direction=
. After=20
going up to City Lights to pick up the tickets, the night grew larger wit=
h more=20
places to stop, get high and eventually miss a historically important=20
performance where the like of Joplin, Doors, Dylan, Rolling Stones, Beatl=
es=20
would soon re-introduce the great traditional music that had been forgott=
en.=20

Though San Francisco was going to be the town built on Rock=92n=92Roll in=
 the=20
60's, it would eventually have to pay tribute to the Jazz and blues from=20=

Kansas City from the 50's to achieve its greatness. My nostalgia lay in b=
oth=20
decades.

ACCORDING TO THE INTERVIEWS I READ, YOU HAVE BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED=20
WITH DRUGS. GUYS LIKE BUKOWSKI SWORE THAT BOOZE, ETC...WAS=20
ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR CREATIVE PROCESS. IN RETROSPECT WAS ALL THE=20
LSD, ETC...MORE OF A HINDRANCE OR HELP?

That=92s the old question =93on many levels=94 as we used to say so much =
during=20
that period. Someone remarked that he thought we were eternally on an=20
elevator! It=92s difficult to answer. Brain chemistry is still endless in=
 new=20
territories. Certainly spontaneity and improvisation in the frontal lobe =
are=20
stimulated by holding all that Cannabis smoke in. The associations seem=20=

favorable and helpful for jazz musicians, for example, and probably prove=
d=20
through anecdotal experience and empiricism. Cannabis in other arts that=20=

demand simultaneous critical and symbolic motifs of the eye instead of th=
e=20
ear, and the whole language/brain involvement seems more problematic. It =
is=20
essential for creative people to travel that road of excess unless they a=
re by=20
chance the Innocent or Idiot. It would be impossible for me to weigh thos=
e=20
imports into such an elusive study of so many variables such as a persona=
lity=20
overlay on a biochemical mass. The most concrete case study would probabl=
y=20
remain in Kubla Khan. It is odd that two of the most motivating forces fo=
r=20
modern man surface to the top of the paradigm in drugs and money. In the =
=93B=94=20
column, Sex and Rock=92n=92Roll. Or maybe Sex on top.=20
ALBERT HOFMANN DISAPPROVED OF THE RECREATIONAL USE OF LSD. HE FELT=20
YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD USE IT MORE RITUALISTICALLY. YOUR TAKE?=20

Yeah, I saw his recent obit and said that was the guy who used rye bread =
for=20
his toast and tea. Yes, there was intelligent advice in the obit. The Gol=
den=20
Mean is always good advice. I was more heavily involved in the variety in=
stead=20
of the quantity. Even with Benzedrine in the 50's, I would take breaks fo=
r my=20
body to recuperate instead of maxing it out, which seem to be a universal=
=20
approach for many in a kind of competitive way rather than what common=20=

sense would dictate. There was a certain excitement riding with Neal on t=
he=20
Amphetamine Trail, but in reality the more he used it, the more symptoms =
of=20
overuse came into play, and his preoccupation with defending his title of=
=20
fastest word in the west would became more tiring. So there is always an=20=

apex where force recedes to entropic realities.
There was always an implicit demand in opening doors to the interior univ=
erse,=20
I remember just before the Haight explosion a bunch of us were tripping i=
n a=20
pad down the street below McClure=92s. We had locked the doors and would=20=

express a kind of anguish about going there again. There were terrors alo=
ng=20
the way. The mirrors would change your face into others. Of course it was=
=20
Sandoz vials at that time, or maybe Owsley had come on the scene by then.=
=20
Either was the pure stuff and only fools would not have a personal trepid=
ation=20
of a contraindication. McClure came to the door about the time we were=20=

dissolving into the trip and we didn=92t let him in . He was sort of joki=
ng about=20
tripping and it was very alarming to us because we had definitely left th=
e road=20
of known landscapes. I don=92t know whether or not he had the experience =
by=20
then, but I=92m sure he would have taken it with his doctor friends or un=
der very=20
trusted circumstances. It was not to play with in the normal environments=
 of=20
society. I shudder to think how the young would take it in such cavalier =
ways.=20
Of course I don=92t know how much the doses were diluted or contaminated=20=

since the first days of it. Even a decade earlier in the 50's with Peyote=
, we=20
would naturally gravitate to ritualistic behavior down on the river banks=
. The=20
experience itself seemed to demand the ceremony of at least twisting in t=
he=20
wind of a higher force. I just saw a rather stupid program on TV of Peyot=
e to=20
something or other flashing from early investigators to Leary and the Hai=
ght..=20
My God! Well it shows that culture is the worst contaminate. And I began =
to=20
think of all the cool, hip distinctions surrounding the reefer of my earl=
y years=20
and then tried to picture Laura Bush and her sorority friends smoking=20
Marijuana. Ha! The devaluation and deflation dissolves the mythical. The=20=

tincture of spirit no longer has purpose while ground into toxic trash cr=
awling=20
alongside the sanctioned public expressway of technology. God will give u=
s=20
only what our hands can make, what our brains can discover in science. Ou=
r=20
spirit has not busted out of our upright poster. Drug chemistry just stir=
s the=20
maw. Some like to throw off social safety nets, hate controls, and chant =
for=20
freedom to take the cosmic plunge. Hart Crane said that the bottom of the=
=20
sea is cruel.

A LOT OF US SMALL PRESS FOLKS HAVE GRIPES WITH THE =93ACADEMY.=94 YOU=20
HAD A SMALL PRESS, AND THERE IS NO GREAT LOVE BETWEEN YOU AND=20
ACADEMIA.=20

I=92m no longer involved with either. Publishing has changed a great deal=
 since I=20
was active in it. Somehow I was one who had to be written off the money l=
ist=20
for a personal grant/fellowship. Any institutional activity always needs =
a fall=20
guy. Ironically, it=92s always the person who could have benefited the mo=
st.=20
After a lifetime of involvement, I just read my poetry when friends put=20=

together an interesting venue, or a cultural wealthy country invites me t=
o=20
their forum. I=92m probably one of the few poets who needs the honorarium=
 for=20
livelihood rather than resume/curricula/vita. If I can add to my almost 7=
00 a=20
month social security check, I will. In publishing, I no longer know poet=
ry and=20
mainly read physics and sleep the longs nights thinking about what I do n=
ot=20

I knew Hugh mainly in the publishing days of the 70's. We published his b=

and he was friends with Pam=92s mother, Mary Beach and her husband Claude=
=20
Pelieu. He was always going off to Kansas City or Rio with outlandish sto=

great interest. All he needed was a market researcher! Well, we were out =
in=20
New Mexico on a literature panel 30-40 years ago and I sat down in a thea=
ter=20
sort of place where there were presentations and along side me came a lad=
y=20
dressed to the nines. It was Hugh! Later we went to a party at a Mexican=92=
s=20
house in the country. He was a writer whose name I forget, but I saw it=20=

everywhere those days. Obviously he had ties to the director of programs =
who=20
got drunk and started feeling me up. Later at the hotel, the director had=

when he wrote his book, but I had definitely camped in the back of an old=

sleeping on the prairie. And by =9152 was goin=92 to Kansas City to hear =
Jay=20
McShann and later Charley Parker. He was older and had a good ear for jaz=

his Mexico City poems. But I was never into his prose. Except for his jaz=

AS A SMALL PUBLISHER I AM INTERESTED TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR SMALL=20

It would be impossible to list the publications. Part of it began with Jo=

what=20
sells Independents. And one has to kind of be in a movement or tied to=20=

performance to sell original work these days. There is very little litera=
ture from=20
larger presses. Most of it is reserved for the people who are known on=20=

television to have a hard copy of their thoughts. The book has become mor=
e=20
archival and more of an artifact itself for lesser-known artists these da=

do not have an archive for Cherry Valley. We sold it for living needs. Wi=

WHICH POETS LIVING OR DEAD ARE IN YOUR PERSONAL CANON?

I don=92t have any new influences because I read mainly physics and scien=

Loren Eiseley. His brush was as broad as Shakespeare=92s I thought that h=

poetry and that his prose in books, like The Star Thrower, was more poeti=

than most poetry. Like a fool, I tried to suggest this to him and he humb=

answered that he spent a lot of effort trying to place his words to suit =
him, or=20
something like that. When I went to meet him at his museum office at the=20=

> Can a digital work (a prpcess) make mistakes?

consider a chess-playing program. the best ones make mistakes. a 'mistake',
in that context, is a move that could be better.

mistakes in art are more subjectively oriented, perhaps. what one person
likes another thinks is a mistake.

one of the reasons i like doing what i do is i don't know what i'm doing.

in dbCinema, often i don't know whether a feature i'm programming will be
worth the work. i try to pick features that will be worth it. in terms of
their contribution to the art, mainly. sometimes they aren't. usually they
aren't. but, often, it's hard to tell until the feature's working.

those are my mistakes, though, not the digital work's.

but to return more directly to your question, if the digital work is
programmed in such a way that agency (to make mistakes), in some sense, is
in its hands,  then it can make mistakes. if the programming does not, in
some sense, give it the agency to make mistakes, then it can't.

Very interesting. For our latest event/performance/recording @ Toyeaters
Studio, Jersey City,
May 23rd, CATERASCHWARTZLOPEZ created a system of its own: BLEND TO MAKE,
using the following system functions as follows, (especially in the pieces
"Herb Robertson Said",
"Nation Building Avatar", "Taize Singing", "Oui Wimmy-Diddle (For Jonathan
Williams):

1. Theme Domains: themes were represented by axioms expressing properties
specific to that
particular poetic/sonic system. Associated with each theme domain is a list
of keywords that
access that theme domain.

2. The BLEND TO MAKE "algorithm": generated new concepts and metaphors from
input
spaces selected from the theme domains.

3. Grammar Morphism: mapped the conceptual blends to natural language

4. Optimality Principles: We used principles that consisted of a metric that
quantified optimality
according to: 1. communitivity, 2. changes in elements in the input spaces;
and. the number of
elements from the input spaces that were preserved in the blended space.

5. Narrative Structure: this defined how phrase units could be composed. A
poetic/sonic system
designer inputted his choice of narrative structure, stacking it all up.

6. Formatted input was read in and the system is initialized. This input
consists of the theme
domains and keywords, phrase "templates", and a narrative structure,
provided by the poet.

7. An input loop began, the system waited for the user input in the form of
a keyword

8. A phrase of the appropriate type, was selected from a list of Phrases

9. The phrase selected in 2 was checked for wildcards of the following
types:
-Phrasal = used to select a particular phrase type in order to replace the
wildcard with a
subphrase
-Grammatical = used to choose grammatical expression for a blend-space, this
is bolstered
for richer treatment
-Domain = used to select a select domain
- Axiom = for finer grained conceptual space selection
(wildcards consist of a token to represent its grammatical type. This
selection is random.

10. Conceptual spaces were selected from the chosen domains as follows:
-axioms were chosen from the first domain in relation to its emotion,
consistency, and drive. The o's
are always used to make the BLEND TO MAKE
- subdomains were formed from the 2nd domain that consisted only of axioms
of sorts that matched
the chosen axioms
- These spaces were used to create an input pattern (the studio's generic
space, three input spaces,
and the morphisms between our spaces
- The input pattern was passed into the blending "algorithm", which
outputted a conceptual blend and
two morphisms to it.

11. The input Loop starts over, unless the system has reached a finish state
in the narrative structure

The result was a two set performance that shredded the tin ceiling and is
available (very cheap)
by contacting me.

Jim,

A mistake, it seems to me, is a step which undercuts its own structure, and
not, necessarily, the user misusing it. For instance, can a process acts
against (outside?) the algorithms which constitute its instructions? In
mathematics this seems to be impossible. You can not *in the middle* of a
permutation assign to a triangle four sides or start by dividing by zero,
though in a parallel structure I assume that might be imaginable.

What I am really asking if a program can unlearn as much as learn?

Ciao,

Murat

'emergent behavior' is an interesting phenomenon. 'emergent behavior',
concerning programming, is behavior that is not anticipated by the
programmer but arises via the program's abilities. for instance, suppose a
program can learn. the programmer will have anticipated that the program
learns and changes in certain ways, but it may be impossible to tell what it
will learn and what it will become, over time. just like us in that sense.

can a program unlearn as much as learn? it would have to be able to
formulate alternatives and decide among alternatives. and, yes, it's
theoretically possible for programs to do that. how well they do it is a
matter of the programming and the way the programming allows for emergent
behavior.

it hasn't been convincingly demonstrated, Murat, that there are any thought
processes of which humans are capable that programming cannot also, in
theory, do. but neither has it been convincingly demonstrated that there are
no such processes.

there is a pretty good argument that there are very likely no such thought
processes. but i have never heard a good argument to the contrary.

this doesn't diminish us. to me, it makes us more interesting. we are the
ultimate machines. the universe has apparently been around for about 15
billion years. life on earth has been evolving for about 2.5 billion years.
spatially, we're a speck in the vast universe but, temporally, our living
form has been evolving through a significant portion of the full life of the
universe. nothing in the universe could have evolved longer than one order
of magnitude longer than our own life on earth. of course that could mean
very big changes, but still. it sort of puts in perspective how highly
evolved we and our fellow creatures on the planet are, despite our tragic
failings.

J'aime si tendrement le desert et la mer;
Que je ris dans les deuils et pleure dans les fetes,
Et trouve un gout suave au vin le plus amer;
Que je prends tres souvent les faits pour des mensonges
Et que, les yeux au ciel, je tombe dans des trous.

I love most tenderly the desert and the sea;
I find a curious suavity in bitter wine,
I smile at the saddest moments, I weep amid gaiety;
I take facts for illusions - and often as not, with eyes
Fixed confidently on heaven, I fall into holes.

it's so funny i'm an older unlaureled uneducated poet who's been
following this thread
and what's so interesting to me is that i  know and love many younger
poets and they're work
and have the exact opposite feelings about many of them
particularly the eager beavers - the comers and they know who they are
but even they take poetry quite syrupyoops i mean seriously
but here's the real laugh ole stupid me NEVER EVEN HEARD OF BOB PEARLMAN

maybe i'd better try to write this in sonnet form

Interesting article by John Burnside in the UK magazine Poetry Review on the dismissive attitude the British poetry establishment have towards US poetry:

http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/lib/tmp/cmsfiles/File/review/963burnside.pdf

Burnside is to be applauded for pointing this out (however mildly) in such a bastion of the mainstream as Poetry Review.

To all of you who may be interested, I've just initiated a blog under =
the title poems & poetics as a repository of new and old work, largely =
but not exclusively my own.  I take it as a supplement to my other, =
offline publications and as a celebration of that kind of autnomous =
publication that I think of as central to our ongoing and shared project =
over the last 200 years.

=20

The prospectus of the blog reads as follows: "In this age of internet =
and blog the possibility opens of a free circulation of works (poems and =
poetics in the present instance) outside of any commercial or academic =
nexus. I will therefore be posting work of my own, both new & old, that =
may otherwise be difficult or impossible to access, and I will also, as =
it comes to me, post work by others in the manner of a freewheeling =
on-line anthology or magazine. I take this to be in the tradition of =
autonomous publication by poets, going back to Blake and Whitman and =
Dickinson, among numerous others."

=20

The blog can be accessed at poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com and is already =
underway.

With cheers & abrazos for all of you,

Jim,

I had written quite an elaborate response to your post, which, for one
reason, disappeared from my computer and can recover it. This is one kind of
mistake (I am sure mine). I will try to recreate a short version of which,
which besaically I hate to do.

By mistake I mean the ability of the machine to stop and step out of, escape
its weave of usages and look at itself. In the last few months, I have
re-watched a number of times the film *Blade Runner*. In it humanoids,
replicants, in strength and intelligence superior to humans, suddenly become
aware of their mortality, that they only live for four years. The whole film
is about their vain attempt to escape that mortality. While language may
also exist in the animal world, the human language seems to be the only form
in which the user can step out of himself/herself and realize its own death.
The idea of the future is only possible if one can imagine its cessation. In
other words, human language (and very time itself) are possible with a
consciousness of its cessation. Will a machine revert to the animal stage or
preserve that quality of escaping, stepping out of itself, of "making
mistakes." I am particularly interested in this question because, in the
last two months I have been working on the section entitled, "The Spiritual
Life of Replicants," from my poem *The Structure of Escape*. Here is a poem
from The Spiritual Life:

        The Mortal Proof


I exist because I may cease to exist.

I may not exist; therefore I am.

A machine, image, if complex enough, will inevitably ask the question, am I
mortal, or what will happen after I cease to exist.

Imagining its cessation is part of the essence of being conscious.


I also found out that *Blade Runner* was the last movie in which digital
technology was *not* used for special effects. I wondered why are there are
so few science fiction movies after *Blade Runner* which equal the visual
resonance of that movie? Maybe *Jurassic Park*, *A.I*, *Altered States* (?,
the movie about cyborgs), *Star Wars I, II*, *Matrix I* remotely match it. I
have a theory based on the theory of natural selection. During the making of
*Blade Runner* the special effects were so difficult, also straining the
limits of the available budget, that only those which the vision of the film
demanded. In other words, vision preceded available technology. As
technology developed and special effects became relatively easier and
cheaper, many effects were created because it was possible to do so. In
other words, to a greater degree, technology preceded necessity, vision. I
wonder if this analysis, if at all true, has a relevance to the activities
going on among digital poets today?

Here again, vision becomes a stepping outside, a mistake, creating its own
necessity -therefore form.

Do special effects "replicate"? Is a replicant a copy, or something new?

Ciao,

Murat

Hey JP:

Our system was developed as reference, direction and as documentation,
and its longer term goal was in generalizing the technical and theoretical
framework... a way to play out., especially with richer media such as sound.
To that end, a simple extension is passing input to "the system" via this
gamelike interface (for example navigating a kind of map or selecting
objects
in the created environment. In the pieces "Oui Wimmy Diddle (for Jonathan
Williams)" and "Herb Robertson Said" the system was used with a preset
interface to generate a combination of prose, noise, and lyricism that's
often
used to narrate my personal everyday experiences in a live performance with
free jazz musicians.

There were more complicated extensions which used the blending to generate
new sonic content on the fly. In practice it required new and efficient
blending
and clear-cut representations s well as an extension of the theory to
account for
the "non-verbal" input. In one approach we used conceptual spaces between
and
including us (picture Venn diagrams) as metadata to annotate the
information,
blending that meta-data, providing morphisms from these annotations to
graphical
representations. This always opens up the expressway for more and more.

Here's a sample, our 2nd "set": (unedited with all the ambient sound
intentionally
left in... thank you very much):

www.metaharmonic.com/music/0523catera02_ruffmix.mp3

Cheers,
Gerald S.

Gerald,
This is a fascinating procedure. Could you share some of the software/
hardware mechanisms you used to do it? Or was it a strictly human-
operated system? JP

You truly believe that the poet's job is expression?

CA CONRAD WROTE: "When Lyn Hejinian read at the Kelly Writers House a few y=
ears ago I confronted her during the Q&A about allegations made through the=
 Poetry Project Newsletter, statements that THEY made claiming that SHE mad=
e about how younger poets are not involved in being open against the war, n=
ot involved in anti war protests and marches etc. SHE seemed glad that I br=
ought it up and said quite openly that that issue of the Newsletter irritat=
ed her because it was all taken out of context."

The Poetry Project Newsletter never made any claims and certainly no allega=
tions about anything Lyn Hejinian said about younger poets and their commit=
ment to anti-war protests and marches.

What did happen was that Nada Gordon and I took two published statements by=
 Ron Silliman and Lyn Hejinian on politics, writing, and generations, and u=
sed these quotes to launch a forum discussion on politics and aesthetics an=
d the younger generation(s).

Here is the full introduction from the Newsletter forum in question, which =
appeared Feb-March 2003 on pages 9-14:

[Begin quote]

"From Ron Silliman's blog: 'There has =85 been a depoliticization of younge=
r people generally & that has impacted poets. =85 You see the long-term res=
ult in a lot of writing these days that is simultaneously politically corre=
ct and depoliticized, a politics really of cynicism and disgust. So this al=
so becomes an incentive not to organize, not to write criticially.'

"From an interview with Lyn Hejinian and Bob Perelman conducted by Eric Lor=
berer in Rain Taxi: 'Lyn Hejinian: What tends now to get identified as Lang=
uage Writing is identified as such on the basis of surface characteristics,=
 surface features=97things that mark the poem as "experimental." But for us=
 there were broader motivations for using those devices than mere aesthetic=
ism. =85 I think poets in their mid-twenties to mid-thirties now do not hav=
e a comparable [to the Vietnam War and the 1960s counter culture] historica=
l moment. =85 Also, I think younger people are unable to sustain utopian vi=
sions=97they don't consider them to be tenable.'

"Do you agree with these characterizations? What is your own sense of the w=
riting/situation/outlook of the younger generation(s) vis-=E0-vis politics?=
"

[End quote]

This was followed by responses from Reg E Gaines, Laura Elrick, Ammiel Alca=
lay, Pamela Lu, Chris Stroffolino, Kristin Prevallet, Michael Magee, Renee =
Gladman, Alan Gilbert, Leslie Scalapino, Edwin Torres, and John Yau.=20

The responses were lively, diverse, and engaged, focusing on political acti=
vism, the politics of poetic form, and other related ideas. As Lyn Hejinian=
 herself wrote in her response, which we published in the following issue: =
=93Opening such questions to discussion as you have done is one element in =
a general strategy that can sustain that kind of resistance. ... I very muc=
h appreciated the Forum.=94

It is disappointing to see this characterized, and in such a public way, as=
 the Poetry Project Newsletter making slanderous allegations about Lyn Heji=
nian=97something that no editor of the Newsletter, then or now, has done, o=
r ever would do.

Having just returned from the Conceptual Writing and its Others =
conference in Tucson, and conscious that I'm not  going to Orono  to =
hear about the SEVENTIES, I'm circulating this call for papers for the =
next issue of  a journal I co-edit which will focus on the =
possibility/desirability of writing histories  of the contemporary. =
Although the main focus is visual art, I am eager to include material on =
poetry and poetics, writings by poets and literary critics/academics, =
material whether sprung from these conferences or other equally intense =
formations (individual or collective) of the zeitgeist.

The first issue includes an essay by me on autobiography, Ron Silliman =
and others and the conceptual artist On Kawara and others, the current =
issue has a great piece by Tan Lin (it=92s the cover essay) on a work by =
Erik Baudelaire. You will see details of these issues on the web site =
below.

Wystan=20

 =20



READING ROOM. A Journal of Art and Culture.
=20
ISSUE 3: CALL FOR PAPERS=20

Art Goes On=20

We=92ll always be eager to find or create a new experience, a new source =
of exhilaration. But whatever you arrive at will very soon no longer be =
there. And so you will need to move on, or you will need to move up. And =
this will have to be your perpetual practice.

Ai Weiwei (Artforum, May 2008)

The editors of Reading Room invite contributors to reflect on the =
momentum of which Ai Weiwei speaks, to address a range of questions his =
statement evocatively raises. What is the relation between the =
contemporary artist=92s desire to move on and the appetite of the market =
for newness? Where does this leave the project of historical reckoning =
that has traditionally been the task of the critic or art historian? If =
artists are caught in the effervescence of the now, how do they =
negotiate the historical legacies within which they are embedded? Is =
perpetual motion an antidote to history and its teleological ambitions =
or an impossible fantasy that is itself historically conditioned? Is =
such optimism a product of a buoyant and expanding art world or a =
symptom of its amnesia-inducing effects?=20

Reading Room encourages contributors to explore how art practice is =
shaped by and shapes current conditions. Equally, we invite submissions =
which consider the character of our moment to offer diagnoses of the =
situation for critical discourse.

Expressions of interest or short abstracts relating to this topic are =
sought by 30 June 2008.=20

Reading Room is a refereed journal of art and culture published annually =
by the E.H. McCormick Research Library at Auckland Art Gallery Toi o =
T=E2maki. The journal publishes essays of around 5000 words, artists=92 =
projects, and shorter articles of around 1000 words for its archive =
section. Information for contributors is available at: =
www.aucklandartgallery.govt.nz/research/journal

That sounds more like 'objective awareness' than 'mistake'. But perhaps we
need objective awareness to conclude we made a mistake. Or a success, for
that matter. What the winner don't know the gambler understands.

Well, it's a topic with subtleties, I think.

When we write or create digital art, the process of writing (or creating
digital art) is, itself, crucial to what gets created. We usually don't sit
down with an idea already thought out and just transcribe it. When we do, it
usually isn't very lively. It often lacks the bloom of insight, the event of
it. And the energy of pursuit.

Similarly, when somebody with some cash has a bright idea but can't program
and hires someone else to program it, it usually is a wooden implementation.
Unless the programmer can take it on as something other than a job. As art.
In which case the person writing the paycheque has to surrender some space
as artist, or they're going to have a dead thing.

Experimental art involves trying things where the outcome is uncertain. The
motivation for the experiment can, of course be various. From a vision to an
observation that something simply is now doable. One has to be open to the
feel, possibilities, and opening directions of it as it proceeds. If so,
then one normally ends up in a different place than imagined at the outset.

So, yes, of course there is work that is done simply because it can be. And
there is work done of quite a different order.

I saw a documentary about Bladerunner on TV quite a while ago. I dimly
recall the director (I think it was the director) saying that part of the
reason for the high quality of the visuals is that certain parts of the
project stalled for a year or more. So the people in charge of the visuals
had a lot more time than they figured they would to do their thing. And they
did. Big time. I also recall from that documentary somebody saying that an
important part of the vision of the look of the future was of the past. The
notion that the future really has a strong visual element in it of the past.
Contrast that with, say, The Fifth Element. Which also is strong in its
futuristic city scapes, but they are not grotty and aged like Bladerunner's.

Certainly the people who did the Bladerunner visuals were totally involved
in it as art and architecture and as vision of the future and vision of
history and of humanity, really. The replicants are machines but it's all
about humanity, what it is to be human. As you say, Murat.

Whoever did those city scapes in Bladerunner, I'll bet it wasn't their first
time. Lots of licks. Licks developed over time. Don't know with what tools.
Apparently not digital.

Whether the tools are digital or not, it's the licks developed over time by
the artist that find their maturity, eventually, in a few projects.

i said that in experimental art the outcome is uncertain. of course this
could be said of just about anything.

but i want to respond to your point of seeming objection to work that is
done merely because it can be done rather than out of vision.

one can imagine work that is embarked upon merely because it can be, work
that finds its way to something quite worthwhile.

the 'vision' may involve the spirit of adventure, exploration, and
discovery. a desire to boldly go where no gink has gone before. a desire to
discover/create the human dimensions of commonly used technologies commonly
used without elan energy articulation art a desire to defeat in this way the
forces of dullness and business, a desire to take poetry or art into new
possibilities where people are in any case having to deal with the
technology better that they deal with it not with the energy of slaves but
able to make mistakes in your sense of making mistakes, with the freedom to
make mistakes and experiment toward something human.

that said, there is, yes, a kind of unfortunate emphasis in the art world on
doing things first. doing whatever first. it's easier to identify. people
have a hard time identifying what's significant. much easier to say what's
first. as in a race or a competition. and technology thrives on new stuff,
so an emphasis on doing things first with a new technology synchs with
business and the tech world.

so the desire to do a thing simply because it can now be done is not just
that. it's not simply because it can now be done but because it's new and
new in certain narrow ways is easily understood and can command some
attention. in the same way that winning a competition commands attention
independent of what won the competition.

but that phenomenon is just a kind of sideshow part of experimental art. it
may not be sideshow but far more prominent, pragmatically, because it can
also get funding. silly but true. but it's sideshow in terms of real
significance to anyone with eyes in their head. the world thrives on central
sideshow in many spheres. time and chance.

it isn't significant to do something simply because it can now be done.
unless it's creating world peace, should the opp arise. but then obviously
it isn't done simply because it can be done but because doing it is much to
be desired. so sometimes it's good to do something because it can now be
done and also for other reasons. and obviously in many other cases.

it's up to each person to discern for themselves what's of value and what
isn't. there is no authoritative substitute for one's own insight and
intuition. art needs to be experienced, not simply 'understood'. it's in the
nature of digital art that there's going to be lots of it that is far less
than outstanding. but that's true of all arts. digital art's engagement with
technology inevitably forms part of the statement and position of any of its
works. it's not the only part, mind you. but it's part of the work in a way
that mayn't crucially apply to many books.

also, on a different note, i wouldn't put it past animals to consider their
own death. i have seen some of them, it seemed, face it with a sad,
dignified and accepting awareness of irrecoverable loss. we've all been
around as life forms on this planet for billions of years. anything we are
is not so far from the least of earth. a very big family. the more we learn
about life on earth, the more linked it seems are all of earth's forms of
life. in their biochemistry. in their interdependence in the ecosphere. in
their processes of adaptation. in the nature of their brain processes. we
are special, apparently. but i wonder how different we are from our furry
friends. i do agree, though, that there is something crucial about language
in that difference. which is why poetry may suffer but never die as long as
humanity lives. or continually die, continually be reborn in our deepest
engagements with life and language.

Gerald,
I'm flummoxed. Your description of the system as a reference,
direction, and documentation suggests it might be a human-operated
procedure. But some of your other language like "passing input,"
metadata, interface and extension suggests that you're using a
software algorithm. Maybe you're using computer terms to describe a
human-operated process? Could you clear that up for me? I'm
fascinated by all these possibilities, but I've been trying to keep
especial track of the hardware and software people are beginning to
use because I like to play with software-assisted poetry production
myself. JP

Dear Steve--Thanks very much for your reply--i am so glad you found this
story!

re the experiment of the scientists--
& Froggie

This parable being very much re language--
one could substitute poets for scientists for example and come up with the
same scenario--

a linkage which you write of--


"I hate the scientists of your story, too, as you do,
of course, too.  And the same with "some" EXPERIMENTAL poetries, and at
moments briefly, their poet producers, including myself, at times -
whose "experiments" aim at only one thing, the "success" that, as Nick
Piombino's Otto Rank explains, is illusory, or, Unconsciously, a dead
end."

I appreciate this as its a viewpoint different from my own & helped me to
understand the ways in which you understand the Experiment--
in terms of success and failure--

Does the word "Experiment" necessarily lead to thinking in terms of
"success/failure" as yet another either/or, us vs them framing  in terms of
"getting results, getting the right answer" rather than finding good
questions?

Experiments may "fail" yet by the failure open the way to new questions
which "lead to unexpected successes."

in "experimenting" --perhaps what's of real interest and use is what one
finds--which is a hopefully deeper understanding of what the questions and
elements involved are.

Edison often made hundreds of experiments before arriving at "something tha=
t
worked."  Along the way, he found out a lot of useful information that coul=
d
be applied to other ares then  simply the one he was working in.  Sometimes
"failures" end up being the experiments which bring out what the real
question is, rather than the shaky one one began with.

Perhaps then "success" and "failure" are not "either/or" at all and really
"both/and."

Or perhaps these are things which only "matter" to persons who concern
themselves with them?  Define themselves and others in these terms?

Also "success and failure" imply that the poet begins with some preconceive=
d
ideas of the impositions they want to "experiment on."

An "imprisoning point of view," which entails not only the seperations of
what are failures and successes but also what are Experiments by
Experimentalists and What Are Not.

Often the success and failure of writing are as much the successes and
failures of readers of the writing.  Not just "the average reader" whom no
one admits to being, but also "successful poets," "the leading literary
critics of the day," and "theoreticians above reproach."

So many writings meet at first with a Failed Non-reading--and are deemed
failures--yet later on--some other  reader "succeeds" in reading the writin=
g
and says-"-My God!! A neglected Masterpiece has been here all along!"
And Presto! Change-o!  Once shamefully tossed in the library closet  with
someone's "reserve supply" of liquor & dope amid the mildew of old mops, th=
e
damp and rank pages now unfurl like Headliners in a Hit Parade.


 Just like that!--the Neglected Masterpiece, an unread non writing as non
read previously--is  avidly consumed by devouring book worms as an Instant
Classic. Successful poets and Important Critics profusely embrace the long
ignored familial ancestor,a Lazarus suddenly raised from the dead to join  =
"
the Most Advanced  Writers of Today."
Positively heart warming these Family Reunions are!!

Praise rains down on the Newly Discovered Great Author previously subjected
to the hail of critic's brickbats and the stones and scorn of street
urchins!

Another form of "rediscovery" is via erasures of Old Classics by New
Readers/readings. Many such readers have triumphantly informed me of their
erasures of whole shelves of books in a Feng Shui Frenzy of rearranging
their personal Experimental canons via the replacement of Timeless Classics
with the Revised Redacted & Erased Versions of the Moment.

(A leading text in this regard is The Bible--Old & New Testaments both.)

In order to read some hoary old tome, one hears how one's Didactic
acquantance had to erase, redact and rewrite as they went along, producing =
a
Revised Innovative Experimental  Edition to make the world safe from the
Sordid Monsters of the Past.

"Literary studies" and "poetics" as an  immense industry,   a Re-Production
Factory of erasing, redacting and re inscribing--revising--re translating
via the latest forms of translations-(far superior to ones previous)-- unti=
l
some wretched text disappears in order to reappear--as a "New and Immensely
Improved and Approved  Authoritative Edition."

The Authoritative Authority replaces the literally or at least
Theoretically  "Dead Author," making some rotting old hulk of anachronistic
dementia "palatable"' for  today's readers.  This overhauling produces a
version both "vastly superior to the original" and "restored as a Newly
Discovered Classic."   "Not only of Today but 'Also and Equally'-- of its
own Early Jurassic Proto-Conceptualism."

 For to re-write for today is to re-produce the past in today's own image.

How much of the work of reading  is this "saving" of literature and poetry
from "their terrible conditions!"
Let alone "saving it from its terrible producers--! Monstrosities of rank
Failure compared to the Successful Saints of Today."

To bring back from the wells of silence and darkness these long lost
Masterpieces--
not as the wrecks they were, but as shiny contemporary Versions, the Proofs
of the Superiority of Today's Innovations . . .
!
A Successful Reader is actually the Producer of a Shining New
Writing--"Thankfully" erasing yet another  "Failed poet" from view. And
hopefully for good!  Get the dirty old sods off the nice clean streets of
the gated communities saving rotting old neighborhoods from themselves !

"Purity and Terror," as Robespierre said--are the Twin Pillars of State
Revolution. And does not the State of Poetry require these methods for its
Ethic Cleansings?

To make Safe the Homeland Security of the State of Poetry--at times poets
and poetries must be destroyed to save Poetry by other Poets.

For the State of Poetry to appear Safe and Shining--must not some poets and
poetries Disappear?

From the experimenting scientists/poets and Froggie--one moves into the
Green Zones of the New Extreme Experimental American Poetry.

Here the relationship of language experiments with those of science,
economics, politics, the military,  espionage, forgery, counter/terrorism,
and others opens new areas of writing and reading which are as yet in many
ways unread.  And, being unread, taken to be unwritten.

One finds these unwritten lines of the unread
writing towards the finding of their readings all about one, hidden in plai=
n
site/sight/cite.

(Which is where Purity and Terror want them to remain, to protect you, O
citizens!)

Paul Celan writes of this situation as "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it
exposes itself."

Yet, as the Parable of Froggie shows, "even" "Experimental" poets as you
clearly point out, may prefer to impose on poetry a set of commands "to
which it will answer."

When these "experimenting poets" are confronted with a poetry "which expose=
s
itself"--what do they find but a  frog
without legs who is suddenly found to be deaf because he cannot obey the
command to jump.

(Or perhaps at least cover itself up! My God--a poem exposing itself like
that!)

The "New Extreme Experimental Poetry" is what is unread  by the
Mis(sed)-reading of its non writing by the imposed reading of an imposed
poetry.

An imposed poetry's imposed reading of deafness is in actuality a projectio=
n
imposed on to the frog of the poet's own deafness.

By imposing a projected deafness on to the frog, the poet is able to ignore
the fact that the frog--and himself--"do not have a leg to stand on."

A "deafness" which desperately ignores that it has no legs to stand on in
order to deny its own deafness and "put it on someone else," uses the
imposed projections of its poetry to separate itself from its own mirroring=
.


Leglessness and deafness have nothing to do with the poet/experimenter--
they al belong to Froggie. As long as Froggie is not seen as a  mirroring o=
f
the poets projections.

To substitute deafness for leglessness!
The moving of a "blank and ruin" from one site/sight to another--which is
cite-less--"beyond hearing."

To see the silence of an other's auditory existence rather than their
absence of legs--

  a projection of a disembodied deafness onto an actual mutilated "body of
work," a projection
which is blind to its projection as a mirroring of itself elsewhere--
And that that elsewhere being "within its own eye?"
As a blindness--?

In a sense,then, does the "critique of the self" in language produce a
blindness to its self-projection mirrored in an elsewhere to which it is
blind--in order that it may make "experiments" in which what are found are
"deaf Froggies?"
Which  it does not recognize as its own  critiqued self?

As an example, a mutilated Froggie considered as a mutilated language which
"doesn't hear" the "healthy"  language of commands is not unlike the
mutilated language of the tortured and experimented upon Poets of
Guantanamo, which has produced, according to healthy  American poets, a
non-poetry for non-readers.

Seeing and writing down that "frogs with no legs can't hear" introduces an
interesting twist on Emerson's formulation in "Nature" that "The blank and
ruin that we see in Nature is within our own eye."  Seeing "frogs with no
legs can't hear" becomes:  "The deafness that we see in frogs with no legs
is within our eye."

Seeing and writing a deafness "that is within our own eye," when a legless
frog no longer jumps on ("our") command, indicates a "failure to
communicate" on the part of an imposed language which "won't take no for an
answer."

A Russian artist has written that "Language is a fascism not because it
censors, but because it forces to speak."

Trying to force the legless Froggie to "speak,"by jumping, the experimenter=
s
"hear no reply," and project this silence on to the Froggie as a "deafness"
to their own speaking.

Seeing "deafness" is a blindness to the absence of legs being the cause of
the failure to jump.

By "forcing the situation" the experimenters in imposing their language,
their poetry--create mutilated  "unhearing subjects" of their "poetic speec=
h
and writing"  for their own unseeing,(and mis/unreading) eyes  to "explain.=
"


Their concluding sentence, "Frogs with no legs can't hear," presents a
writing in which a blindness discovers a deafness, in which unseen
reflections and unheard echoes mirror elsewhere the presence of an absence
which is a self-projection.  The "result" of the imposed, "experimental"
mutilation of  Froggie is a mutilated language of absences (unseeings,
unhearings) misreading and mis writing an actual absence--the non-jumping o=
f
non-legs.

Froggie as the presence of an absence which is a self projection as "the
blank and ruin we see in  Froggie is the blank and ruin in our own eye."

An imposed experimenting language already a blank and ruin which projects
this on to Froggie as a mutilating  "forcing to speak," produces a scene
unseen and "blank," and commands unheard and in "ruins."

The critique of self in which it reappears--as blind to itself--and so
taking itself to be absent--
not recognizing that what it is seeing is its self----mirrored as the
projection of its own eye.


"Experimental" --a lot of my writings in  recent years are increasingly
found among the unread and unwritten found hidden in plain site/sight/cite-=
-

These are re what i call "The New Extreme Experimental American Poetry" (an=
d
Arts, also--)

The story of  Froggie--at once a mutilation physically and a mutilated
mis(sed) reading of what is taken as a non-writing "response"-- is very
relevant to the writings re Extreme Experimental American Poetries--

In these Extreme Experiments occur such things as:"fingerprint forgeries" i=
n
"identifying" both persons and works of art--in order to determine
"authenticity" of "identity" and, predicated on the outcome--the "value"
that a  hoped for Authorial signature , when ascertained to be such by
Authorities, confers upon an identity and its works--

Yet "who exists?"  when forged copies of fingerprints match original ones
for which there is no proof to whom they belonged?
Forgeries of anonymous fingerprints are used to "prove"  the "identity" of
the painter of paintings which are not signed--yet which have a miraculous
"signature"  fingerprint found on them.  Is this anonymous fingerprint the
same as one which appears on a can of paint once belonging to the painter?
Yet since the painter was never fingerprinted, how does one know for certai=
n
that the fingerprint is his?  There are others who might also have touched
the can--

This has all happened in the last year with examinations of paintings and
fingerprints and paint cans cliamed to be jack Pollocks by the persons
currently owning the paintings.
(The paint can has a home in a home of Pollock memorobilia--and is supposed
to be "authentic.")


"To forge one's identity" can mean to forge it as at the forge of
Hephaestus--or of Longfellow's "Village Smithy" --or in an experimental poe=
m
of deaf Froggies--or simply to forge an identity out of anonymity and into
the "mark of greatness."

Is a forged "greatness" really all that different from an original and
actual anonymity?

Both signal the presence of an absence--the absence of "a real name."

And is this why even with critiques of the self and deaths of the authors
(other than oneself--to be sure! O Immortal Poet!!)
there continues to be the absolute necessity for the "identity of the autho=
r
to be known?"

Is this how perhaps the "identity" of the experimenting poet winds up
camouflaged even from herself or himself as a deaf frog?

A critique of the self in which the self hides from itself and puts in its
place a convenient substitute? Which is all the same the mirrored projectio=
n
of its unrecognized self?

Yet all the same, an author's name is attached to "impersonal" or "non-lyri=
c
self" works--which amazingly has the same identity as the experimenter--
Who may well refuse to believe that in actuality he or she is themselves a
deaf frog?
And so require "their real name" in order "to have leg stand on."?

To refuse that they are in actuality  seeing a mirrored self projected
substitution for themself which is denying that it is itself?

All these areas move among each other--and the lines of the unwritten write
themselves in these movements--using the materials that are found among the
unread--

Among New Extreme Experimental American Poetries Electronic and Print which
in order to keep Safe their Homeland ceaselessy work to non-read  and
abolish and annihilate the non-literatures for non-readers which need to be
kept non-written.

 Steve=97I wrote more but too long already=97so will stop here, with these:
as examples:  two pieces re The Guantanamo Poems wil be out by the end of
June--
one is at Wordforword #13 the current issue:

*Waterboarding & Poetry:
Francois Villon & the New Extreme Experimental American Poetry

*http://www.wordforword.info/vol13/dbc.htm

and the other will be up soon at Kaurab--
it's called Non-Poetry for Non-Readers  (towards a non-reading American
abolition of "non-literatures")

We are using a human-operated procedure, emulating on a larger scale what D.
Catera is doing with his rig (guitar, laptop, effects, et.)

 Maybe you're using computer terms to describe a

Yes, as I say, years ago we st down and, in you will, flow=charted what we
do and what is done as descrbed above, found it to be close to one in the
same and leaned more into emulated it as a system.

Now, on the other hand, when Catera and I (as a duo) performed our
"consTELLations" at Chicago's Adler Planetarium, there was a pre-recoded
"track" of material as well as a "live reading/performance", which was set
up by Catera to constantly be interacting with each other, moving, mutating,
morphing. Ah, the stone-age!

MEDIA+SPACE New Media Gallery :: Yonsei University :: Seoul, Korea ::

Alan Sondheim :: Avatar of Excess
An exhibition of video work and texts.

Exhibition: Wed June 11  Fri June 20th
Artist will be present via Second Life at the
opening Wed. June 11th 1pm



condensed S Korea online SL performance text
with Sandy Baldwin and Baruch Gottlieb

Alan Sondheim is a unique figure in contemporary cyber culture. A
hyper-prolific artist, poet, and critic, Sondheim produces dozens of new works
every week and publishes these in a variety of venues from conferences to
galleries to Second Life to the numerous mailing lists he inhabits.

His online persona and his work are utterly symbiotic; his language straddles
the edge of coherence between the machine language of code and the global
lingua franca.  English is unique in that it is used by 100% of the computers
of the world as well as by a significant section of human society.  Sometimes
it is hard to tell if Sondheim's work is created by a human or by an automaton.

Alan Sondheim's use of language in his oeuvre exemplifies the infrastructural
actuality of English today.  Often repetitive, railing away on a tangent,
riddled with codes and surging with automatic energies, Sondheim evokes the
perverse vitality of the proto-cyborg consciousness of our age and it's obscene
hyperproduction.

Human forms appear as avatars in Sondheim's videos only to be corrupted,
smashed and smeared by irrepressible surges of information, rendering palpable
the fragility of human meaning in the age of self-perpetuating automatic
processes, the masochistic ecstasies of the human body at the mercy of it's
machines.
- Baruch Gottlieb

most recent piece is "A Tale of Two Skull" at =
http://bbc.co.uk/radio3/sundayfeature/pip/4rhg4

he's from ny but has, i think, been living in london for some time =

      Artist Jane Wildgoose, keeper of the Wildgoose Memorial Library =
(WML), has a cabinet of curiosities, among which are two human skulls. =
Each skull was donated to the library =EF=BF=BD one was a prop from an =
artist's studio in Hampstead and the other was from an archaeological =
dig in Waltham Abbey. Wildgoose embarks on a journey with the skulls to =
examine how their individual pasts should inform their future and how, =
as a society, we understand and deal with human remains.=20

    =20



The WML began as an informal collection of objects and books relating to =
Jane's enduring fascination with the interest of the dead to the living. =
Numerous objects have been donated and others have been discarded and =
found their way there. The two skulls, however, have a particular =
resonance in the collection. For the first time Jane takes them out of =
the library, visiting different professionals who deal with human =
remains   archaeologists, artists, clergy and museum directors =EF=BF=BD =
to help understand their relationship with what once were living beings.


Along the way, she discovers more about the provenance of the skulls and =
seeks guidance as to what would be a fitting resting place for each of =
them were they to leave the library for good. Jane discovers that one of =
the skulls belongs to a group of people on the other side of the world =
and that the debate surrounding human remains and repatriation is very =
much a live and contentious one which she must also navigate.


Presenter/Jane Wildgoose, Producers/Neil McCarthy and Gregory Whitehead.

I am the originator of Ron Silliman, which happened
The day before I originated poetry. In this manner,
I originated Patrick Herron, who, through a sad mispelling,
Flew from the birds which I originated just the day before.
Hello Patrick, I say, as he flies overhead, on the way to flarf
And other lines that start with Larger Letters.
All letters are capital! He cries, every single one of them!
How am I to argue even if G makes me quake, an ornate C
That cuts curious the cataract from my left and fuzzy I.
On a dark and otherwise murderous night, Maria Demon
Completed her work and I emerged, speechless, holding her
Responsible for every word I write; please contact her
If there are any difficulties with this transmisson. At what
Bleak point did Socrates trade Daemon in, suturing her name
Which used to be Sally Forth? I know he meant no harm,
He was busy writing me into submission while I, knowing the worst,
Created Silliman, Flarf, Cataract, Damon, Herrons Galore,
And at least two letters of the alphabet, now sung
Almost as much as any other (jst dd vwls!).

Subject:      Jewish Voice for Peace: re "stifling of open debate" : John
              Stewart's comments, Harvard, Politics and Prose Bookstore,
              Spertus Museum

Jewish Voice for Peace's Muzzlewatch purpose is
"Tracking efforts to stifle open debate about US-Israeli foreign policy."

All the articles below are from the last week's updates:

Two areas in which this "stifling" have been increasingly targeted are
Education and the Arts, as well as Media and Government,  raising and
revealing  First Amendment concerns in many different ways.

A few recent events briefly made headlines which drew some attention to the
area of Education.  One was the arrest, deporting and 10 year ban given by
the State of Israel to internationally known writer and speaker Norman
Finkelstein, whose Faculty-approved tenure earlier this year was denied at
Depaul Univesrity under extreme pressure from forces led by Alan
Dershowitiz  and the visits of some Israeli government representatives. The
intrusion of  forces outside of a specific institution other than alumni,
let alone ones from a foreign government in an American University's hiring
practices is very dangerous.  As Harvard Law Professor Dershowitz knows ver=
y
well, establishing precedents makes each succeeding "case" that much more
"winnable."
In recent years an increasing number of hirings and tenure approvals have
experienced pressures, public attacks based on spurious "evidence," planted
rumors and threats. These aid greatly in  creating public and private
censorship of groups, events, talks, meetings and individuals, which in tur=
n
spreads a culture of self censorship in which fewer and fewer are willing t=
o
protest or comment.  The silencings and "looking the other way's," as many
writers have pointed out, has an eerie resemblance to the McCarthy Era in
the USA and the first years of Hitler's Reich. (cf Naomi Wolf's The End of
America)

Another recent Education example was the withdrawing by the United States o=
f
7 Fulbright Fellowships granted to Palestinian students residing in Gaza.
This withdrawal was caused by Israel's refusal to grant visas to the
students.  An international outpouring of shock, disbelief and criticism,an=
d
the critiques portraying "the tail that wags the dog,"made possible the
reinstatement of the Grants and an assurance that the Visas will be
granted.  At the same time nearly 700 other students in Gaza granted
Fellowships abroad are still being denied Visas.  A very tiny few more may
be allowed Visas--it remains to be seen.

Unlike almost al the other incidents Muzzlewatch reports on, these two
examples briefly drew attention, then vanished. These very very tips of the
tip of an ever growing iceberg vanishing so quickly,as if to say, "problem
solved,"  have little or no effect on the silencings, censorships and self
censorships that go on every day and which Jewish Voice for Peace and many
other Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Ecumenical and Secular groups are trying t=
o
raise an awareness of and find support for refusing it to continue
spreading.

History repeats itself for those who ignore or refuse to believe that it is
happening again.

 Remember the story--"first they came for the Jews, and I did nothing.  The=
n
they came for the Communists and Socialists and I  did nothing.  Then they
came for the Catholics and I did nothing.  Then it was the Gypsies, the
Slavs the mentally ill, the Homosexuals and Lesbians and I did nothing.
Then it was my boss, my neighbor, my nephew, my brother-in-law, the store
keeper, the bus driver and before I could do anything--they were coming for
me."

Consider that one may read the Israeli papers daily --as John Stewart point=
s
out below---and find more discussion and criticism than one ever does in th=
e
USA.  Language begins to be censored, silenced and mutates into doublespeak=
.
American stands on Human Right and Civil Rights begin to sound hollow
meaningless
when a single word the rest of the word sees and says and is starting to
even appear in Israeli journals, can't be used in the United States without
creating outraged condemnation and  storms.
When a word is  not supposed to be written or said--it means one denies the
existence of what it names. Bits and pieces of the world begin to
disappear.  Bits and pieces of one's being vanish.  And one begins to
believe in  and support things one formerly would have found appalling. Whe=
n
those things begin to appear in one's midst, since they don't exist--one is
ready and willing to be all for them. Think of how many things the United
States at least publicly and openly used to be "for," and how many of those
now it is not. Or have those things, too,  begun to vanish from memory as
well as existence?

Stewart says:

One part of being a good friend to Israel is constructive criticism of any
of its polices that may not be in the best interest of the world, so lets
hear the candidates critiques of current Israeli policy=85 [silent video of
candidates.)

Oh I forgot! You can't say anything remotely citical of Israel and still
gete elected president. Which is funny, because you know where you can
criticize Israel? Uh Israel.

*June 11 UPDATE: DID THE DAILY SHOW SELF CENSOR?*

We've been getting emails from people who said the links to the infamous
Indecision 5678 segment are now dead. The direct link we have above still
works fine. But it's also true that if you don't happen to have the direct
link, it's now impossible to find using various search mechanisms on The
Daily Show website <http://www.thedailyshow.com/index.jhtml>. In fact, all
video segments going back to May 28 are no longer searchable on the
timeline. The segment doesn't show up in direct search, or using tags
either. The entire June 5 episode is available, however, on the front page.
But you'd have to know it was there to find it. It's the Adam Sandler
episode.

<http://www.muzzlewatch.com/wp-content/picture-12.png>Accidental or
deliberate? You decide.

One thing is certain, with 251,884 viewers, Indecision 5678 has proved to b=
e
one of The Daily Show's most popular segments ever.

Academic freedom, relatively unfettered by corporate business interests, is
one of the last bastions of free speech and inquiry in the US. That is
precisely why people like Alan Dershowitz and Daniel Pipes, extensively
discussed here, intrepidly do their utmost, despite assertions to the
contrary, to stifle such activity. No matter one's point of view, the
ability to have multi-vocal academic discussion is a core activity of a
functioning democracy. In this spirit J. LORAND
MATORY<http://www.feedblitz.com/t.asp?/150615/2461612/http://www.thecrimson=
.com/writer.aspx?id=3D1202946>discusses
in detail his own worrying experience as a long time Harvard
faculty member. His effort to have the Harvard faculty "commit itself to
fostering a civil dialogue in which people with a broad range of
perspectives feel safe and are encouraged to express their reasoned and
evidence-based ideas" was tabled by the Faculty of Arts and Science
precisely because it could allow such reasoned debate about I/P. He goes in
to detail on censorship occurring to him and others, such as Norman
Finklestein, in and around the Harvard Campus.

More on the story <http://www.muzzlewatch.com/?p=3D362>about the Spertus
Museum:

Last week, the Chicago
Reader<http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/thebusiness/080529/ind=
ex.php?cAction=3D>spoke
with Rhoda Rosen, the smart and courageous director of Spertus,
Chicago's Jewish museum. The Imaginary
Coordinates<http://www.spertus.edu/exhibitions/imaginary_coordinates.php>ex=
hibit
on maps of the Holy Land (held as part of the city's Festival of
Maps), which Rosen worked on for 3 years, recruiting both Israeli and
Palestinian artists, "was suddenly and mysteriously shut down" a week after
opening. The public reason for the closure was too much sun light shining o=
n
the displays. This excuse was, pardon the pun, transparent. Chicago Reader'=
s
Deanna Issacs remarks that the museum was housed in a spectacular state of
the art showpiece building completed 6 months before, making the excuse
unlikely . . .

For the next few days the museum's Web site carried a notice that Imaginary
Coordinates had been closed due to "unanticipated maintenance" . . .
<http://www.muzzlewatch.com/?p=3D363>

 Then came word that the show would reopen "tweaked," as Rosen put it, and
with a new protocol: visitors would be admitted only on guided tours, to be
conducted hourly.

Saree Makdisi - Banned in the U.S.A.
(Almost)<http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/SabbahsBlog/%7E3/309394430/>

Posted: 11 Jun 2008 01:17 AM CDT

I didn't think America was a place where bookstores barred people for their
viewpoints, until it happened to me, right here in Washington, D.C., the
city of my birth.

I was scheduled to speak at Politics & Prose Bookstore and Coffeehouse last
month about my latest book, "Palestine Inside Out: An Everyday Occupation."
My appearance was canceled when the bookstore owners realized that my book
concludes by questioning the viability of a two-state solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Instead it proposes a single democratic,
secular and multicultural state in which Israelis and Palestinians live
peacefully as citizens with equal rights.

"I do not believe that your book will further constructive debate in the
United States," one of the owners wrote to me in an e-mail. "A single state
is not a solution." I was dismayed that my invitation was rescinded because
I express a different point of view from the one sanctioned by a supposedly
independent bookstore. Yet the cancellation seems to fit into a larger
pattern of nationwide censorship about this issue.

Stanford professor Joel Beinin had been invited to speak about Israel and
Palestine at a Silicon Valley school last year; his appearance was canceled
when the school was criticized for booking the event. Tony Judt of New York
University was invited to speak about Israel and Palestine at the Polish
Consulate in New York last fall; his talk was canceled after the consulate
came under pressure from the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish
Committee.

The fact that senior scholars are prevented from speaking in well-known
forums because they do not toe an official line suggests that the civic
culture on which our country was founded has broken down, at least when it
comes to Palestine and Israel.

Yet citizens can object to the muzzling of ideas. After receiving letters o=
f
protest and eloquent entreaties by bloggers, Politics and Prose decided las=
t
week to reissue my invitation. This reversal is an important step forward
but questions still linger. Can we afford not to hear each other out as we
evaluate our Middle East policies? Should Palestinians not be allowed to
speak unless their erstwhile audience gets to tell them what to say? What,
then, is the point of a conversation? What is the alternative to
conversation?

What is so unspeakably wrong with saying that justice, secularism, toleranc=
e
and equality of citizens =97 rather than privileges granted on the basis of
religion =97 should be among the values of a state?

Politics and Prose owner reverses position, reinvites Edward Said's
nephew<http://www.muzzlewatch.com/?p=3D376>

Posted by Cecilie Surasky under Publishing<http://www.muzzlewatch.com/?cat=
=3D4>


<http://www.muzzlewatch.com/wp-content/palestine-inside-out.jpg>We may neve=
r
know the true back story behind the beloved Politics and
Prose<http://www.politics-prose.com/>DC-based bookstore owner Carla
Cohen's decision to invite
Palestinian-American professor Dr. Sari Makdisi, then disinvite him because
of his political positions, and then invite him again.

To be fair, there may be no back story, which makes Carla Cohen's ultimate
decision to admit she made a mistake and embrace him all the more laudable.
But it is apparently a fact that the independent bookstore already had to
endure hate mail from some members of Cohen's (and our) Jewish community
for, well, acting like an independent bookstore and welcoming a free
exchange of ideas on Israel-Palestine.

It is almost certain that she will get many more because of her reversal on
Makdisi. Do make sure to let her know she did the right thing. Email:
books@politics-prose.com

Grace Said, the late Edward Said's sister, and aunt of UCLA English
professor Dr. Makdisi, had this to say to Cohen:

It is with sadness that I write to inform you that I have decided to
cancel my membership at Politics and Prose, effective immediately. I
have always been a supporter of independent bookstores. Politics and
Prose, in particular, seemed to be the place for me. Visiting your
store was always pleasant; the atmosphere, choice of books, the
friendliness and knowledge of the staff, and the coffee shop have
always made it a plus for me, and I am sure, for many others.

However, I was quite appalled to hear that you chose not to follow
through with your invitation to Dr. Saree Makdisi, whose book,
Palestine Inside Out: An Everyday Occupation describes the effect of
the Israeli occupation on the lives of ordinary Palestinians. It is
precisely this kind of book that needs to be promoted in the US, where
the mainstream media and political pundits have deliberately avoided
any discussion of the hardships endured by the Palestinians under
occupation.

I know Makdisi's writing from the LA Times where he is a frequent
contributor<http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-makdisi11-2008may11,0=
,7862060.story>,
writing hard-hitting and incisive commentary about the conflict, and most
recently, the idea that a two-state solution is no longer possible. It's th=
e
kind of analysis one typically doesn't find in US papers, but which is
increasingly finding a home in corporate-owned publications, making Cohen's
cold feet all the more surprising.

Cohen responded to Grace Said's note by explaining:

I have been very active =97 and my husband even more so =97 in trying to
have the U.S. intervene with Israel to end the occupation of the West
Bank. I was recently in Israel and saw and heard about the
heartbreaking effects of Israel's policies vis-=E0-vis travel,
employment, and so on. I came back very discouraged about Israel's
political ability to break through the impasse. The way to end the
occupation lies with the U.S. I want to make the case with American
Jews and with American politicians to press Israel to end the
occupation.

I guarantee that nobody will listen to me if I am seen as promoting a
book whose only way out of the present situation is a one-state
solution. One state means the end of Israel as a democratic and Jewish
state. I do not believe that should happen. I am placing all of my
energies on promoting within the American Jewish community a practical
solution that involves respecting the legitimate needs of Israelis and
Palestinians and treating with empathy those on both sides.

It's hard to fathom how offering a space for independent political thought
would threaten the possibility of Middle East peace. In fact, the
topic of Makdisi's
book is life under occupation <http://imeu.net/news/article008577.shtml>,
not, the one-state solution. But his most recent op-ed in the LA Times is
worth reading because he puts forth a view increasingly held by many people
(and rejected by many as well, including Norman Finkelstein) that the
one-state solution is the only option left. Because of the actions of peopl=
e
who want to see Israel destroyed? No, but rather, due to Israel's own
actions. He argues that the ceaseless project of appropriating Palestinian
land and building Jewish-only houses on it has made a contiguous Palestinia=
n
state simply impossible. Is this an analysis that would isolate Politics an=
d
Prose from the liberal, anti-occupation Jewish community? It's sad to think
it could.

After probably more than a few letters like Said's, a Politics and Prose
friend told us late yesterday: "Carla Cohen reinvited the author back to
Politics and Prose, and admitted that she was wrong. She does want to make
sure that there is open dialogue/debate at the bookstore. She reaffirmed
that she wants the bookstore to continue to be a place where people hear
diverse opinions and people make their own decisions."

When One Can Become Two or More


We do this on the board -- students list things that have "touched" them in some way during the past 21 days. This can be a lost cell phone or a parental divorce. It can be a beating that has occupied the local / national news.  We make a list of these things.  Then I ask the students to write for 10-15 minutes about one of the items on the list.  Next I ask them to consider what was vibrant and strong about what they just wrote, ask them to exchange their accounts and ask for the reader's comments.  Following on this 10 minute writing "opportunity," I ask them to write a poem in free verse.  We discuss what works in this poem and what might be added.  After this, I ask them to write a sonnet (it doesn't have to rhyme--and we discuss this, looking at older and newer ways sonnets can be written.  Then, I ask the students to use the same initial material and write a villanelle and then a sestina.  In the process, we discuss how sound can be employed, color, taste, dialogue, etc
  -- an
d finally, we look at how the differences that occur in each rendering.

Jim,

I want to focus on one point from your full response:

" but that phenomenon is just a kind of sideshow part of experimental art.
it
may not be sideshow but far more prominent, pragmatically, because it can
also get funding. silly but true. but i*t's sideshow in terms of real
significance to anyone with eyes in their head*."

It is very interesting that you automatically, implicitly assume that
experiment has something to do with the eye, whereas, historically, words
were associated with the ear. Does this not suggest a profound alteration in
the concept of language, of poetry in our time, almost a mutation of
linguistic DNA? It seems to me a dynamic analysis of the relation between
what is seen and what is heard is extremely important.

Ciao,

Murat

Jim,

You are very right about the retro elements in *Bladerunner*, particularly
in the columns of building and some rooms and leaky interiors. and chaotic
mixture of clothings (some reminiscent of *Starwars*). They add to the
feeling of desolation the movie projects. On the other hand, there is the
incredible giant neon figure of the oriental woman, several storeys high,
bursting open continuously, advertizing mood pills. During the last few
years, I have visited Hong Kong every summer. Last year, I was on a
hovercraft boat returning from Macao to Hong Kong after it was dark. The
view of the Hong Kong skyline at that time, with its mind boggling array of
sky scrapers and neon lights, in an area which ten years before was water,
reminded me *bladerunner*. It looks exactly like the utopian, corporate
capitalist, city of the future. Also, exactly as in *bladerunners, Hong Kong
*has retro features, very narrow streets winding across twenty-five storey
apartment building, exotic (to us!) markets. Compared to that, New York
looks quaint, almost with the feel of a village.

What do you mean by "licks"? Do you mean experimentation? It seems the
director made things happen with an iron fist.

Ciao,

Murat

FYI - I have a few things that I wrote inspired by thoughts that bounced off
and around during the poetics conference it Tucson.  I actually posted these
in the middle of the conference, but didn't really think to put it out on
this list.



I'm also typing in my notes from the conference for my own use and if anyone
is interested, I can either blog these or send them along to you.  Let's say
if more than 5 people ask me, I'll blog 'em.  Otherwise will only send out
individually.  Of course as with any notes, these will be highly subjective
and interpretive . . . but I am happy to share with anyone who wants them.

the eyes, ears, and the mind's eye which sees and hears other things such as
what is read...experiment can involve any or all of these, can't it.

of course, in the computer it's all ons and offs, charged and not charged,
zeros and ones. code. mixed with language. codes for one form of language
mixing with those of another. sound with visuals. with text. with video.

text has tended to appear mostly on paper. where it can exist with images
(is an image, of course) but not with sound. and text has not been a
significant part of cinema, for the most part, because it's usually for the
mind's eye. which mostly is disregarded in cinema which may be one of the
reasons i usually find cinema thin. but there's time for text in computer
art. video can be viewed and text read in different spaces of the same work.

one can mix media spaces or keep them separate but have numerous different
ones. for text, sound, image, video/animation, interaction, communication.
semiotically very rich.

when we experience this in computer art or installation work, when written
language is operating in some sense simultaneously or in strong relation
with other types of signs, we sense the existence of other types of language
operating here and, as you say, a kind of "mutation of linguistic DNA" in
the cross-products of these previously mostly separate forms of
language/code/communication.

writers are in an excellent position to deal with this. because writing is
so crucial to the coding of it all. in programming, one may be writing that
which creates or synthesizes visuals or texts or sounds or communication
conduits or videos or some combination of them, but one is writing.

Connections: Exploring the Relationship between Poetry and Music
with Daniel Godston at Woodland Pattern Book Center, Milwaukee, WI
Saturday, July 19, 1-4pm
$35 / $30 members

Daniel Godston There are many deep connections between poetry and
music. Imagery, metaphor, meter, and tone are several poetic elements
by which those connections can be explored. Jazz, blues, rock and
roll, and other musical genres have provided inspiration for poets,
over the years. Sometimes poetry has provided inspiration for music,
sometimes music has inspired poetry, and other times the inspirational
flow moves back and forth between poetry and music. We will write
poems that explore these connections and read several poems that
connect with music, including those by Harryette Mullen, Jayne Cortez,
Sterling Plumpp, Sun Ra, Ed Roberson, and Steve Dalachinsky. In
addition we will discuss our personal experiences collaborating with
poetry and music.

Daniel Godston teaches, writes, and creates music in Chicago. His
poetry and fiction have appeared in Chase Park, Versal, Drunken Boat,
580 Split, Kyoto Journal, Eratica, California Quarterly, after hours,
Moria, Sentinel Poetry, and other print publications and online
journals, and his nonfiction has appeared in print and websites such
as Teaching Artist Journal, Afropop Worldwide, and The Jazz Institute
of Chicago's JazzGram. His poem "Mask to Skin to Blood to Heart to
Bone and Back" was nominated by the editors of 580 Split for the
Pushcart Prize. In February 2007 he curated the Forth Sound Back
event, in the Red Rover Series. He works with the Borderbend Arts
Collective to organize the Chicago Calling Arts Festival.

http://amyking.wordpress.com/2008/06/12/poetry-exercises-wanted/

Thanks to all who have contributed their awesome suggestions to this thread -- internet searches have already brought folks to this growing resource in search of poetry exercises ... not only for their classes, but also to kick start their own muses into putting pen to paper!

I'll be in touch with people about the "prizes", which I have in spades, thankfully,  because it looks like I'll be using quite a few of these next month!

Thanks again, and feel free to add to the list if you haven't already!

Best,

friends~

tuesday, june 17th, 7pm, @ quimby's bookstore <http://www.quimbys.com/>, in
chicago:

Join authors/poets *Kathleen Rooney*, *Jasmine Dreame Wagner* and *Samuel
Wharton* as they read from their new books.

*Kathleen Rooney* was born in Beckley, West Virginia and raised in the
Midwest. She earned a B.A. from the George Washington University and an
M.F.A. in Writing, Literature, and Publishing from Emerson College. Along
with Elisa Gabbert, she is the author of the collaborative poetry chapbook
Something Really Wonderful and the collection That Tiny Insane
Voluptuousness. Her poems have appeared in AGNI online, 32 Poems, and
Cincinnati Review, and her essays have appeared in Gulf Coast, Gettysburg
Review, Ninth Letter, Southern Humanities Review and Another Chicago
Magazine. She currently lives in Chicago with her husband, the writer Martin
Seay.

Jasmine Dreame Wagner is a recent graduate of the MFA program at the
University of Montana - Missoula. Her poems have appeared in journals such
as Verse, American Letters & Commentary, Colorado Review, Indiana Review,
Seattle Review, North American Review, Columbia Review, 32 Poems, and
others. A graduate of Columbia University, she was a writer-in-residence at
The Hall Farm Center for Arts & Education in Townshend, Vermont. Her
chapbook, "Charcoal," surveys and deconstructs the language and visual field
of the American urban ruin from the remains of the 9/11 site and the
Greenpoint Terminal Market fire to the eroded mines and mills of the former
western frontier. "Charcoal" was published this spring in collaboration with
printmaker Matthew Trygve Tung and is part of a commission on the behalf of
Windows Gallery (formerly PS2 Gallery) in Long Island City, New York. Wagner
also performs in the experimental folk collective Cabinet of Natural
Curiosities.

Samuel Wharton <http://www.samuelwharton.blogspot.com/> has recently
published poems in *Blackbox*, *The Concher*, *Death Metal Poetry*, *NOO
Journal*, *Open Letters Monthly*, *Otoliths* & *Redivider*. He is the author
of a chapbook -- *Welcome Home* (NeOPepper Press, 2007) -- & editor of the
poetry journal *Sawbuck* <http://www.sawbuckpoetry.blogspot.com/>.
i, especially, don't read much, so this might be your only chance to hear me
in the near future!

see you there?

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The editors at Reconfigurations, http://reconfigurations.blogspot.com/,
are developing a special feature to be published in volume two (November,
2008) on the general topic of simultaneous submissions and e-journals.  We
would be interested to receive any of the following forms of work that
specifically address that topic:

* essays
* dialogues (collaboratively written, etc.)
* interviews
* brief statements
* manifestos
* multi-media and/or hybrid forms

What are the current politics of simultaneous submission in the field of
arts & letters electronic journals?  What does the process contribute to
the field?  How and why does simultaneous submission either invigorate or
enervate the work that writers, editors, and readers may choose to do?

* Submission deadline: August 31.

* Electronic Submissions: showard@du.edu. Submissions should be attached
as a single .doc, .rtf, .pdf or .txt file. Visuals should be attached
individually as .jpg, .gif or .bmp files. Please include the word
submission in the subject line of your message.

Recently  I and my partner, Sandy, were in the Yucatan for 10 days. Charles Olson's MAYAN LETTERS (1953) to Robert Creeley were a kind of ironic talisman. It was an extraordinary trip. Currently on my blog there are photographs, reflections and commentaries on and with various sites along the way. I welcome your responses. I encourage a trip there, too. Only over a 1,000 ruins there! And those curious enslaving, culturally genocidal Spaniards, Dominicans et al.

 Enjoy and, as always, appreciate your comments.

I. Two Vladimirs at the Window
Small lives, small lives,
we are trapped inside
small lives. Call this window
a prison of rotten wood; the hinges
a broken lock that still won’t release us.
Call us the curse of clouded mirrors,
the blank faces of the soul
stuck inside an old kaleidoscope.
Small lives, small lives. We hum and chant
to the silence outside the frame.



The first lines in Linda Nemec Foster’s Ten Songs from Bulgaria, sing 'Small lives, small lives/ we are trapped inside/ small lives.' The paradox here is that Foster’s poems reveal how large and rich the worlds are in which these small lives are lived. In line after line, we encounter the depths and reach of those who live outside the zones of everyday safety. Foster makes herself vulnerable to a world 'as tangible as fog' with her own penetrating observations. She walks 'the long journey' and her poems reflect the haunting music of ode and elegy.
-Jack Ridl
These poems evoke--in their concision and clarity--intense, disturbing images of lives shredded into pieces so small all that’s left is the memory of having endured. They are caged inside the empty space of the page, which seems to want to suffocate their spare, fragile, incredible beauty. Each image speaks a world that is window and mirror of what we hide from in the fabricated assemblages we make against the truth these poems speak.
-Faye Kicknosway
Linda Nemec Foster is the author of seven books of poetry including Living in the Fire Nest (a finalist for the Poet’s Prize) and Amber Necklace from Gdansk (a finalist for the Ohio Book Award in Poetry). Her most recent book, Listen to the Landscape, was short-listed for the 2007 Michigan Notable Book Award. Foster’s poems have appeared in over 250 magazines and journals including The Georgia Review, Nimrod, North American Review, and New American Writing. Her collaboration with jazz musician Steve Talaga, Contemplating the Heavens, was nominated for the 2007 Pulitzer Prize in Music. She has been the recipient of honors from the Michigan Council for the Arts, the Arts Foundation of Michigan, the National Writer’s Voice, and the Academy of American Poets. From 2003-2005 she served as the first poet laureate of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Foster is the founder of the Contemporary Writers Series at Aquinas College and currently is a member of the Series’ programming committee.

Hi Everyone-

Sign-up for the Cervena Barva Press Newsletter. Every month there is a featured interview by a poet, fiction writer, editor, publisher or a playwright.
You can read past interviews in our archive without having to go through all the previous newsletters at: http://www.cervenabarvapress.com/interviews.htm

The interview list will be updated shortly so check back after browsing in a few weeks and you will see more.

The interviews are not lengthy.  I give each person the option to write as much or as little as they want about each question.

For all writers with chapbooks and books:

Besides being editor of Cervena Barva Press and publishing books, I offer a service to all writers for selling their chapbooks and books.

I found as a writer myself, it is difficult to find a distributor or get a bigger audience to know that you have a book out for sale.  Because of this, I started an online bookstore called, The Lost Bookshelf.  It is a bookstore where authors can sell their poetry, fiction, plays, memoir, and non-fiction
on consignment.  The bookstore takes 30% of each sale and you get the rest.

Visit our bookstore and on the homepage, scroll to the bottom and click on,
how to submit your books.  Please follow this if you send books.  Allow
2-3 weeks for your book to be listed though we try to have it up online much sooner.  More importantly, DO NOT pack your books in newspapers.
The ink bleeds all over the books.  Any books that arrive damaged will automatically be returned.  We only want your books if they are in excellent condition!  Please pack them correctly.
To read more, visit the bookstore at: http://www.thelostbookshelf.com/index.html

I really hope you will check our bookstore out.  With the closing of so many independent bookstores, I hope you will take advantage of this.  The only thing we ask in return for putting the books online is that you put a link to our bookstore on your Webpage/Blog if you have one.  If you don't have these, it is still ok to send books.

Finally, we also have a small used book section.  There is only one copy of these books.  We will be adding many more next month.  Authors sending books takes first priority being put online over the used books.

Questions: customerservice@thelostbookshelf.com

Since we are busy, please allow a few days for response.  Thanks!

Best,
Gloria Mindock

If Argentina thinks paying homage to a murderous thug whose ideology has no relation to reality and which results in the impoverishment and dehumanization of millions is appropriate, shame on them.

That's Unnameable Books depicted on that cover, by the by.  And a taller,
handsomer version of myself.

Adrian Tomine, my erstwhile next-door neighbor who made that cover, has done
a number of excellent New Yorker covers exploring the erotics of books.
He's also a first-rate graphic novelist.

what do you think we have running the show here?

and not only here but all the thugs we shell billions out to every year--

governments, privatized "security forces," war lords, runners of secret
torture prisons, drug cartels, Apartheid, death squads--

look at the thugs Bush and the Candidates for President pay homage to--and
that pay homage to them--

and to whom the American citizens are supposed to pay homage to--

and then take a look in the mirror--

we're footing the bill for the impoverishment, dehumanization, massacres,
starvations, displacements --of millions daily--

at home and abroad--

more Americans are in prison both in a total number (two million-plus) and
as a percentage of population than any nation in the world--

more Americans are living in dehumanizing poverty daily--more Americans are
dope addicts than anywhere else in the world--the list is long of all the
wonderful thuggeries visited on the citizens by their own State--which in
turn supports every sort of monster and monstrosity it can in the name of
"democracy"--what is anyone supposed to think the US's word means anymore re
"Civil Rights" when it backs Apartheid or "Human Rights" when it runs
torture prisons of its own and via surrogates around the world?

the US backed the dictatorship in Argentina during which tens of thousands
of people were tortured and "disappeared--

why bother with monuments to a specific thug anymore?

why not just a colossal monstrosity of a Thug, resplendent, reflecting the
twilight's last gleamings--

a truly Great Thug to Last The Ages--

it's eyes turned heavenward and its boots resting on the skulls of children
"left behind"--

melt down al the statues of the Lesser Thugs in the land and just pour them
all into the casting for this one this only this First and Last

President Thug--

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

combinatorium: a combinatorial space.

consider that which can be created with a software tool. contrast and
compare with what can be produced by/with a work of software art.

the scope of possibilities in a tool is, typically, broader. word (the word
processor) can represent most documents. whereas we might liken the scope of
a software work of art to that of the sonnet. a software work of art is
concerned to create a combinatorium of possibilities that is of interest as
an artistic form.

one considers the entire combinatorium, the entire range of possible works
that can be created with the software work of art as the work itself
together with the software.

were one to write some software that wrote sonnets, one would not consider
all sonnets to be part of the work. not only because hundreds of thousands
of people have previously written millions of sonnets. but because the range
of the sonnet, the scope of its combinatorium, is broader than what is
typically creatable with a work of software art.

no, that's not true. it's not that the scope of the sonnet is broader.
people tolerate less difference between sonnets than they do between
instances of a new form. part of the idea of software art is to provide some
sense of the whole combinatorium of the form under consideration. whereas
that was never really part of the idea of the form of the sonnet.

if the idea of software art is not to exhaust the form under consideration,
it is to astutely and perhaps beautifully map it out.

the monkey-at-a-typewriter (or at a whatever) approach to generation seems
to have been done. even the monkeys are bored by it, by now. one is more
concerned with the work of software art concentrating on producing
interesting things more often than the monkeys can manage. john simon did
"every icon" ( http://numeral.com/appletsoftware/online.html ). somebody had
to do it. the monkey has been done. the monkey approach now must function
like a literary device functions, ie, as a part, rather than as a whole
work. it isn't interesting as a whole work anymore.

a tool usually does not provide much of the content of what's produced with
it. whereas a software work of art, even when it resembles a tool in many
ways, may introduce elements of content either without the user's permission
(generatively) or after asking the user in a kind of
collaborative/interactive gesture.

more notes to follow, perhaps, as they occur to me

Dear Fluffy,

I also, and I imagine a host of others, would be very interested to read
your conference notes - often there are no transcript notes, or if there are
it is difficult to get hold of them, and many important, watershed
conferences are missed by many who would be inspired by and their work
benefit from such information, so, go for it, put your notes - or selected
notes - up on UB Poetics, "you know it makes sense".  Many thanks in
anticipation.

Roy Exley.

Poet, and Polymath Hugh Fox: Still a Wunderkind at 76

With Doug Holder



  At the Sherman Caf=E9 in Union Square, I met poet, translator, critic,=20=

playwright, Hugh Fox and his wife before a taping we were  to do at Somer=
ville=20
Community Access TV of my show  =93 Poet to Poet: Writer to Writer.=94 Fo=
x was=20
visiting his daughter who lives in Somerville and teaches at area univers=
ities.=20
Two of my next-door neighbors Kirk and Lucy joined us as Fox held court. =
At=20
age 76 Fox no signs of slowing down. He regaled us with stories of his=20=

extensive travels, all peppered with his vast wealth of knowledge of anci=
ent=20
Aztec culture, mythology, literature, and publishing. Fox talks like a Br=
onx=20
cabdriver, (decidedly from the side-of-his mouth,) and he is not afraid t=
o use,=20
to put it mildly, unsavory language. My friend described him as =93Larger=
 than=20
life.=94 And so he is.

  Fox, who was a tenured professor at the University of Michigan for well=
 over=20
30 years, recently completed a controversial memoir =93Way, Way Off the R=
oad=94=20
(Ibbetson Street) that dealt with many of the figures from the small pres=
s=20
movement, a movement that has produced thousands of small literary=20
magazines and books, and is the lifeblood of poets and writers of all str=
ipes.=20
Fox was a founding member of COSMEP, (a seminal small press organization)=
,=20
he published the well regarded literary magazine =93Ghost Dance,=94and pe=
nned=20
the first critical study of the dirty old man of literature himself, Char=
les=20
Bukowski. Fox has written and published many booksandchapbooks of poetry,=
=20
and has reviewed countless small press books for Len Fulton=92s =93Small =
Press=20
Review.=94



Doug Holder: Hugh you wrote critical studies of Henry James and Charles=20=

Bukowski, two vastly different writers. Whom did you have the greater aff=
inity=20
for?
.


Hugh Fox: I got my PhD from the University of Illinois and my dissertatio=
n was=20
on Edgar Allen Poe. I was raised as an Irish Catholic, and all I read was=
 Irish=20
Catholic literature. I had no idea what was in the outside world. I decid=
ed to=20
take on Henry James because it would be an Americanization process and I=20=

thought I would learn to write novels. I did like James=92 work a lot.

 I never intended to get involved with Bukowski. I was totally academic. =
And=20
then one day I was in this bookstore in Hollywood, the =93Pickwick,=94 (I=
 saw=20
Aldous Huxley at the store that day as well. I was reading him for years.=
=20
There was this old woman standing next to me, and I said to her: =93Look=20=

there=92s Aldous Huxley!=94 She said: =93 Don=92t know what you are sayin=
g!=94 He heard=20
us and then  vanished!) So I bought Bukowski=92s book: =93Crucifix and th=
e Death=20
Hand.=94  I got a hold of his press LouJon in New Orleans, and they told =
me to=20
look him up in the phonebook. So I called him up and said: =93This is Hug=
h Fox. I=20
love your work. I want to meet you.=94 He said OK come over tomorrow. He =
was=20
living in a motel in Hollywood. I talked with him awhile. He took out the=
se=20
suitcases. There were all his books and magazines in them. He gave me fiv=
e=20
full suitcases. He told me if I saw doubles to keep them. My entire way o=
f=20
seeing the world changed after this. Bukowski and Henry Miller were big=20=

influences of change for me.

 DH: You were friends with Harry Smith, the book publisher, and founder=20=

of =93The Smith=94 magazine. Smith published such writers as: Duane Locke=
, Ruth=20
Moon Kempher, John Bennett, Lloyd Van Brunt, Jeff Sorensen, Alan Britt, a=
nd=20
Tristram Smith as well as my friends Luke Salisbury and Jared Smith. Can =
you=20
talk about your relationship with Smith?

Hugh Fox:  I=92ll tell you what happened. Smith had no money at all. He m=
eets=20
Marian Pechak up in Rhode Island at Brown. So he marries her. Her parents=
 die=20
and she gets millions. So they move to Brooklyn Heights. They had a big=20=

Brownstone mansion. So Smith tells her he wants to be a publisher. His wi=
fe=20
said:=94 Hey, we have the money do what you want to do=94. So he started =
to=20
publish. He had an office right by City Hall in New York City. I met Smit=
h=20
through COSMEP. I used to go to Smith=92s all the time. I go between=20
semesters, the summer; I=92d go for a month a year for twenty years. Smit=
h=20
published everyone who was anyone. I did a lot of reviews for him. He pai=
d=20
me=97I stayed at his house=97he set up the basement for me. We used to go=
=20
out for lunch and dinner. His wife told the kids to call me: =93Uncle Hug=
h.=94 I was=20
closer to Smith than anyone else. Through him I met Menke Katz who was a=20=

Yiddish writer.=20

DH: You edited the groundbreaking anthology =93The Living Underground,=94=
 that=20
our Boston Poet Laureate Sam Cornish was in. How did you get this collect=
ion=20
together?

HF: It was formed due to my connection with COSMEP. This was=20
the =93Committee of Small Press Editors and Publishers.=94 Len Fulton and=
 others=20
formed it in the early 70=92s. Len Fulton still runs the magazine =93The =
Small Press=20
Review and =93Dustbooks Publishing=94 in Paradise, California. COSMEP use=
d to=20
have annual conventions around the country: St. Paul, New York, and New=20=

Orleans. Every convention had a huge reading. Almost every small press ed=
itor=20
in the country was there. I got to meet all the writers and all the publi=
shers. I=20
got to know people in Boston, and of course Sam Cornish was in Boston, an=
d=20
as it happened he was included in  =93The Living Underground=85=94 He was=
 at the=20
convention in Boston.

DH: What is an =93underground poet?=94

HF: Someone who is not published by the big New York publishers.

DH: What was =93groundbreaking=94 about the anthology?

HF: We had living, contemporary small press poets. We had folks like Char=
les=20
Potts, Richard Krech, and many others. We had a reunion almost forty year=
s=20
later in Berkley, Ca.

DH: How did you get involved with the small press literary award the =93P=
ushcart=20
Prize?=94

HF: I got involved through a COSMEP conference in New Orleans. The Prize=20=

doesn=92t have as much impact as it did in the day. I go to a Barnes and =
Noble=20
today and nobody is
buying anything, everyone is there with his or her computer. Everyone is=20=

having coffee with their computers.


DH:  Hugh you are the most prolific reviewer I know. How did you get=20=20=

involved with reviewing books, and why do you spend so much time on an=20=

activity that doesn=92t provide you with monetary compensation?

HF: I became good friends with Len Fulton of the Small Press Review. Now,=
=20
every four months or so I get a package of books to read. It=92s good for=
 me=20
because I get to find out what=92s going on with the poets. It influences=
 my=20
style=97all these poets I read. It helps me get my name in the Small Pres=
s=20
Review all the time. I want to be involved.

DH: Your are the doyen of the short review. How are you able to get to th=
e=20
essence of a book with such few words?

HF: Before I go to bed I always read a few things. Then I just react to i=
t. It=92s=20
funny it is like I listen to an inner voice. The inner voice tells me wha=
t to=20
write. The reason I got a degree in American Literature was really to lea=
rn=20
how to write reviews of books.  To react to books. My first draft of my P=
oe=20
dissertation was horrible. My advisor said as much. He told me that I was=
=20
going to write his way. He said: =93 You are going to react, feel, and so=
 forth. I=20
learned to react. I learned this from academic teaching.

DH: You said you always considered yourself a  wunderkind, a boy genius.=20=

How about now at 76?

HF: The same at 76. I haven=92t aged mentally or psychologically. I=92m s=
till 26. I=20
may have cancer of the prostate, arthritis, but my mind is the same. When=
 I=20
was in California recently I wrote 100 poems in two weeks.

DH:  What do you want your legacy to be?

HF: I haven=92t thought about it. I would like to see other people do the=
 same=20
thing. I want them to react to the world around them.

Doubtless part of a corporate move, these accolades . . . are doubtless a t=
op-off to the continuing successful US hamburger trade.  A golfing trophy. =
 Didn't Che play golf? Or was that baseball?  Or was that Castro, in fact, =
and not Che? Well, harmless enough, to any end.  But where's the beef?  In =
a world where third-world Marxist politicos and Muslim radicals like nothin=
g better (and perhaps rightfully so) than to inject western white women wit=
h Revolutionary Serum (the bumper stickers in Rihyad just after 9/11 read "=
Osama/Madonna"), Argentina's homage to Che in retrospect hardly comes up to=
 the level of "The Seven Year Itch."  And I don't mean Marilyn.  I mean, Su=
ez.  The really high-octane shit.  To move things a little further east alo=
ng the Argentinian-Afghani fault line, does anyone on this list know how mu=
ch crude is pumped through Kharg Island on a daily basis?  With all due res=
pect.  Or, as Marlene Dietrich duly noted, in and about Hollywood premises,=
 wherever there was a camera rolling, there you would find Cary Grant, famo=
us, and on the run to get in front of it.  Self-justification can always be=
en made to look like a mild form of justice.  Roll 'em.

All reasons why I oppose the dehumanizing forces of Marxism, fascism, socialism, welfare statism. The neoconservatives were all former Marxists, and they didn't leave behind their dehumanizing world view. The difference between McCain and Obama is that Obama doesn't realize yet that he shares the same military ideology as McCain -- which he will if he is elected President, just like Clinton embraced the international policies of Bush I when he took office.

This is why when Argentina or anyplace else does something shameful like erect a status to someone who hated mankind as much as that murderous thug Che Guevara, I say so. No one anywhere should celebrate that man who was little more than a waste of oxygen when he was alive. All he did was make the world a worse place. What are you doing to make it better (better based on reality, and not on so called good intentions, which are worthless without reality behind it and lead you to good results)?

what do you think we have running the show here?

and not only here but all the thugs we shell billions out to every year--

governments, privatized "security forces," war lords, runners of secret
torture prisons, drug cartels, Apartheid, death squads--

look at the thugs Bush and the Candidates for President pay homage to--and
that pay homage to them--

and to whom the American citizens are supposed to pay homage to--

and then take a look in the mirror--

we're footing the bill for the impoverishment, dehumanization, massacres,
starvations, displacements --of millions daily--

at home and abroad--

more Americans are in prison both in a total number (two million-plus) and
as a percentage of population than any nation in the world--

more Americans are living in dehumanizing poverty daily--more Americans are
dope addicts than anywhere else in the world--the list is long of all the
wonderful thuggeries visited on the citizens by their own State--which in
turn supports every sort of monster and monstrosity it can in the name of
"democracy"--what is anyone supposed to think the US's word means anymore re
"Civil Rights" when it backs Apartheid or "Human Rights" when it runs
torture prisons of its own and via surrogates around the world?

the US backed the dictatorship in Argentina during which tens of thousands
of people were tortured and "disappeared--

why bother with monuments to a specific thug anymore?

why not just a colossal monstrosity of a Thug, resplendent, reflecting the
twilight's last gleamings--

a truly Great Thug to Last The Ages--

it's eyes turned heavenward and its boots resting on the skulls of children

If it were Argentina, perhaps, there'd be something to shame. But we're
really talking about Rosario, and more precisely, we're probably talking
about the town council of Rosario, not Buenos Aires, and certainly not all
of Argentina.

Dear Fluffy.

I found your report extremely interesting, thanks for the link to the post.

Also  wondering if you had a chance to take a look at the Vispo exhibit at
the Conference, and if you had any thoughts about that. I sent three visual
poetry pieces out there and have been wondering what the reactions were.


Best,

Tamiko Beyer's work has appeared numerous journals including Calyx, Crab Orchard Review, Gay and Lesbian Review, The Progressive, and the anthology Cheers to Muses: Contemporary Work by Asian American Women. She is a Kundiman Fellow and a member of Agent 409, a multi-racial, queer writing group based in New York City. Through the NY Writers Coalition, she leads writing workshops for homeless LGBTQ youth, and she works as a freelance writer. She will be pursing an M.F.A. at the Writing Program at Washington University in St. Louis, beginning in the fall.

Ana Bozicevic emigrated to NYC from Croatia in 1997. She's the author of chapbooks Document (Octopus Books, 2007) and Morning News (Kitchen Press, 2006). Fresh poems are forthcoming in the Denver Quarterly, Hotel Amerika, absent, typo, and elsewhere. Ana co-edits RealPoetik with Caroline Conway.

Poet, writer and radical cineaste Tisa Bryant makes work that often traverses the boundaries of genre, culture and history.  Her first book, Unexplained Presence (Leon Works, 2007), is a collection of hybrid essays that remix master narratives in film, literature and visual arts to zoom in on the black presences operating within them.   She teaches writing at St. John's University, Queens, lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and is a founding editor/publisher of the hardcover annual, The Encyclopedia Project.

Daniel Lin has published poems in Chelsea, Verse, Washington Square, Agni and Indiana Review, as well as a chapbook, Tinder, with Nightboat Books.

Due to time constraints and inevitable overlaps, a lot of important
discussions were missed or cut short at the recent NPF "Poetry of the
1970s" Conference in Orono, Maine. This is not at all peculiar to the
conference, which most everyone I spoke with agreed was very well run,
and a welcomed, rare opportunity to share scholarship, new and old work,
and off hours. Conference organizer Steve Evans wrote to participants
about the "Thought Mesh" site for the NPF, where abstracts and/or papers
can be posted. I want to encourage others to post their work. Free
access to scholarship seems like a good thing, in principle.
Facilitating access for those who were asking similar questions from
different cardinal points of the campus seems like a "no-brainer" also.
Since my own presentation was cut in half, I wanted to point out that
the whole text is sitting there in Thoughtmesh for all the world to see,
at http://vectors.usc.edu/thoughtmesh/publish/60.php

Here's the abstract:

This paper reads Jackson Mac Low's work of the 1970s as a hinge between
the intermedia and early procedural practices for which he is best known
and the work of the 1980s, where a self-consciously literary practice
resonates with the ideo-linguistic experiments of Language Writing.
Beginning with a hypothetical list of the common hallmarks of
literariness from a Mac Lowian point of view, the article then reads the
"Odes for Iris Lezak" and "Phone" comparatively. This reading is
situated beside a debate between Mac Low and Silliman in the pages of
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E in order to illustrate the decade as pivotal with
respect to the aesthetico-political predicates of literariness.

Here are some blogland reports, though there will surely be others:

Thursday - Sunday    June 26, 27, 28, 29
THEATERLAB – 137 W 14th St. (between 6th and 7th Aves)
all performances  8 PM      $15
reservations recommended
Smarttix  https://www.smarttix.com/show.aspx?showCode=NON1
or the Theaterlab box office: 212-929-2545

Nonviolent executions, Steve Ben Israel’s one-man show, is his latest
séance to contact the living. A series of short takes combining humor,
poetry, stories of rare poignancy, and his virtuosic acting abilities,
nonviolent executions is an evening of entertainment with extraordinary
intelligence and heart.

Mr. Israel started working as a comedian almost 50 years ago, then joined
The Living Theatre and for many years toured this country, Europe, North
Africa and Brazil as a leading actor in that ground-breaking group. More
recently, he has performed extensively on the downtown scene, in such
venues as The Kitchen, The Performing Garage, and The Nuyorican Poets
Café, and has appeared in movies by Bertolucci, been a featured artist on
recordings by Frederic Rzewski and Anthony Braxton, and has been a guest
commentator on NPR’s All Things Considered.

In nonviolent execution, Israel comes full circle, to inhabit the city of
his waking dreams and nightmares and confront the beauty, the horror and
the possibilities of “the island that creates the spice that gives much
of the country its flavor.”

When he finds communality with an immigrant cab driver, a cashier at the
phone company, or an old jazz hand, he touches something in us all. When
he tells his audience that he doesn’t “like the way white people are
portrayed in movies,” he is completely sincere. When he sings the
cantonal “Ballad of Black, White, and Jew,” sadness and hope ride a North
African musical motif from hidden grief to deliverance.

Steve Ben Israel would present an audience’s most generous face to
itself. If he pierces the slick armor masquerading as sense in our time
with jolts of love and compassion, it is only his compulsion and our deep
pleasure to be so subjected.

Steve is a 2007 Obie Award winner and recently performed Frederick
Rzewski’s Attica at Carnegie Hall.

I'm forwarding this announcement.
http://www.liverpool-unipress.co.uk/html/publication.asp?idProduct=3856


Journal of Literary & Cultural Disability Studies

I am writing to let you know that in 2009 the groundbreaking Journal
of Literary Disability is moving to Liverpool University Press under
the new title Journal of Literary & Cultural Disability Studies. It
will continue to focus on the literary representation of disability,
but cultural studies will now be added to the multidisciplinary mix.

With an editorial board of 50 internationally renowned scholars, the
journal is central to the literary disability movement that is
changing the face of literary studies on a global scale.

The exciting news is that from 2009 the journal will be published 3
times per annum and available in print and online formats .

The first issue in the new format, JLCDS 3.1: Deleuze, Disability and
Difference, will be a special issue, guest edited by Dr. Petra
Kuppers, Associate Professor of English, Theatre, and Women's Studies,
University of Michigan; and Dr. James Overboe, Assistant Professor of
Sociology, Wilfrid Laurier University. Many disability scholars have
been wary of utilizing poststructuralism as a means to disrupt
ableism. But there is much nuance in poststructuralist thought and its
relation to representational politics, and JLCDS 3.1 hopes to push
disability studies further along its journey into this territory.

For more information on the journal and how to subscribe, please see
the attached leaflet. For information on any Liverpool University
Press journals, please do not hesitate to contact me.

With best wishes,

=93What a necessary poem this is, as USAmericans look for a new =
President and
Cubans without Castro try to keep what they have so hard-won. The =
grotesque
dead hand of Fulgencio Batista y Zald=EDvar and the deadening grasp of =
the
United Fruit Company, tyrannies of the past right here right now, wrong =
now,
wrong always, implacably here always, the raw sugar of greed lurking =
beneath
the poem's flat matter-of-fact absurdity, grim comedy's helpless outrage
skittering over monstrous abuse of capital power. Compelling writing, =
the
links between poetry and the political here inescapable. Bowering at his
best.=94

I don't know if masturbation poems would be what you are looking for, but
Harry Mathews (NY School poet) published an entire book of poems about
masturbation called, Singular Pleasures, all short prose poems.=20

Hi,

=20

I am taking the opportunity of Patrick Durgin's posting about the recent
Orono conference to the listserv (see below) to mention that, as I
believe most everyone who might read this message would agree, the
National Poetry Foundation conferences have been both incredibly
important and incredibly enjoyable, and thus we should do what we can to
see that the conferences continue. The NPF conferences are unique and I
for one cherish them for all they have done for me.

=20

So, especially given that Burt Hatlen is no longer with us-and btw I
want to acknowledge Steve Evans, Jennifer Moxley, Ben Friedlander and
Carla Billitteri  for their efforts to make this recent conference a
smashing success-and given that we should not presume that funding for
NPF will automatically continue without Steve's and everyone's efforts
to see to it that it does, I urge everyone who attended the conference
to do two things:

=20

1)       Fill out the Conference Evaluation form that was in the
conference packet and send it to the address provided on that form

=20

and

=20

2)       Write a note, preferably on letterhead, to the president of the
University of Maine, saying how much his presence at the Friday evening
dinner, and the remarks he made then, were appreciated, and point out in
the letter the value of NPF and of its conferences (thereby suggesting
that NPF's mission needs to be supported in the future); since he was at
the dinner I think it would not be inappropriate to write to him, and
below is his address.

=20

Dr. Robert A. Kennedy, President

The University of Maine

The Office of the President

5703 Alumni Hall, Suite 200

Orono, Maine 04469

Best wishes to all,

Due to time constraints and inevitable overlaps, a lot of important=20

Beginning with a hypothetical list of the common hallmarks of=20

literariness from a Mac Lowian point of view, the article then reads the


"Odes for Iris Lezak" and "Phone" comparatively. This reading is=20

I am trying to figure out this query! Are your looking for sex poems performed while 'standing- up", or, non-sex poems performed while 'lying down.'

 Sorry if I sound possibly stupid, but I am 'positionally' confused by the question! However, if you are asking for poems which speak of lying about the quality of the sex, or lying to get sex or refuse sex,  that seems to me, another question, another level of consciousness. I am sure there are multiples of all of these. My daughter threw a birthday for herself and a friend in a Karioke Club the other night. I won't attest to the quality, but the monitors were overflowing with texts for every kind of love/sex you can imagine. All the singers managed to stay somewhat standing up performance after performance without fallng into each other on the floor. A miracle I thought!   (I add this on in case you are wondering where all the hot love poems -great or not - and writers of such - seem to have often gone!)

Obama claims 1.5 million donors, and that 90% of donations have been
under $100. Assuming that tallying each donation at $100 offsets
donors who have given small amounts more than once, 90% of donations
equals $150 million. But Obama has received total donations of $265
million, which means 10% of his donations equals $115 million. Since
he's opted out of public financing for the very principled reason
that he thinks he can do better, it would be good to know where all
those larger donations have come from.

I'll vote for him anyway, but he's not working real hard to make me
happy about it.

"The Man in the Booth in the Midtown Tunnel"
by Doug Holder




For years that image of the man in a small plastic booth in the fume-filled Midtown Tunnel that connects Queens to Manhattan in NYC haunted me. As a kid traveling into the city from the sheltered, well-manicured lawns of Long Island to the enigmatic, cosmopolitan world of Manhattan, I couldn't help but wonder about that blue- uniformed lone figure pacing the perimeter of his plastic cage. I think he represented to some extent my fear of the world outside the comforts of my family, and the staid, small town I lived in, Rockville Centre.
I have always admired writers like the New Yorker's Joseph Mitchell, who wrote about the outsiders, the denizens of the old Bowery, the ner-do-wells, the poseurs, the dandies, and the stumblebums, who make the city a both fascinating and frightened place. I always wondered as a kid if I would wind up in the middle of a metaphorical tunnel, a man in a cage, looking for the light. And I guess to some extent we all do in one-way or the other, whether we like it or not.
So I thought this image would be a perfect focal point for my poetry collection, a sort of "Spoon River Anthology" that would consist of character studies of the many men and women I have met, watched and imagined in my time across this stage. I include myself in this collection, because I have always identified with that man and I see his ghost wherever I roam.

(=93Killing Time at the 99).

Realistic sketches, but almost always with an underlying flow of melancho=
lia.=20
Which super-emphasizes the power of the sketches themselves. Never in the=
=20
psychopathological abstract,he nicely identifies with the proletarian ago=
nies,=20
looks at the Out There and totally can splice with it and its problems: =93=

Doug Holder is above all an urban poet, an observer chronicling the every=
day=20
sights and absurdities of Somerville, Boston and New York City in plain t=
alk=20
flavored with cool irony and sudden startling bursts of imagery. His sett=
ings=20
include hospital rooms, bars, coffee shops, Harvard Yard, the post office=
,=20
buses and subway trains, the Boston Public Library, Shea Stadium, housing=
=20
projects, city streets, and the Midtown Tunnel from Queens to Manhattan=20=

which is the location of the book=92s title poem. His characters are biza=
rre and=20
ordinary like all of us. Several of the poems are inspired by newspaper s=
tories=97
about a woman who sat on a toilet for two years in her boyfriend=92s apar=

about an old man who murdered his equally aged wife, about a middle aged=20=

man who died on a subway train: =93the Daily dropped/ From his hands. . .=

trains backed up/ From Cambridge to Dorchester.=94=20

I=92m reminded in the pages of this collection of meeting, a year or two =

her death, the artist Alice Neel, who painted gorgeously surreal ironic p=
ortraits=20
of famous and ordinary people in the 1930s and 40s--and shivering as she=20=

looked me over. Doug Holder looks at the world through a similarly sharp =

for=20
the helplessness of aging and of poverty, for physical and mental illness=
es, for=20
the complexity of family relations=97and most of all, for the isolation a=

However, let me assure you this is not a gloomy collection of poems. Ther=
e=20
are rich nuggets of humor and wry reflection throughout this collection a=
nd, to=20
combat the isolation of urban life, in almost every poem a relationship i=

between the observing eye and the subject of the poem. So, for example, a=

A few of the poems in this collection, like the one above, segue graceful=

troy,

This is amazing. After all this attack on "military idealogy," etc., you
want to tell a town in Argentina what statue to erect or not in its public
square. That's exactly the arrogant, interfering spirit that got us into
Iraq.

As for Obama and McCain being the same. I remember hearing a similar
argument when Bush and Gore were running, and someone called Nader gifted
the presidency to Bush.

Troy

You are taking out your personal hate against Che Guevara and I am amazed
that the POETICS moderators think it is perfect thing to do in a poets
e-group.

Seconding Chirot's response to your wrath on Guevera I would like to add
that as a romantic revolutionary, Che is still much loved and respected in
large parts of the world where the so-called "dehumanizing forces of
Marxism, socialism or facism" are not in play.....and by the way, you forgot
to add "capitalism" to that list.

Bringing up Obama/McCain/Clinton etc., or for that matter the whole
"special-cased" idealogy of what is called "bi-partisan democracy" here only
reinforces your rather stereotypical, culturally-biased viewpoint.

That man is still celebrated in multi-party democracies wider, bigger and
demographically and politically more diverse than the one you live in. And
this is the first time I hear Che getting hate from poets !!!

Check out world history - romantic revolutionaries at all times and places
have been "murderous thugs" or "cold blooded" in the least, at particular
times/events in their lifetime and perhaps it would be no crime to count
George Washington, Sri Aurobindo, Michael Collins or even Rene Char as some
of those.

All reasons why I oppose the dehumanizing forces of Marxism, fascism,
socialism, welfare statism. The neoconservatives were all former Marxists,
and they didn't leave behind their dehumanizing world view. The difference
between McCain and Obama is that Obama doesn't realize yet that he shares
the same military ideology as McCain -- which he will if he is elected
President, just like Clinton embraced the international policies of Bush I
when he took office.

This is why when Argentina or anyplace else does something shameful like
erect a status to someone who hated mankind as much as that murderous thug
Che Guevara, I say so. No one anywhere should celebrate that man who was
little more than a waste of oxygen when he was alive. All he did was make
the world a worse place. What are you doing to make it better (better based
on reality, and not on so called good intentions, which are worthless
without reality behind it and lead you to good results)?

However, if you are asking for poems which speak of lying about the quality of the sex, or lying to get sex or refuse sex,  that seems to me, another question, another level of consciousness. I am sure there are multiples of all of these. My daughter threw a birthday for herself and a friend in a Karioke Club the other night. I won't attest to the quality, but the monitors were overflowing with texts for every kind of love/sex you can imagine. All the singers managed to stay somewhat standing up performance after performance without fallng into each other on the floor. A miracle I thought!   (I add this on in case you are wondering where all the hot love poems -great or not - and writers of such - seem to have often gone!)

Hello everyone,

Coach House Books is very pleased to announce Rachel Zolf, author of
Human Resources, has won the Trillium Book Award for Poetry. The
Trillium Book Award for Poetry is awarded to one poetry collection in
Ontario published  the previous year. The winners of the 2008
Trillium Book Awards were announced by Ontario Minster of Culture
Aileen Carroll at a luncheon hosted by the Ontario Media Development
Corporation on Thursday, June 12.

The Trillium judges' citation:

'With biting satire and appropriate outrage, Rachel Zolf's tour de
force collection examines the newspeak network of commerce, branding
and the internet and pinpoints the spaces inside language where it
intersects, exploits, collides, and attacks individual conscience and
public consciousness. Bracing, funny, ominous, and completely
original, Human Resources looks at our degraded argot from the
inside, exposing its manipulations and manipulators while it urgently
plots an eleventh-hour escape route.'


For more information about Human Resources, the Trillium win, and to
read the text of Rachel Zolf's great acceptance speech, visit http://

Heidi Arnold has asked me to post the following announcement to the List.

Orders for the book can be sent to teecnospas AT gmail DOT com


Colleagues and Friends,

the memoir written for my husband, _Silent Road, Aspen
Echo_, will be
released in 150 numbered, hand lettered manuscript copies
this summer.  each
copy will be hand lettered, numbered and signed by the
author.  i do not
plan more than 150 copies and consider this a limited
edition with no
reprint in future.

my funds have been cut off through varieties of
governmental red tape, which
i believe is due to my human rights activism, and for which
reason i am
forced to ask for pre-orders.  $45. per copy.  postage in
addition, since i
will be in transit, postage costs will vary.  expect one
week from receipt
of order to the mailing of the book, unless everyone orders
at the same time
in which a bit of patience will be required.  paypal in
most cases on
american dollars.  please ask if the price is a matter of
difficulty due to
artistic work on a full-time professional basis.

the memoir spans my solo trip through the U.K. and Europe
in which i
journeyed immediately following my husband's death to
talk to his spirit,
and honor his life, and it is the first book of a two-book
biographical set
written for him.  november 2007-may 2008.  the second book
will be more
historical in nature and more scholarly.

There's a tricky new online magazine that works some of the conceptual
digs that magazines like Soft Targets, Cabinet and the Paul Ford-wing
of Harper's Online have been staking out this century (in fact, a few
of the editors have had gigs at those kindred publications). The joint
is called Triple Canopy, dark nod to the private defense contractor of
the same name. They've had a few recent coups, including an interview
with foreign policy provacateuse Samantha Power and the first complete
English translation of the Chilean novelist Roberto Bola=F1o's 1999
speech accepting the R=F3mulo Gallegos Prize.

This month in Issue #2 they feature the Poetic Research Bureau
extensively, focusing on the Bureau's concern with derivate poetries
and unoriginal literature. This includes contributions from the three
directors (Mosconi, Shirinyan and Maxwell), and the summer issue of
the quarterly PRB's Directors' Dispatch, the first of several, which
may serve as seasonal statements of intent.

Triple Canopy editors will be visiting LA next weekend, June 27th -
29th, and have an Issue #2 launch at SiteLA on Friday night, plus a
contributor's reading at Family Bookstore on Fairfax Sunday evening.
PRB co-director Andrew Maxwell will be reading from the Literary
Product Trials on Sunday at the bookstore event.

Caute, and breathe,
The Directors

(The PRB's Western Office is part of "Upper Limit Los Angeles," a
curious constellation of very loosely affiliated venues that have
cropped up recently in Northeast LA that host public events
emphasizing conceptual, speculative and international language arts.)

KAURAB Online Translation Archive (http://www.kaurab.com/english) is about
to launch an international book review series called BOOK OPENER. We invite
poets, authors, anthology editors and presses to submit international poetry
(in English,  original and/or translation/transcreation) publications for
review. The idea of this series is to present international poetry reviews.
The reviewers are mostly North American poets/editors. American poetry is
also welcome. We will have a limited space for canonical work.

The book review series will acommodate a wide range of review styles from
conventionally academic to dandily creative. We plan to include multimedia
interactions and creative co-authoring. If you wish to submit a copy of your
book/anthology, please send an email to editor@kaurab.com with "BOOK
OPENER-<book title>" in the subject.

If the book cannot be reviewed for reasons beyond our control we will mail
it back to you.

Dear POGGers and friends of POG

POG's fiscal year closes June 30, and we need roughly $ 800 in additional
income to balance our annual budget.

As you know, POG has been presenting a terrific program of formally
innovative poetry and multidisciplinary art in Tucson for more than a decade
now.  Our all-volunteer organization stays afloat from a combination of arts
council grants, event admission charges, occasional fundraising events, and,
significantly, individual donations.

A donation of $ 100 or more makes you a POG Patron; $ 50 makes you a
Sponsor.

Please consider donating to POG in the next several days to help make our
wonderful programming sustainable.

POG is a federally recognized 501(c)3 non-profit corporation; all donations
are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

Checks payable to POG can be mailed to:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Leaping Down to Earth is a book that displays a=20
unique correlation between image and text in a=20
beautifully designed, affordable format. It=20
consists of six images each by the contemporary=20
British artists Stephen Chambers and Tom Hammick,=20
together with twelve poems by Robert Vas Dias=20
which illuminate or subtly subvert the images.

The poems take as their point of departure the=20
paintings and prints by the two artists but are=20
not about art and don=92t describe the=20
images.  =93The point,=94 Vas Dias explains, =93is that=20
the formal aspects of poetry, and the way it uses=20
language, are stimuli for my imagination to run=20
with someone else=92s way of seeing things, so I=20
end up discovering things I never knew I wanted to say.=94

Each poem is printed on a semi-transparent sheet=20
over its corresponding image, displaying the=20
integral connection between poem and picture and=20
yet allowing each work to stand on its own.  Each=20
picture is reproduced in full colour.

The book is published by Permanent Press and=20
Pratt Contemporary Art in two editions: a regular=20
edition of 500 copies, square-back perfect-bound,=20
and a special edition of 25 copies printed on Zen=20
Pure White 150gsm and casebound in a slipcase=20
with an original numbered and signed print made=20
specially for the book by each artist.

Regular Edition: size: 195 x 245 mm (landscape),=20
32 pages, printed offset in colours.  1 July=20
2008.        ISBN 978 0 905258 21 8.   $24.

Special Edition.  1 July 2008.  ISBN 978 0 905258 22 5.  $1,200.

Comment on Leaping Down to Earth

The British poet Lee Harwood writes:  =93With=20
forerunners such as William Carlos Williams and=20
Frank O'Hara, we now have the poet Robert Vas=20
Dias working alongside the painters Stephen=20
Chambers and Tom Hammick.  The result is =96 beside=20
the undeniable pictures =96 a collection of poems=20
that are some of the best Vas Dias has ever=20
written. There=92s a wit and liveliness to them=20
that often makes me laugh out loud. But also more=20
serious and moving threads weave through these poems.=94

The American poet and critic Michael Heller=20
writes: =93The poetry is absolutely terrific,=20
moving, funny, scary.  The poems go with the=20
pictures but are in no way dependent on them.  It=20
is a beautiful thing, the cover, the ingenuity of=20
the layout, and the pictures.  I think this book=20

In the summer shade of the Quercus Review (number eight)=97Review by=20
Michael Todd Steffen=20


The summer edition of Quercus Review (number eight), across the country=20=

from Modesta, California, will be of interest to Boston area readers and =
poets=20
and writers. Its featured poet, Ed Galing, at 90 years young, stands as a=
 great=20
oak of the small press, with a publishing career that spans sixty-some ye=
ars.=20
Ed is known widely to the local eyes of the nation, not least to friend a=
nd=20
editor of the Ibbetson Street Press Doug Holder from Somerville.=20
I became aware of Galing=92s work first through the Ibbetson Street web s=
ite=20
and in the pages of Holder=92s Off the Shelf run weekly in the Somerville=
 News.
The featured section in Quercus gives 42 pages to Galing=92s work, the fi=
rst four=20
consisting of an informal essay by Doug Holder who characterizes Galing=92=

 wisdom=20
and acquired skill with words and sense and how to place them, ever so=20=

nonchalantly, as in ONE DAY IN A NURSIN HOME, in which Galing, pushing hi=

wife in a wheelchair to the cafeteria for lunch, is asked where his is ta=

and=97

i reply with a smile
i thought today we would go
into the forest, and see the
lake, and the trees, and maybe
stop in the pizza parlor=85


Galing=92s answer here is as wry as the names of those with whom he plays=
=20
cards in SENIOR CENTER=97

during
lunch.
every day,
there is moe epstein,

Galing=92s poetry bears on you to the extent that you are immersed in lan=
guage.=20
People of some age and wisdom are keenly attuned to language in a way=20
others are not. Some of us must especially focus in order to perceive the=
=20
music in what is being said. A dip of the hand=20
does not find the resistance of wading up to your breastbone in a pool or=
=20
shoreline. Galing=92s wit and expression are so at one with the fluency o=
f his=20
spirit, after these some years, the demarcations in the language, the poe=
try,=20
simply breathes from him. Ed sums up the almost transparent union in his=20=

composition process:

I sit at the electric typewriter and bang them out=85 It is as if the poe=
m has=20
come to mind long before it develops on paper.

Quercus is a reputable biannual literary journal of poetry, fiction and b=
 & w art,=20
which has featured such names as X.J. Kennedy, Naomi Shihab Nye and=20
Charles Harper.
Their number eight, along with this generous feature of Galing=92s work, =
includes=20
poets and writers from every direction in the United States, from Ashland=

The silence of the house turned the air around me electric. I could hear =
the=20
steady hum of the refrigerator; a car slowly turning some corner, and the=

Harangue the Behoover

Star stations, star planets are not equine. Escapes=92 intent (namely, the =
mechanical pencil). Intend choreography of demurs, of gestures along embank=
ments. Entirely fogged out. Holding phlegmatic back for the right moment.
*
Or otherwise moment. Un-constellated. Un-swell. Instead, believe this as if=
 nothing else: A hallowed hip shake in a heated speculation. So then, the a=
ftercare & after it. Could eat it anywhere, fraught with predilection. Boug=
ht with sweet, escapes the sextant, too. And if aubergine, purge. Abandon, =
the city. That's the berry in you in your traveling pretty. A forest of nig=
htshades along its starry wall. A failing idea, forgetfulness & a parlor tr=
ick, as well. To magnanimity. Two, supererogatory. Still, too terrible a so=
und.=20
=20
*
Aspects of it confute. A sound projects, arced beyond its own event horizon=
. Gold lame squinched into gaps of couch cushions. A forcible thrust acquir=
es what its opposition accepts. And so on. Nothing rose tinted on the dashb=
oard. Spines of books hammered together. Either an acorn of next or thrown =
wrappers accrue. Diligent is as diligent does. Whispered across the flat. T=
he flat miles of chaos on either side of order's street. So to put up a shi=
ngle, to announce this place open for a kind of commerce.
=20
*
=20
For an unabashed exchange, the rate of which is noticed exponentially. Here=
 are the beginnings of a more glitter-covered auto. Give back the titles of=
 everything. And awash. And awash, briskly. Now darling you have walked so =
far out past the stadiums & schools! A gladiola in a spatial relationship w=
ith a dial tone.=20
=20
*
=20
Spidery tarantellas on adjective foreheads.  Come to pronounce boat, as veh=
icular echo of its cousin flounce. Where saucy emblazoned caricatures pump =
the other full. Walks off the curb getting hit by delight, the soundtrack. =
Yes, hello. The romanesque and drab interiors wont hurt. The red-tipped whi=
ne shatters glassware in the foyer. A puzzle comprised of quadrants in spac=
e. Indelible, regardless, panchromatic. French insouciance be damned. One f=
ollicle for every lusted delusion. A cold that rips through mathematics. Th=
en humming at the counter, preparing a snack.
=20
*
Someone has to do it. The red planet on the Real Mars. If you look very clo=
sely, you can see it's just a bunch of pools. Restraint, a cousin of the de=
arest thing. The dearest thing a cousin of random fucking. A hard listen to=
ward the spycam, as if that'll. Work. Insouciance in the daylight where hab=
itude can see its marksmen. And boat: when will all this appetite stop? In =
the foyer. What you want to be when you grow up. Ate all the monads. Sought=
 dumb pieces in false heads in thoroughfares. Thought to lunge. Confounded =
the astronomers & the republic.
=20
*
=20
Dearest dawn. Conflate the maps. An extended walkabout. Charred edges for t=
he rustic look. We, the people's we, draw blood for the convenience. Two fa=
ces speak up and out and out of the tunnel and over and over the fence and =
into the light. A carousel of dangling provisions out of reach. A bitten le=
ft shoulder knows. Scribes the wherewithal. A little stalin scurries. The c=
rease lines give away that the portfolio's been dropped.
=20
*One rears its ugliness in the darkened stalls. The takeaway blooms, spits,=
 amasses: all this dancing, because. Two is a visitor to One's sorry maze. =
Tried the best posies. But the sticks. Took her wilted poses and got yoked =
on a train. One dimension didn't, kissed him happily and he happily ran. Oh=
, for the love of the hometown tumor. A tooth-sinking. In. Arms-circled emb=
attlement. At the guillotine, finally and finely alone.=20
=20
*
Robot-headed boys replaced. In case one forgets endless tethers. So jaded t=
hat jaded's jaded. And if to wait for breathiness, somehow safe to land her=
e - you will know. All the machines spitting cannot shake jewels from their=
 settings. To hate machines. To make them walls. So only an arm worms throu=
gh. A cartoon bubble. Guillotined. First aid to the injured woman with her =
dress ablaze. Thimble-fisted rodents. Knockdown contusions. Lightly water-c=
olored scenarios. Oddly better afterward. Action lines around the heart mak=
e for giggles. Two clowns robbing a bank.
=20
*
The flames, supermost & to think through repose. Rest the rest here, meet i=
n a largely undetermined assumed. When we like, as we like, if we should ev=
er do. Arrest. That thing where the deer splits the porch swing in half. An=
d with nowhere else to do it, just stood there, silently, rocking back and =
forth. The sunset: a perfect standalone. No ideas or words were ever actual=
ly incurred. An exception for the absurd under-lung. And the micro-self. An=
d the serious blood.

Brandon Holmquest sent me this link (to an article & video) of a Memphis
transsexual named Duanna Johnson being SEVERELY BEATEN AND MACED by a police
officer while in custody at the station. It's OUTRAGEOUS! Click here:
http://www.wmctv.com/global/story.asp?s=8515744

All over our country transsexuals are treated like this, even in
Philadelphia where the MURDER of Erika Keels STILL TO THIS DAY remains on
the record as an accident! Erika (let us NEVER EVER FORGET) had just
celebrated her 21st birthday when she was forcefully ejected from the car on
North Broad Street and run over four times. The medical examiner's report
confirms witness statements that in fact she was run over four times, yet
the police allowed her murderer Rolland Buttons to go free. Buttons is STILL
free, and when many of us gathered to protest, the chief organizers of the
protest were literally run out of town.

"What would kari edwards think?" I think when watching this video of Duanna
Johnson's beating? kari's blog was a BLOODBATH of information just like
this. No one culled the brutality against transsexuals in such a way, and in
doing so kari let us see JUST HOW BLOOD THIRSTY the world is to harm this
inimitable and invaluable part of our human community. Click on
http://transdada.blogspot.com/ to see kari's blog. And on the sidebar are
her other two blogs you'll want to check out as well.

I'm so SICK from watching this video. And it makes me think of kari, and how
much I miss her. And makes me think of Poodles, Patches, Lily, and SO MANY
OTHERS who died of AIDS, suicide, and murder since I moved to Philadelphia
in 1986. My good friend Marie Fontini and I went to drag show memorials for
drag queens who were shot and killed by skinheads at the corner of 12th
&amp; Spruce, and none of these murders were ever solved.

When I was a kid fresh on the scene here in Philly, it was the drag queens
living in my building who took me under their wing, gave me advice, showed
me how to have your eyes all around you when walking the streets. They were
these older, wise goddesses, elegant, and like no one I had ever met, and
most of them are now gone because they didn't see the bullets coming, or, or
whatever else. But I feel a stronger, more beautiful person for having known
them.

It's sad, and shakes me up when I realize how sanctioned such brutality
appears to be!

Dear Poetics List Members,

In line with our editorial focus, we do not automatically post
submissions but select those we think are most useful for sustaining
this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

Sincerely,

--------------------------------------------


June 2008: Refocused List Policy

In line with our editorial focus, we do not automatically post
submissions but select those we think are most useful for sustaining
this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

1. Posting to the List

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize that other
lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange, we request that
those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focused nature of this project and respect our decision to operate a
moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to doing what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Posts are limited to list
subscribers. All messages are reviewed by the editors in keeping with
the goals of the list as articulated in this Welcome Message. The
listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for discussion
and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow listserv
policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

Please note that this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics. We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links, relating to publications (print and
internet), reading series, and blogs that they have coordinated,
edited or published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Queres for contact info, messages intended
for just a few subscribers, "flame" messages, and free-standing
personal poems or journal entries will, in general, not be forwarded
to the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers. Personal queries and off-topic submissions will not be
posted.

Send messages directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


2. About the Poetics List

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1500 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation.

In addition to being archived through the EPC and at the UB Listerv
archive, some posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices,
announcements, etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject
areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also online at the
EPC.

3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email us at poetics.list --at -- gmail.com, subject-line
"registration," with your full name, street address, email address,
and telephone number. Failure to register at the time of subscription
will result in automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed frorm the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

In moderating this list, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

All posts not only go out to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

Note: Private correspondence via email and letters are always (c) the
author and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without the
written permission of the author. As a general rule, we will not
publish posts that include such material unless they indicate that
permission has been given.

We request that posters limit the number of posts they send to the
list on any given day. Given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 75
or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be changed at
the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

Subject:      Michael Davidson's *Concerto for the Left Hand*
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Michael Davidson's collection of essays on the poetics of disability,
"Concerto for the Left Hand: Disability and the Defamiliar Body," is now
out from University of Michigan Press, and can be ordered at:

http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=00B43A7355534F6F727B9C5E7497B6F1?id=286540

I'm particularly looking forward to seeing his chapter on Larry Eigner,
"Missing Larry," in this volume, as well as Davidson's larger thesis on the
relation between disability and the cultural discourse of "abledness."

*****
Concerto for the Left Hand is at the cutting edge of the expanding field of
disability studies, offering a wide range of essays that investigate the
impact of disability across various art forms---including literature,
performance, photography, and film. Rather than simply focusing on the ways
in which disabled persons are portrayed, Michael Davidson explores how the
experience of disability shapes the work of artists and why disability
serves as a vital lens through which to interpret modern culture. Covering
an eclectic range of topics---from the phantom missing limb in film noir to
the poetry of American Sign Language---this collection delivers a unique
and engaging assessment of the interplay between disability and aesthetics.

Hi Mark,

It is a lot of money and mind boggling, especially for us poets, but my
understanding is that it's a transparent system and that info about
Obama's funding sources is readily available. The money does add up
quick; for a while, Obama was getting over one million dollars a day in
donations.  But let me point to some figures and websites that may offer
clarification:

A watchdog group called Open Secrets posts a basic funraising breakdown
for Obama:
http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/summary.php?cid=3DN00009638&cycle=3D200=
8)

Some basic info: individuals are limited to giving $2300 per election
cycle, which equalls $4600 a year ($2300 for primary season, $2300 for
the general election).
=20
And according to Open Secrets:=20

141,658 people have given Obama more than $200 total. But 45% of these
gave less than $200 at a time; he's been good about getting people to
give small donations two or more times.
28,215 people have given Obama the $2,300 max per cycle, and 2,652
people have given him the $4,600 max.
That leaves a lot of people who've given him anywhere between $5 and
$199 dollars. And the 1.5 million donor number is verified by
independent sources.

Here, for example, is a chart, from Open Secrets, calculting donations
to Obama *not* from these organizations per se, but the total $ given by
individuals at these organizations: =20

Goldman Sachs 	$571,330
University of California 	$437,236
UBS AG 	$364,806
JPMorgan Chase & Co 	$362,207
Citigroup Inc 	$358,054
National Amusements Inc 	$320,750
Lehman Brothers 	$318,647
Google Inc 	$309,514
Harvard University 	$309,025
Sidley Austin LLP 	$294,245
Skadden, Arps et al 	$270,013
Time Warner 	$262,677
Morgan Stanley 	$259,876
Jones Day 	$250,725
Exelon Corp 	$236,211
University of Chicago 	$218,857
Wilmerhale LLP 	$218,680
Latham & Watkins 	$218,615
Microsoft Corp 	$209,242
Stanford University 	$195,262

Also, the Huffington Post has something called Fundrace where you can
search by name, zip code, and profession to see who has given to each
candidate and how much. Huffington Post also highlights celebrities and
corporate donors.

Well, happy hunting, and thanks for bringing this up.  I think it's
natural to get suspicious of the outrageous sums required to attain
public office in this country, but again it's my understanding that
independent sources are pubicly verifying and accounting for the sources
of Obama's funds.

I saw an interview today about 85 million from fundraisers held for Clinton, sponsored by individual State  democratic parties 'before' Obama won the nomination, that by default, after Clinton lost, was awarded to the Democratic Party and inevitably went to Obama. This is the main cause for many of the die hard Clintonites sharp disdain, but also, I suspect,  how Obama can easily "help" Hillary with her 32 million dollar debt. All of this, of course, depends on how much spin we believe and it doesn't account for the 30 million or so left over after your calculations.

Regardless, I couldn't be more convinced of how 'right' Obama is for this county at this point. Have you read "The Audacity of Hope"???


Best for now,


Warren

Yes, C. D. is amazing. My respect for her as a person and a writer/mind-in-the-world continues to grow. Too bad Brouwer flaunted his own limitations with the dismissive phrase, "egghead experiments of the Language poets". I don't even necessarily disagree, entirely,  that "coldly/dryly intellectual" might not be a valid criticism of some of the work that goes by "Language poetry," depending on which work by which Language poet we're talking about, but the utterly unqualified, drive-by generalization reflects very poorly on him. Where's a good editor when you need one? A minor point, though. I'm glad C. D.'s getting this level of attention; she deserves it as much as anyone, I think, and more so than most who get it.

Cheers,
Tod

Tod,

I totally agree. I found the review to be dismissive and in the tone
of "this poem stuff is funner when it's not Languagey."

Jaap Blonk is a self-taught composer, vocal performer and sound poet.

As a vocalist, Blonk has performed around the globe exciting audiences =
with his powerful stage presence and childlike improvisation. Live =
electronics have over the years extended the scope and range of his =
concerts. Besides working as a soloist, he has collaborated with many =
musicians and ensembles, including Maja Ratkje, Mats Gustafsson, Nicolas =
Collins, Joan La Barbara, The Ex, the Netherlands Wind Ensemble and the =
Ebony Band. He was the founder and leader of the long-standing bands =
Splinks (modern jazz, 1983-1999) and BRAAXTAAL (avant-rock, 1987-2005).=20

We talk here about the noises humans make that aren't words, how =
important they are in communication, and the way sound poetry utilizes =
them; about meaning found in intonation and getting booed, the pleasure =
of inventing structures, Dadaism and the breaking of rules, Johnny Van =
Doorn and A Bridge too Far, the international phonetic alphabet, pitch, =
timber and the best English language sound poets. Listen, and brace =
yourself for the recital of a sonnet Jaap wrote in honour of Van Doorn.

WIsh I did, but thanks for the links. I wasn't aware of the connection between Heidegger and Celan. That book sounds quite interesting. Especially in light of the verse play I wrote on the relationship among Heidegger, Jaspers, Sartre, de Beauvoir and Camus. I'm always interested in the dialogues among philosophers and artists.

Subject:      The lyric poem - what be its current fate?
Comments: cc: UK POETRY <ukpoetry@listserv.muohio.edu>,
          "Poetryetc: poetry and poetics" <poetryetc@jiscmail.ac.uk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Sometimes I read a lyric poem - singular or serial - and I am struck by two contrary reading experiences. On one hand, I am taken  by a poem's structure,  the attention of the poet, the technique, tone, etc,  - how forcefully these combinations impel themselves on to the page. I am totally present with the process, and the momentary totality of the poem's object, its presence. I am with it - which means to say  its particulars have become an assured presence within the immediate horizons of my take (world) as a reader.

 Yet, on the other hand, the poem(s), no matter how solid its occurrence in my imagination, critical presence, etc. is soon gone, particularly as I move on to the works of others, or shift my awareness to, say, the television, the inevitable perk and threnody of the news, its repetitions and cycles.

 And, in terms of the lyric poem as an experience in reading - no matter how present it was - - becomes such a fleeting thing without much bearing on what's left of either my private or public space. What is that that 'thing' that caught me and then flew by? Why does much work - much of it good, and, certainly, labor intensive - fly by with but a transitional, momentary effect? Whatever act or frame could make that pleasure more concrete, an enduring, significant presence, a constantly returnable project & gift?? (Perhaps, obviously.  that is part of the poet's job, too).

 I suspect we know that's the job of a critical community - to maximize the public presence and circulation of a work or works. To review a person's work, to secure (ideally) our attention. And, no doubt, the importance of academic institutions. To insist students write critical papers, memorize, and/or improv new works off the work of others  - to insure that a work secure a place, a point of memory in the young, as well as older persons. And, for those of us outside institutions, to resist and confront the the sense of erasure that inevitably haunts those of us who live, read, write and work not 'at the margins', but in locations that require a different sense of critical reception and measure.

 Without this surrounding labor of critical community, so many often extraordinarily fine lyric poems - let alone larger forms. - end up fleeting around, or become paralysed in a kind of statuary limbo. They may vibrantly appear in a small publication, then disappear as readily. For the poet it takes a fierce stubbornness to put up with can appear as an almost instant annihilation or a perennial sense of being 'not quite dead on arrival.'

 The reason I write this is that I became quite aware of this condition whitle reading some quite fine books that have come my way to review. Recent intriguing good works by Peter Manson, George Albon, Joseph Noble, Tyrone Williams, Tim Atkins - all guys (I realize), but, indeed, a mix of sexual, ethnic and national persuasions, yet each (most at mid-life, I think)  working various lyric, experimental edges. They are among many,  obviously both men and women,  out in the field of combatting limited attention to their work,each working the language to scrape out  (sing, whatever), a non- familiar truth in fresh, demanding and/or startling ways. As I begin to write these various or combined reviews I remain struck by the ambition and struggle to make a work find its location in a contemporay landscape that is mostly either oppositional or,most likely. oblivious to an enterprise that - as both poet and reader - I, if not most of us, totally support.

 Proportionately, without wanting to sound one bit self-piteous (because the work can bring such joy and critical pleasure) Sisyphus might appear to have had it  relatively good!  In this nation (USA), where Executive (Cheney. Bush. etc.) management has done nothing but produce a national paralysis of the imagination (it's nasty girim and impotent, to be both obvious and frank). Without sounding like a 'draino liberal' (I hope), I think its absolutely essential to do whatever we can (in community, critcially, creatively,  etc.) to vigorously support the efforts of both poets and poems (lyric and otherwise)  to continue to rise and take hold in the public realm - and take form in the pleasure and combat of that. Otherwise we be in for a long, thirsty time! So yes, I am writing my reviews. You, too?

Tod,

I totally agree. I found the review to be dismissive and in the tone
of "this poem stuff is funner when it's not Languagey."

by "Language poetry," depending on which work by which Language poet we're
talking about, but the utterly unqualified, drive-by generalization reflects
very poorly on him. Where's a good editor when you need one? A minor point,
though. I'm glad C. D.'s getting this level of attention; she deserves it as
much as anyone, I think, and more so than most who get it.

Intreresting, Warren. I wonder whether Hillary declined to accept federal
funding. If not, that might marginally
compromise Barack's pledge to refuse such funds. In that case, I would hope
he would take any federal money
that Hillary accepted and pay off her debts with it, then return the balance
to the feds. I haven't read "The
Audacity of Hope," though I hope to; he has me convinced without it, though.
We need a Hawkeye Pierce
for triage now.

Nice to read your thoughts, Stephen.  I wonder though "izzit not ever
thus," for in them I hear an echo of Wordsworth, from the "preface to
the 2nd edition of the lyrical ballads." That your thoughts are familiar
to me suggests that the lyric may be in a steady sissy-fun state, rather
than about to die altogether. Yet I'm not suggesting that the work to
preserve & enlarge our atttention to the lyric isn't crucial; rather, I
think we may whistle a bit while we work.  And WW, while he affirms the
frustration, also suggests a way to progress: he says that yes quiet
lyrics may easily be drowned out, but that learning to attend to lyric
quietness, via both reading and writing, is a crucial practice, one that
strengthens "certain inherent inherent and indestructible qualities of
the human mind," qualities which WW thinks are good.

I'm going to copy down a hunk o' WW here. It feels good to type it, like
a meditation/prayer:

From WW:  "For the human mind is capable of being excited without the
application of gross and violent stimulants.... It has therefore
appeared to me that to endeavor to prodice or enlarge this capability is
one of the best services in which, at any period, a writer can be
engaged; but this service, excellent at all times, is especially so at
the present day. For a multitude of causes, unknown to former times, are
now acting with a combined force to blunt the distriminating powers of
the mind, and, unfitting it for all voluntary exertion, to reduce it to
a state of almost savage torpor. The most effective of these causes are
the great national events which are daily taking place, and the
increasing accumulation of men in cities, where the uniformity of thei
roccupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident, which the
rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratiafies. To this tendency
of life and manners the literature and theatrical exhibition of the
country have conformed themselves. The invaluable works of our elder
writers...Shakespeare and Milton, are driven into neglect by frantic
novelss....When I think about this degrading thirst after outrageous
stimulation, I am almost ashamed to have spoken of the feeble endeavor
made in these volumes to counteract it; ... had I not a deep impression
of certain inherent and indestructible qualities of the human mind, and
likewise of certain powers in the great and permanent objects that act
upon it, which are equally inherent and indestructible...."

Subject: The lyric poem - what be its current fate?

Sometimes I read a lyric poem - singular or serial - and I am struck by
two contrary reading experiences. On one hand, I am taken  by a poem's
structure,  the attention of the poet, the technique, tone, etc,  - how
forcefully these combinations impel themselves on to the page. I am
totally present with the process, and the momentary totality of the
poem's object, its presence. I am with it - which means to say  its
particulars have become an assured presence within the immediate
horizons of my take (world) as a reader.
=20
 Yet, on the other hand, the poem(s), no matter how solid its occurrence
in my imagination, critical presence, etc. is soon gone, particularly as
I move on to the works of others, or shift my awareness to, say, the
television, the inevitable perk and threnody of the news, its
repetitions and cycles.=20
=20
 And, in terms of the lyric poem as an experience in reading - no matter
how present it was - - becomes such a fleeting thing without much
bearing on what's left of either my private or public space. What is
that that 'thing' that caught me and then flew by? Why does much work -
much of it good, and, certainly, labor intensive - fly by with but a
transitional, momentary effect? Whatever act or frame could make that
pleasure more concrete, an enduring, significant presence, a constantly
returnable project & gift?? (Perhaps, obviously.  that is part of the
poet's job, too).=20
=20
 I suspect we know that's the job of a critical community - to maximize
the public presence and circulation of a work or works. To review a
person's work, to secure (ideally) our attention. And, no doubt, the
importance of academic institutions. To insist students write critical
papers, memorize, and/or improv new works off the work of others  - to
insure that a work secure a place, a point of memory in the young, as
well as older persons. And, for those of us outside institutions, to
resist and confront the the sense of erasure that inevitably haunts
those of us who live, read, write and work not 'at the margins', but in
locations that require a different sense of critical reception and
measure.=20
=20
 Without this surrounding labor of critical community, so many often
extraordinarily fine lyric poems - let alone larger forms. - end up
fleeting around, or become paralysed in a kind of statuary limbo. They
may vibrantly appear in a small publication, then disappear as readily.
For the poet it takes a fierce stubbornness to put up with can appear as
an almost instant annihilation or a perennial sense of being 'not quite
dead on arrival.'
=20
 The reason I write this is that I became quite aware of this condition
whitle reading some quite fine books that have come my way to review.
Recent intriguing good works by Peter Manson, George Albon, Joseph
Noble, Tyrone Williams, Tim Atkins - all guys (I realize), but, indeed,
a mix of sexual, ethnic and national persuasions, yet each (most at
mid-life, I think)  working various lyric, experimental edges. They are
among many,  obviously both men and women,  out in the field of
combatting limited attention to their work,each working the language to
scrape out  (sing, whatever), a non- familiar truth in fresh, demanding
and/or startling ways. As I begin to write these various or combined
reviews I remain struck by the ambition and struggle to make a work find
its location in a contemporay landscape that is mostly either
oppositional or,most likely. oblivious to an enterprise that - as both
poet and reader - I, if not most of us, totally support.=20
=20
 Proportionately, without wanting to sound one bit self-piteous (because
the work can bring such joy and critical pleasure) Sisyphus might appear
to have had it  relatively good!  In this nation (USA), where Executive
(Cheney. Bush. etc.) management has done nothing but produce a national
paralysis of the imagination (it's nasty girim and impotent, to be both
obvious and frank). Without sounding like a 'draino liberal' (I hope), I
think its absolutely essential to do whatever we can (in community,
critcially, creatively,  etc.) to vigorously support the efforts of both
poets and poems (lyric and otherwise)  to continue to rise and take hold
in the public realm - and take form in the pleasure and combat of that.
Otherwise we be in for a long, thirsty time! So yes, I am writing my
reviews. You, too?=20

PRINTING POETRY: A Workshop for Poets and Visual Artists at The Arm
Letterpress Studio=20

Each month The Arm offers workshops in our public access letterpress studio=
.
In July, Dan Morris and I will be teaching a two-day letterpress workshop
together at The Arm Letterpress Studio in Brooklyn, NY. You=B9ll learn the
basics of typography, composition and have the opportunity to print a
broadside that features your own text and image on the Vandercook proof
press. Come alone or with a collaborator. No previous experience necessary.
All materials provided. More details available at:

International Poetry Festival is a biennial event, in the interim years,
Friends of the Library present smaller language poetry festivals, such as=

this year=E2=80=99s Latino Poetry Festival.

The first Latino poetry festival west of the Mississippi was held in 1973=
 at
the University of Southern California, but it was not until 2006 that San=

Francisco first hosted this event.

=E2=80=9CIt started out as a small gathering with a few poetry readings i=

Mission District,=E2=80=9D said Murgu=C3=ADa, =E2=80=9CThis year=E2=80=99=

organizations and business, especially those located in the Mission Distr=
ict
of San Francisco. In addition to the Friends of the San Francisco Public
Library, San Francisco Public Library, Litquake and 826 Valencia, local
coffee shops and restaurants such as Philz Coffee, L=E2=80=99s Caf=C3=A9,=
 Casa Sanchez
and many others will host readings and other events. =E2=80=9CSince commu=
nity is at
the heart of this event it was important for us to gain the support of th=
e
local merchants and organizations,=E2=80=9D said Bero.

0pm

Thanks, Joanie, for pointing to WW lodestar! Then the quote. Yes, a quick and impressive ear you have for echoes!
 What?  Are we (yon poets)  fated to repeat ourselves century upon century with twists on the metaphors and content du jour!!!  An endless spiral loop earthly journey? An eternity of small audiences?
 Ain't complaining too hard. As long as there are good and quick ears in the neighborhood that can take and hear a poem to the max, who needs more?! (It's always nice when it happens - large)

 Got to get back to writing those reviews - among all the other 'requirements'!

thus," for in them I hear an echo of Wordsworth, from the "preface to
the 2nd edition of the lyrical ballads." That your thoughts are familiar
to me suggests that the lyric may be in a steady sissy-fun state, rather
than about to die altogether. Yet I'm not suggesting that the work to
preserve & enlarge our atttention to the lyric isn't crucial; rather, I
think we may whistle a bit while we work.  And WW, while he affirms the
frustration, also suggests a way to progress: he says that yes quiet
lyrics may easily be drowned out, but that learning to attend to lyric
quietness, via both reading and writing, is a crucial practice, one that
strengthens "certain inherent inherent and indestructible qualities of
the human mind," qualities which WW thinks are good.

I'm going to copy down a hunk o' WW here. It feels good to type it, like
a meditation/prayer:

From WW:  "For the human mind is capable of being excited without the
application of gross and violent stimulants.... It has therefore
appeared to me that to endeavor to prodice or enlarge this capability is
one of the best services in which, at any period, a writer can be
engaged; but this service, excellent at all times, is especially so at
the present day. For a multitude of causes, unknown to former times, are
now acting with a combined force to blunt the distriminating powers of
the mind, and, unfitting it for all voluntary exertion, to reduce it to
a state of almost savage torpor. The most effective of these causes are
the great national events which are daily taking place, and the
increasing accumulation of men in cities, where the uniformity of thei
roccupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident, which the
rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratiafies. To this tendency
of life and manners the literature and theatrical exhibition of the
country have conformed themselves. The invaluable works of our elder
writers...Shakespeare and Milton, are driven into neglect by frantic
novelss....When I think about this degrading thirst after outrageous
stimulation, I am almost ashamed to have spoken of the feeble endeavor
made in these volumes to counteract it; ... had I not a deep impression
of certain inherent and indestructible qualities of the human mind, and
likewise of certain powers in the great and permanent objects that act
upon it, which are equally inherent and indestructible...."

Subject: The lyric poem - what be its current fate?

Sometimes I read a lyric poem - singular or serial - and I am struck by
two contrary reading experiences. On one hand, I am taken  by a poem's
structure,  the attention of the poet, the technique, tone, etc,  - how
forcefully these combinations impel themselves on to the page. I am
totally present with the process, and the momentary totality of the
poem's object, its presence. I am with it - which means to say  its
particulars have become an assured presence within the immediate
horizons of my take (world) as a reader.

 Yet, on the other hand, the poem(s), no matter how solid its occurrence
in my imagination, critical presence, etc. is soon gone, particularly as
I move on to the works of others, or shift my awareness to, say, the
television, the inevitable perk and threnody of the news, its
repetitions and cycles.

 And, in terms of the lyric poem as an experience in reading - no matter
how present it was - - becomes such a fleeting thing without much
bearing on what's left of either my private or public space. What is
that that 'thing' that caught me and then flew by? Why does much work -
much of it good, and, certainly, labor intensive - fly by with but a
transitional, momentary effect? Whatever act or frame could make that
pleasure more concrete, an enduring, significant presence, a constantly
returnable project & gift?? (Perhaps, obviously.  that is part of the
poet's job, too).

 I suspect we know that's the job of a critical community - to maximize
the public presence and circulation of a work or works. To review a
person's work, to secure (ideally) our attention. And, no doubt, the
importance of academic institutions. To insist students write critical
papers, memorize, and/or improv new works off the work of others  - to
insure that a work secure a place, a point of memory in the young, as
well as older persons. And, for those of us outside institutions, to
resist and confront the the sense of erasure that inevitably haunts
those of us who live, read, write and work not 'at the margins', but in
locations that require a different sense of critical reception and
measure.

 Without this surrounding labor of critical community, so many often
extraordinarily fine lyric poems - let alone larger forms. - end up
fleeting around, or become paralysed in a kind of statuary limbo. They
may vibrantly appear in a small publication, then disappear as readily.
For the poet it takes a fierce stubbornness to put up with can appear as
an almost instant annihilation or a perennial sense of being 'not quite
dead on arrival.'

 The reason I write this is that I became quite aware of this condition
whitle reading some quite fine books that have come my way to review.
Recent intriguing good works by Peter Manson, George Albon, Joseph
Noble, Tyrone Williams, Tim Atkins - all guys (I realize), but, indeed,
a mix of sexual, ethnic and national persuasions, yet each (most at
mid-life, I think)  working various lyric, experimental edges. They are
among many,  obviously both men and women,  out in the field of
combatting limited attention to their work,each working the language to
scrape out  (sing, whatever), a non- familiar truth in fresh, demanding
and/or startling ways. As I begin to write these various or combined
reviews I remain struck by the ambition and struggle to make a work find
its location in a contemporay landscape that is mostly either
oppositional or,most likely. oblivious to an enterprise that - as both
poet and reader - I, if not most of us, totally support.

 Proportionately, without wanting to sound one bit self-piteous (because
the work can bring such joy and critical pleasure) Sisyphus might appear
to have had it  relatively good!  In this nation (USA), where Executive
(Cheney. Bush. etc.) management has done nothing but produce a national
paralysis of the imagination (it's nasty girim and impotent, to be both
obvious and frank). Without sounding like a 'draino liberal' (I hope), I
think its absolutely essential to do whatever we can (in community,
critcially, creatively,  etc.) to vigorously support the efforts of both
poets and poems (lyric and otherwise)  to continue to rise and take hold
in the public realm - and take form in the pleasure and combat of that.
Otherwise we be in for a long, thirsty time! So yes, I am writing my
reviews. You, too?

Stephen Vincent asks:

by with but a transitional, momentary effect? Whatever act or frame could
make that pleasure more concrete, an enduring, significant presence, a
constantly returnable project & gift??

Thomas Savage asks:
But I'm curious to see if anyone can define what a "lyrical poem" is?

It may be useful to ask this in a different way--I don't think lyric has a
"current fate" at all.  I'd like to think of lyric in much the same way I
was told to think of old TV broadcasts from the 1950s (When I was, in 1984,
a 14-year-old earth science student): that episodes of "The Honeymooners"
were bouncing around in the troposphere or somewhere on their way to Alpha
Centauri & could, given the right conditions, be pulled in and watched from
those first broadcast signals.  This is Gumbrecht's argument about
troubadour song as well--the envoi of the poem sent out into a vast
"nothing" that just might reach the ear of the beloved, but may as well not
(its current fate:  probably won't).  If we are incredibly fortunate, we may
approximate the "context" of the poem's initial expression (or if you hate
that word, its energetic emission) & find ourselves hallucinating some other
place & time & sense.  My sense being: what in a successful lyric poem
should endure?  Why should it have a fate? I'm of the hopelessly outdated
opinion that lyric is an attempt to achieve "kenosis".  But thats the entire
project:  to fuck with time.  "currents" and "fates" want their quarterly
reports.  But good lyric can suck the relentlessness out of fate--in fact,
lyric says, if anything, "relent".  Its so bourgeois!  Who's got the time in
perilous times to forget about time?  Better we mangle current slang, tell a
good joke, or get down to our programming.

Of course I'm smoking way too much hashish these days, but I'd say the
"current fate" of lyric is the same as that mountain tortoise that Hermes
gutted to make the first lyre (this  is Barbara Hughes Fowler's
translation):
[Hermes says to the tortoise] ' "You're better off at home.  It's dangerous
outdoors./Alive, you'll charm away mischievous witchcraft,/but if you die,
you'll be a lovely bard".  So he spoke, and, taking her up in both his
hands,/he carried his charming toy back inside the house./ Then with chisel
of gray iron he bored through/and scooped from the shell the mountain
tortoise's very life--'
After building the first lyre: "the god sang a soft and pretty little song .
. .about Zeus, and Maia,/beautifully sandaled, and of their dalliance
before/in companionship of love, and told the glorious tale of his own
begetting"

Pretty cool, eh?  Tell the very story of how your parents got it on to have
you!!  Were they even thinking of you then?  That's the kind of thing a good
lyric should do--let you know that your "fate" is dependent on someone and
something else being able to get it on!  You're a complete accident, unless
you've got some serious family-planning forebears.  You may not "charm away"
your fate, or anything else, with lyric, but it may send you to the moon.

Hope this helps.

Doug

I consider myself a lyricist. The lyric is a difficult genre to work
in, but I don't think it is any worse off than any other genre other
than the song lyric subgenre, of which there are any number of
successful workers. there's still a lot of room left to work with in
the lyric and it's something that's been pushed to the fringes of
even the fringes that tend to congregate on this list.

which is, frankly, just the way i like it. I don't need to be yet
another post language post projectivist new sincerist 4th generation
new york school guy. i suspect that others of my ilk feel the same way.

Is there a difference between sound poetry and slam poetry or is one just a

Jaap Blonk is a self-taught composer, vocal performer and sound poet.

As a vocalist, Blonk has performed around the globe exciting audiences with
his powerful stage presence and childlike improvisation. Live electronics
have over the years extended the scope and range of his concerts. Besides
working as a soloist, he has collaborated with many musicians and ensembles,
including Maja Ratkje, Mats Gustafsson, Nicolas Collins, Joan La Barbara,
The Ex, the Netherlands Wind Ensemble and the Ebony Band. He was the founder
and leader of the long-standing bands Splinks (modern jazz, 1983-1999) and
BRAAXTAAL (avant-rock, 1987-2005).

We talk here about the noises humans make that aren't words, how important
they are in communication, and the way sound poetry utilizes them; about
meaning found in intonation and getting booed, the pleasure of inventing
structures, Dadaism and the breaking of rules, Johnny Van Doorn and A Bridge
too Far, the international phonetic alphabet, pitch, timber and the best
English language sound poets. Listen, and brace yourself for the recital of
a sonnet Jaap wrote in honour of Van Doorn.

The lyric follows a long, meandering path in the history of poetry and
poetics in English . . .

For those on the list (a minority, perhaps?) who may enjoy reading
criticism & theory, a new book from Susquehanna UP may be of interest,
_Dialogism and Lyric Self-Fashioning_, edited by Jacob Blevins.

Historically, lyrical poetry has had a very large audience. It began dying off with Modernism, and postmodernism and LANGUAGE poetry have all but killed it off. The few poetry bestsellers are the lyric poets like Frederick Turner.

Thanks, Joanie, for pointing to WW lodestar! Then the quote. Yes, a quick and impressive ear you have for echoes!
What?  Are we (yon poets)  fated to repeat ourselves century upon century with twists on the metaphors and content du jour!!!  An endless spiral loop earthly journey? An eternity of small audiences?
Ain't complaining too hard. As long as there are good and quick ears in the neighborhood that can take and hear a poem to the max, who needs more?! (It's always nice when it happens - large)

Got to get back to writing those reviews - among all the other 'requirements'!

thus," for in them I hear an echo of Wordsworth, from the "preface to
the 2nd edition of the lyrical ballads." That your thoughts are familiar
to me suggests that the lyric may be in a steady sissy-fun state, rather
than about to die altogether. Yet I'm not suggesting that the work to
preserve & enlarge our atttention to the lyric isn't crucial; rather, I
think we may whistle a bit while we work.  And WW, while he affirms the
frustration, also suggests a way to progress: he says that yes quiet
lyrics may easily be drowned out, but that learning to attend to lyric
quietness, via both reading and writing, is a crucial practice, one that
strengthens "certain inherent inherent and indestructible qualities of
the human mind," qualities which WW thinks are good.

I'm going to copy down a hunk o' WW here. It feels good to type it, like
a meditation/prayer:

From WW:  "For the human mind is capable of being excited without the
application of gross and violent stimulants.... It has therefore
appeared to me that to endeavor to prodice or enlarge this capability is
one of the best services in which, at any period, a writer can be
engaged; but this service, excellent at all times, is especially so at
the present day. For a multitude of causes, unknown to former times, are
now acting with a combined force to blunt the distriminating powers of
the mind, and, unfitting it for all voluntary exertion, to reduce it to
a state of almost savage torpor. The most effective of these causes are
the great national events which are daily taking place, and the
increasing accumulation of men in cities, where the uniformity of thei
roccupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident, which the
rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratiafies. To this tendency
of life and manners the literature and theatrical exhibition of the
country have conformed themselves. The invaluable works of our elder
writers...Shakespeare and Milton, are driven into neglect by frantic
novelss....When I think about this degrading thirst after outrageous
stimulation, I am almost ashamed to have spoken of the feeble endeavor
made in these volumes to counteract it; ... had I not a deep impression
of certain inherent and indestructible qualities of the human mind, and
likewise of certain powers in the great and permanent objects that act
upon it, which are equally inherent and indestructible...."

Subject: The lyric poem - what be its current fate?

Sometimes I read a lyric poem - singular or serial - and I am struck by
two contrary reading experiences. On one hand, I am taken  by a poem's
structure,  the attention of the poet, the technique, tone, etc,  - how
forcefully these combinations impel themselves on to the page. I am
totally present with the process, and the momentary totality of the
poem's object, its presence. I am with it - which means to say  its
particulars have become an assured presence within the immediate
horizons of my take (world) as a reader.

Yet, on the other hand, the poem(s), no matter how solid its occurrence
in my imagination, critical presence, etc. is soon gone, particularly as
I move on to the works of others, or shift my awareness to, say, the
television, the inevitable perk and threnody of the news, its
repetitions and cycles.

And, in terms of the lyric poem as an experience in reading - no matter
how present it was - - becomes such a fleeting thing without much
bearing on what's left of either my private or public space. What is
that that 'thing' that caught me and then flew by? Why does much work -
much of it good, and, certainly, labor intensive - fly by with but a
transitional, momentary effect? Whatever act or frame could make that
pleasure more concrete, an enduring, significant presence, a constantly
returnable project & gift?? (Perhaps, obviously.  that is part of the
poet's job, too).

I suspect we know that's the job of a critical community - to maximize
the public presence and circulation of a work or works. To review a
person's work, to secure (ideally) our attention. And, no doubt, the
importance of academic institutions. To insist students write critical
papers, memorize, and/or improv new works off the work of others  - to
insure that a work secure a place, a point of memory in the young, as
well as older persons. And, for those of us outside institutions, to
resist and confront the the sense of erasure that inevitably haunts
those of us who live, read, write and work not 'at the margins', but in
locations that require a different sense of critical reception and
measure.

Without this surrounding labor of critical community, so many often
extraordinarily fine lyric poems - let alone larger forms. - end up
fleeting around, or become paralysed in a kind of statuary limbo. They
may vibrantly appear in a small publication, then disappear as readily.
For the poet it takes a fierce stubbornness to put up with can appear as
an almost instant annihilation or a perennial sense of being 'not quite
dead on arrival.'

The reason I write this is that I became quite aware of this condition
whitle reading some quite fine books that have come my way to review.
Recent intriguing good works by Peter Manson, George Albon, Joseph
Noble, Tyrone Williams, Tim Atkins - all guys (I realize), but, indeed,
a mix of sexual, ethnic and national persuasions, yet each (most at
mid-life, I think)  working various lyric, experimental edges. They are
among many,  obviously both men and women,  out in the field of
combatting limited attention to their work,each working the language to
scrape out  (sing, whatever), a non- familiar truth in fresh, demanding
and/or startling ways. As I begin to write these various or combined
reviews I remain struck by the ambition and struggle to make a work find
its location in a contemporay landscape that is mostly either
oppositional or,most likely. oblivious to an enterprise that - as both
poet and reader - I, if not most of us, totally support.

Proportionately, without wanting to sound one bit self-piteous (because
the work can bring such joy and critical pleasure) Sisyphus might appear
to have had it  relatively good!  In this nation (USA), where Executive
(Cheney. Bush. etc.) management has done nothing but produce a national
paralysis of the imagination (it's nasty girim and impotent, to be both
obvious and frank). Without sounding like a 'draino liberal' (I hope), I
think its absolutely essential to do whatever we can (in community,
critcially, creatively,  etc.) to vigorously support the efforts of both
poets and poems (lyric and otherwise)  to continue to rise and take hold
in the public realm - and take form in the pleasure and combat of that.
Otherwise we be in for a long, thirsty time! So yes, I am writing my
reviews. You, too?

Way to think historically.

I love that it's the bad modernist poetry that made people read less poetry,
rather than things like radio, television, movies, computers, video games,
the assembly line, and other 20th c. inventions...

I mean, seriously. Do you really think history has nothing to do with
poetry?

THE NATION POETRY FOUNDATION announces the publication of RONALD JOHNSON:
LIFE AND WORKS, Edited by Joel Bettridge and Eric Murphy Selinger.

"After decades of neglect, academic interest in Johnson has been growing,
slowly but perceptibly, since the early 1990s. Book chapters, essays in
journals, and conference talks by a small but enthusiastic group of critics
planted one set of seeds for this growth; others sprouted in graduate
courses featuring Johnson's work, taught by Kenneth Fields (Stanford),
Stephen Yenser (UCLA), Joseph Conte (SUNY-Buffalo), and others across the
country. In 1996, to celebrate the publication of the completed *ARK*,
the *Chicago
Review *featured a special tribute issue with pieces by Thom Gunn, Robert
Creeley, Devin Johnston, and Peter O'Leary; two years later, a new journal,
*Facture*, edited by Paul Naylor, featured another impressive array of
essays and poems about Johnson in its inaugural issue. This wave of interes=
t
crested in the spring of 2000, with a weekend conference on Johnson at the
Poetry and Rare Books Library, SUNY-Buffalo, organized by Joel Bettridge.
Talks from that conference formed the core of this collection, where they
join newly commissioned essays and revised versions of a handful of
important reviews of Johnson's late work. In keeping with the variety of
Johnson's poetry and the range of pleasures it affords, we have included
pieces of varying lengths, styles, and approaches. Some expansive, some
incisive, some elegantly brief, they map the current state of Johnson
scholarship and suggest the avenues of inquiry that others will soon
follow." =96 from the Introduction by Eric Murphy Selinger and Joel Bettrid=
ge

"I count Ronald Johnson as one of the defining peers of my own imagined
company of poets, ageless and yet insistently specific to all one's life
might seem to be here and now. The very title of his major long poem cycle,
*ARK*=97with its deter-mining echoes, its senses of a contiguous, innumerab=
le
event, its measure of heart and time, all the wondrous, intimate,
particularizing reflection and record-proposes the character of this work I
so value." - Robert Creeley

"I have always thought Ron Johnson a terrific poet: everything he has
written has surprised and delighted me." - Thom Gunn

"Poetry with a passion for exact, even scientific scrutiny." - Guy Davenpor=

        "Lyric" is either a descriprive or a (semi)evaluative term.

        Descriptively, a lyric poem is distinguished from a dramatic or
narrative poem by using the "I" form.

                I suffer (lyric)

                They suffer (narrative)

                We suffer (dramatic)

Evalutation enters with or before Palgrave's Golden  Treasury.

        Lyric begins when Archilochus turns Homer's "we" to "I".

                        Other than that, it is mostly blah and nonsense.

i read this quoted in an article some time ago in the london review of
books. an interesting article. i think the title was "it's the oil, stupid".

the gist of it was that, yes, the war is primarily about control of iraq's
oil.

a stable democratic government in iraq to which the usa could hand over
power would be undesirable, if the goal is to control the oil. instead,
instability is advantageous.

the article pointed out that if we read events with this perspective, it
seems that things are going more or less 'successfully', insofar as the usa
is indeed angling with predicted success to ensure that the big usa oil
companies control the lion's share of Iraq's oil. googling "who controls
iraq's oil" provides a lot of info on the matter.

how much oil is there in Iraq?

"While its proven oil reserves of 112 billion barrels ranks Iraq second in
the work behind Saudi Arabia, EIA ( US Energy Information Administration)
estimates that up to 90-percent of the county remains unexplored due to
years of wars and sanctions. Unexplored regions of Iraq could yield an
additional 100 billion barrels. Iraq's oil production costs are among the
lowest in the world. However, only about 2,000 wells have been drilled in
Iraq, compared to about 1 million wells in Texas alone."

john: roughly speaking, the two are not altogether unrelated fellow
travellers with rather different genealogies. sound poetry traces its roots
back to european dada in the 1910s and is conveyed in polyglot trans-sense
utterances, often written out in scores but very much intended to be
performed. kurt schwitters "ur sonata" is the cornerstone of such work.

slam poetry originated in chicago in the mid-1980s and is also heavily
dependent upon performance, in this case of a wholly memorized and/or
partially improvised text. the performance takes place in the context of a
competition where individual 3-minute performances are judged by the
audience and those results compiled for the given teams of performers,
victorious teams travelling on to face other teams at higher levels of
competition. that said, i think a slam "style" exists outside of this
competitive sphere. saul williams would be an example.

and i'd say further that the two strains can be seen converging in the work
of tracie morris.

In 1961 George Oppen met Buddhadev Bose, an Indian poet, in Greenwich
village. Bose, was visiting the US on a sabbatical at Columbia University.
In the months to follow, Oppen and Bose struck an unusual and terrific
camaraderie that continued for the next several years until Oppen lost much
of his memory and Bose, his life. Pat Clifford recently wrote an article
(George Oppen, Buddhadev Bose and Translation) on these two poets.
Interestingly, 2008 is a centenary year for both Oppen and Bose.





Pat Clifford writes -



"We are all familiar with George Oppen. However, some may only know Bose for
his poems "arranged" and included in The Materials. Few in the states
realize how prominent and prolific he was, not only as a poet, but as an
essayist, playwright and critic. He was the founding editor of the first
Bengali-language poetry journal called Kavita, or Poetry. He was even
regarded as the literary successor to Rabindranath Tagore, the first
non-European to win the Nobel Prize for literature....."

The two aren't unrelated, you know. It's no coincidence that you started getting things like impressionism when photography came about. Milan Kundera observes that the novel (for example) should do only what the novel can do. The same can be said about poetry. TV and film are their own media, and do not necessarily exclude the reading of poetry. Much of the Modernists' experiments came about precisely in reaction to such things as radio, etc. Part of the result was that it became something only elitists were interested in (bizarre poetry, etc. is a great way for elitists to separate themselves from the rabble, you know). But lyric poetry in the form of songs is as strong as ever -- belying claims that other media pushed poetry aside. What pushed poetry aside was the fact that poets began writing poetry 1) knowing nothing about poetry, and 2) writing as elitists for elitists. I listen to the radio, watch movies and TV, use a computer, etc. and also read
 novels and poetry, so these different forms are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they can be mutually enhancing. If people are running away from your art, it may have more to do with the state of the art. Unless that is seriously considered (which is also an historical perspective), then you're never going to understand why nobody reads poetry anymore.

Way to think historically.

I love that it's the bad modernist poetry that made people read less poetry,
rather than things like radio, television, movies, computers, video games,
the assembly line, and other 20th c. inventions...

I mean, seriously. Do you really think history has nothing to do with
poetry?

Jim,

The key phrase is a stable government "friendly to the United States."
Considering that the recent agreements are exclusively with Western oil
companies and the Iraqi government is showing early signs of a modus vivendi
and also early signs of some independence from Iran (the idea of a "security
agreement" would have been inconceivable a year ago), perhaps that goal is
being reached more than one realizes.

Greenspan mentions that idea of the Iraq War being all about oil in his
book.

Ciao,

Murat

This was a response to David Chirot's post on "Failed Poets," actually,
but I forgot to send it out last week or the week before, whenever:

=20

How about "a 12-Step Program for FAILED POETS":  "Hi, my name is Steve
Tills, and I'm a failed poet."  "Yes, aummm, Good Evening, my name,
aummm, is Carrie Ar, and I am a failed poet."

"Hello, I'm Chris Tucker Matthews Steinemnott, and I'm a failed poet."
"Hello Everyone, my name is Will T. Bucklegeorge, and I, well, I, ummm,
well, I AM a failed poet."

=20

I like/love the idea and practice of "experimenting" and "experiment."
Do I dislike/distain the idea of succeeding/failing?  Yes, the either/or
there is almost automatically problematic. =20

=20

(Ummm, yeah, that Steve Tills guy is pretty effing hard on
"experimenters" sometimes.  I think that he used to be one, or wanted to
be one, himself, at one time.  A wannabe Experimental Poet.  Poot guy.
I mean, Poor guy, but the typo "Poot" was cool, so let's keep it.
Probably some Unconscious reason for its getting made. Right?  Couldn't
be just, simply, a fuggin typo, right?  Yeah, anyway, he shoulda started
a 12-Step program for Failed Wannabe Experimenters.  Gawd knows he had a
lot of Psychological Savvy that went to waste, ummm, even if it could be
said, and then WAS, that he hardly ever succeeded in resolving his own
emotional crises and personality black, grey, magenta, cyan, and
yellowed holes, wholes."                 MT Braak)

=20

Well, jeepers, of course, ALSO, one would be cognizant, and want to be
cognizant, of some sense of succeeding   &&&  failing in one's
experimenting, well, jeepers, of course one would...

=20

If only EVERYBODY could just be misread.  Equally, abundantly,
democratically, frequently.

=20

Last night this fellow I know in his library wrote about Worthlessness -
not, mind you, as an experiment, and surely not in an effort to
experiment - but because he feels THAT sometimes unbearably and also,
perhaps especially, because the notion of putting time into
typesetting/publishing a book makes him feel so worthless.  In CONTRAST
to actually Writing.  Actually writing, investing time in actually
writing, THAT he likes.  Investing time in trying to publish or
circulate what gets written when he invests his time in writing seem
like insanely worthless activity.  Seems totally insane.  And then he
should concern himself with whether others regard his writing as
"successful" or "failing," too?  Fickle NO!  It's the actual activity of
writing that he enjoys, finds

pleasurable, even "useful," and certainly satisfying.  What difference
does it make whether even he himself reads what gets written or not?
(But of course that fellow is, or must be, enormously depressed, at
times, anyway, aye?  And then, though, he wasn't so much "writing about
Worthlessness" as he was writing in response to feelings of
worthlessness and the impulse to complete some proofreading of a
manuscript he is publishing and, frankly, he DOES regard publishing as
WORTHLESS.  Not because it's relatively worthless in the sense of
monetary reward being so negative as the whole sense that WRITING, his,
anyway, is NOT done FOR MONETARY REWARD, or even for Sharing, really.
It's done because it's what he likes to do with his time; it's what he
likes to do.   Of what USE is it to him whether the ink on the paper
gets labelled as Success or Failure.  The ink on the paper after he
engages in the activity of Writing is NOT what he writes for.

Yeah, he's fucking stuck good, isn't he...)

=20

Okay, enough of these misdirections for the moment.  Hey, David, your
post is brilliant and ought to be published.  Heck, there's a whole dang
and worthwhile manifesto there, and NOT the kind that some good folks
devoted so much time and ink to penning 15 years ago in the "Age of
Manifestos."  ("Whooops, there he is, that Steve Tills guy, getting bent
on one of his Post-Reactionary

benders again.  Watch out!  He's liable to hurt somebody when he does
that!"       MT Braak)

=20

Seriously, your depth and range here, David, are remarkable.  Like the
incredible stuff that Stephen Ellis wrote the other day, too.
(Jeepers, I hope that I'm not inspiring these great posts because my own
are thin and wheedling...  You two knock my socks off, that's for sure!
Hats off (too), and Thank you, for your great passion and depth!  We got
some serious reading and re-reading and more re-reading we can do with
this great post of yours.  And that's something, when writing demands
and invites multiple and aggressive and voracious Re-reading, and that's
what you've provided, Neat!  Fantastic stuff!  =20

=20

Some initial responses:

=20

You write, "Edison often made hundreds of experiments before arriving at
'something that worked.'"  Hmmm, I both admire and reject, sometimes
want and sometimes distinctly do NOT want, the AIM at something that
works or doesn't work.  Oh YEAH, no question at all, Edison was a
phenomenal human being and of course a genius, and perhaps equally he
impresses me/one as a hard worker and a courageous fellow who never gave
up.  (One could hardly ever call ANY EDISON a failure, right?)   AND &&&
AND Edison aimed at creating a product, a thing, a practical and useful
and extraordinarily cool object.  A scientist AND entrepreneur, after
all.  But even if a given writer does indeed want his/her writing
"Activity" to "work for himself/herself" - I mean, if the activity
itself is not working out as satisfying whatever it's supposed to be
satisfying, then as "Activity," it would need to be modified or dropped,
of course - there's still such a big difference between "Writing as
Activity, and an End in Itself" and "Writing as Means to Create an
object that others will find useful, successful, failing," etc =20

=20

Yeah, yeah, yeah, who am I trying to kid?  I'd like both AND all of
these things, activities, MEANINGs, Worths, satisfactions, and private
and public results from my writing, experimenting, poming...  And from
and for Others' poetry and/or poetry endeavors and experiments. =20

=20

Actually, I'm not trying to kid anybody, and even if sometimes, like
most others, I will inadvertently and maybe unfortunately kid myself (I
don't mean in my usual kidding way but in a way that causes me to screw
up or misunderstand or stay blind to stuff), I do think that sometimes
it's quite right and prudent (at the risk of feeling like and being a
Big Old PRUDE) to be skeptical about SOME "experimenting" (first and
foremost one's own, always, of course, but OTHERS', too, and not just
strangers', but ALL others') if/when there may be some sort of Fetish
for The New Virus in the air, this or that given season, or Post-season,
that ISN'T really "about" anything but suceeding to be "noticed."  Awww,
geeeeee, I'm showing my ugliest colors yet again, aren't I...  Geesus, I
could make a whole career of this, the one idiot who endlessly condemned
"getting attention" and never understood his own legitimate need for it,
so that "dark side" need grew into a monster and...  And WHTF, that,
TOO, is as legitimate, and HUMAN, a need/desire as anything else.  Why
am I so uptight, sometimes.  Of just plain skeptical (and "critical"),
or maybe simply "jealous." =20

=20

You write, "Also 'success and failure' imply that the poet begins with
some preconceived ideas of the impositions they want to 'experiment
on.'"  In this case, David, I definitely agree, or believe, that
"success" and "failure" are quite legitimate and useful terms that one
applies to what one is doing, aiming for, seeking satisfaction from.
And notice also, for sure, that here "success" and "failure" are private
terms, privately supplied and applied - and I do NOT mean in the way a
Faulkner might say, "I was a failed poet"; that's just another way of
saying "I cut my teeth in the game of Poetry, so I thus got some really
great training for my fiction writing from the best of Wordsmiths,
didn't I, fans?"  Again, I seeing that kind of comment by "a" Faulkner
as being just run-of-the-mill (and really quite innocuous)
self-promotion.  Or obviously disingenuous self-effacement.   Won't
someone come along and say, eventually, something like, "I was a failed
Language Poet" or "I was a failed Flarfist"?  And won't that be another
way of saying, "I succeeded at WHAT I did write, or fashion, and perhaps
because I put all of that ("failed") effort into the excellent other
tradition." =20

=20

Yes, indeed, any given poet would be beginning with some "preconceived
ideas of the impositions they want to 'experiment on,'" yes.  Yes, yes,
he/she would...  This "can" also imply a radical split between form and
concent, or "How" and "What," too, though, don't ya think...  (Yes, it's
cool to "error on" the side of "form," not "material," to be sure, too,
but...)  Yeah, BUT What "about" poets who have already pretty much
decided on, or gotten comfortable with, "found" a form, or formal range,
that works for them, and then, mostly, it IS the WHAT that they are
concerned with, ultimately...  I mean, and NO I don't know, or won't
claim to know, but did Frank O'Hara, really spend a lot of time
"experimenting" with his form(s) or formal means, ultimately, or pretty
much, at least after mid-"career," let's say, just let things rip, put a
sheet of paper in the typewriter and typed out "WHAT" ever came to
mind/heart?  Pound, after pretty much settling on the Canto?  Olson,
after getting his "thing(s)" theory all settled.  Emily Dickinson, once
she'd gotten comfortable with her scoring on the page?  Whitman?
Marianne Moore? =20

=20

Well, you know, I for one read O'Hara for the "sensibility," the
"spirit," the "tone," and the "humor," NOT the overall "Form."  Pound,
for the overall "Form."  Olson, BOTH, but there is MUCH to trust in the
"particulars" of "content" that cannot be trusted in the particulars of
Pound's content, AND, for both, the "particulars of Form," making a
slight but I think real distinction, are excellent, but I really could
less WHAT Pound "says," right?  Dickinson, DEFINITELY care what she
"says," what her poems "say," what her Poetry "says."  And her
"particulars" of form are equally intriguing.  Moore?  Cool particulars
of form, I guess, yeah, but after that?  What's left?  If ya had to make
a distinction, if there IS a distinction, IF there is, who does one read
for "form" and who does one read for "content?"  Whitman, well, again,
Content is KING.  This is TRUE content, isn't it?  WHAT the poetry says
MATTERS with Whitman, yes?  All of this distinction between "Form" and
"Content" is Arbitrary, misguided, pedestrian, bourgeois, lacking?
Maybe so, and it IS certainly a "weakness" of my own that I will forever
have to trouble myself about, but can anybody deny that the emphasis
since the Language Poets has been "on Formal invention" and away from
"Content," as it were?  Not necessarily the Language Poets, themselves,
but the rest of "us" since then.  If we "errored," or, hey-ho lookie
here there's that word "failed" all of a sudden, if we errored or failed
to one side or the other, is it possible that we have errored to the
"formal" side?  Or should it be argued that there is no such "erroring?"
Or "failing?"  That ALL experimenting, even Especially "formal
experimentation," is noble, honorable, and "good?" =20

=20

I don't think that we could possibly say that.  I think that at least
SOME formal experimentation would have to be nothing but "a fetish" and
a sick, narcissistic, one at that  (Whoops, there goes that pedantic,
fucking stupid moralistic and assholish prudish pretentious side of a
couple of his selves again.  Damn it!).  Okay, NOT "sick" or even
"narcissistic," but maybe "fetishistic" or just plain Lame.  Again,
isn't it at least a little bit true that there has been some
considerable erroring to the "make it New" (and "New" being almost
entirely in terms of "formal" NEW) side of things since the early 90's?
I cannot believe otherwise.  And it's no great sin, even if that Steve
Tills guy when he's at his highest Holy Royal Heiner tone of
pretentiousness and moralizing starts bemoaning and condemning it.  In
fact, it's "natural" and a blessing, the result of the incredible TRUE
work that the very courageous Language Poets and other
"experimentalists" and overall 60's generation poets have done to make
opportunities in Academe and Publishing for everybody who can/would/does
count themselves, for lack of better terms, "Progressive Poets."  No,
not, at this moment, "avant-garde," "experimental," "exploratory," or
"post-avant," but "Progressive," BECAUSE it's largely a wider and deeper
Political, and Content, issue, not just an Aesthestic, and, more
narrowly, Formal issue, so, for the moment, "Progressive Poets."  YES,
there are Ten times more of us than existed in 1985, or would exist
today, largely because the Language Poets, particularly, advocated so
vigorously, courageously, shrewdly, successfully, stubbornly,
relentlessly, and rightly for ALL OF US.  But part of their success was
"an Opening up" of formal means, and Form, partially as a method of
opposing the primary vehicle of academic exclusion and priviledge and
hegemony - adherence to received Forms.  And partly out of that
fantastically shrewd and ingenious marketing ploy that succeeded beyond
everybody's wildest dreams, diversifying everything, redistributing so
much wealth and opportunity, we got a Giant Fetish for Form, too.  A
sometimes - that's SOMETIMES - very false addiction to "Form."  And
that's alright, even for one of the most jealous and sometimes bitterest
fools around (me, that is), but it IS nonetheless, sometimes very False,
and we would do very well to devote great attention to the "particulars
of Content," I think. =20

=20

Of course, "we" already have, and there are surely, at least a thousand
pomers Today who already have discovered incredible frontiers of new
"particulars of Content" that for example, and this would be one of
infiniterewards, avoid whole prisons of Sexism and Classism and the
like, but I still think that we are lagging in terms of drawing intense
attention to all kinds of "particulars of Content," and Substance, and
such that have nothing to do with "new Form," or needs to invent more of
such.  Yeah, this notion IF one can usefully make a distinction between
Content and Form in the first place, and at the risk of not being
completely stupid, as hundred of poets have probably already done these
things, and I'm just lagging myself in my reading, and I'm quite naive.
But I still think that it's not so much How as What we write, and that
may sound pathetically overgeneralized and archaic and naive and
prehistoric and OLD and all, but no matter the "Form" I'm still always
looking for "the Sensibility" and the "Truth of/in the Details" and the
"Underlying Integrity" and the "Degree of Depth and Insight Imbued" and
the "Originality of Perspective" and the "Intensity of Compassion" and
the "Bearing on True Reality" and whatever the hell all of these things
would/could refer to, but they're decidely NOT aspects of FORM, so I'm
attached to and ever hungry for SOMETHING ELSE, huh.  Ya know, one of
the best poets, Michael Palmer, made the big distinction between "the
Formal" and "the Material" back in the Lang Pomers' heyday, and surely
he's as much a pioneer of "Form" as anybody, but doesn't one always
sense a very palpable "Integrity" and "Depth" in his poetry, and isn't
it THAT, really, that makes his poetry so "trustworthy," as it were?  Or
the "Truth" in the small details of Rae Armantrout's _Made to Seem_, for
example.  I mean, first, they're "details" that SHOULD BE noticed, and
ARE, and second, the treatment of those "details" is so genuine and
sincere and humble; there's such humility and "care," and all.  Or
something like that...    =20

=20

=20

P.S.  Finally, in all honesty, I've got hundreds of books on my shelves,
and ESPECIALLY from the quite recent last 10 years, that absolutely
abound with "particulars of BOTH Form AND Content," so, I admit that I
should "work" harder to explain why the heck these kinds of thoughts
come to my head in the first place...

A TRIBUTE TO GRACE PALEY: A WRITER WHO FOUND BEAUTY IN THE=20
EVERYDAY.

By Doug Holder

On a warm and humid morning in late June I jumped on the Red Line to go t=
o=20
UMass Boston, to attend the William Joiner Writers Workshop=92s tribute t=
o=20
writer Grace Paley.
The Workshop is directed by poet Kevin Bowen, and is held every summer at=
=20
the Boston campus. The late Grace Paley is a renowned fiction writer and =
poet=20
who passed away in 2007. Paley was an enthusiastic, and much admired and=20=

loved teacher at the William Joiner. She was born in 1922 in the Bronx to=
=20
Russian-Jewish immigrants. She published three collections of short=20
stories =93The Little Disturbances of Man,=94 (1959), =93Enormous Changes=
 at the=20
Last Minute (1974), and =93 Later the Same Day=94 (1985), and her =93Coll=
ected=20
Stories=94(1994) was a finalist for a Pulitzer and a National Book Award.=
 She=20
published several volumes of poetry, was elected the first New York State=
=20
Writer, and the Vermont Poet Laureate in (2003). Paley was also a politic=
al=20
activist involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as the Women=92=
s=20
Movement. In 1969 she accompanied the peace mission to Hanoi to negotiate=
=20
the release of prisoners of war. In 1978 she was arrested as one of the =93=
White=20
House Eleven=94 for unfurling an anti-nuclear banner on the White House l=
awn.

  Paley=92s writing focuses on the lives of women, examining their gritty=
=20
everyday world. Her characters ranged from left wing women, their kids, t=
heir=20
husbands, their lovers, their aging parents, and their aging selves. She =
was a=20
master of dialogue, and a champion of everyday life in contemporary liter=
ature.

  At the tribute were a number of Somerville poets including: Pushcart Pr=
ize=20
winner Afaa Michael Weaver, Off the Grid Press publishers Bert Stern and =
Tam=20
Lin Neville, Somerville poet, writer and activist Alex Kern, and Ibbetson=
 Street=20
Press author Elizabeth Quinlan (=93 Promise Supermarket=94). Paley=92s hu=
sband Bob=20
Nichols was present, as well as her daughter Nora.

  Sitting next to me in the audience was Henry Braun, one of the founders=
 of=20
Somerville=92s Off the Grid Press, and a friend of Nichols and Paley. Bra=
un, who=20
was once an editor of the Beloit Poetry Journal said of Paley: =93She was=
 the=20
voice of my people. People who came from New York, the Lower East Side,=20=

political activists from the Vietnam era.=94 Afaa Michael Weaver, who was=
=20
teaching at the Joiner this summer said later that he had met Paley two y=
ears=20
before at the Joiner Center and was impressed by her graciousness and=20
her =93commitment to society.=94

 Julie Thacker, a creative writing instructor at Lesley University in Cam=
bridge,=20
lead the discussion of Paley and her work. She told me that Paley had=20
a =93Singular and human voice, married poetry and prose together beautifu=
lly,=20
and found beauty in ordinary life. She also exhibited a striking compassi=
on.=94

  The audience often commented on passages from Paley=92s work and pepper=
ed=20
their commentary with memories of Paley=92s teaching at the Joiner Center=
. Most=20
were in agreement with the fact that Paley, along with Tillie Olsen, were=
 the=20
first writers to open up the idea of ordinary woman as being good fodder =
for=20
stories. Poet Elizabeth Quinlan told me: =93 For the first time I realize=
d that you=20
could write about being a struggling young mother, your babies, even, wel=
l,=20
your period.=94 Martha Collins, the founder of the undergraduate Creative=
=20
Writing program at UMass Boston said she was amazed how Paley could=20
combine the =93political=94 with the fabric of life, and do it with such =
great humor.=20
Paley, according to the anecdotes of the many folks who knew her was a=20=

master of dialogue, organically bringing the conversational into her work=
. She=20
was a big believer in revision. Her husband Bob Nichols pointed out to th=
e=20
audience that they should respond to her work not only on an intellectual=
 level=20
but also on an emotional level . He reminded the audience that her work w=
as=20
all about emotional content. He also noted that Paley when she was giving=
 a=20
reading was always looking down at the text, rather than the audience. Po=
et=20
Fred Marchant, the director of the Poetry Center at Suffolk University
said this was testimony to her singular focus on her work.

 Paley, to her credit, was able to marry the profound and the ordinary,=20=

without sounding stilted. And in all of her work there was endless=20
conversation, rather than a strong sense plot. Like in her fiction, the t=
ribute=20
was an ongoing conversation punctuated by memories, and always-generous=20=

doses of laughter. One student remembered Paley asking her to her home to=
=20
discuss her work. She said: =93 Let me make you a cheese sandwich.  You=92=
ll love=20
it.=94  And I guess Paley would like it that way, to be remembered by her=
 work,=20
and, yes, even her cheese sandwiches.

Not at all like slam poetry, or not much. Both involve vocal performance,
but as the name suggests, sound poetry is just sound, not necessarily words.
Listen to Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate at Ubu. It is a good example of sound
poetry. http://www.ubu.com/sound/schwitters.html

Sorry, when I said "think historically" I meant "think about groups larger
than just yourself."

Funny comment about the poets knowing nothing about poetry though. Now
that's a strong argument.

Troy,

Did the first person to write a poem KNOW anything about poetry? Was
there a poetic prime mover?

This repeated mantra, that poetry is dying and has been, is so tiring
and completely false. If anything , poetry has always been marginal,
been despised by segments of society that (perhaps, if you're the
wagering sort) seek to obscure meaning, and pin down  suggestion as a
commodity (I say this, you buy this.) If anything, there are more
people writing poetry now than ever. Just search the internet...it's
everywhere. In some ways, Baudrillard's concept about art easily
applies to poetry: since poetry is everywhere, it no longer exists.
This seems to be the contradiction working in your statement below. If
poetry exists in songs (qualify please. In ALL songs? Some? Which?)
and is more present than ever before, then isn't this the reason it's
dying? Is poetry overexposed?

Also, I find your use of terms confusing. Is poetry elitist? Is
television? What is elitism? It sounds, with statements like, "bizarre
poetry, etc. is a great way for elitists to separate themselves from
the rabble, you know" that you mean to imply that all experimentation
is elitist. That's big news coming from a Ph.D. such as yourself. It
just seems off. Counterproductive and dissonant. It's weird that
there's this "bizarre" poetry based on radio and tv (great equalizers,
if anything) that somehow, written as a response to these things,
suddenly becomes "elitist" to you.

But I guess if writers know nothing about poetry, then it's probably
somewhat difficult for them to be "elitist," don't you think?

-Ryan

> The two aren't unrelated, you know. It's no coincidence that you started getting things like impressionism when photography came about. Milan Kundera observes that the novel (for example) should do only what the novel can do. The same can be said about poetry. TV and film are their own media, and do not necessarily exclude the reading of poetry. Much of the Modernists' experiments came about precisely in reaction to such things as radio, etc. Part of the result was that it became something only elitists were interested in (bizarre poetry, etc. is a great way for elitists to separate themselves from the rabble, you know). But lyric poetry in the form of songs is as strong as ever -- belying claims that other media pushed poetry aside. What pushed poetry aside was the fact that poets began writing poetry 1) knowing nothing about poetry, and 2) writing as elitists for elitists. I listen to the radio, watch movies and TV, use a computer, etc. and also read

If people are running away from your art, it may have more to do with the state of the art. Unless that is seriously considered (which is also an historical perspective), then you're never going to understand why nobody reads poetry anymore.

The Booklyn Artist Alliance is pleased to announce the publication of =20=

Haiku Not Bombs.

Haiku Not Bombs is an outgrowth of the haiku year, published by Soft =20
Skull Press in 1998.  In 1996, a group of friends made a commitment to =20=

write one haiku a day and mail them to each other. At the end of the =20
year, they realized that their collection of simple, critical =20
observations had given them a new way to look at the details of their =20=

lives. Original members of the project included Michael Stipe, Grant-=20
Lee Phillips, Tom Gilroy, Jim McKay, Anna Grace and other contributors =20=

from diverse artistic backgrounds ranging from pop music and theater =20
to independent film.

In the current incarnation of the haiku year project, several of the =20
project=92s founding members decided to continue with their haiku =20
practice, inviting new writers to take part in a new collaborative =20
project.  The challenge was reduced to writing one haiku poem for =20
every week of the year. The collection of contributors to the current =20=

manuscript, include Tom Gilroy, Jim McKay, Grant-Lee Phillips, Denise =20=

Siegel, Biskit Roth, Alison Roth, Patrick So, and Shin Yu Pai. The =20
poems in Haiku Not Bombs range from the one-line hokku form and the =20
Filipino hay(na)ku to linked verses (renga) and the loose western =20
style haiku favored by writers like Jack Kerouac and American =20
practitioners of the craft.  Some emergent themes include modernity, =20
urban life and the everyday.

Copies of Haiku Not Bombs are available from the Booklyn website at  =20
for $15 each + shipping. The book combines a mix of high and low =20
culture and technique: letterpressed covers from Kallemeyn Press, with =20=

hand-tipped art, and saddle-stapled binding. Printed in an edition of =20=

1,000 copies.

Please join the authors for a book release party on July 9, 2008, from =20=

8-10 pm at Think Coffee at 248 Mercer Street, NY, NY.  The event is =20
sponsored by the Pen & Cup Reading Series.

People run away from my art because it's a huge hairy monster (though
it has a good heart at times). The fact of the matter is that people
aren't fleeing poetry in terror or otherwise; they merely do not seek
it out. Unlike pop music, it isn't widely broadcast. For the most
part, it's taught in school (when it's taught) as a dead thing created
hundreds of years ago. The mast majority of kids who learn to hate or
be intimidated by poetry aren't learning those feelings from reading
The Wasteland, The Cantos, or anything that came later. They're
learning it through the way Byron, Shelley, and Shakespeare (and maybe
a smidge of Milton) are taught. This is, however, not the fault of
those illustrious poets.

On the other hand, I have on occasion had the opportunity to visit
middle school classrooms in the US and guess what? The students really
dug experimental and other free verse poetry (including my own
hairy-monster art) when it was presented to them with enthusiasm.

how could a government that hands over its wealth to foreign powers be
stable? and how could it be even remotely friendly to those powers? it just
can't be. a smile from someone with a boot on their face can only be

Subject:      Braincap (2000-2008): Back in Black
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Just a note to friends and well-wishers that Braincap, my eight year old
Kyushu goldfish and the partner of my midnight ramblings has shaken off
this mortal coil and has ascended to wherever it is the metaphysical
portion of good fishes go.  He (I truly believe it was a he, though
sometimes I wondered), showed me that goldfish could truly be peaceful,
thoughtful, planetary beings.  In fact, as Braincap assumed his adult
proportions (about 10 inches in length, four in girth), he reminded me
of a dugong, with that same kind of "easy does it" manner; in addition
he and his friends Biggie and Abc-sama all reminded me of a herd of
little cows grazing on the stones of their near-industrial sized
aquarium.

Braincap was born in Fukuoka prefecture, and came as a group of six tiny
fish that my son won at a temple matsuri (festival) in July of that
long-ago time, just north of the year 2000.  We decided to purchase a
small plastic aquarium and introduced a bubble stone to keep the crew
happy.  Little did we know that these little fish would thrive and come
with us by plane to our new home near Tokyo, and that they would stick
with us to calm us and cheer us up through good times and through bad.

Braincap was the most gifted of the crew.  He recognized his name,
watched CNN with me and offered passable commentary--at times blazingly
intelligent commentary--on global warming and other subjects of vital
concern.  He did a great imitation of George W. Bush (fool me
once...)and predicted that Weapons of Mass Destruction would never be
found.  When Hillary began her run he (or was it she?) swam hot and
cold.  Braincap was definitely for a woman running for office, but maybe
just not that woman.  I'm happy to add that Braincap was an Obama
supporter, a tradition that he began and that now I and the whole
Ahadada group maintain.

Braincap is survived by his spawn-mates Biggie (pushing 11 inches, 4
inches girth) and Abc-sama, and the Glass family of Shin-Urayasu.
Tributes in experimental, conceptual, and visual poetries would be
greatly appreciated.  Back-channel them and we'll put the best up on
the ahadada books website.

Thanks, and yours in Fish-Consciousness,

Jesse

i probably came off more snide than i meant in my earlier post, trying to
hit on what separates lyric out from a lot of other kinds of poetry, not to
mention other media and the way historical epochs frame aesthetic
questions.  It was an impulsive idea to try to make a case for lyric in a
lyric mode. but since much of the poetry i write has been considered
such--lyric--so that i feel called on to say something a little more
extensive about it--

i'd like to thank Robin for mentioning Palgrave's Golden Treasury, a book
i'd never seen, but follows with a set of classics that would make for a
beautiful investigation--along with Percy's Reliques of Ancient English
Poetry (which book Richard Owens told me to read)--Alan Lomax's Folk Songs
of America--etc. etc.

In poetry, especially contemporary poetry, lyric has a much different role
to play for readers than previously.  At a basic level of understanding,
lyric is verse composed to be sung with musical accompaniment, with a lyre.
Historically, I think it depends on much more than a simple syntactic shift
of WE--I, but in our recent ghostly haze of grammatology we have become very
deeply invested in "find--replace" poetry as a way of watching words,
syntax, speech acts and images spin out of their contextual anchors & we're
having a blast trying to catch them as they fly away.

But like Hermes' poor treatment of the mountain tortoise, scooping out the
guts of the animal to get a decent soundboard doesn't answer Stephen
Vincent's question.  Because, for all i can tell, we're still stuck in the
same set of terms that framed the contentious question of what a poem means
that was started a long time ago & with prodding seems only to open old
wounds for many (or taps the "delete" button).  And, because of our cultural
economy of multimedia and art-by-committee, this argument may seem nothing
more than teacup tempestuousness.  It is odd how many sharp critical poets
spend more time on their movie and music reviews than in serious talk about
poems.  One doesn't choose to be a poet (and especially a poet writing in
lyric mode) to become a salon poet or to escape the social, or to "go
quiet".  C'mon all you hypocritical readers!!

I thought to myself: "Self, you can ditch Heidegger and cuddle up with
Freud, but you're not out of the psychological woods yet."  And I'm not
going to go into this any further here, because, as I get a better
perspective on the broader nature of this issue, I can only indicate some of
the first sources I'm going to be using to tease this question out (and
hopefully can post to my blog in due time).  And perhaps its just ego, but I
have to say I'm not doing this for any academic satisfaction or scholarly
necessity, or to prop up a career--

My first thought was to re-read Benjamin's "On Some Motifs In Baudelaire",
then, obviously, Adorno and Horkheimer's _Dialectic of Enlightenment_ (i was
right, they set out a tasty plate of problems)--from there I'm off to
Bergson's _Matter and Memory_.  This should allow me enough vocabulary to
abrade this old, crudely sawn tapestry, get some terms of authentic
experience and terms of dialectics, that will allow a reading of some
non-traditional (and TOO traditional) lyric anthology projects:  Palgrave's
Golden Treasury, Percy's Reliques, and Lomax's Folk Songs. I'm very hesitant
to take up these questions in either strict constructionist or
deconstructionist terms, because they truly bore me, but will have to let
the shape fill itself in.  My poetry-per-se lyric modernist/postmodernist
experience will fall somewhere between Baudelaire's evil flowers and
Berrigan's sonnets (this last, for me, the culmination of the now-receding
ecstasy of lyrical syntax tumbling).

so maybe i'll send you a postcard if you'd like.  I'm gonna be in Memphis
for a while.

411 N 7th Ave Suite 103
Tucson, AZ 85705-8332

A few weeks ago when we moved into our new studio (with partner, painter
Cynthia Miller), our landlord told us to use 411 7th Ave B -- now the
post office has told us there is no such address, has finally released
mail they've been holding for us for two weeks, and has created a brand
new address for us.

This is good for Chax Press, Charles Alexander, & Cynthia Miller.

Chax Press
411 N 7th Ave Suite 103
Tucson, AZ 85705-8332


In a building with only two large spaces, just WHY there should be a
suite 103 is totally beyond me, but that's the way it is. Sorry, then to
have two address changes within a few weeks, but PLEASE update your
address books if Chax was in them in the first place. Or add this NEW
address only if it was not. This supercedes the address as stated on our
web site, which will be updated very soon.

Thank you,

Charles

Nobody reads poetry anymore because they aren't exposed to it as children a=

e they had no access to it, most people don't even know poetry exists.=A0 A=
s for the elitism of experimental poetry of the 20th and 21st century, that=
 is another matter.=A0 Anyone who takes chances with a tradition risks isol=
ating him or herself from the larger group of people who will not understan=
d what is going on or who simply don't care.=A0 I don't think that is neces=
sarily elitism but in certain cases, particularly Pound's and Eliot's, it m=
ay have been accompanied by elitism.=A0 Williams, Olson, and many other exp=
erimental poets were populists trying to do something that would resonate w=
ith the larger masses of educated readers.=A0 Whether they ever reached tho=

The two aren't unrelated, you know. It's no coincidence that you started
getting things like impressionism when photography came about. Milan Kunder=
a
observes that the novel (for example) should do only what the novel can do.=
 The
same can be said about poetry. TV and film are their own media, and do not
necessarily exclude the reading of poetry. Much of the Modernists'
experiments came about precisely in reaction to such things as radio, etc. =
Part
of the result was that it became something only elitists were interested in
(bizarre poetry, etc. is a great way for elitists to separate themselves fr=
om
the rabble, you know). But lyric poetry in the form of songs is as strong a=
s
ever -- belying claims that other media pushed poetry aside. What pushed po=
etry
aside was the fact that poets began writing poetry 1) knowing nothing about
poetry, and 2) writing as elitists for elitists. I listen to the radio, wat=
ch
movies and TV, use a computer, etc. and also read
 novels and poetry, so these different forms are not mutually exclusive. In
fact, they can be mutually enhancing. If people are running away from your =
art,
it may have more to do with the state of the art. Unless that is seriously
considered (which is also an historical perspective), then you're never
going to understand why nobody reads poetry anymore.

Way to think historically.

I love that it's the bad modernist poetry that made people read less
poetry,
rather than things like radio, television, movies, computers, video games,
the assembly line, and other 20th c. inventions...

I mean, seriously. Do you really think history has nothing to do with
poetry?

POINT 5 presents

JANET HAMILL, SPARROW, & THOMAS DEVANEY

Saturday, June 28th at 5:00 PM
Point 5 (383.5 Madison Avenue) in Albany, New York.


SPARROW
Sparrow lives in the heart of the Catskill Mountains, within the snug
village of Phoenicia, New York, with his wife Violet Snow and daughter
Sylvia. For Sylvia's 16th birthday, Sparrow gave her Johannes Brahms'
Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 77, on cassette. Soft Skull Press has
published three of Sparrow's books. (Watch him on www. rumur. tv/sparrow.=
)

THOMAS DEVANEY
Thomas Devaney is the author of A Series of Small Boxes (Fish Drum,
2007) and The American Pragmatist Fell in Love (Banshee Press, 1999).
Devaney is a Senior Writing Fellow in the English Department at the
University of Pennsylvania. He has worked with the Institute of
Contemporary Art (Phila) on a number of site specific, multi-sensory
projects, including "No Silence Here, Enjoy the Silence" for the
Locally Localized Gravity exhibit, "Tales from the 215" for the
Philadelphia Freedom exhibit with Zoe Strauss, and the performance
"The Empty House" at the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site for
The Big Nothing exhibit. (TD: http://writing. upenn. edu/~tdevaney/).

JANET HAMILL
Poet, painter, and performer Janet Hamill was born in Jersey City, NJ.
For her first five years she gazed across the Hudson from Weehawken,
NJ, before the family moved north to New Milford, in Bergen County. In
the mid-sixties Janet attended Glassboro State College (now Rowan
University), in Glassboro, NJ, where she met life-long friend,
singer/songwriter, Patti Smith. After graduating with a BA in English
from Glassboro, Janet joined Patti in New York. Using the city as a
base, and bookstore jobs as a livelihood, Janet lived out her first
love, travel, during her twenties and early thirties. Some of her
journeys included cross-country trips in the USA and sojourns in
Canada, Mexico, Morocco, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania,
Denmark, England, France, Spain, Italy, and Ireland.

Janet is the author of four books: Lost Ceilings, Nostalgia of the
Infinite, The Temple, and Troublante. Her poetry and fiction have
appeared in anthologies such as Living With the Animals, Up Late:
American Poetry Since 1970, The Low-Tech Manual, The Unmade Bed, and
Deep Down: The New Sensual Writing by Women.

A strong advocate of the spoken word, Janet has read widely at well
known poetry venues such as The Peoples' Poetry Gathering, St. Marks
Church and the Walt Whitman Cultural Center. Early in September of
1997, Janet was the featured poet at the first Liss Ard Festival, in
Skibbereen, County Cork, Ireland. The festival is held annually to
raise world-wide environmental awareness.

In the summer of 1997 Janet began to perform her poetry with the music
of Moving Star, a backing group of musicians named after one of her
poems. They are Bob Torsello (bass), Jay LoRubbio (guitar) and Sean
Healy (drums). In their short time together, Janet and Moving Star
have performed at the The People's Poetry Gathering, The Knitting
Factory and CBGB's Gallery in New York City, as well as clubs in
Orange and Ulster Counties. Recently, Janet and the band released
their first full-length CD, Flying Nowhere, produced by Lenny Kaye,
with two cameo appearances by Patti Smith on clarinet.

Bravo, Elizabeth. That's putting the way it is and where it belongs. If the
educators suck, then their presentation of poetry is going to do the same.
The kids would be alright if poetry were presented as an exciting art form.
And they can probably relate to it more if it is presented in colloquial
rather than as some ancient rhyme. Let the poetry talk the way they talk and
it'll take them home.
The type of talk we hear presented in this thread is the type that's plagued
music forever. Think of the big band jazz fans attempting to come to grips
with Bird and Diz and them decrying the death of jazz. The same happened in
the 50s with Miles. And then the sixties with Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Ornette,
Trane, et al. Yet, much of the music of the sixties have begun being played
as background for modern day commercials - not that that's any sine qua non.
Anyway, signing off.
Sayonara.

People run away from my art because it's a huge hairy monster (though
it has a good heart at times). The fact of the matter is that people
aren't fleeing poetry in terror or otherwise; they merely do not seek
it out. Unlike pop music, it isn't widely broadcast. For the most
part, it's taught in school (when it's taught) as a dead thing created
hundreds of years ago. The mast majority of kids who learn to hate or
be intimidated by poetry aren't learning those feelings from reading
The Wasteland, The Cantos, or anything that came later. They're
learning it through the way Byron, Shelley, and Shakespeare (and maybe
a smidge of Milton) are taught. This is, however, not the fault of
those illustrious poets.

On the other hand, I have on occasion had the opportunity to visit
middle school classrooms in the US and guess what? The students really
dug experimental and other free verse poetry (including my own
hairy-monster art) when it was presented to them with enthusiasm.

How come mathematics gets to be "elitist"?  Why is poetry condemned to
"having to have meaning/be understandable?"

Personally, I don't believe in elitism as a label; I think it's
largely used to hide embarrassing moments of "I don't get this."

Having said all that, where does Jackson Mac Low fit on this scale as he
seems to have written sound poems in 1937 or 8 as can be seen in his
recently release Thing of Beauty. But this consists of words as well as
sounds? The material he released subsequent to falling under the sway of
John Cage also seems to carry both.

john: roughly speaking, the two are not altogether unrelated fellow
travellers with rather different genealogies. sound poetry traces its roots
back to european dada in the 1910s and is conveyed in polyglot trans-sense
utterances, often written out in scores but very much intended to be
performed. kurt schwitters "ur sonata" is the cornerstone of such work.

slam poetry originated in chicago in the mid-1980s and is also heavily
dependent upon performance, in this case of a wholly memorized and/or
partially improvised text. the performance takes place in the context of a
competition where individual 3-minute performances are judged by the
audience and those results compiled for the given teams of performers,
victorious teams travelling on to face other teams at higher levels of
competition. that said, i think a slam "style" exists outside of this
competitive sphere. saul williams would be an example.

and i'd say further that the two strains can be seen converging in the work
of tracie morris.

Math is both understandable and meaningful. But to practice it and understand it, you have to learn a lot of techniques.

The arts are different from the sciences (including math) in that they are meaningful and valuable in a more complex, more directly human way. There's dehumanizing, nihilistic art, and humanizing, meaningful art. I personally like a lot of elite art; but I also understand why most people don't. Part of it is indeed that they don't get it. And why isn't that a valid criticism? Why should people rely on a bunch of overeducated elites (like myself) telling them what this or that work means, and why it's significant? Shouldn't there be at least some level in every art where the average person "gets it"? This doesn't mean, of course, that one cannot learn more about a work -- meaning critics, etc. are still needed to help people see all the possibilities -- but the best works are not those that only require critics for anyone to understand what is going on. There's a certain tyranny of meaning-making in only having critics able to understand a work of art.

The most beautiful works are those that one can get some meaning from right away, but which gain in meaning the more you understand and learn. Those works both the uneducated and the educated can appreciate. Why shouldn't we want to create that kind of poetry? Why should we only ever want to exist in the realm of the elite, where only a select few "truly understand"?

Dear Listfolk,

William Logan apparently never read a dead gay poet he could avoid taking
the opportunity to bash.

After his savaging of the Library of America edition of Hart Crane last
January, Logan is back in this weekend's *New York Times Book Review* for an
encore performance, dishing out his thinly-veiled contempt for Frank O'Hara
in an ostensible review of the recent *Selected Poems* edited by Mark Ford.

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/books/review/Logan-t.html

Here's a walk through Logan's "arguments":

1) Contrary to custom, death did not serve O'Hara well since it gave
us a *Collected
Poems* that enshrined a sizeable body of work with little merit.

2) His "falling in" with New York School painters and poets enabled his
celebration of life filled with frivolous gossip.

3) Spontaneity is no substitute for studied labor at one's craft.

4) The reality "O'Hara almost never faces up to [is] the emptiness beneath
this high life and low desire" -- one that extends to and includes his
homosexuality: "O'Hara wrote about homosexual life with a cheerful
nonchalance rarely matched since."

5) Ford's selection ultimately does not much help a body of work consisting
only of a dozen or so truly worthwhile poems, because his poetic practice is
fundamentally flawed: "When O'Hara was lucky, he was very lucky, because his
method could not help but fail most of the time."

I'll leave readers to decide which of Logan's insults are truly offensive
and which merely cheeky. I also wonder what kind of campaign would be needed
to convince the NYTBR editors to give Logan a permanent respite from his
reviewing duties.

Sincerely,
Tom Orange

whaddya mean, "Nobody reads poetry"?  Everybody I know reads poetry -- and I
know a lot of people, from a lot of different social classes.  (I may not
like all the poetry they read, but that doesn't stop them from reading it.)
I think what you must mean is: "Nobody shows poetry on television."  And
that is easily explained by the fact that television programmers are
elitists, who will do nothing that challenges their own elitist hold on
ever-increasing money and power. (Most poets I know, by way of contrast, are
radical democrats who spend the majority of their waking hours working
toward a participatory cultural economy...)

How come mathematics gets to be "elitist"?  Why is poetry condemned to
"having to have meaning/be understandable?"

Personally, I don't believe in elitism as a label; I think it's largely used
to hide embarrassing moments of "I don't get this."

Elizabeth, this is exactly right. If poetry lacks readers, it is not because
of the poetry itself but because of the way poetry is presented and packaged
in schools and other cultural institutions that distribute it.

A good anecdote: Earlier this year, Ron Padgett and Joel Dailey did a
reading together here in New Orleans, at the Gold Mine bar in the French
Quarter. I was on my way down there on the streetcar, when the guy sitting
in front of me, who was writing a text message, turned around and asked me
how to spell "poetry."  I told him. About half an hour after I got to the
bar, that same guy walked in. He had asked me how to spell poetry
because his text was about meeting a friend at the reading. After the
reading was over, we talked for a few minutes about poetry. He told me that
he'd always thought of poetry as something elitist, for stuck up university
types, but that this reading was nothing like that. He really enjoyed it.
His impression of poetry was formed in school, where poetry was introduced
to him as something alien and impossible to understand. Something that would
never engage someone like him, a working class guy with no intention of
going to college.

People are taught that the world of poetry is a closed one that they can
neither enter nor interact with in an real way. Poetry in the classroom is
far too often something fixed, that occurred in the past and has lost any
possibility of dynamism or a present. When it is seen as something that
addresses present concerns, present language, and when it is a conversation
between present, living people, it is no longer seen as irrelevant,
regardless of its difficulty. Of course, you can't please everyone, but what
poet ever has?

I have always thought that the "people don't read poetry anymore because
poetry is too hard to understand" argument was itself elitist, a means of
cordoning poetry off as the province of people who only enjoy antiquated
styles of writing.

This Sunday, PRISM Poetry and Karawane: Or, the Temporary Death of the
Bruitist present the release party for issue 10, celebrating our 10th
anniversary as well.  The event will include Laura Winton, J. Otis Powell!,
and Christopher Shillock with other artists TBA, this Sunday, 1:00 pm, June
29th at Coffee Gallery, 1011 Washington Avenue in Minneapolis.



Karawane, a journal of experimental performance texts, began in 1997 as
Voices From the Well, showcasing open mic poets of the Twin Cities.  Over
the years, we have focused more and more on experimental work and expanded
to include performance texts of all kinds, reflecting the cross-pollination
of art forms and the way in which once we bring our work to audiences, we
find ourselves expanding into other forms and styles.  The name of the
journal was based on a sound poem by Hugo Ball and was chosen to indicate
that we were spoken word more in the sense and spirit of Cabaret Voltaire
than a poetry slam.



If you are in the Twin Cities, please stop by and catch the show and say
hello.



If you are not in the Twin Cities and would like to order a hard copy of the
journal, email us at Karawane@earthlink.net.



We also have a MySpace presence at http://www.myspace.com/karawane.  You can
read samples from current and previous issues at
http://www.karawanemagazine.blogspot.com
<http://www.karawanemagazine.blogspot.com/>  and can download full PDFs of
many back issues at http://www.karawane.homestead.com
<http://www.karawane.homestead.com/> . If all of that doesn't satisfy your
web jones . . . well, we got nothin' else.



Cheers.

Troy,

But I think that's where you're wrong: most of what you're calling
"elite" isn't intended to be only understood by a few, but rather
represents (sometimes vain) attempts to open dialog where there wasn't
previously. In this case, then, what most people don't understand
isn't what they don't "get", but what they aren't familiar with (as in
Michael's example) due to lack of good teachers, exposure, what have
you.

There's dehumanizing, nihilistic art, and humanizing, meaningful art. I personally like a lot of elite art; but I also understand why most people don't. Part of it is indeed that they don't get it. And why isn't that a valid criticism? Why should people rely on a bunch of overeducated elites (like myself) telling them what this or that work means, and why it's significant? Shouldn't there be at least some level in every art where the average person "gets it"? This doesn't mean, of course, that one cannot learn more about a work -- meaning critics, etc. are still needed to help people see all the possibilities -- but the best works are not those that only require critics for anyone to understand what is going on. There's a certain tyranny of meaning-making in only having critics able to understand a work of art.
>
> The most beautiful works are those that one can get some meaning from right away, but which gain in meaning the more you understand and learn. Those works both the uneducated and the educated can appreciate. Why shouldn't we want to create that kind of poetry? Why should we only ever want to exist in the realm of the elite, where only a select few "truly understand"?

>> Nobody reads poetry anymore because they aren't exposed to it as children as a part of their education.  Once it vanished from their schooling, since they had no access to it, most people don't even know poetry exists.  As for the elitism of experimental poetry of the 20th and 21st century, that is another matter.  Anyone who takes chances with a tradition risks isolating him or herself from the larger group of people who will not understand what is going on or who simply don't care.  I don't think that is necessarily elitism but in certain cases, particularly Pound's and Eliot's, it may have been accompanied by elitism.  Williams, Olson, and many other experimental poets were populists trying to do something that would resonate with the larger masses of educated readers.  Whether they ever reached those readers is another matter.  Regards, Tom Savage

I don't agree that Logan should be silenced for his cheekiness, homophobia,
lack of good taste or whatever. But I do think the NYTBR should open up its
pages to a rebuttal or at least a friggin' flurry of letters.

Thanks for that Logan link.

Forgive my ignorance, but is Logan actually putting forth the idea
that Frank O'Hara was not serious about poetry -- because of the tone
of his poems?

"Allen Ginsberg by contrast was slightly lugubrious about sex). It's
hard to know whether Whitman, who took poetry seriously, would have
laughed or wept."

Or do you think I am reading too much into the lines above?

"...the best works are not those that only require critics for anyone to understand what is going on. There's a certain tyranny of meaning-making in only having critics able to understand a work of art.

The most beautiful works are those that one can get some meaning from right away, but which gain in meaning the more you understand and learn. Those works both the uneducated and the educated can appreciate. Why shouldn't we want to create that kind of poetry? Why should we only ever want to exist in the realm of the elite, where only a select few 'truly understand'?"

Troy Camplin, Ph.D.

The limitation I see with this approach is that when one is trying to "communicate"or write so that it goes over with people who don't read poetry, is that the impulse to move in that direction is often fear. If one is open to a work of art, they'll recognize the power of it long before they fully understand, or even partially understand, what it may be "communicating." When artists start worrying about communication, the gesture suffers. What's the line by the painter Clyfford Still "demands for communication are presumptions and irrelevant."

It is a symptom of our capitalist society and the underlying materialist cosmology that equates numbers (books sold, how many "regular" people have heard of the artist, etc.) that creates the kind of attitude exhibited here by Dr. Camplin. Now, that may be his interest, or motivation and he is welcome to it. It does not interest me and I find I am usually not interested in art that can "go over" with average people, but there are exceptions. Anything really worthwhile takes a little effort to appreciate, or at least some background, or some kind of understanding or openness. People raised in North American TV culture want it now, if not sooner, like the ones who yell at the microwave to hurry up. Cook slow.

wow. i'm o'erwhelmed. that recantation video is terrific. and the power

I do not see what would be gained by writing poetry that talks down to its
audience. "I know you are too dull to understand complexity, so here's
something simple to match your inteligence" is not what I want any of my
poems to say, nor do I want to read that message in other people's poems.

poetry is and i emphasize IS elitist and in most cases closed off
and alot of that CLOSED-OFF-NESS  is between poets and poetry worlds etc
this guy you met  - a rare exception these days tho a welcome one

this state has less to do with school at this point than with those
schooled and bringing it to the world at large
i am an uneducated elitist poet and don't care whether everyone
understands my pomes
but also acknowledge though abhore the world of slam etc thast made
poetrty more accesible
MTV   bob holman nuyorican etc  wow it's humid big rain storm city
wettens sparrows feeding and taking sand baths

Blaze VOX {books}. She is gifted with a powerful writer=92s imagination a=
nd a=20
lovely voice which articulates such pieces as =93Heaven and Earth=94 and =
=93Desire,=94=20
interwoven with doubled voicings, rhythmic breathing and spare=20
instrumentation. As an example of her capacity to enchant with concrete=20=

ephemera, you can check out the first track on her Myspace page=20
(www.myspace.com/wandaphhippsband) and hear a lush reverberating guitar=20=

under her softly declared words:

=93I=92m heaven over fire, fire under heaven. I=92m heaven into eleven:
two plus eleven seconds of heaven.=94

The pink and the shimmering white in =93Desire=94 seem like floating piec=

Wanda and I share a similar background that spans the theatre arts world =

writing (both prose and poetry) =96 Wanda having studied at Naropa, after=
=20
theater school, and incorporating a kind of free-associative, open and br=
oken=20
phrasing style which sculpts thoughts that scan her monitor second by sec=
ond.

Her poetry has been published over 100 times in a variety of publications=
,=20
including several anthologies. A denizen of New York City =96 the City wh=
ich=20
marks much of her verse like a maze-like tattoo =96 she=92s also curated =
several=20
readings and performance series at the renowned Poetry Project at St. Mar=
k=92s=20
Church, as well as other New York venues.

In 2004, Soft Skull Press released her full-length poetry book, =93Wake u=

Frank O=92Hara=92s famous =93Lunch Poems.=94 The author successfully unde=

results are poems that refresh in their hybrid revelations, daily task-li=

voice, one with both a learned and maverick=92s approach to verse; one wh=

the influence of the break up of a long-term relationship with a live-in =
soul-
mate and collaborator. Anyone who=92s loved, labored and lost knows the a=

powerfully luminous spectrum of colors that nothing feels bitter-black, r=

=93Field of Wanting=94 contains nine sections =96 each honing to the mode=
 and mood=20
and particular style of its poetry zone: sonnets, prose-poetry paragraphs=
,=20
numbered blues, and short-haiku like slivers, along with more traditional=
 free-
verse. In the opening poem, from =93Your Last Illusion,=94 she writes a k=
ind of=20
prelude:

I am pure madness
If I yell and scream and bleed
Is that pure enough? is that raw enough?
If I wear my sensitivity like a crown=20
Is it a tool?
can I touch you with my frailty?
touch you with my vulnerability?
Is my weakness
my strength?

p. 13
=93A Purist at Heart=94

She continues with a series of 19 modern sonnets (inspired by Ted Berriga=
n=92s=20

p. 34-35

In =93Hours=94 she creates 12 pieces that combine hallucinatory pop cultu=

What leaves me grounded and breathless within Wanda=92s wondrous matrix o=

In a deliciously erotic riff in her final section, =93Gray Fox Woman=94 W=

into an ode to a double who is also herself:

=93kiss my shaved cunt
and bow to its beauty
introduce me to Dangerous
the woman in the spiderwebbed dress
the wild child filling her mouth
by the newspaper stand

let me watch you
unroll my fishnet stockings slowly
let me wait until you scream
because men do make noise when they fuck
but only as a form of worship.=94

p. 124


Wanda will be appearing at The Living Theatre in NYC on July 28th. For mo=

This is great news for all who know Mark Young's terrific work from his

'Grafton Bridge,' much less 'Lizard'? 'George W.'s Language Primer' and

either 'The Baggage Card' or 'The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors,
Even,' would s/he necessarily assume that the same author was responsible
for both? Mark Young has the courage to be traditional, imagistically or
narratively direct, discrete, serial, surreal, 'experimental,' and
'difficult' in the same season, year, or cluster of years. The reward is
ours.'*

Funny, of the examples I have given -- Michaelangelo, Mozart, Shakespeare, Moliere, Racine -- not one was an American and not one lived in a capitalist country. Yet each communicated extremely well to a very wide audience. Prior to them, one had raconteurs and bards who travelled and recited/sang poetry. The ancient Greek tragedies and comedies were wildly popular (you may recall Plato complaining about tragedy because it was wildly popular). The stories of the gods and heroes were told through the recitation of poetry, particularly epic poetry. So poetry has historically been popular, and it has been used primarily as a way of communication. The Church, for example, used visual arts to tell the stories of the Bible to its illiterate parishoners. Art is a form of communication, and has always been a form of communication. Danto goes so far as to argue that the arts are a form of rhetoric -- and he's probably on to something there.

If art is not communicating something, what is it doing? If you are not concerned with getting your vision across to others, then what you are doing isn't art. When you create art that is not intended to communicate with anyone, then you are engaged in nothing more than masturbation. Similarly, it doesn't result in the creation of anything new, because it never comes in contact with others. If Danto is right that art is a form of rhetoric, then those who either won't (or cannot) communicate with their artwork are simply bad artists. To proclaim that your art does not and should not communicate is simply to try to provide an argument for why your terribly bad art is in fact good art -- precisely because the art can't speak for itself as to its worth.

Subject: Re: The lyric poem - what be its current fate?

"...the best works are not those that only require critics for anyone to understand what is going on. There's a certain tyranny of meaning-making in only having critics able to understand a work of art.

The most beautiful works are those that one can get some meaning from right away, but which gain in meaning the more you understand and learn. Those works both the uneducated and the educated can appreciate. Why shouldn't we want to create that kind of poetry? Why should we only ever want to exist in the realm of the elite, where only a select few 'truly understand'?"

Troy Camplin, Ph.D.

The limitation I see with this approach is that when one is trying to "communicate"or write so that it goes over with people who don't read poetry, is that the impulse to move in that direction is often fear. If one is open to a work of art, they'll recognize the power of it long before they fully understand, or even partially understand, what it may be "communicating." When artists start worrying about communication, the gesture suffers. What's the line by the painter Clyfford Still "demands for communication are presumptions and irrelevant."

It is a symptom of our capitalist society and the underlying materialist cosmology that equates numbers (books sold, how many "regular" people have heard of the artist, etc.) that creates the kind of attitude exhibited here by Dr. Camplin. Now, that may be his interest, or motivation and he is welcome to it. It does not interest me and I find I am usually not interested in art that can "go over" with average people, but there are exceptions. Anything really worthwhile takes a little effort to appreciate, or at least some background, or some kind of understanding or openness. People raised in North American TV culture want it now, if not sooner, like the ones who yell at the microwave to hurry up. Cook slow.

I try to pay more attention to the actual art produced rather than the rhetoric of those producing the art. In a published article I wrote about game theory and literature, I argue that the surrealists attempted to sell a bill of goods that they themselves did not buy into. Many post-surrealists did, however -- producing a lot of incredibly bad poetry that all sounds the same, and that nobody wants to read. The actual surrealists, however, produced a lot of very well-crafted, difficult poetry. They claimed that they were trying to create a poetry of and for the people (as opposed to the elitist verse of the romantics, with their regular rhythms and rhymes), but they in fact created work that only artistic elites would even begin to appreciate. We see this going on throughout the Modernist and Postmodernist periods, where the experiments are proclaimed to be intended for the masses, but the masses reject it en masse. Perhaps only T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound
 were the only honest poets of the last century, being unapologetically elitist in their verse and theory.

The attacks by other posters on "best-sellers" and "capitalism" belies their elitism. Why shouldn't some measure of worth be how many books of poetry you sell? Except that then that would indicate you are in fact not a very good poet if you can't sell but a half dozen copies at your readings. So we get attacks on capitalism and the commodification of art, etc. as excuses for why nobody wants to read their rotten poems.

Now, I do agree with you that many of our problems with the acceptance of poetry lies with our teachers and with the educational system in general. Teachers seem to go out of their way to make students abhor poetry. Of course, most teachers don't understand poetry at all, and that ignorance translates to hatred of the material, which is communicated to the students. The few who make it through high school not hating poetry have still learned nothing about it. They learn that one has "poetic license," which they are told means anything goes in poetry. Thus they begin writing poetry without the least understanding of what a poem really is, or what it does. They think that just because they speak the English language, they can write; and they think that they are being radical poets by breaking all the rules, not even knowing what the rules are. While we would never dream of claiming to be a great pianist if we never learned the proper way to play piano (the
 ability to whistle does not make one a musician), we somehow think that we can be a great poet without understanding the first thing about poetry, its origins, its history, how poems are similar and differ among cultures, etc. Our college professors don't help at all because they are pushing the kind of experimental poetry they are writing, forgetting that their students don't even have the basics. The consequence is a lot of people writing poetry, not having the kind of historical understanding of the art that painters and musicians are made to have, and as a consequence writing poems nobody really wants to read.

I find it laughable to read peoples' arguments that poetry is in fact popular because of some anecdotal evidence. This would be like arguing that opera is popular because I have friends who, like me, go to the opera. In fact, the opera house is always packed, so it must be spectacularly popular! Nonsense. Most of the poetry readings I've been to have been full of bad poets reading bad poetry to each other and their friends. I've been to poetry readings that were exceptions -- but they typically took place in such places as art museums and galleries, and involved selection of the poets beforehand. And in those cases, few were there primarily for the poetry.

I personally would like to turn this around. I think people miss out on a lot when they do not read or listen to poetry -- or are otherwise exposed to the arts. I think that if poets would simply learn the history of their art, and keep their audience in mind when they write, that it would go a long way to poets creating poetry that people might want to read. But it requires making things of beauty, which inspire people to want to create more poetry like it. It has to be reproductive.

Troy,

But I think that's where you're wrong: most of what you're calling
"elite" isn't intended to be only understood by a few, but rather
represents (sometimes vain) attempts to open dialog where there wasn't
previously. In this case, then, what most people don't understand
isn't what they don't "get", but what they aren't familiar with (as in
Michael's example) due to lack of good teachers, exposure, what have
you.

There's dehumanizing, nihilistic art, and humanizing, meaningful art. I personally like a lot of elite art; but I also understand why most people don't. Part of it is indeed that they don't get it. And why isn't that a valid criticism? Why should people rely on a bunch of overeducated elites (like myself) telling them what this or that work means, and why it's significant? Shouldn't there be at least some level in every art where the average person "gets it"? This doesn't mean, of course, that one cannot learn more about a work -- meaning critics, etc. are still needed to help people see all the possibilities -- but the best works are not those that only require critics for anyone to understand what is going on.

>> Nobody reads poetry anymore because they aren't exposed to it as children as a part of their education.  Once it vanished from their schooling, since they had no access to it, most people don't even know poetry exists.  As for the elitism of experimental poetry of the 20th and 21st century, that is another matter.  Anyone who takes chances with a tradition risks isolating him or herself from the larger group of people who will not understand what is going on or who simply don't care.  I don't think that is necessarily elitism but in certain cases, particularly Pound's and Eliot's, it may have been accompanied by elitism.  Williams, Olson, and many other experimental poets were populists trying to do something that would resonate with the larger masses of educated readers.  Whether they ever reached those readers is another matter.  Regards, Tom Savage

If you are interested in whether or not your book might stake a claim for recognition in the New York Times Book Review, particularly a review by William Logan, it is probably best to check out the frame through which your work might be considered. Or, if you are wondering, about the frame through which Frank O'Hara's work was scourged by Logan in today's Times, his University of Florida bio/pub accounting might make his nonsense make sense - if that's any relief. A NY Times kicking on on Gay Pride day to boot! A real 'time-sensitive' editor there, I say!


 William Logan       Professor       William Logan is       the author of seven books of poems: Sad-faced Men (1982), Difficulty (1985), Sullen           Weedy Lakes (1988), Vain Empires (1998), Night           Battle (1999), Macbeth in Venice (2003), and The           Whispering Gallery (2005). He is the author of four books of           criticism, All the Rage (1998), Reputations of the           Tongue (1999), Desperate Measures (2002), and The           Undiscovered Country (2005); and co-editor of a book on the           poetry of Donald Justice, Certain Solitudes (1997). Reputations           of the Tongue was a finalist for and The Undiscovered           Country       the winner of the National Book Critics Circle           Award in Criticism.           The Undiscovered Country was also named the best book           of criticism of 2005 by the Contemporary Poetry Review.
       Logan is a regular critic of poetry for the New York Times Book             Review         and writes a biannual verse chronicle for the New             Criterion. He has           won the Citation for Excellence in Reviewing from the National Book           Critics Circle, the Peter I.B. Lavan Award from the Academy of American           Poets, the John Masefield and Celia B. Wagner Awards from the           Poetry Society of America, and the J. Howard and Barbara M. J. Wood           Prize from Poetry. In 2004 he received the Corrington Award for           Literary Excellence and in 2005 the inaugural Randall Jarrell Award           in Criticism. He has also won the Amy Lowell Poetry    Traveling Scholarship and received grants from the Ingram Merrill Foundation, the Florida Arts Commission,    and the National Endowment for the Arts.
         Logan graduated from Yale (BA, 1972) and the University of Iowa (MFA, 1975). He was the English     Department’s Director of Creative Writing from 1983 to 2000. He teaches poetry workshops and an occasional     seminar on contemporary
  poetry.

Dr. Camplin,

So you judge my work without ever having read it? How does that help dialog? Communication? Just because my intention is not necessarily to communicate does not mean it doesn't get something across. Nor does it make it masturbation, as judged by the number of featured readings I have given over the last ten years.

Charles Olson said:

A poem is energy
transferred from where the poet got it (he will have some several causations),
by way of the poem itself to, all the way over to, the reader. Okay. Then the
poem itself must, at all points, be a high energy-construct and, at all points,
an energy-discharge. So: how is the poet to accomplish same energy, how is he,
what is the process by which a poet gets in, at all points energy at least the
equivalent of the energy which propelled him in the first place, yet an energy
which is peculiar to verse alone and which will be, obviously, also different
from the energy which the reader, because he is a third term, will take away.

People seem to be interested in HIS work, 38 years after his death at 60. So, did HE communicate anything? Apparently so, given the new film about his work and life in Gloucester, Polis is This. Given the movie from last year Fully Awake: Black Mountain College.

You obviously come to the SUNY list with an agenda far more traditional than the average list reader. You must expect people to disagree with you. You should understand they'll have a more challenging aesthetic than to have their work go over to a large audience. That is a measure addled by a capitalist ethos anyway. And the artists you cite did not have nearly the same cultural conditions, so it's a misnomer.

In a wonderful Jacket interview: http://jacketmagazine.com/35/perez-ivb-johnson.shtml

Omar Perez points out that capitalist considerations have NO PLACE in art. They're antithetical to it. I'm not interested in heat from this list. I am interested in light. Calling a stranger's work masturbation is unfortunate if you are really interested in dialog. Of course at least masturbation is sex with someone I love.

Subject: Re: Response to Troy Camplin, Ph.D.

Funny, of the examples I have given -- Michaelangelo, Mozart, Shakespeare, Moliere, Racine -- not one was an American and not one lived in a capitalist country. Yet each communicated extremely well to a very wide audience. Prior to them, one had raconteurs and bards who travelled and recited/sang poetry. The ancient Greek tragedies and comedies were wildly popular (you may recall Plato complaining about tragedy because it was wildly popular). The stories of the gods and heroes were told through the recitation of poetry, particularly epic poetry. So poetry has historically been popular, and it has been used primarily as a way of communication. The Church, for example, used visual arts to tell the stories of the Bible to its illiterate parishoners. Art is a form of communication, and has always been a form of communication. Danto goes so far as to argue that the arts are a form of rhetoric -- and he's probably on to something there.

If art is not communicating something, what is it doing? If you are not concerned with getting your vision across to others, then what you are doing isn't art. When you create art that is not intended to communicate with anyone, then you are engaged in nothing more than masturbation. Similarly, it doesn't result in the creation of anything new, because it never comes in contact with others. If Danto is right that art is a form of rhetoric, then those who either won't (or cannot) communicate with their artwork are simply bad artists. To proclaim that your art does not and should not communicate is simply to try to provide an argument for why your terribly bad art is in fact good art -- precisely because the art can't speak for itself as to its worth.

Subject: Re: The lyric poem - what be its current fate?

"...the best works are not those that only require critics for anyone to understand what is going on. There's a certain tyranny of meaning-making in only having critics able to understand a work of art.

The most beautiful works are those that one can get some meaning from right away, but which gain in meaning the more you understand and learn. Those works both the uneducated and the educated can appreciate. Why shouldn't we want to create that kind of poetry? Why should we only ever want to exist in the realm of the elite, where only a select few 'truly understand'?"

Troy Camplin, Ph.D.

The limitation I see with this approach is that when one is trying to "communicate"or write so that it goes over with people who don't read poetry, is that the impulse to move in that direction is often fear. If one is open to a work of art, they'll recognize the power of it long before they fully understand, or even partially understand, what it may be "communicating." When artists start worrying about communication, the gesture suffers. What's the line by the painter Clyfford Still "demands for communication are presumptions and irrelevant."

It is a symptom of our capitalist society and the underlying materialist cosmology that equates numbers (books sold, how many "regular" people have heard of the artist, etc.) that creates the kind of attitude exhibited here by Dr. Camplin. Now, that may be his interest, or motivation and he is welcome to it. It does not interest me and I find I am usually not interested in art that can "go over" with average people, but there are exceptions. Anything really worthwhile takes a little effort to appreciate, or at least some background, or some kind of understanding or openness. People raised in North American TV culture want it now, if not sooner, like the ones who yell at the microwave to hurry up. Cook slow.

A last thought about using numbers of "consumers" to judge literary art. This August marks the 2nd year that Lana Ayers and I will facilitate the August Poetry Postcard Fest. http://poetrypostcards.blogspot.com/

You take a card, address it to the next person on your list, refer to a previous card in composing the original poem on the card, if relevant, and send it to that person. I tend to transcribe postcard poems after writing them, before dropping them in the mail. We're about to release guidelines for 2008 and accept participants for this year's festivities.

Does it make the effort any less relevant if the poem is addressed to only one person? Will no one understand if I make a reference only that person might "understand?" Is it my job as a poet to send a poem that the person will "understand?" Can appreciation of art go beyond conscious "understanding" of meaning and intent? What does Jazz mean?

Charles Olson's statement in Projective Verse, "use of speech at its least careless and least logical" resonates with me. Does that make me elitist? Would my postcard poems not be appreciated by anyone else besides the reader?

I can't believe you think Emily Dickinson's work is unimportant because she was not interested in publication, grants and the admiration of the SUNY-Buffalo listserv poets. Or those who come here just to stir up shit.

Funny, of the examples I have given -- Michaelangelo, Mozart, Shakespeare, Moliere, Racine -- not one was an American and not one lived in a capitalist country. Yet each communicated extremely well to a very wide audience. Prior to them, one had raconteurs and bards who travelled and recited/sang poetry. The ancient Greek tragedies and comedies were wildly popular (you may recall Plato complaining about tragedy because it was wildly popular). The stories of the gods and heroes were told through the recitation of poetry, particularly epic poetry. So poetry has historically been popular, and it has been used primarily as a way of communication. The Church, for example, used visual arts to tell the stories of the Bible to its illiterate parishoners. Art is a form of communication, and has always been a form of communication. Danto goes so far as to argue that the arts are a form of rhetoric -- and he's probably on to something there.

If art is not communicating something, what is it doing? If you are not concerned with getting your vision across to others, then what you are doing isn't art. When you create art that is not intended to communicate with anyone, then you are engaged in nothing more than masturbation. Similarly, it doesn't result in the creation of anything new, because it never comes in contact with others. If Danto is right that art is a form of rhetoric, then those who either won't (or cannot) communicate with their artwork are simply bad artists. To proclaim that your art does not and should not communicate is simply to try to provide an argument for why your terribly bad art is in fact good art -- precisely because the art can't speak for itself as to its worth.

I never called your work specifically masturbation. I said that the kind of work that is not intended for an audience, that does not communicate anything, is masturbation. If you took offense, that is not my doing. You are the one who takes offense. You have taken a general argument personally, which is certainly not my fault.

Now, as for what you quoted me of Charles Olson, that's all a bunch of sound and fury signifying nothing. Poetry is energy. Oil is energy. Nuclear power is energy. The sun is energy. If you want to know if someone hasn't said anything, take the topic word and replace it and see if you can make it make sense. Make "a poem" = "love," "poet" = "lover" and "reader" = "beloved" and the quote still makes just as much (non)sense. Certainly being a good poet doesn't make one a good theorist.

If "capitalism has no place in art," then neither does Marxism or socialism or nationalism or identity or race or sex or gender or culture or religion or anything else of human concern, thought, or behavior. Again, I don't know what it could possibly mean that capitalism has no place in art. Art is a commodity. Always has been. Always will be. Again, it was only elitists who have tried to separate art from that aspect, to make it into something that nobody but the elites would want.

And why shouldn't I be able to come on here and talk about how I view things? This is a discussion group, and we all have our own agendas. The last thing I would want would be a bunch of people sitting around agreeing with me about everything, as I would never grow as a thinker or a poet. One reaches the light only through dialogue, and being open to understanding and persuasion. Anyone who does not want to be challenged is only interested in the shadows on the walls of the cave -- they certainly are not interested in the light.

Dr. Camplin,

So you judge my work without ever having read it? How does that help dialog? Communication? Just because my intention is not necessarily to communicate does not mean it doesn't get something across. Nor does it make it masturbation, as judged by the number of featured readings I have given over the last ten years.

Charles Olson said:

A poem is energy
transferred from where the poet got it (he will have some several causations),
by way of the poem itself to, all the way over to, the reader. Okay. Then the
poem itself must, at all points, be a high energy-construct and, at all points,
an energy-discharge. So: how is the poet to accomplish same energy, how is he,
what is the process by which a poet gets in, at all points energy at least the
equivalent of the energy which propelled him in the first place, yet an energy
which is peculiar to verse alone and which will be, obviously, also different
from the energy which the reader, because he is a third term, will take away.

People seem to be interested in HIS work, 38 years after his death at 60. So, did HE communicate anything? Apparently so, given the new film about his work and life in Gloucester, Polis is This. Given the movie from last year Fully Awake: Black Mountain College.

You obviously come to the SUNY list with an agenda far more traditional than the average list reader. You must expect people to disagree with you. You should understand they'll have a more challenging aesthetic than to have their work go over to a large audience. That is a measure addled by a capitalist ethos anyway. And the artists you cite did not have nearly the same cultural conditions, so it's a misnomer.

In a wonderful Jacket interview: http://jacketmagazine.com/35/perez-ivb-johnson.shtml

Omar Perez points out that capitalist considerations have NO PLACE in art. They're antithetical to it. I'm not interested in heat from this list. I am interested in light. Calling a stranger's work masturbation is unfortunate if you are really interested in dialog. Of course at least masturbation is sex with someone I love.

slam and hiphop work  but they suck as well
mozart ha  he sang for his super as did they all back then just happened
to be a great one as the others you mentioned
yhey wote for the poulace tho some had elitist patrons  as well
those were different times
much poetry was sung memorized spoken handed down
i'm sure there was an ongoing equivelent in lyric verse of law and order
i'm sure everyone went out there dor and caiught euripides
maybe got to hear the odyssey intoned on the MTV of its day

In response to Troy Camplin, you make the statement " few were there
primarily for the poetry" with regard to poetry readings in art =
galleries,
etc. How is this statement supported - by anecdotal evidence? You asked =
a
few "buddies" why they were there?
I take exception to another of your statements: "But it requires making
things of beauty, which inspire people to want to create more poetry =
like
it. It has to be reproductive." Keeping in mind the clich=E9 that beauty =
is in
the eye of the beholder, if "beautiful" poetry is to be reproductive, =
then
language poetry must be the most beautiful of poetries as it has been a
dominant force, reproducing like rabbits, since the mid-20th century.
Finally, I have one thing to say regarding your statement "While we =
would
never dream of claiming to be a great pianist if we never learned the =
proper
way to play piano", that being Thelonius Monk - he of the splayed =
fingers. I
don't think many would disagree that Monk was a great pianist yet those =
same
would likely agree that he "never learned the proper way to play piano". =
The
only thing that counts is expressivity. Whether Jimmie Hendricks plucked =
the
strings with his fingers or his teeth, as long as he was able to fully
express himself the technique didn't matter.
Just my thoughts.

Subject: Re: The lyric poem - what be its current fate?

I try to pay more attention to the actual art produced rather than the
rhetoric of those producing the art. In a published article I wrote =
about
game theory and literature, I argue that the surrealists attempted to =
sell a
bill of goods that they themselves did not buy into. Many =
post-surrealists
did, however -- producing a lot of incredibly bad poetry that all sounds =
the
same, and that nobody wants to read. The actual surrealists, however,
produced a lot of very well-crafted, difficult poetry. They claimed that
they were trying to create a poetry of and for the people (as opposed to =
the
elitist verse of the romantics, with their regular rhythms and rhymes), =
but
they in fact created work that only artistic elites would even begin to
appreciate. We see this going on throughout the Modernist and =
Postmodernist
periods, where the experiments are proclaimed to be intended for the =
masses,
but the masses reject it en masse. Perhaps only T.S. Eliot and Ezra =
Pound
 were the only honest poets of the last century, being unapologetically
elitist in their verse and theory.=20

The attacks by other posters on "best-sellers" and "capitalism" belies =
their
elitism. Why shouldn't some measure of worth be how many books of poetry =
you
sell? Except that then that would indicate you are in fact not a very =
good
poet if you can't sell but a half dozen copies at your readings. So we =
get
attacks on capitalism and the commodification of art, etc. as excuses =
for
why nobody wants to read their rotten poems.

Now, I do agree with you that many of our problems with the acceptance =
of
poetry lies with our teachers and with the educational system in =
general.
Teachers seem to go out of their way to make students abhor poetry. Of
course, most teachers don't understand poetry at all, and that ignorance
translates to hatred of the material, which is communicated to the =
students.
The few who make it through high school not hating poetry have still =
learned
nothing about it. They learn that one has "poetic license," which they =
are
told means anything goes in poetry. Thus they begin writing poetry =
without
the least understanding of what a poem really is, or what it does. They
think that just because they speak the English language, they can write; =
and
they think that they are being radical poets by breaking all the rules, =
not
even knowing what the rules are. While we would never dream of claiming =
to
be a great pianist if we never learned the proper way to play piano (the
 ability to whistle does not make one a musician), we somehow think that =
we
can be a great poet without understanding the first thing about poetry, =
its
origins, its history, how poems are similar and differ among cultures, =
etc.
Our college professors don't help at all because they are pushing the =
kind
of experimental poetry they are writing, forgetting that their students
don't even have the basics. The consequence is a lot of people writing
poetry, not having the kind of historical understanding of the art that
painters and musicians are made to have, and as a consequence writing =
poems
nobody really wants to read.=20

I find it laughable to read peoples' arguments that poetry is in fact
popular because of some anecdotal evidence. This would be like arguing =
that
opera is popular because I have friends who, like me, go to the opera. =
In
fact, the opera house is always packed, so it must be spectacularly =
popular!
Nonsense. Most of the poetry readings I've been to have been full of bad
poets reading bad poetry to each other and their friends. I've been to
poetry readings that were exceptions -- but they typically took place in
such places as art museums and galleries, and involved selection of the
poets beforehand. And in those cases, few were there primarily for the
poetry.=20

I personally would like to turn this around. I think people miss out on =
a
lot when they do not read or listen to poetry -- or are otherwise =
exposed to
the arts. I think that if poets would simply learn the history of their =
art,

making things of beauty, which inspire people to want to create more =
poetry
like it. It has to be reproductive.

Troy,

But I think that's where you're wrong: most of what you're calling
"elite" isn't intended to be only understood by a few, but rather
represents (sometimes vain) attempts to open dialog where there wasn't
previously. In this case, then, what most people don't understand
isn't what they don't "get", but what they aren't familiar with (as in
Michael's example) due to lack of good teachers, exposure, what have
you.

There's
dehumanizing, nihilistic art, and humanizing, meaningful art. I =
personally
like a lot of elite art; but I also understand why most people don't. =
Part
of it is indeed that they don't get it. And why isn't that a valid
criticism? Why should people rely on a bunch of overeducated elites =
(like
myself) telling them what this or that work means, and why it's =
significant?
Shouldn't there be at least some level in every art where the average =
person
"gets it"? This doesn't mean, of course, that one cannot learn more =
about a
work -- meaning critics, etc. are still needed to help people see all =
the
possibilities -- but the best works are not those that only require =
critics
for anyone to understand what is going on. There's a certain tyranny of
meaning-making in only having critics able to understand a work of art.

Those works both the uneducated and the educated can appreciate. Why
shouldn't we want to create that kind of poetry? Why should we only ever
want to exist in the realm of the elite, where only a select few "truly
understand"?

Who is 'Danto', Troy? And what is communication? Do we write in the dominant
voice of the time or do we attempt to extend the meaning of communication
even if the majority at the time may not understand what is being said?
Again, the language poets, as an example, must be engaged in high art as
they have inspired many a 'poet' to walk that path. Although difficult
poetry, it does communicate even if to a select few who take the trouble to
learn the language.

Funny, of the examples I have given -- Michaelangelo, Mozart, Shakespeare,
Moliere, Racine -- not one was an American and not one lived in a capitalist
country. Yet each communicated extremely well to a very wide audience. Prior
to them, one had raconteurs and bards who travelled and recited/sang poetry.
The ancient Greek tragedies and comedies were wildly popular (you may recall
Plato complaining about tragedy because it was wildly popular). The stories
of the gods and heroes were told through the recitation of poetry,
particularly epic poetry. So poetry has historically been popular, and it
has been used primarily as a way of communication. The Church, for example,
used visual arts to tell the stories of the Bible to its illiterate
parishoners. Art is a form of communication, and has always been a form of
communication. Danto goes so far as to argue that the arts are a form of
rhetoric -- and he's probably on to something there.

If art is not communicating something, what is it doing? If you are not
concerned with getting your vision across to others, then what you are doing
isn't art. When you create art that is not intended to communicate with
anyone, then you are engaged in nothing more than masturbation. Similarly,
it doesn't result in the creation of anything new, because it never comes in
contact with others. If Danto is right that art is a form of rhetoric, then
those who either won't (or cannot) communicate with their artwork are simply
bad artists. To proclaim that your art does not and should not communicate
is simply to try to provide an argument for why your terribly bad art is in
fact good art -- precisely because the art can't speak for itself as to its
worth.

"...the best works are not those that only require critics for anyone to
understand what is going on. There's a certain tyranny of meaning-making in
only having critics able to understand a work of art.

The most beautiful works are those that one can get some meaning from right
away, but which gain in meaning the more you understand and learn. Those
works both the uneducated and the educated can appreciate. Why shouldn't we
want to create that kind of poetry? Why should we only ever want to exist in
the realm of the elite, where only a select few 'truly understand'?"

The limitation I see with this approach is that when one is trying to
"communicate"or write so that it goes over with people who don't read
poetry, is that the impulse to move in that direction is often fear. If one
is open to a work of art, they'll recognize the power of it long before they
fully understand, or even partially understand, what it may be
"communicating." When artists start worrying about communication, the
gesture suffers. What's the line by the painter Clyfford Still "demands for
communication are presumptions and irrelevant."

It is a symptom of our capitalist society and the underlying materialist
cosmology that equates numbers (books sold, how many "regular" people have
heard of the artist, etc.) that creates the kind of attitude exhibited here
by Dr. Camplin. Now, that may be his interest, or motivation and he is
welcome to it. It does not interest me and I find I am usually not
interested in art that can "go over" with average people, but there are
exceptions. Anything really worthwhile takes a little effort to appreciate,
or at least some background, or some kind of understanding or openness.
People raised in North American TV culture want it now, if not sooner, like
the ones who yell at the microwave to hurry up. Cook slow.

Nice, clear post, Troy!  I haven't been drawn to some of your posts, but
this one is quite fair-minded, in my opinion, and I appreciate its
candor and the courage you have in making it.

=20

Your last question, "Why should we only ever want to exist in the realm
of the elite, where only a select few 'truly understand'" moves me to
respond:

=20

I, for one, used to think, quite narcissistically, to be honest, that
"only if I were to figure out how to create something that only the
elite understand, then, and only then, would my creation be Important
(and/or recognised); then, and only then, would I have created
anything/something that those I revered would respect; then, and only
then, would I have created something that might survive my own
mortality.  Of course, this whole approach to writing (poetry) can
become depressingly and maybe even tragically self-defeating, at best.

=20

My wisest poetry mentor once told me something that still to this day
inspires me and gives me hope.  He said something like this, "Sometimes,
if not often, a poet creates something really good BY ACCIDENT, or
something profoudly good gets created by a young poet BY ACCIDENT."  Or
something to that effect.  But in other words, one wouldn't have to Try
so hard to please the (perceived) elites (or be an Elite,
himself/herself), or, simply, try so hard to begin with.  I have written
a few good things, and a lot of them I didn't think were "cool enough"
by any stretch of the imagination, and guess what, they were recognised
(and even published) by some very fine poets/publishers I would have
considered "elite."  (Ha, I would have considered them elite if they had
rejected my poming, too, so jeepers, so much of this is so very
psycholigically (pre)determined.)

=20

Some of the elite ARE, quite simply, "difficult" by nature.  And some of
them ARE, or will be, the best.  (I suppose...)

=20

But you're quite right, I think. There's a certain tyranny.  And it's
absolutely effing ridiculous, too.  Like THEIR perspective or their view
of humankind and WHAT is important and WHAT is worth writing about
("...is a preposition.  It takes a noun.  It takes a noun to know
one...").  Absolutely, there is.  And it's fucking despicable!  It's
extremely selfish, too.

It's all out of Competition, NOT (necessarily) for the fittest STUFF of
our times to survive, but for the most powerful and power-holding forces
to survive, to prosper, to rule.  And that is just one way that the
Elite fuck up, badly, I think.  If they aren't more careful, ALL they
will have on this planet and in the lives of their children and
grandchildren is THEIR poetry and their perspective and WHAT they deem
Meaningful and Worthy.  Same principle is destroying all the so-called
"lower" animals and plants, while "ManKIND" (Gabriel Gudding is
interesting to me) rules over "Nature" and makes "her" subservient to
our arrogant species' greed for power.  Ummm, Immortality?  Ummm, the
dark side of the immortality-quest is ever there was one.

=20

But this is all so very much more complicated...  "Only a select few
'truly understand'" is the case with "the Best" in many fields and
disciplines, but you can surely find posers in Science who advance
themselves, not science, through obscurity, obfuscation, shreud
political dealings.  Are some of our elite poets only advancing
themselves, not Poetry, and certainly not humanity or Life or anything
much else?  I think that this is a good question to keep in mind in the
coming decades; it goes hand in hand with deconstructing and
"de-nutting" all of the other selfishness and greed that may be driving
our species to make most all others extinct and the planet
uninhabitable.

=20

Blah blah...  I have aspired to being "an elite" and I now have more
serious questions about such aspirations.  I'd like to come out on the
other side someday, but I don't know where I'll end up (probably just
right here).  What I do know is that my aspirations were doomed from the
start, one because it wasn't my nature and two because it doesn't fit my
truer sensitivities, anyhow anymore.  =20

Math is both understandable and meaningful. But to practice it and
understand it, you have to learn a lot of techniques.

=20

The arts are different from the sciences (including math) in that they
are meaningful and valuable in a more complex, more directly human way.
There's dehumanizing, nihilistic art, and humanizing, meaningful art. I
personally like a lot of elite art; but I also understand why most
people don't. Part of it is indeed that they don't get it. And why isn't
that a valid criticism? Why should people rely on a bunch of
overeducated elites (like myself) telling them what this or that work
means, and why it's significant? Shouldn't there be at least some level
in every art where the average person "gets it"? This doesn't mean, of
course, that one cannot learn more about a work -- meaning critics, etc.
are still needed to help people see all the possibilities -- but the
best works are not those that only require critics for anyone to
understand what is going on. There's a certain tyranny of meaning-making
in only having critics able to understand a work of art.=20

=20

The most beautiful works are those that one can get some meaning from
right away, but which gain in meaning the more you understand and learn.
Those works both the uneducated and the educated can appreciate. Why
shouldn't we want to create that kind of poetry? Why should we only ever
want to exist in the realm of the elite, where only a select few "truly
understand"?

I try to pay more attention to the actual art produced rather than the rhet=
oric
of those producing the art. In a published article I wrote about game theor=
y
and literature, I argue that the surrealists attempted to sell a bill of go=
ods
that they themselves did not buy into. Many post-surrealists did, however -=
-
producing a lot of incredibly bad poetry that all sounds the same, and that
nobody wants to read. The actual surrealists, however, produced a lot of ve=
ry
well-crafted, difficult poetry. They claimed that they were trying to creat=
e a
poetry of and for the people (as opposed to the elitist verse of the romant=
ics,
with their regular rhythms and rhymes), but they in fact created work that =
only
artistic elites would even begin to appreciate. We see this going on throug=
hout
the Modernist and Postmodernist periods, where the experiments are proclaim=
ed to
be intended for the masses, but the masses reject it en masse. Perhaps only=
 T.S.
Eliot and Ezra Pound
 were the only honest poets of the last century, being unapologetically eli=
tist
in their verse and theory.=20

The attacks by other posters on "best-sellers" and
"capitalism" belies their elitism. Why shouldn't some measure of
worth be how many books of poetry you sell? Except that then that would
indicate you are in fact not a very good poet if you can't sell but a half
dozen copies at your readings. So we get attacks on capitalism and the
commodification of art, etc. as excuses for why nobody wants to read their
rotten poems.

Now, I do agree with you that many of our problems with the acceptance of
poetry lies with our teachers and with the educational system in general.
Teachers seem to go out of their way to make students abhor poetry. Of cour=
se,
most teachers don't understand poetry at all, and that ignorance translates
to hatred of the material, which is communicated to the students. The few w=
ho
make it through high school not hating poetry have still learned nothing ab=
out
it. They learn that one has "poetic license," which they are told
means anything goes in poetry. Thus they begin writing poetry without the l=
east
understanding of what a poem really is, or what it does. They think that ju=
st
because they speak the English language, they can write; and they think tha=
t
they are being radical poets by breaking all the rules, not even knowing wh=
at
the rules are. While we would never dream of claiming to be a great pianist=
 if
we never learned the proper way to play piano (the
 ability to whistle does not make one a musician), we somehow think that we=
 can
be a great poet without understanding the first thing about poetry, its ori=
gins,
its history, how poems are similar and differ among cultures, etc. Our coll=
ege
professors don't help at all because they are pushing the kind of
experimental poetry they are writing, forgetting that their students don't
even have the basics. The consequence is a lot of people writing poetry, no=
t
having the kind of historical understanding of the art that painters and
musicians are made to have, and as a consequence writing poems nobody reall=
y
wants to read.=20

I find it laughable to read peoples' arguments that poetry is in fact
popular because of some anecdotal evidence. This would be like arguing that
opera is popular because I have friends who, like me, go to the opera. In f=
act,
the opera house is always packed, so it must be spectacularly popular! Nons=
ense.
Most of the poetry readings I've been to have been full of bad poets readin=
g
bad poetry to each other and their friends. I've been to poetry readings
that were exceptions -- but they typically took place in such places as art
museums and galleries, and involved selection of the poets beforehand. And =
in
those cases, few were there primarily for the poetry.=20

I personally would like to turn this around. I think people miss out on a l=
ot
when they do not read or listen to poetry -- or are otherwise exposed to th=
e
arts. I think that if poets would simply learn the history of their art, an=
d
keep their audience in mind when they write, that it would go a long way to
poets creating poetry that people might want to read. But it requires makin=
g
things of beauty, which inspire people to want to create more poetry like i=
t.
It has to be reproductive.

Troy,

But I think that's where you're wrong: most of what you're calling
"elite" isn't intended to be only understood by a few, but rather
represents (sometimes vain) attempts to open dialog where there wasn't
previously. In this case, then, what most people don't understand
isn't what they don't "get", but what they aren't
familiar with (as in
Michael's example) due to lack of good teachers, exposure, what have
you.

another matter.  Anyone who takes chances with a tradition risks isolating =

Shakespeare never called your work specifically masturbation. The
typewriter monkey said that the kind of banana that is not intended
for an audience, that does not communicate anything, is masturbation.
If the apple took offense, the worm is not my doing. The figs are the
ones who take offense. Fruits have taken a general argument
personally, which is certainly not my fault.

Now, as for the beauty of rhythm and rhyme, that's all a bunch of
sound and fury signifying nothing. Free verse is energy. Batter is
energy. Matter is energy. The moon is energy. If the masses want to
know if the elitist hasn't said anything, take the topic word and
replace it and see if the circus clown can make it make sense. Make "a
poem" = "love," "poet" = "lover" and "reader" = "beloved" and the poet
still makes just as much (non)sense. Certainly dancing with whiskey
doesn't make one a good theorist.

If "free verse has no place in art", then neither does Marxism or
socialism or nationalism or identity or race or sex or gender or
culture or religion or anything else of human concern, thought, or
behavior. Again, the stones don't know what the grass could possibly
mean that experimentalism has no place in art. Tibet is a commodity.
Always has been. Always will be. Again, it was only dreamers who have
tried to separate art from that aspect, to make it into something that
nobody but the dreamers would want.

Just because Emily Dickinson didn't get her poems published (though she did try), that doesn't mean she didn't try to communicate with others through them. Please note that I never said that we should use the number of consumers to judge literary art. Never said it. Never implied it. To use a popular art form: some of the best movies weren't wildly popular when they were first released. Some had to build audiences over time.

Now, the quote by Olsen you have is half right: poetry is language at its least careless. But to say it's at its least logical shows both an ignorance of logic on his part, and an (purposeful?) ignorance of the history of poetry. Still sounds liek a bad theorist to me.

I do note that people tend to get defensive when they realize that their own position is indefensible, but they still want to cling to it.

A last thought about using numbers of "consumers" to judge literary art. This August marks the 2nd year that Lana Ayers and I will facilitate the August Poetry Postcard Fest. http://poetrypostcards.blogspot.com/

You take a card, address it to the next person on your list, refer to a previous card in composing the original poem on the card, if relevant, and send it to that person. I tend to transcribe postcard poems after writing them, before dropping them in the mail. We're about to release guidelines for 2008 and accept participants for this year's festivities.

Does it make the effort any less relevant if the poem is addressed to only one person? Will no one understand if I make a reference only that person might "understand?" Is it my job as a poet to send a poem that the person will "understand?" Can appreciation of art go beyond conscious "understanding" of meaning and intent? What does Jazz mean?

Charles Olson's statement in Projective Verse, "use of speech at its least careless and least logical" resonates with me. Does that make me elitist? Would my postcard poems not be appreciated by anyone else besides the reader?

I can't believe you think Emily Dickinson's work is unimportant because she was not interested in publication, grants and the admiration of the SUNY-Buffalo listserv poets. Or those who come here just to stir up shit.

Funny, of the examples I have given -- Michaelangelo, Mozart, Shakespeare, Moliere, Racine -- not one was an American and not one lived in a capitalist country. Yet each communicated extremely well to a very wide audience. Prior to them, one had raconteurs and bards who travelled and recited/sang poetry. The ancient Greek tragedies and comedies were wildly popular (you may recall Plato complaining about tragedy because it was wildly popular). The stories of the gods and heroes were told through the recitation of poetry, particularly epic poetry. So poetry has historically been popular, and it has been used primarily as a way of communication. The Church, for example, used visual arts to tell the stories of the Bible to its illiterate parishoners. Art is a form of communication, and has always been a form of communication. Danto goes so far as to argue that the arts are a form of rhetoric -- and he's probably on to something there.

If art is not communicating something, what is it doing? If you are not concerned with getting your vision across to others, then what you are doing isn't art. When you create art that is not intended to communicate with anyone, then you are engaged in nothing more than masturbation. Similarly, it doesn't result in the creation of anything new, because it never comes in contact with others. If Danto is right that art is a form of rhetoric, then those who either won't (or cannot) communicate with their artwork are simply bad artists. To proclaim that your art does not and should not communicate is simply to try to provide an argument for why your terribly bad art is in fact good art -- precisely because the art can't speak for itself as to its worth.

"...the best works are not those that only require critics for anyone to understand what is going on. There's a certain tyranny of meaning-making in only having critics able to understand a work of art.

The most beautiful works are those that one can get some meaning from right away, but which gain in meaning the more you understand and learn. Those works both the uneducated and the educated can appreciate. Why shouldn't we want to create that kind of poetry? Why should we only ever want to exist in the realm of the elite, where only a select few 'truly understand'?"

Troy Camplin, Ph.D.

The limitation I see with this approach is that when one is trying to "communicate"or write so that it goes over with people who don't read poetry, is that the impulse to move in that direction is often fear. If one is open to a work of art, they'll recognize the power of it long before they fully understand, or even partially understand, what it may be "communicating." When artists start worrying about communication, the gesture suffers. What's the line by the painter Clyfford Still "demands for communication are presumptions and irrelevant."

It is a symptom of our capitalist society and the underlying materialist cosmology that equates numbers (books sold, how many "regular" people have heard of the artist, etc.) that creates the kind of attitude exhibited here by Dr. Camplin. Now, that may be his interest, or motivation and he is welcome to it. It does not interest me and I find I am usually not interested in art that can "go over" with average people, but there are exceptions. Anything really worthwhile takes a little effort to appreciate, or at least some background, or some kind of understanding or openness. People raised in North American TV culture want it now, if not sooner, like the ones who yell at the microwave to hurry up. Cook slow.

The anecdote I related was in reference to the poor presentation of poetry
by the officials of verse culture and to people's willingness to accept
challenging poetry when it is presented in a manner that does not strike
them as snooty. It was not intended to demonstrate that poetry is popular
but that it could be (more so) if presented properly. I see evidence of this
all the time, living, as I do, among the people you lovingly refer to as
"the masses." Perhaps I exaggerate the importance of this evidence, but I
certainly do not think that my conclusions are any more ridiculous than the
idea that people would flock to poetry if we all started writing in styles
that stink of the 19th century. I see no evidence for this whatsoever.

So if you're after LOGIC in poetry, you can swing back to the stink of the =
19th century, as Michael Ford put it. Fortunately, there are those (the vas=
t majority on this list) who want a DEEPER gesture than what certain Doctor=
s from Texas are capable of appreciating and that's why this list exists.=
=0A=0AThere have been a couple of movements since the romantic era that sou=
ght to make art more relevant to the times. We see where intellect gets us =
and the Doctor from Texas exemplifies it to perfection. The hastily-written=
 put down. The intellectual pissing match. The desire to prove one's self r=
ight at the expense of another. It is a clear demonstration of the competit=
ion/domination cosmology, one whose time passed long ago, but still clings =
on   and on. =0A=0AJack Spicer said =0A=0A =0A=85Prose invents -=0Apoetry d=

 way ahead of its time. It IS threatening to think that we have moved ahead=

> Who is 'Danto', Troy?

Now see, when I read "Danto," I assume we're talking about Ezili Danto,
one of the Lwas of Haitian Vodoun. As she is mute (various legends
identify her with a Haitian revolutionary who had her tongue cut out), I
would imagine she tends not to go on about the rhetoric of anything. And
since she is part of the Petwo ("hot") family of Lwas, and notoriously
temperamental, I'd guess she wouldn't be entirely amused to have her name
taken in vain by someone pretending to speak for "the masses" of whom she
is emphatically a part. Your mileage may vary, however.

amy, great idea; it'd also be nice to have captions under the pix saying
who the poet is.

the main problem with poetry is that it isn't usually a quick fix. it
usually requires thought and perhaps even meditation and study. reflection.
runish. enigmatic. the mystery.

poetry is unreasonably and anachronistically demanding. if poetry is to fly
in today's hyper-mediated brain pan, it needs to pick up the pace a bit.
reflection ok. for those with the time. but quick fix first for those in a
hurry. include a chocolate bar with the book, maybe. a book of poems called
eat more, say. this way it could get corporate sponsorship and be
conceptually quick and deep. like visual art. innovative but quick. fast
poetry. like a slam only slim.

what was the name of the poet who was described as the best understood poet
of his generation? rod mckuen, wasn't it? remember him? no? well then.

Hmm, most of them do, at least, at the top of the photo.  Some people may not have included a name, but I think all of mine do.  For instance,

"Ron Padgett and John Ashbery"

"Cole Swensen and Keith Waldrop"
http://www.flickr.com/photos/amyking/302830083/in/pool-10646338@N00

"Evie Shockley and Sina Queyras"
http://www.flickr.com/photos/amyking/400437928/in/pool-10646338@N00

The titles appear *above* each photo.

Best,
Amy

amy, great idea; it'd also be nice to have captions under the pix saying
who the poet is.

Hello all,

Before Flarf, before conceptual poetry (as such), there was
Surrealism. This week Wordplay (from the Archive page of WPVM.org)
features Nan Watkins, one of the foremost translators of Yvan Goll, a prominent
member of that movement, reading her translations of
10,000 Dawns and Dream Weed, and discussing the problems of
translating his work. I even talked her into reading a couple of the
poems in German, so we could hear their original music.

Give the lady a listen.

Production notes for the show are here:

And now back to your regularly scheduled Monday,

Jeff
