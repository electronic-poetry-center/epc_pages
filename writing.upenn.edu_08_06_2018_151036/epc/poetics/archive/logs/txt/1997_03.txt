Much as I love Duncan (both the person and the poet), he was entirely
capable of jaw-dropping foolishness and exhibited it on as many
occasions as he could.

Thanks to Lisa Jarnot for providing a source for Duncan on "rejecting
Hitler" as follows:

"Reject Mae West as vulgar or Hitler as the enemy, reject them as fellows
of our kind, and you have to go to battle against the very nature of Man
himself, against the truth of things."

I take it that in this Duncan is saying that the violence Hitler summoned,
marshaled, represented, and used is a violence deep in humankind. That
seems straightforward. I take him to be saying also that we get nowhere to
read such violence, in the form of Hitler, as a symbol of something
non-human -- an aberration, the enemy, the common enemy -- which we may
therefore comfortably ignore or dismiss as "ignorance." Duncan is reminding
us that such violence is well inside human nature and history. Hitler is
not an isolated or aberrant case. Yes, this is far from "foolish." It is true.

True, yes; but, it doesn't mean, to my ears at least, what Lisa makes it
mean. As I saw Duncan resist actively what he thought was evil on several
occasions, I don't think it means "forget about Dorn's racism." Indeed, I
think it counsels precisely against such forgetting. We can no more ignore
or dismiss Dorn's racism than we can reject Hitler as some aberrant
irrelevant "enemy."

Lisa concludes her short note by saying: "I kind of thought it (i.e. the
reference to Duncan) made sense in the context of the Dorn discussion since
there has been talk of counteracting ignorance with physical violence."

Indeed, it does make sense. And by offering Ed a knuckle sandwich I was
making the same point Duncan was making. Or, the point Pogo made so
eloquently: "I have seen the enemy and we are it." But, it's not ignorance.
Hitler was brilliant not ignorant. Dorn's active excessive mind and
linguistic force need no underlining. His racism, like Hitler's, must be
resisted.

I'm struck by the blandness of a word like ignorance in this case, and by
-- I'm sorry to say -- the self-praise. If racism is ignorant, then "I"
must be wise, and of course that should do the trick I guess.

Let me ask Joe Safdie directly -- since he knows Dorn over a long period
and is Jewish -- did Dorn *ever* taunt you as a Jew or "jew-bait" you in
any way? A truthful answer will clear up -- and I think end -- this
creepiness. Joe knows the truth (in a funny way, so do I). And just needs
to propose the truth here.

i'd say that duncan's right on: rejection would push away and make other
what is human (i.e., the problem of evil). hitler himself used rejection
as a solution: a "final" solution. this solved nothing.

I agree - Duncan's quote reminded me of a poem I just read with some
highschool students I (along with many others) tutor on Mondays and
Fridays.  The poem is called "The Hangman" - its a formal poem in rhymed
iambic tetrameter quatrains and is ostensibly a moral about the holocaust
(which they're studying).  A man in the "village" volunteers to help the
hangman execute people thinking that in doing so he'll save himself - of
course in the end, after everyone else is dead, the hangman kills him too.
As a simple moral its fine, I suppose, but th problem is this hangman -
he's purely allegorical and one finds oneself either comfortably distant
from him ("Thank god there's no hangman around here") or condemning him as
pure evil (a version of the devil).  Consequently, you don't learn
anything about how an event like the holocaust could take place in real
space and time.  The student s are very street-wise North Philly kids and
they reacted with real suspicion - one of them called the hangman "an
abstraction."  It seems to me that its that sense of "abstraction" - the
way it allows Hitler to disappear in the realm of mythology - that Duncan
is arguing against.  For me its what gives he as well as someone like
Creely real political weight even when their "subject matter" is not
political.

Ah, Walt Kelly there is another ambivalent figure. He seemed to buy into
cold war propaganda in a way that left room for a great deal of humanism &
thoughtfulness. Yet when you read him he would regularly punctuate his very
endearing foolishness with something completely anti-absorptive - for me
anyway - something really foolish in the sense it is being used here.

there's a difference between rejection and denial.  it is not a good idea
to reject "hitler" as an abstraction, an aberration, "it can't happen
here," or it can't happen within us etc.  however, it is not a good idea to
pretend we didn't know what hitler, or other less demonized members of
society, including ourselves, did, or that to pretend that it;s not really
that big of a deal, because, as they say in The Producers, "the fuhrer was
an excellent dancer, he was much better than churchill."

In response to the ongoing Dorn/Duncan thread i just want to say two things:


one/ yes, ron, thank you for reminding me that duncan was filled with
foolishness. as a duncan devotee i responded emotionally to tom's post
(using the words foolish and duncan in the same sentence).

two/ yes, tom, of course issues of anti-semitism and racism are serious.
but i wasn't trying to be self-congratulatory or more "evolved" by saying
racists are "ignorant."  I'm talking about the ignorance encouraged by the
powers that be (corporate /hegemonic/media/USA) to keep marginalized groups
separated from each other by convincing them that they should be enemies.
I teach at Long Island University in Brooklyn where 90% of my inner city
students are convinced that they are oppressed exclusively by Jews.  Their
fierce anti-semitism only begins to fade when they become informed of the
complexities of the issue, of the ways in which their oppression is similar
to that of the Jews, and that the Jews in their neighborhood who seem so
well-off are hardly the people who run the country.  This is what I mean by
the ignorance in relation to various xenophobias. I'm not saying that
anyone's racism should be disregarded, but the truth is that we live in a
violent racist homophobic country, where maybe "The Dorn Discussion"
obscures the bigger problem.

several versions of this quote are to be found in the corpus.
the title of a 1972 Pogo collection is _Pogo: We Have Met the Enemy
and He is Us_; likewise, Pogo uses this version of the phrase in
the final panel of the daily strip for "earth day" 1971.  these late
versions should probably be considered the canonical form.  the earliest
verified occurance is in the introduction to the 1952 collection _The Pogo
Papers_ --quoted here in context, appropos of the ongoing discussion:

   "...Traces of nobility, gentleness and courage persist in all people,
   do what we will to stamp out the trend.  So, too, do those characteristics
   which are ugly.  It is just unfortunate that in the clumsy hands of a
   cartoonist all traits become ridiculous. leading to a certain amount
   of self-conscious expostulation and the desire to join battle.

      There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things
   which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand.  resolve
   then, that on this very ground, wtih small flags waving and tinny blasts on
   tiny trumpets, we shall meet the enemy , and not only may he be ours, he
   may be us." --Walt Kelly

So do I. Duncan was saying something that was not all that much different
from what Williams was suggesting in _In the American Grain_,
that America and Americans contain both Pere Rasles AND Cotton Mather, bith
Boone and Franklin, and that if one does not realize that, one will
continue the bad psychological health the Puritans were prone too, as WCW
saw them. He even shows Valery Larbaud telling him this in the Rasles
chapter.

Of course it is. The bellicose statement that Kelly was parodying was

"We have met the enemy and they are ours."

Yes--apparently it all started with the introduction to _Pogo Papers_
(1952).  Here he seems to be in dialogue with Robert Duncan:

"Specializations and markings of individuals everywhere abound in such
profusion that major idiosyncrasies can be properly ascribed to the
mass. Traces of nobility, gentleness and courage persist in all people,
do what we will to stamp out the trend. So, too, do those
characteristics which are ugly. It is just unfortunate that in the
clumsy hands of the cartoonist all traits become ridiculous, leading to
a certain amount of self-conscious expostulation and the desire to join
battle.

"There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things
which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand.
Resolve, then, that on this very ground, with small flags waving and
tiny blasts of tiny trumpets, we shall meet the enemy, and not only may
he be ours, he may be us."

Yes, how was he ambivalent?  At the height of McCarthyism--when people
were cowering all over the country--he introduced Simple J. Malarkey,
clearly modeled after Senator Joe, and with similar obsessions.  I was 4
at the time but Kelly was a hero in my house.

I seem to remember a character modeled after Spiro Agnew that was a hyena.
And then there was the Pogo presidential campaign in which his swamp
buddies resorted to some familiar tactics. I, too, wonder what Walt
Kelly's clay feet look like.

Okay i concede perhaps i have been overly suspicious. Having dicovered him
in my teenage years, whcih after all wasn't that long ago, i automatically
assumed him to be  more of an apologist figure - this was reinforced by
interviews/essays he wrote about travelling to eastern europe (I have
briefly looked for these but they are not in the house at present) which
seemed to take a 'we are more enlightened' line. The S J Malarkey was at the
other end of the ambivalence and one i could not align with the 'voice' of
his essays. I will read through them again - (next time i have a long bath)
I also never fely comfortable with Bumbazine - who luckily disapeared as the
series progressed.

Henceforth please consider my opinion under revision.

Folks:

After the brief exchange on this list with Mark Weiss (from ten
days
or so ago) I queried Eliot Weinberger re: the matter of Neruda's
relationship to Trotsky's murder in Mexico City. I have EW's
permission to share part of his reply with the list. One would need
to look further into the whole issue, of course, but it would seem
that there are at least some serious grounds for doing that.

_Twenty Love Poems and a Big Favor for Comrade Stalin_?

Anyway, FYI:

I used to own most of the Pogo books (big error to have let em go) but the
following isn't something I remember directly: but apparently there was one
or more occasion--the Watergate cartoons w Agnew et al (he sure did) being
the one I'm pretty sure of--on which lots of papers in which Kelly was
syndicated refused to run whole long sequences of Pogo.  Apparently there
was a backup, less controversial, Pogo that they could run instead.  I don't
know if Kelly was contractually obligated to do this, or what.  But if true
it might account for some folks' perception that Kelly went soggy in key
periods.

Tenney, you may be right, but my memory (perhaps I'm conflating this later
period with the McCarthy period) is that a lot of papers ran the strips they
objected to on the editorial pages, with the political cartoons, as many
still do with Doonsbury.
There's another possible source of confusion: after Kelly's death his widow
and others attempted to continue the strip. It was very different in
character--I don't remember any political content--but I stopped reading it
fairly quickly because it was so disappointing.
Someday somebody's going to do a study of the effect of Pogo on American
English.

Actually my father and I do have all the Pogo and they're hardly soggy; in
fact there were books put out that were totally political. But there was
censorship and alternative scripts involved.

It should have stopped with Walt's death.

I've lived them all.

[This document was prepared by Charles Bernstein (bernstei@bway.net) and
Loss Pequen~o Glazier (glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu).]
____________________________________________________________________

1. About the Poetics List

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to
keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While
individual posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we
continue to work to promote the editorial function of this project. The
definition of that project, while provisional, and while open to continual
redefinition by list participants, is nonetheless aversive to a generalized
discussion of poetry. Rather, our aim is  to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations,
and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received
forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein: contact him for further
information. Joel Kuszai is currently working on the administration of the
list.  For subscription information contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.


____________________________________________________________________

2. Subscriptions

The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or
unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject
line, to:

listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

the one-line message should say:

unsub poetics

{or}

sub poetics Jill Jillway

(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your
name to unsub)

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.

*
If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you can
substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.  If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from
your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is
part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider
obtaining a commercial account.

____________________________________________________________________

3.  Cautions

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a
post, since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via
"digest" or who cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics (especially
reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. (See section 7.)

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or
supply information missing from an post, please send the request or comment
to the individual backchannel, not to the whole list.

____________________________________________________________________

4. Digest Option

The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to
your account to each day!  If you would prefer to receive ONE message
each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to
                                listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu

set poetics digest

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply
to this message!!

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:

set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________

5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may
lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily
turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to "listserv."


set poetics nomail

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 8 below.)

____________________________________________________________________

6. Who's Subscribed

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message
blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:

  review poetics

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.

Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a
specific subscriber.
____________________________________________________________________

7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

our URL is

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center
provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new
poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS
List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct
connections to numerous related electronic
RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about contemporary print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we
have an extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as
well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Pequen~o Glazier.
____________________________________________________________________

8. Poetics Archives via EPC

Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and
year or search them for specific information. Your interface will
allow you to print or download any of these files.

Or set your browser to go directly to:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive

____________________________________________________________________

9. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications
as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a
list of your press/publications to
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word processing
program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the address above
to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk. Though files marked
up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your
word processor ill save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is also highly
desirable

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.

Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

here's a topic --

the conventions that have developed of an email "signature quotation"
(sort of the tailend of an epigraph -- a postgraph?) -- one sees this
used variously (or, as case may be, uses 'em variously) -- and the
notion of raising it as a proper topic amid this august crowd arose
just now, when perusing a msg. from my South Asian Lit listserv,
wherein -- in a single post (contianing a quoted excerpt of another)
I found thus, by happenstance, the following 2 signoffs in tandem:

So, what questions?  Not sure, in truth -- except to note the
prevalence of quotation practice, the variety of use, and perhaps to
wonder abt. the useage of a singoff convention for a sort of literary

Subject:      anger and violence
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        A colleague of mine, talking about teaching the essays of bell
hooks, says that "students always perceive her as very angry and bitter
when they read her essays--they get upset that she seems to be taking them
to task. Then when I show them a video of her talking about her work and
laughing, sometimes they suddenly revise their opinion, because they see
her as witty and likeable. In any case, they're far more likely to respond
to her personality than they are to her ideas."

        What is interesting to her about this, she says,
is the issue of how anger and violence relate inside American ideology. To
generalize (perhaps too much), it is not necessary to express violence
through anger--indeed much violence in this country is done through a
calm conviction that violence is the correct tactic. Students
will often think of violence as a GIVEN--in my own experience, at least
several students a semester will make the argument that violence is innate
and normal, and that attempts to eliminate it are utopian and go against
human nature. Violence, if accepted as natural, doesn't even need ANGER as
a motivation--indeed, it can be seen simply as a natural extension of
one's right to possess whatever one can get ahold of.

        Anger, on the other hand, often remains very intensely a social
taboo. Perhaps this comes in part out of the very deep U.S. ideological
conviction that things are really okay--indeed that they MUST
be okay, since "this" is America. So when people express anger, one
response
is that their confusion must be their own fault (or perhaps the fault of
their parents) because how can there be any legitimate anger against what
we all know to be a system of freedom?

        Anger and violence are certainly related at times, but at other
times, anger can be a legitimate reaction AGAINST violence, and does not
necessarily lead to it. Indeed, it's far more likely that violence will
result from the belief that one needs to repress one's anger than from the
idea that expressing anger is actually okay. Are there times and places
where one should express anger, and others where it should not be spoken?
Perhaps, but perhaps not also... for where is that place where anger is
totally taboo on every occasion?

        I think I'm saying all this because, at times, it is easy on this
list to confuse anger with violence--even to confuse expressions of desire
for violence with the act of violence itself. But again, it is just as
likely in many circumstances that vocal anger is a REFUSAL of physical
violence. And I have been reading recent posts by Lisa Jarnot and Tom
Mandel and others with the sense that everyone, in various ways, has been
talking about how to REFUSE violence, and in that sense, I have found none
of the recent discussion "disturbing" at all, except to the extent that
disturbance is necessary to learning.

        I think where this also relates to poetry has to do with what
Charles Bernstein was saying about recognizing and continuing to deal with
the "dark side" of poets and poetry. I'm not sure that poetry serves
necessarily as an outlet for this "dark side," although it certainly can
in some cases. But it just as equally can be a continued expression of
fascination with, and extension of that "dark side." But I think that even
in dealing with this "dark side" one has to work with the complex problem
that poetry, in its interrelation with life, is not the same
as other activities (indeed that all physical activites are distinct and
cannot be reduced to sameness with each other). One can express a line,
and not act on it--one can even express a line that is the opposite of
what one would act on. Similarly, it is possible to be greatly motivated
by that which one would never speak...

Subject:      Duncan Dorn Nuts
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Lisa Jarnot is "talking about the ignorance encouraged by the
powers that be (corporate /hegemonic/media/USA) to keep marginalized groups
separated from each other by convincing them that they should be enemies."

Without disagreeing, I hope it is clear that hegemonic powers have no need,
alas, to *create* this kind of xenophobia, hatred, etc. As Duncan pointed
out, and as I have been trying to make clear in my posts on this Dorn issue
which has its teeth so deep in the leg of the list.

Why racism must be resisted is *not* that this is a way of resisting the
hegemony, what the rabbis used to call the "kingdom of arrogance" or "Rome"
but that racism is within us (like self-praise conscious or not) -- and
that is why I offered my critique in the form of a knuckle sandwich. An
acknowledgment, not an offer of violence.

Additionally, Lisa is not "saying that anyone's racism should be
disregarded, but the truth is that we live in a violent racist homophobic
country, where maybe "The Dorn Discussion" obscures the bigger problem."

But it's not "a racist country" it's a racist world (where "racism" can
also stand in for what divides, for example, xtian and moslem bosnians who
have clearly dropped from the same tree). Not that the uses of racism in
policy should not *also* be resisted, of course they should. But it is easy
to resist something so big that announcing one's opinion does the job. It
is resisting the particular, the racism of a poet for example, that is

This is a request to those in the US who might know of any
institutions etc interested in having Alan Halsey give a reading etc
in the fall. Susan Howe has Alan coming over to read at Buffalo and I
thought as he is over...When I last spoke to Alan he didn't have exact
dates arranged, but while I think about it (knowing how early fall
budgets are allocated, I hope I am not too late already) I wanted to
lodge that little nugget of info in any brains out there looking to
present something spiffy and real in the fall. I am certainly hoping
to get him out to the west coast if possible, maybe some places can
join coffers?

What was the influence of Bill Griffith's Zippy on langang poetry?

Also, hey, F. Bruno, while you're checking out the influence of Ashbery on
Malkmus, could you check out what effect William Carlos Williams had on
Walter Salas-Humara, and how much Olson there really is in D Berman's head,
and whether David Byrne's favorite book really is _Bean Spasms_?

Hey, Mark Wallace, wait, nobody thought you were _angry_!

Whoa, Rod Smith, nice reading at Segue! keep those Minutemen references
coming. Didn't you love it when Louis Cabri, in the middle of his breathy
sequence of Canadian politics and expletives, dropping his manuscript all
over the floor, whispered, in time with the poem, "Damn!" Was it not
excellent of Heather Fuller to thank 'the woman in the corner' (Lee Ann
Brown) for reading out loud along with all of Heather's choral poem,
"Placards"? When's Heather's book's comin's out's?

This is an interesting convention.  As David said (or did I think it??)
related to things like bumperstickers...As such, sort of a subset of
de/trans-personalized verbalizations characteristic of late cap/urban
experience? (an attempt to re-personalize same..)  In other word, related
to the ubiquity of advertizing and signage (..have been reading R.
Waldrop's wonderful The Road is Everywhere, which encorporates
pictograph'd street-signs into the dense personal-flow of the verse).

One Australian librarian who posts on library listservs has a box at the
bottom, labelling it a "pithy-quotation-free space."  thus the
expectations a new convention gives rise to, can in turn be used to make
(to feel compelled to make?) a statement...

One use for pithy quotations, which I think is fairly frequent--To make
clear something one feels, to delinieate an emotional commitment to a
value, without having folks think you're being too pushy about it.
Another library worker has as her tag a Conrad quotation: "We live, as we
dream, alone."  As a socialist I find this quote depressing and even
rather angering every time I see it.  By the same token I've been using my
signature to make a political point about outsourcing, which is part of
capital's high-drive attack on people (working people, the majority);
since my library actually does a little outsourcing, and I can't be too
outspoken when cyberspeaking as part of my job, I hide behind 1. the
putatively light, "witty" character of pithy-quotations; and 2. the
prestige of a widely-read recent book in library science...I hereby append
that signature, which I usually leave off when Poetix-izing:

Jennifer Turns For Lorn


Today I up-and-gathered myself, all dressed in my new frock, and went gai-
ly-raily to the store where I could buy books read by others. And there I
found, guess, two volumes by sad Elinor Wylie, called Angels and Earthly
Creatures, and Angels and Earthly Creatures! One was the very first edi-
tion and the other was even earlier

There were these sad poems, and this very sad comment written right in
both of them:

"The contents of this, Elinor Wylie's last, book of poems was selected by
her for publication on the evening of December 15th, 1928, the day prior
to her death. It is printed precisely according to her own arrangement
without any necessity for the exercise of literary executorship."

Was she in bed? And, oh, Jennifer, that novel of hers which popularized my
name, from Guinevere, Jennifer Lorn, that is I do believe, Jennifer For-
Lorn! And what pretty books these books are!

        O break the walls of sense in half
        And make the spirit fugitive!
        This light begotten of itself
        Is not a light by which to live!

She wrote, and that other sense is me!  Now this, from Miss Edna St-Vin-
cent Millay!

        To Elinor Wylie

        [In answer to a question about her]

        Oh, she was beautiful in every part!
        The auburn hair that bound the subtle brain;
        The lovely mouth cut clear by wit and pain,
        Uttering oaths and nonsense, uttering art
        In casual speech and curving at the smart
        On startled ears of excellence too plain
        For early morning! - Obit. Death from strain;
        The soaring mind outstripped the tethered heart.
        Yet here was one who had no need to die
        To be remembered. Every word she said,
        The lively malice of the hazel eye
        Scanning the thumb-nail close - oh, dazzling dead,
        How like a comet through the darkening sky
        You raced! . . . would your return were heralded.

Now me!:

        would I have had the time to have been her instead of Jennifer,
        or have sat down against the clock killing her, dressed down
        in one or another violation fabric, cotton, silk, of pinafore
        or lovely frock, train, velveteen of lace, red wedding gown:
        would I these gloves have fit her, dark with grace and veil
        these lines would not have fit her, face of pearl, failed
        at being life, o Jennifer forlorn, o gods, o ghastly gruel,
        o meales, o scales and carapace, nylons, garters rule
        the thin constricted waste, garnered heels turned to blacks;
        the violent maelstrom churns, burns against your slacks.

        I describe myself upon the shelf.

I am so happy to have found love and death and Elinor Wylie!

To announce that I be reading with Pam Rehm this thursday is the expressed
purpose of this message. "I hold a picture up everybody thinks it's me" is a
Graham Parker line. The event is listed as a reading (I am from a town or
tavern called Reading and Pam too was "raised" in Pennsylvania) and it will
be at 7:30, March 6th 303 East 8th, btw. B and C. I think that is all the
information one would need to know I think. But, although I can't speak for
Ms. Rehm here, I should say that any potential audience people should not
necessarily EXPECT it to be a reading. It's even less likely that I will play
paino, though that might be more fun. But fun isn't the same as "pleasure".
It's likely that there will be drinking before the reading--as if there would
be no reading without drinking.

I think there is a certain analogous use of the sig.s to that os epigraphic
prefatories, a certain aura, era, ira.  but then there is the usual, the
humourous, the 'god aren't I quick' etc.  and the display of our pretentions,
character slippage.  much probably.

This will possibly come too late for those getting the list on digest, alas,
but ...

If you haven't seen it, watch Nova tonight on PBS.  It's a very provocative
and disturbing piece on Genie, a contemporary "wild child" and addresses *a
lot* of issues, including the role Truffaut's film had in shaping what
happened to this poor human being who became a research tug of war.

With all of our talk here about "linguistically innovative" poetry, there is
very little *news* here about what's going on in language research.  Perhaps
we think too much that we are the news.  Whatever, this program addresses
several disturbing issues regarding the role of research, science, and the
fate of individual human beings in a dire discourse concerning core issues
over the nature of language.

Subject:      is "hate" speech "free" speech
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Sorry not to let this thread die, but I don't think I'm quite
ready to let go of it yet.

        Frankly, I'm not sure where I would ultimately come down on this
issue, but my understanding of the problems regarding "hate" speech have
to do with potential contradictions between the first amendment,
permitting free speech for all, and the fourteenth amendment, granting
equal opportunity to all under the law.

        Those who think of "hate" speech as purely a first amendment
issue will, undoubtedly, want on all occasions to reserve people the right
to speak as they please, although even this is limited, because certain
kinds of speech ARE prohibited under the law (yelling "fire" in a theater
being the cliched example). Thus, a first amendment position would clearly
argue that more damage is done by repressing the free speech of racists,
etc, than by allowing them to speak freely, because of the potential
dangers that the loss of free speech may lead to.

        A Fourteenth Amendment position may, on the other hand, argue that
it is necessary for the law to promote an environment in which opportunity
remains equal for all. How does this impact the subject of speech? Does an
environment of "free" racist speech harm the ability of individuals to
have access to education, housing, etc? If such "group hate" speech does
create an unequal environment, is a law restricting such speech in certain
instances really an attack on the First Amendment? Does the question shift
if one is talking not simply about an instance of a single racist speaker,
but of a racist group that demands equal rights to resources on the
grounds that their speech is as allowable as any other?

Interestingly, both Canada and Britain (if I understand correctly) do have
laws prohibiting, in certain specific instances, the right of individuals
to engage in "speech" specifically designed to denigrate any group of
people based on some supposedly shared characteristics such as "race" etc.
By interpreting these laws narrowly (that is, by only prosecuting very
specific instances of indviduals preaching violence against groups), there
has PERHAPS been very little impact on "free" speech.

A Fourteenth Amendment position might point out, therefore, that in a case
where there may be a conflict between the right to free speech and the
right to equal opportunity under the law, both individuals defending their
right to free hate speech and individuals defending their right to equal
opportunity by making attempted prosecutions of hate speech must prove
"compelling reasons" that 1) their activity be protected 2) that the
activity of others can be definitely SHOWN to impact their freedom. Thus,
someone who sues someone else for "hate speech" must prove how they have
been harmed, while someone defending their right to free speech must prove
why their need to denigrate others based on race outweighs the right of
individuals to equal access under the law. Both such instances would then
need to be pursued on the basis of the particularities of their cases,
rather than by generalities about "free speech" or "equal rights."

As I am still forming my point of view about these matters, I welcome
response...

Mark Wallace

For Rachel Duplessis and others:

        Just as a clarification, my point last week about Ron Padgett and
Ted Berrigan in relation to Tulsa was NOT that they knew nothing about the
Tulsa incidents later in their life--I'm aware of Ron's poem on the
subject. Rather, my point was simply that information about the Tulsa
riots was not publically available in Tulsa for many years. In the case of
someone like Ron, he clearly went on to research the subject--based on
rumors he had heard? information from where? I don't know.

        Rather, my point was this: what does it mean to live in an
environment in which information about social reality is so biased that
the public account of the Tulsa riots (despite several books that appeared
on the subject (in the 60s?)) was that the National Guard had been called
in to suppress a "Negro rebellion"? Where does such a reality intersect
with the story of some young men who find that life in Tulsa does not
perhaps offer sufficient outlet for a creative existence as a poet. Some
might say: the two are not related--how could something that one could not
know as a child impact one's later choices. My answer was this: is it not
likely that what one does in reaction to one's social environment is
influenced even by that which one does not know? That is: does not the
suppression of information in one instance at least suggest why
information (about creative choices, about poetry) is suppressed in other
instances? Or put it this way: one may not know all of the reasons why one
leaves a place, but the reasons one knows are intimately and historically
bound with the reasons one does not know at the time, but may be lucky,
committed, and intelligent enough to explore later.

mark, have you looked at catherine mackinnon's _only words_ (harvard,
1993)?... she makes a strenuous case for a more conservative reading of the
first amendment in light of the fourteenth, very much along the lines
you're suggesting...

while i'm ultimately in disagreement with mackinnon, dworkin and others, i
found the book useful in highlighting the contentious issues...

best,

You may be interested in the forthcoming _Excitable Speech: Contemporary

     This "direct" question by Tom totally ignores a post I made a few
days earlier (February 25th) in which I said "in 20 years of off-and-on
friendship my Jewishness was never the occasion for any Jew baiting."
I would have thought this statement was fairly clear. I know Tom saw the
post because he referred, in the verbal equivalent of a sneer, to other parts
of it later. Perhaps he jumped over this part.
     If there is any single human being still interested in this issue,
let me state that, unlike Maria, I haven't found Tom's "lack of
ambivalence" at all refreshing, that I think he's been wrong from the
start, that I fail to see how offering anyone a "knuckle sandwich" can be
seen as implying that the perceived fault is shared, and that (finally)
the reason I haven't responded before this was because I was concerned
about an issue of public/private posting that I thought gave rise to Tom's
question: I'm told -- and I indeed thought -- that the impetus for this
question came from his knowledge of a PRIVATE post I had made to another
member on the list, who then paraphrased it (perhaps prematurely) to Tom,
who then posted it to the entire list. That's troubling.
    If, however, the impetus for the question came solely from my
statement that I have, in fact, known Ed for some 20 years, he should have
read the rest of the post where that statement appeared.
    I suggest, now, that the place to pursue any further discussion of
this issue is through back-channels, where I'll be happy to discuss with
any and all what I do and (mostly) don't know.

Now Walt Kelly wd be in another kind of trouble. Once Pogo and Albert were
out on their flatboat (remember the name on the side wd chgange a little
with each panel?) fishing, and Pogo went to throw the anchor, but it went
into Albert's mouth and he fell overboard. When he surfaced, Pogo said
"Albert you is swoggled the anchor!" And lighting up, Albert said, "Yep,
and I is smokin' the rope!"

Another time the turtle guy was standing on Albert's chest, looking down
his maw at something else Albert has swoggled, and he says, "Albert, you is
deeper than I thunk!"

"that turtle guy" had the brilliant name of, as i recall, churchy la femme.
this whole cold war thread, including people's passion for pogo, is
teaching me a lot about my stoically complacent father, who had a passion
for pogo, mentioned once that the rosenbergs' only crime was being jewish,
and otherwise struck me as more of a podhoretz-type than anything
else...now i can see between some of those silences...thanks all.--md

I'm looking for recordings of F.T. Marinetti and other Italian Futurists.
I've located some Marinetti on the Tellus #21 cassette, but would like to
uncover more (as much as there is).

Can anyone point me in the right direction?  Post here or back-channel me

Martin,

the Belgian recording label Sub Rosa has a collection called Futurism &
Dada Reviewed, that includes recordings of Apollinaire, Cocteau, Duchamp,
Grandi, Huesenbeck, Janco, Wyndham Lewis, Marinetti, Russolo, Schwitters, &
Tzara.

Some of the recordings are old & not well restored & some of the
editing/collaging of sound is confusing & weird, but it's the only
relatively easy to find source of recordings of lots of these people.  I've
got the LP, but I've seen it on CD.

Bests

Herb

Yep.  And those were (sometimes) the names of real swamp denizens, I
have reason to know, because once it was my best friend in grade school.
Okay all this has sent me back to the Pogo books (I knew this list was
good for something).  Where I find a poetry contest between Albert and a
worm.  Albert, glaring at worm: BY JING! I could write a BETTER poem
than that with BOTH HEADS tied behind of my back.  Worm: Phoo! You
missed its fruity import.  Albert: Phoo yo' own self...It don't mean
nothin' an' I don't unnerstan' it!  Howland Owl: You don't understand
RUSSIAN, so Russian means NOTHIN'?  Worm: NYET! ... Albert: Fuddle-
stucks! I'll outscan that li'l grub TWO TO ONE.  Worm:  WELL! I'll go
home an' work on my I-ambic pentameter.  Albert (enraged): By tunkit, if
you uses any MACHINERY, I'll declare a FOUL!

and so on.

Poor Joe Safdie, feeling pressed to deny the Jew-baiting (or whatever) of
which his friend Ed Dorn *accuses himself* in the letter to Baraka Al
Nielsen quoted oh so long ago, refers to:

"a PRIVATE post I (i.e. Joe) had made to another member on the list, who
then paraphrased it (perhaps prematurely) to Tom, who then posted it to the
entire list."

What=92s he talking about? What did I "post to the entire list?"=20

And, oh yes, what about --

Dorn defending, at the Berkeley conference on Olson a few years back,
Vincent Sarich and his ideas about the genetic intellectual inferiority of
certain racial groups=20

-=96 as someone emailed me recently (and shamefully I share it with the
entire list). Is it fact or fiction? Is it irrelevant? Doesn't affect *my*
life (whose?)

Now, I could go on and ask Joe whether and what he knows about that
subject, but I won=92t.

My concern is not the question of Dorn=92s racism; maybe it's all an
unfortunate tissue of coincidental misquotations, anyway he doesn=92t seem
placed where he can do much harm, anyway harm to him occurs only if he
comes around me with that kind of stuff (pop in the puss).

I am concerned with the way it got handled here. The fact that Al Nielsen=92=
s
personal testimony and then his reference to a researcher-available letter
were both pooh-poohed. The fact that the subject seemed embarrassing,
somehow vulgar perhaps, to certain members of the list, the fact that it
prompted the really low-level response that "why yes, poets can be bad
people." Or worse, can be "difficult" people. Und so weiter.

That=92s what I meant by calling the thread "creepy." Not Dorn, the response
on the list.

Outsourcing is one of those lovely corporate weasel-words for a way to
attack people's lives.....Essentially, it means hiring a worker on an
"independent contractor" basis.  Usually you "downsize" first--i.e. you
fire a lot of your employees.  then you hire people (often the folks you
just fired) for limited amounts of time to do the same work without
unions, at much lower pay, without job security, without basic medical or
dental coverage, without vacation or sick leave...You get the picture.
Sometimes outsourcing involves contracting with a firm to provide a bunch
of folks without benefit, decent pay or job security to do work that used
to be done by people with decent jobs.

I have to admit I use the Crawford/Gorman quote because of its implied
political edge....As a poet, I don't necessarily agree that neologisms
some people find "ugly" are bad language---Messing with the language in
"irresponsible" ways is one of the mothers of invention...

dear Martin --

The most Marinetti I have is on an old lp "musica futurista: antologia
sonora a cura di Daniele Lombardi, published by Cramps Records (Italy) --
I think in 1980.  The Marinetti listings are (1) Profilo Sintetico
Musicale di Marinetti (1923); (2) Cinque sintesi radiofoniche (1933),
(3) Marinetti (voce) with Aldo Giuntini (pianoforte) performing
"sintesi musicali futuriste 1931; & (4) Marinetti reciting "La battaglia
di Adrianopoli" and "Definizione di Futurismo" (1924).  The last is
said to be from a disc titled "Marinetti e il Futurismo" (EMI 3C-065
17982/A), if that's of any help.

Are these on the Tellus #21 cassette you mention, which maybe you can
otherwise identify for me?  I also have no idea whether the Cramps disc
ever reappeared as a CD.

Anyway, all best,

Jerome Rothenberg / JERRY

ps.  Other interesting things on the disc, including later realizations
of Russolo intonarumori.

I think Tom Mandel is right that the Dorn thread is creepy: I mean creepy
not only in every sense in which I think he means it (I agree with him)
but also creepy in the sense of gothic: the return of the uncanny: the
fear of politics is the fear of people who have been killed by someone

I'm co-curating an exhibition of books and magazines produced (mostly) via
the mimeograph machine. I've compiled a list of a hundred or so as a
beginning but would be very curious to hear some suggestions from those on
the poetics list. Anyone wish to offer their "top ten list"  of favorite

I'm also interested in acquiring collections/libraries/archives of such
material for the exhibit. Please back channel any offers.

Dear Fiona,

Steve Evans' lecture "The Dynamics of Literary Change" is available from
The Impercipient Lecture Series, 61 E Manning St, Providence RI 02906-4008.
I misspoke when I said that it proposes a structure of literary change.
What would be more accurate is to say that the talk digresses around the
subjects of the autonomy of the work of art, the beginnings and ends of
literary eras, and the writings of Hegel, Musil, Bourdieu, Adorno and
others.

A couple of other mimeo/xerox notables: Mark Nowak's old
Furnitures, and Giants Play Well in the Drizzle. Also Andrew
Schelling's Jimmy and Lucy's House of K, which I think was
reincarnated into something else.

Some of the magazines listed here are photocopied- does the original
post specify mimeographed?

I would be very interested in hearing from magazine producers about the
difference in production choices that mimeograph vs. photocopy entails.
Not just technical, but the aesthetic choices as well.

Thanks,

Hello everyone -
In Australia , well, in Sydney, we had the amazing roneo magazine "Magic
Sam" with silk-screened covers & graphics - and later the
not-as-brilliant-looking "Meuse" followed by Mark Roberts' (& Adam Aitken's)
"P76" - maybe you can remember some others Mark ?
But "Magic Sam", with its sometimes four/five colour silk-screened comics as
well as the most interesting poetry, prose & interviews of the mid to late
seventies/early eighties, gets my vote as the best of the Australian mimeo
(we called it "roneo")magazines.
Cheerio

And I should add that "Magic Sam" was edited & produced by Ken Bolton (with
Anna Couani & later, Sal Brereton) - Ken now edits "Otis Rush Magazine" and
has a poetry publishing imprint called "Little Esther"
Les Wicks was the editor of "Meuse" (which I think began as a Poets Union
publication). Les now edits Transit Poetry - which is the poetry posters on
buses project in Sydney & Newcastle.
And Mark can speak for himself I guess

That is when the government tells poets that they can no longer afford to
fund culture and in order to save 'costs' poets should no longer write their
own work - instead they should 'outsource' the writing of poetry to the
private sector who, after all, can produce poetry much quicker and for much
less unit cost.

Yes P76 used MAGIC SAM as inspiration. (i've still got two gestner machines
in the garage). I can also remember a few others from the Poetys Union book
box I used to cart around with me selling small press stuff at readings,
conferences, parties, funerals etc....Pam can you remember a magazine called
CHOOK CHOOK CHOOK (i think) which had a chicken feather stuck to the cover,
or THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN WHITING (as in fish).

As an aside P76 is about to reborn as an web magazine. The 6th issue will be
uploaded to the AWOL (http://www.ozemail.com.au/~awol/ site sometime in the
next fortnight) There will be a photocopies print out available on request
(no gestner PLEASE!). The 7th issue will be edited by andrew burke in perth.
(the idea being that each issue will be edited by someone different in a
different area of Australia (or even os?). Anyway more details when the
issue is uploaded.


btw I think the 3rd issue of P76 was the best (that's the one whose cover
appeared in the introduction to Pio's Penguin anthology OFF THE RECORD).
Magic Sam also produced a series of roneoed books (one of which was a
brillant little book by Pam Brown). I just remembered Magic Sam produced a
roneoed Mental as Anything single...!!!!

I just remebered that the last two or three issues of Kris Hemnensly's H/EAR
where roneoded with gift wrapping (I think) used as a cover. It was
basically a collection of letters/comments form and to Kris from writers
around the world.

I think the first issue of Vanishing Cab, edited by Jerry Estrin, may have
been mimeographed - Done by PG&E but unknown to them - But it may have been
xeroxed -

Subject:      Mimeo/Off-set Revolute

Re J S's interesting question:
"Some of the magazines listed here are photocopied- does the original
post specify mimeographed?

I would be very interested in hearing from magazine producers about the
difference in production choices that mimeograph vs. photocopy entails.
Not just technical, but the aesthetic choices as well."

if my memory serves me well (??), the change from mimeo to photocopy(xerox
and/or off-set) occured in about 1971 or 72.
Mimeo went out and Xerox Copy shops and cheap off-set places began to appear.
The issues of aesthetics for each technology was not a question of enjoying
one technology more than the other. That was not the choice. With the
exception of a small overlap period, photocopy machines and photo off-set
presses became the dominant technology. . In terms of aesthetics -- in at
least a visual sense -- students primarily via art schools played most
interestinly the possibilites first with memory and then with zerox. Even
though I think some of that work is wonderful, and it's great Granary Books
going to bring the mimeo format back into public exposure, I don't think much
of the art centered work ever caught much art collector attention.
     In terms of literary output mimeo production was attractive because it
was both inexpensive and small. A machine could fit easily on to a table in
an appartment. In the context of sixties radical politics, it was an ideal
device for clandestine productions (broadsides, books etc.) Though I knew
some people with off-set equipment in their basement or garage, no one could
afford a xerox machine. For small presses and magazines with small runs,
small budgets, no government grants etc. the mimeo was a terrifically
affordable way to go. The intimate, hand made, slightly ink blurred, soft
paper feel of many mimeo mags and books fit into an aesthetic of back to the
land, back to the streets, back to the people etc. - a definite sense of
rejecting the corporate. Publishers took a certain pride in coping multiple
color mimeo papers from corporate offices and filling them with poetry rather
memos, stats, etc.  The use of art in the literary mags varied in qualtity -
multiple colored inks wd jazz them. The multi color Gestener - which was hot
through out the seventies was great for cheap 8 1/2 by 11" posters. (The
Intersection Poetry Series  in San Francisco was often wonderful. John Brandi
in New Mexico (Tooth of the Nail?? Press) did what seemed then rather
extraordinary mixes of color images, text, multiple color papers etc. Instead
of making use of either xerox or the mimeo as an aesthetic medium for images,
I suspect most of the time, to use computer language, images were "imported"
from an established artist.  In terms of text the 8 1/2 by 11" format made a
broad expanse of space for text - either for variations on two column format,
or filling it to the max. I don't think it had a major effect on the use of
the space. In "reality" since in the days of type writer, 8 1/2 by 11" was
the  "real time" format so there was the possibility of a genuine
correspondence/ similary between the artifact of the poet's manuscript and
the mag as an artifact!

  Off-set production made for more professional looking work, made for larger
press runs, access to commerical distribution, etc. Off set most often
required a relationship with a professional printer and a set of more costly
variables. The costs and circumstances limited most aesthetic experimentation
on account of the costs and other obligations of the printers. Interesting
the further away the process got from the domestic mimeo, the government, via
the NEA, became more involved, funding, for example, the West Coast Print
Center - this interface with the Government and its effect on poetry
production is a whole other story. Most problematic was that the cost of
off-set required larger editions (500 +) - the poetry market was soon flooded
with more and more titles than any store could support - and that was part of
the ambition. Mimeo had the advantage of limited runs and providing a more
accurate guage of the market.

This memory is totally off the top of my head - not that I should worry to
ask, but I would look forward to hearing other people's takes.

West Coast sixties mimeo mags:

Wild Dog
Or  (David Sandburg)
Magdalene Syndrome Gazette

(Ron Silliman is probably a good memory source here - some of us were there
and do remember).

Detroit - John Sinclair's "Work" and "Change" were big.

To me it seems that the computer technology (net, web sites. zines) has
redomesticated the whole production process that is comparable to mimeo
times. But that brings up current issues which is probably something for
later.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

It was much more of a party printing a magazine off a gestner machine in
your bedroom..taking lots of drugs and staying up for days with the
click/thump of the machine and loud music. I also found you could do much
better graphics on a gestner. By cutting a stencil and printing one copy at
a time you could bet a great lino cut look - we did an ad in P76 no1 for ON
THE BEACH magazine and ended up printing another fifty copies of the add on
textured paper for the artist. We would occassionally do two or more colours
on a page. My second gestner machine was wonderful. It had a light switch
which seemed to make it glow inside and it had all sorts of arms which swang
out, folded down and tucked in.
I bought it for $10 off a hippie in Balmain in 1984 who had just bought
himself a computer (back in those days I don't think I'd even seen a pc!)

A great deal of beautiful and interesting xerography is happening today,
but mostly right outside the world of poetry-  with "zines".  As a
Kinko's employee I had the blessed oppportunity to produce a poetry
magazine with multiple color copies and multiple  textured/ colored
papers, all on the sly on the graveyard shift.  I would agree that
offset is generally a domesticating process, but have to say that
photocopiers lend themselves to spontaneous, diverse products.

The magazine I helped create is Proliferation, 1 - 3.  (Available
through SPD.)

Kenny,

I found the package of 2 CDs & press release that I thought I'd sent to you
when I got back today.  It's in the mail now & I think you'll have it by
Saturday, Monday at the latest.  Sorry.

Here's a few URLs that may be of interest to your visual poetry self:

From:         Ron Silliman <rsillima@IX.NETCOM.COM>
Subject:      Typing on green stencils

Many of my first publications, such as in Richard Krech's Community Libertarian
('65), Will Inman's Kauri ('66--where my work first came into contact of the likes
of Clayton Eshleman, David Antin, et al), John Sinclair's mags, Robert Parker's
mag (name now escapes me) were all mimeographed. Others, such as Clifford Burke's
Hollow Orange, John Fowler's Grist, d alexander's Odda Tala seemed to have much
better technology and were I believe offset. By comparison, something like
Caterpillar, with perfect binding and the ability to reproduce photos on the
cover, was a real jolt toward "official" culture in that Clayton could get it into
bookstores that would never have handled a stapled mag.

Anselm Hollo (Hi, Anselm) has spoken of a period in the 1950s when, in London, he
felt it was possible to obtain almost any small English language press
publication, partly because the distribution was so much better but also partly
because there were, relatively, so few of them (remember, in the 1950s, there were
less than a tenth of the books published that there are now, so that how stores
handled stock was very different). By the mid-1960s, when I first was paying
attention, it was already pretty different. For example, Gino Clay Skies was
rumored to have many copies of Heads of the Town Up to the Aether, but it was
years before I was able to find a copy. By 1966, the rare book collection at SF
State (thanks to Robin Blaser) was already a profound resource, with its
collection of Origin etc.

The first issues of Tottel's, my own mag, were photocopied (editions of under
100), then photo-offset in very small runs--the final issue was mimeo'd on a giant
Gestetner in the basement of Hospitality House in the SF Tenderloin. I'd used
mimeo before on non-profit mags I'd worked on, but this was my only foray into
typing poetry onto those stencils. I recall that the machine was very quirky (I
had to call in the guy who normally ran it, a burly fellow named Peter McCarthy,
who hammered a few wayward pieces of metal back into place). It ate a couple of
masters, so I had to retype them in order to get the run of 150. With fulltime
jobs that paid hardly any money (I lived on around $125 a month in 1972), I was
able to put out the mag. One of the requirements in those days was finding a
typewriter that had the ability to "cut" a clean stencil.

I do think that HTML and web technology has some of the very same potential that
generated the "mimeo revolution" back then, but with some important differences.
The most important one is that the world of writing itself is far more dispersed
and decentralized than it was 30-40 years ago (generally a good thing, but not
unabashedly so). The other is that these pieces of equipment are hardly free, even
if they are becoming common. I could never have afforded the upfront costs of
owning a PC when I was in my 20s and didn't actually buy one until I was 41. Yet
the sort of effort that yields something like Luigi-Bob's scratchpad for the
wr-eye-ting list is virtually exactly the same impulse and much of the same result
as a little mag effort of those olden days, and with few of the same limitations
vis a vis distribution or reliance entirely on the local.

As a child in the late 1960s, I loved the Public School look and SMELL of
purple mimeo, which smelled like cheap vanilla ice cream. Mmmmmmmm. I miss
it.

"And I should add that "Magic Sam" was edited & produced by Ken Bolton (with

I assume (nearly) everyone on this list knows the names and music of Magic
Sam, Otis Rush, Little Esther. Obvious point if not: these mags were named
after blues guitarists/singers MS and OR and blues singer LE.

thanks to all for your memories, comments & lists.
lewis warsh, certainly one of the masters of mimeo, made the comment, while
looking at granary publications recently, 'this is so great, i've always
wanted to do this, i've always wanted to make books' - i felt like shaking
him: "lewis! you have, you've been making wonderful books for 30 years!"
there is something about the 'non-design' design of mimeo publications that
is fascinating- and yet they are totally designed even resplendent in their
expression of design, literature,  art and the ever present "bookness". i'm
remined of a comment mikeal made some weeks ago suggesting that the
magazine l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e  somehow had the ambition to present 'the text and
just the text' (like sargent friday 'just the facts ma'am') - but this
seems impossible! l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e was every bit as consciously designed &
produced as, say, 'wired' magazine. it's 'materiality' as with mimeo,
contributes forcefully to its total message. one of the interesting things
about mimeo is that, although it required certain skills, one didn't really
need a grasp of the history of typography, printing and bookmaking.
whereas, for example, printer/publishers using letterpress (also relatively
cheap and widely available at the same time as mimeo) tended to be much
more conscious of design etc. of the whole heritage of 'fine bookmaking'.
mimeo, as a technology, was nearly invisible, yet now, as we look back,
those books and magazines are totally striking in every way, not the least
of which is their 'design'. it would be nearly impossible to produce books
of such purity today, at least in the u.s.

It's Thursday, and that means Poetry City is on the radio!

At 11:45 this morning, if you're in New York or the environs, set your FM
radio to 91.5 (not 91.9 as previously reported) and you'll hear the list's
own Dan Bouchard reading among other poems "A Pavement Ontology", which is
about Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, not Malkmus and Ashbery.

Then, tomorrow at 7 p.m., come by Poetry City (in the luxurious offices of
Teachers & Writers Collaborative, 5 Union Sq W, NYC) to hear international
superstars Quentin Crisp and Lee Ann Brown read their work. You won't be
sorry you did!

With fond regards,

"Open Space" was actually edited by the poet Stan Persky, under Spicer's
direction.  Tho' it looked like a mimeo magazine it was actually offset.
"Open Space" was planned to run for one year, from Jan-Dec 1964, with an
issue appearing every month; in the event 15 issues appeared, extra issues
to celebrate Valentines Day, Baseball Season, and one extremely limited
issue, #9, was printed to thwart collectors who might sell a complete run
to universities, libraries, etc.

Spicer's earlier magazine "J" was indeed a mimeo magazine.  "J" appeared
for five issues during the second half of 1959.  Jack Spicer and Fran
Herndon solicited the writing and art work for "J," and the artists who
contributed (Herndon herself, Jess Collins, Russell FitzGerald) drew their
pictures directly onto the stencil.  Jess' comic strip panels, so
intricate, so flowing in line, and so funny, were executed without a single
false line.  How did they do it?  How did they do these things without a
backspace key?

Subject:      Re: mimeo revolution re clay

Maybe one aspect of mimeo - especially those that used the heavy, soft papers
- was that the ink literally sank into the page. The reading process
compelled a certain quality of literal absorption. Mimeo as a soft, felt
medium was the antithesis of formica, the plastic fifties. An organic, or
vegetal quality about it. The materiality slowed down the reading. (As could
letter press in that 'fine print' tradition. Who would want to rush through
Spicer's "Language" as set and printed by Graham Macintosh for White Rabbit?
  At its worse the quick impression of off-set printed introduced a
quick-disposable feel to work. The way that e-mail can perhaps similarly go
up in quick smoke - and a good pesonal letter usually does not.   The
materiality of a medium can create a resistance -- as well as a larger labor
input -- which impels a depth, a quality.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

Nostalgia for mimeo from a consummate bookman like Steve Vincent--that's a
good one. I used the damned things extensively for political work--it was
all over my fingers, all over my kitchen, all over everything. Typeface was
dependent on typewriter. Mistakes--I'm a lousy typist--were like fate or
original sin.
Multilith used to make a typeable offset plate, so you could do offset and
still not get into bucks. The first issue of Broadway Boogie was done that
way and printed at night on a desktop AB Dick at Hostos College, unbeknownst
to the powers that were, and hand cut on a guillotine. Artwork was drawn on
those self-same plates. All the joys of mimeograph, but longer runs and
cleaner copy. Then I discovered the compositor. Wow. If I made a mistake I
didn't have to start all over, I could simply cut out the goof with an
exacto and replace it with the correction. Good way to learn hand-eye
coordination. But of course that married me to the short-run houses and
budgets. But if it could be photographed it could be printed.
Sometimes I get nostalgic for cars with broken clutches. All kinds of
poverty are fun to visit when you're young.

the purple & odiferous printing process that spurs such fond memory
is actually th product of "spirit duplicators"--ink was transfered from
a sheet (similar to carbon paper) to a master; solvent frm the machine
then transfered that ink to the paper...  occasionally but not much
used fr publications, & most ov those will have vanished, as th ink
fades, especially in contact w/ air...    a different beast frm mimeos,
which pushed ink thru a wax-impregnated stencil...

I must have missed the beginning of this Pogo thread. Was a PC problem ever
perceived here?

Anyway, I love the language possibilities. Are the Pogo books still available

I think this is true and it is interesting that P76 is re-emerging on the
www having basically missed the offset revolution completely. A computer and
internet connection does cost more than a gestner machine a lot of students
(and others) have access to cheap internet connections through universities
(P76 actually accessed stencil cutting machines to cut stencils for our
gestner which meant we did paste ups which could include graphics and then
cut the stencils at Sydney Uni for the cost of the stencil - the cost of
hiring or buying a stencil cutting machine was way beyond our means).

Thanks Jerry,

The Cramps LP sounds exactly what I'm looking for.  I'll check our music
library hear tomorrow, failing that I.L.L. (if they do audio).

Tellus is an audio cassette magazine produced by Harvestworks in NYC.
Their #21 issue was called "Audio by Visual Artist" and has Marinetti's
"La Battaglia di Adrianopoli" only.  Also included are Maurice Lemaitre,
Marcel Duchamp, Kurt Schwitters, Raoul Hausmann, Mimmo Rotella, Antonio
Russolo, and about a dozen others.  If you want, I can dig up their phone
number for you.  Just email me.

Thanks again,
Martin

what is the origin of the word "mimeo"? i assume it's somehow related to
the concept of mimesis, but any further insights wd be enjoyed by moi.

Subject:      asteroid to hit earth

I have a question. Astronomers and people in-the-know writing in
Astronomy, Sky and Telescope, Scientific American, and The New Yorker,
have made it clear in the past year and a half that the Earth is
fated to be whomped with an asteroid or comet, wiping out everything-
-and they mean everything-- as we know it. It might happen
suddenly *tonight* or next month or in a further but still totally
unsuspecting future.

So my question is this: Given this overwhelming fact of an eventual,
sudden, and irreversible asteroidal extinction, what is the purpose
or worth of poetry, "avant-garde" or
otherwise? I mean, there will be no smell of mimeo ink or
memory of it after the big one hits. language poetry, its
precursors and fellow travellers, along with all its contraries, will
be blown to smithereens. The World and APR. Waht makes us talk of
evanescent words
and letters in the face of potential nothingness?  Or would this be
provocation and  reason for mimeo an its strange smelles?

Leinenkugel's is not a micro, but it's a noble beer. ("btw"--as the
buffaloish idiom goes--what beers, sodas, or other drinks do avant-
garde poets prefer when writing? perhaps as relevant a thread as
waht one is wearing and comic strip guys? how about George
crumb if we're going to do comics..)

Wouldn't a progressive political stance for avant-garde poets be to
lobby their governments to invest in research to track the thousands
of still unknown earth-crossing asteroids? The cost for effectively
doing so is very minimal compared to military budget. No doubt a
number of experimental poets will be laughing right now.

well Kaboom,

Kent

Of course, how stupid of me. I'm going to start writing traditional sonnets
and save the earth from being hit by an asteroid.

I just thought of something. I think we have just proved that dinosaurs
where language poets - and therefore they were wiped out by a giant
asteroid. I mean there they were sniffing roneo ink when...WHAMO

The question is it seems why bother doing anything, ever as eventually some
disaster may befall us. The answer is survival  ie reseach, investigate
cures for diseases, learn to build spacehips to escape asteriods etc

What part for poetry in this?
Not much, but maybe it keeps the scientists and people with real jobs
entertained for a while or at least gets them thinking laterally

If the asteriod is big enough we can make it our new home, revert back to
carving verse in rock and maybe one day progress to the high technological
level of mimeo

I started to write a reply about why does poetry need a _part_ and why not
stop legitimation crises behavior phenomena and then I got
NO CARRIER
so it was all precluded but I remember asking Edwin Honig why we studied
Eng. Lit. when I did and he said because it makes us better people.
Sometimes I pray for the asteroid.

Maria Damon asked --

<< what is the origin of the word "mimeo"? i assume it's somehow
related to the concept of mimesis, but any further insights wd be enjoyed
by moi. >>

Not sure -- but a few thoughts anyhow --

At the little Quaker grade school I attended in So. California in the '60s
(Pacific Ackworth Friends School, Temple City), mimeographs were
used regularly for ordinary lesson materials (esp. I think in the lower
grades, for some reason; perhaps textbooks were more common in the
upper grades).

I've a notion that part of the typist's skill (w/ manual typewriter)
involved even force on the keys (true for carbon copies too, but here I
referr to the cut of the mimeo sheet).

Seem to recall some variation in shade -- purple, blue.

Now as for the word, we find these related words:
~mimeograph / mimeography / mimeographic
~xerox / xerograph (?) / xeroxgraphy / xerographic
~reprographics
~facsimile reproduction
also: telegraph
also: autograph / polygraph / pictograph
(not to mention: paragraph)
& also: ~stenotype / stenographer / stenography / stenographic

"mimeo" is (of course) a shortened (familiar) form of "mimeograph" --
and sure, as for derivation, it *seems* like a direct Latin thing (from
mimesis + graph?).  My guess is, perhaps it's modeled after stenography
(?) -- quite big circa '30s-'50s et seq.

dear Alan:

if I could be with you and jennifer when the asteroid hits, i think
i'd be happy. IO've been amazed and wondering about those panties you
talk
about on FOL. But I think that when the asteroid hits, most people
won't be with the people they want to be speaking to, touching,
fucking lovingly, or expressing a kindness to. This is the terrible
thing about the asteroid that will kill us all and/or our innocent
descendandts. What do you think we should do? do we, as avant-garde
poets do
something about this by putting on our bras and panties or our bvd
Jim Palmer briefs or boxers and call our senator and say, look, mother
fucker, our planet could be blown up any second by a rogue asteroid,
what the fuck are you doing spending your time tinkering on the such
and such bomber and so on? ... or do we say to our senator, jennifer
is hot in her panties;
she touches herself and Peter jennings does it behind the screen for
jennifer while no one eis looking, thinkin gabout her, whose thinking
about him, peter jennings, who is coming while he talks about the
asteroid and the way we fucked the fucking iraquis with our astral
weapons? This latter, jennifer, would be a better way to defeat the
asteroid.

I'm not sure how, but mimeo has something to do with this. I'm not
sure how, but how is mimeo connected to the death of iraqui sodiers
buried alive in their sad trenches? I read these painfully
lovely little books, not desiring to hurt anybody, these US
mimeo things, desiring in all thier hearts to
be separate from all the fucking shit. peter jennings puts his right
hand
in Jennifer's panties. Is jennifer happy the moment the asteroid
hits? does she think: I'd
like to see peter jennings in the nude, I'd like to be with my son
and with my daughter in a field talking about what happened today at
grade school, feeling the little bones of their shoulders as i try
to think of the right motherly words to say? her son cries because
the bully said something cruel about his little birthmark.

What does it mena to take a chance, to send it off on e-mail without
cahnging a thing? How does this e-mail exist only becaude a young
iraqui man was buried alive in atrench, while we watched, amazed,
how mimeo could had led to this miracle of precission? Peter and
Jennifer look at each other an want it.

Ket


I say you're a better poet than I, jennifer, but I still say, kaboom.

Kent

The most prolific producer of mimeo poetry books has got to be Bob Cobbing's
Writers Forum, which started in the 1950s and continues to this day, although
Bob switched to xeroxing some 15 years ago or so. There are presently well over
600 WF titles, all claimed to be "in print" (Bob will photocopy a book on
demand). The magazine AND is associated with the press, and has also been
running (sporadically) since the 50s.

Write to him at 89a Petherton Road, London N5 2QT, UK. No e-mail I'm afraid.

Anent Kent Johnson's dramatic query --

<< ... So my question is this: Given this overwhelming fact of an
eventual, sudden, and irreversible asteroidal extinction, what is the
purpose or worth of poetry, "avant-garde" or otherwise? I mean, there
will be no smell of mimeo ink or memory of it after the big one hits...
What makes us talk of evanescent words and letters in the face of
potential nothingness? >>

The fact that all that now appears before us shall one day vanish -- that
is already (on some level) well known.  Don't need asteroids to make it
so.  With 'em or without 'em, the basic story remains.  The contemp.
myth of asteroids serves to dramatize this (in ways that seem dubious).
But no matter.  They don't tell us a whole lot we didn't already "know."

That's part of the given situation.  Poetry -- often, or at best, or in some
circumstances (or poss. w/ other such levels of qualification, but finally
& withal) -- poetry seeks to take adequate stock of this very situation.

It has been said (by the wise, if you'll pardon this) that consciousness
itself transcends the vehicles which it employs (such as what we call our
"body" -- clearly evanescent, as well as what usually mean by our "mind"
-- rather more longstanding [according to many], yet ultimately also
destined for annihilation).  To certain writers (especially many a poet),
such issues grow to become as no-shit serious as are those pesky little
asteroidal issues to certain science-writers whose speculations have, as
noted, lately adorned the here-today pages of American journalism.

_In the Analogy_ is a ravishing translation of the sonnet into an
american language. Realizing the poetics he put forward in _From
Feathers to Iron_, Clarke here brings to bear the push toward what he
called _the world strengthening method_, a way of thinking through the
epic impulse after Olson. This work, astonishing in the range of its
thinking and reference, is John Clarke's final work, not finishing,
though it knows that fact, but finally just stopped in its tracks.
Each of the six completed books contains 40 sonnets, and the final
book conatins 4.

        "John Clarke is among those stand-out poets who are guides in
        what to do in writing that thinks. So--we may come through. .
        . . A concourse of poems--necessary rests between them--runs
        into and investigates our ongoing predicamnt. Here we are just
        plain after-the-modern (to use Olson's clear recoognition and
        step around the pile-up of postisms) and at work."
                --Robin Blaser

        "John Clarke's poems carry off an integration of a whole gamut
        of moods. . . . They reach out to startling conclusions and
        skein out to a future from a deep past in a web of many
        dimensions. . . . [A]s far beyond Olson as Olson was beyond
        Melville."
                --Albert Cook, _American Poetry Review_

John Clarke (b. 1933, Winesburg, Ohio, d. 1992) is also the author of
_Lots of Doom_ (1973), _Gloucester Translations_ (1974), The End of
This Side_ (1979), and _From Feathers to Iron: A Concourse of World
Poetics_ (1987). As Director of the Institute of Further Studies
(founded 1965) he oversaw saw publication of the ongoing series, _A

Not to worry, Kent. Asteroids "read," though they don't move their lips
and only rarely review.  The whole point of the internet is to increase
and amplify linguistic activity on a global scale; as long as we keep our
bubble of words inflated, nothing can touch us.  Check out that seminal
work on Bell's Theorem, _Whistling in the Big Dark: Quantum Butterflies
and the Development of Human Culture_.

i don't get why we shd get upset abt this. i mean it's kind of cool to
think of everything being different.  better this kind of apocalypse than
one we do to ourselves (ecological abuse, nuclear etc). some of us are
already living in the wake of our own apocalypses.

I can't go on, I must go on. If this happens, the survivors will go back to
eating poetry (maybe mimeographed poetry at that!) They sure as hell won't be

Contrary to popular opinion, Simon, lightning frequently touches the same
place not twice, but many times. There have been numerous asteroid impacts:
the Tungushka event in Siberia, c.1910; Arizona's "tourist" crater; Yucatan,
of course, and many smaller ones all over.

Apocalypse fever - catch it!

And of course the answer to Kent's question is: so what? just keep writing.
I mean, the sun is going to enter the red giant phase in 20 million years
anyway, swallowing the innerplanets in its death throe expansion. You might
as well as write...

wait a minute.  I was under the impression that the asteroid had already
hit the earth, and is now known as the gulf of mexico.

if lightning never strikes twice, why would an asteroid?

To this thread I'd like to add a note about my book _Small Press: An
Annotated Guide_ (Greenwood Press) which has an essay contextualizing the
Mimeo Revolution and innovative small press and also lists and reviews
nearly 200 sources related to small press. The focus of the book is to view
independent, content-oriented publishing from the perspective of the IDEA of
a mimeo-revolution which, publishing history has shown, was not so much tied
to a particular type of machine but to a sense of how to make writing circulate.

Watched a portion of Tarkovsky's "Stalker" last night. Had to break off to
read "Ivan Ilyich" for class. My query is this: who is Arseny Tarkovksy,
listed in credits for writing poetry for film? Is he related to Andrei?
Seems I've seen this name before in some anthology.

Jennifer'd want to let the race die with grace, flat on its face.
Species extinction's up to 104 per day, latest web estimates.
Humanity's 1/104 along that turn of mind, never mind the biomass.
Scales'd weigh in way in for the other 103.
Jennifer'd vote that way.
Jennifer'd take her panties off at the very last moment.

Yes. Very thin analysis, and very puffed up about itself. I just read
this too, and I'm happy to learn that monopoly capitalism is bad, thank
you very much, and that we readers and writers live in the declension
that not even gutenberg can save us from. And for all his mau-mauing
about the always already absent goldenage (or is that goldeneggs) he has
a lot of sentimental longing looks over his shoulder.  but, Maybe he's
sniffing the air for that mimeo olfactory sensation. Or, more likely he
is keepin a eye peeled for an asteroid.

In theory, I think this is a good theory, but I wonder how it differs from
the Common Law (or Talmudic for that matter) tradition that we have
inherited. Won't we start noticing similarities in the particularities of
individual cases? And what does that lead to but amendments based on
sweeping generalities. I'm afraid that we will simply invent the wheel all
over again. And now to tie this in with asteroids on collision courses
with the earth, what do we as poets and critics do about this eternal
return of the present? Should we be architects or chroniclers? I'm not
sure either but I'd argue that the latter offers more opportunities for
influence in the bazaar of ideas.

[Melded First Appearances of Jennifer in Files dd / ee Internet Text]


Jennifer walked to the window, thought albatross around her neck. Her
sails unfurled like a curly girl. I'm Jennifer, she said. I'm Jennifer and
I'm still Jennifer, she said. Now I'm still Jennifer and I'm Jennifer now
and still Jennifer. She somersaulted back into the malted, licked herself
over and Jennifer, she said. And I'm Jennifer, she said, and went to bed.

Jennifer had a thought. Honey had a thought. Pip had a thought. Jennifer
sat up and stood down. She raised her frock and cut her panties a table.
"I will make you pile on the screen," said Jennifer (and panties). There's
a lighthouse and my eyes, said Jennifer, sitting up and lying down. She
cycled tremendously! Whirr! "You are looking at my shit!" cried! Jennifer!
Jennifer-I-Jennifer-Jennifer is a silicon chip embedded in Clara's brain.
Jennifer is an installation of Alan! I Jennifer-Jennifer is Clara's brain.
You are Delirious-Jennifer delirious Jennifer, you won't let me go. Kill
me, kill me, delirious Jennifer. Put a bullet in my head, do it fast and
do it quick. Get rid of me, delirious Jennifer. Are Jennifer you delirious
Jennifer? If I can't, I won't and can't and won't. Can't think another
thought worthwhile, delirious Jennifer, if I can't I can't! Motherfather,
delirious Jennifer, then kill me! I be the woman, I piss milk, wet Jenni-
fer! You be the killer, kill my children! Thud, wet! Delirious Jennifer,
thud thud! Kill me, I can't think delirious! Jennifer! Thud! Thud! Thud!

ThE nEw MaChInE gets cold. Jennifer moves towards the center where every-
thing evens out and there are new microbes. Thud! Thud!

Re Mayans and Doomsday:

THe push here is two fold: 1) Mayan notion of time being cyclic, and the
expectations that extinction and rebirth is natural and fated. Hence Aztecs
represent themselves as legitimate successors to the Toltecs, as opposed to
conquerors of them. The problem arises when the Spanish arrive and Cortes
goes on a spree. In a real sense there is a level of indecision based on
religous belief about 'This is fated'.

But for us I think what is more interesting is the argument that the Mayans
were defeated by language: it was their inability to interpret language
laterally that leads to their downfall (or so Todorov would argue)

ipso facto: Indians and Spaniards practice communication differently. The
Indians devote a great deal of their time to the interpretation of
messages, and this interpretation takes elaborate forms, which derive from
various kinds of divination. Interpretation is systemnatic (ie  dividing
time into a thirteen week calendar) and contextual (which takes the form of
omens) Every event is interpreted as the herald of another event (Which
implies that nothing in this world ocurrs randomly). The Aztecs are
convinced that all such divinations come true and only very rarely  resist
the fate declared to them. In Mayan the word fate also signifies 'prohecy'
or 'law'.

The world is from the start posited as overdetermined, everything is
forseeable hence everything is forseen, Secondly the society is highly
heirarchical and regulated: the individual exists for the group, not
themselves.

The Spanish on the otherhand practice a different kind of communication: If
you say there exist two major kinds of communication: one between person
and person, the other between person and the world, the Mayans and Aztes
practised the latter and the Spanish the former.

Communciation of couse is not limited to that between individual and
individual, it also encompasses that between individual and the woder
social group, the natural world and the religious universe.

When  a messanger comes to Montezuma and tells him what he has seen
(Spanish ships and horses) he is thrown into prison. The magicians try to
have prophetic dreamns to interpret the supernatural omens. So when the
information about the Spanish reaches Montezuma his interpretation of it is
made in the context of communication with the world, not of that with other
individuals.

It is this particular way of practicing communucation (neglectinmg the
human dimsension, privaliging contact with the world) which is responsible
for the Indians distorted image of the Spanish during the first encounters,
and notable for the paralyzing belief that the Spanish are gods.

Perhaps more to come on the production of discourse and symbols by the
Mayans ie discourse as symbols, as symbolic - each word is a signifier
rather than the signified etc

I have kept quiet on this thread (I think) but now have both 'a solution'
and an 'observation'

Solution: (having watched Mr Smith Goes to Washington recently) all poets
who feel strongly about anything should in a poetic filibustering hereby
drowning out opposing voices and diminishing the need for violence.

Observation: In yet another instance of New Zealand political life imitates
poetics mailing list this week our deputy prime minister 'assaulted' another
politician (in parliament but outside working hours) - who said stuff he
didn't like. The politician assaulted was one all thinking New ZEalanders
would have (as with some peoples attitudes to Dorn) have liked to punch at
some if not many times over the last few years. He is an racist, sexist,
homophobic, classist etc etc asshole.

HOWEVER the deputy PM who puched him is himself a lying, scheming,
manipulative drunk. Curiously the debacle was witnessed by the leader of our
more 'old school left wing' (what else can i call it) party.

The question here arises - and i guess this is directed more at punchers
than anti-punchers - how do we react when someone long over due a good pop
in the kisser has it administered by someone equally scarey. (To tie hitler
into it again - would we cheer if he were punched by Mussolini?) One thinks
couldn't have happened to a better person - but unfortunately someone -
probably both is gonna get a whole lotta mileage out of it.

ANyway how this relates to poetics i am not sure - as these threads have a
tendency to wander - i hope i have not wandered to far. Guess i really
wanted to check whether our deputy PM was on the list & as i was concerned
this discussion may have had a negative influence on him.

Winston are you out there?

        In response to your question, Arseny Tarkovsky, (b. 1905), the
poet, was Andrey Tarkovsky's father. Andrey frequently quoted his
father's poetry in his films.  If you are interested in knowing more
about the filmmaker and/or his father the poet get ahold of the book,
Sculpting In Time: The Great Russian Filmmaker Discusses His Art,
translated from Russian by Kitty Hunter-Blair, University of Texas Press,
Austin, 1987, ISBN 0-292-77624-1. If you're in Buffalo get this at
Talking Leaves.   That's where I got my copy.

        PS -
        Check out all Andrey's films. He is brilliant. I'd love to have a
discussion by e-mail about his work and what you think of it.

Just struck me this moring that the List had missed some important staple
bound - either mimeo and/or off-set presses which wd add 'grain' to the
Granary exhibit.


Shameless Hussy was the imprint of Alta's infamous Berkely based imprint.
Late in the sixties, I suspect she started with a mimeograph machine and then
went "kind of" multilith. The books were invariably done on the cheapest
stock imaginable with varying and fading inks. All of which corresponded to
the aesthetic of a mother working out of a kitchen amongst kids and other
obligations,  no support from no where - the books were never more than 75
cents. Her best title "No visible means of support" was a lovely  ironic play
on Spicer's line.  Her most famous book was "For Colored Girls..." by Ntozake
Shange - which went Broadway ballistic.

The Women's Press Collective was an equally significant player among the
staple-bound. (In fact I think 'staple bound' is probably the common
denominator of what's been discussed - rather than just mimeo. I think it's
also important to see the sixties as something that really begins - as a
national or global phenomenon -- in 1964 and ends about 1975.)  Anyway, in
addition to Alta, the WPC was the local, if not national ground breaker in
terms of new feminist writing. The book EDWARD THE DYKE by Judy Grahn - at
least in my opinion - was not only good, but a crucially provocative text.

Teachers & Writers Collaborative: Back in the very early days circa 1965 -
under the initial directorship of Herb Kohl - TW did some of the first works
of Victor Cruz, David Henderson and a bunch of other then young writers
working in the NY School System. Stapled and printed, either in mimeo or
off-set (my copies  have since disappeared) these little black ink on cheap
white paper phamplet editions, especially the Henderson and the Cruz, were
urban, edgy, and very popular, striking a chord, or fire among the young.
Distributed primarily in the schools, they were no doubt in part responsible
for initiating Victor Cruz's early career. When he was about 19, SNAPS (1968,
Random House) sold over 10,000 copies in cloth, going thru several editions.

I can't imagine an exhibit of "sixties" spirited publications without these
books. My own mag "Shocks" comes at the early edge of the seventies and was
definitely pushed forward by the political etc. smarts of these three
different presses.

(I welcome corrections or additions to any of this info!)

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

There seem to be some strange notions afloat. Here's a few correctives (I
haven't read the Todorov, so I don't know quite who I'm correcting):
1. Mayans are not Aztecs. Which Mayan defeat are you talking about? The
abandonment of the great centers that tourists like me enjoy exploring? That
happened several centuries before the Aztecs arrived a thousand difficult
miles further north, to say nothing of the Spanish. Do you mean the 16th
century defeat of the highland Maya by the Spanish, which seems to have been
accomplished more by way of the agency of strategic alliances and European
diseases, the Quiche being far more ready to fight than Moctezuma had been?
Do you mean the defeat of the last of the post-classic Maya kingdoms in
1698? Do you mean the defeat by the Mexicans of the independent Maya state
that existed in the Yucatan for much of the latter half of the 19th Century
and the first part of the 20th? What about all those Mayans who still live
in their original homelands and who recently have managed to force the
Mexican and Guatemalan governments to the bargaining table?
2. We have little idea how Mayans and Aztecs communicated. What survives
from that time are government proclamations on stone monuments, creation
myths, Nahua court poetry, and litle else. Except for the latter these
documents do tend to be communications between "persons and the world," but
so are the inscriptions on the Lincoln Memorial and a billboard ad for
Miller Light.
3. "Every event is interpreted as the herald of another event (Which
implies that nothing in this world occurs randomly)" could also be said of
medieval Christianity, which the early Renaissance Spaniards who invaded
Mexico had not yet, and never really, succeeded in escaping. The end of the
story of humankind as both individuals and as a whole was well-known and
largely agreed-upon.
4. After the Aztecs got rid of Moctezuma they got rid of the Spanish. When
the latter came back with greater force the Aztecs resisted heroically,
despite their language deficits, and were ultimately defeated by smallpox,
not syntax. Moctezuma hesitated, many others did not.

Sometimes those of us whose primary interest is language tend to inflate its
importance, coincidentally inflating our own in the process.

re Mayans And Doomsday

Plus This!
Previous transmission concerned communication: what is peculiar about this
for the Mayans and Aztecs is that there was an absence of writing. Stylised
drawings, the pictograms used among the Aztecs are not a lesser degree of
writing: they note the experience, not the langauge (one reason why Charles
Olson was so attracted to Mayan civilisation in terms of its resemblance to
Projective Verse - but that is another story).

The absence of writing is revelatory of symbolic behaviour in general, and
at the same time, the capacity to understand the 'other' appears to be
illustrated by another fact. The three great AmerIndian civilisations
encountered by the Spanish are not located on the same evoution of writing.
Then Incas are the most unfamiliar with writing, possessing mnemotechnical
use of braided cords; the Aztecs have pictograms and the Mayas have
pictograms with rudiments of phonetic writing. This corresponds directly to
the level of belief that the Spanish are Gods. The Incas firmly beieve in
this divine nature, the Aztecs do so only during initial exposure, and the
Mayans raise the question and answer it determining that the Spanish are
not gods, but rather 'strangers' or 'bearded ones' or 'powerful ones'.

What is important that as writing cannot assume the role of memory support,
speech must do so - through ritual discourse (bardic activity). The
essential feature of these discourses then, is that they come from the past
- both in production and interpretation. In to this past -oriented ,
tradition dominated world erupts the conquest : an absolutely unpredictable
event, surprising and unique, even bringing with it another conception of
time (linear as opposed to cyclical).

The collsion between a ritual world and a unique event results in
Montezuma's incapacity to react. Masters of ritual discourse the Indians
are inadequatte in a siuation requiring  improvisation, and this is
precisely the siuation of their conquest. Their verbal experience favors
paradigm over syntagm, code over context, conformity to order over effacicy
of the moment, tha past over the present.

So what lesson for poetics and the threat of an asteriod (ie an
unpredicatble, unique event)? Well, you will say, but the asteriod is
predictable, trackable, and not unique as it has happened before. Which is
precisely the point. Language denotes not only abiity to communciate and
style, but also predicates a certain genus, or type of interaction with the
world and other people. The usefulness of poetics - of investigation into
language, is that it is not simply investigation into langauge, but also
investigation into relationships (with people, world, the future and the
past) and any new way of interpreting or dealing with these future events
has to have a basis in the way we understand and deal with the present.
That is why we write poetry.

Let's never forget Yugen or Birth, both of which, at least for me, exerted
an exhaustive influence. The latter (Tuli Kupferberg) published early

(see comments in previous letter - three key types of langaue - Aztec
Symbolic drawing (pictograms), Mayan Phonetic writing and Incas braided
cords )

Agreed!

(Certaintly there a number of reasons for defeat - mainly due to Spanish
use of horses, tactics, superior weaponry etc. and of course the long term
imapct of intriduction of small pox. The point is about difference in
interpretation of language  rather than the rise and fall of civilisations)

( ouch - Sometimes those of us whose primary interest is self importance
tend to inflate it coincidentally by commenting on others' use of
langauge.)

In medieval christianity every event, even the most intimate, replicates and
repeats another event, and will until the end of time, in a world designed
as a set of symbols revealing god's truth. An intensely symbolic world.
Cortez invades Mexico less than 50 years after moveable type is introduced
to the european world. Before that, book production was rather Mayan
(remember that the jesuits burned untold numbers of codices). The writing
system, which was a lot more than rudimentarily phonetic, was, we think,
practiced only by a class of scribes and aristocrats. Of course, the same
had always been true in Europe--in both places the vast majority depended on
oral transmission and memory systems--and still was in 1519. European
churches were vast books of symbols for the illiterate.
As late as 1640 there were only 14 printing presses, each capable of
producing one sheet at a time, in all of England.
If language explains Moctezuma's undoing it better explain Cauhatemoc's (and
Tupac's) resistance.
If pictograms are related in this easy way to belief systems and ability to
react to the unexpected are the Chinese (were they ever) like the Mayans and
Aztecs?
Some of the Spaniards were armed with an alphabet, but all of them were
armed with microorganisms, guns, horses, attack dogs, sailing ships and steel.
Europeans and Aztecs/Mayans/Incas were clearly very different, but perhaps
not so much in the ways portrayed. Large historical interpretations usually
benifit from deep historical foundations.

short answer is that the Chinese writing system, despite what Ezra Pound
thought, is not pictographic.  the characters are put together from
elements that are variously phonetic, symbolic, mimetic, and which are
recombined, recurrent, etc.  Although learning to read Chinese is
generally conceived of as learning each word separately,in fact that
isn't the case, e.g., the most common example is the character for a kind
of fish that consists of the fish radical (recurring character component)
and a phonetic that sounds like the oral name of this fish.  it is not
alphabetic, of course, but in some senses it is syllabic in
construction.  (the Korean writing system is fully phonetic but it
constructs words into identically sized boxes, so that they look like
characters)  there is a modern Chinese artist (I forget the name) who
creates these wonderful "tianshu" (heavenly or abstruse books) that
consist of line after line of nonexistent characters, all of which could
be real characters, since they are composed out of the regular character
elements: these works are like inventories of all the words that do
not yet exist in written Chinese.

meanwhile, that asteroid must be getting closer.

Thanks for the elucidation. Much the same is true of Mayan writing, as we've
learned in the last few decades. Olson could not have known this. So the
question, as a test of a theory, still stands.

Is this Xu Bing? I ask only because this is the only Chinese "book" artist I
know, but I don't know much about his work, would love to know more.

re-issue of the Cramps LPs Musica Futurista, mentioned earlier in the week
by Jerry Rothenberg as a source for recordings of Marinetti.  The price was
about US$29.  They'll also be getting a new Heidseck book/CD set and new
Henri Chopin CDs sometime later this month.

Subject:      Special Issue of THE NATION on Publishing

Daniel Bouchard et alia,

Now that Saturday has rolled around I have a moment to give a more to the
point response to your comments suggesting your disappointment with the
issue of The Nation dated 3/17/97, whose cover story is "The Crushing
Power of Big Publishing."  While I accept your criticism of the
tendentious tone of the cover article, I do not agree that what the
article contains has all been said before.  I'd like to think that I
more or less keep up with this subject; and I learned a few things
from the article about how and why news does and does not get reported,
about the esthetics of that reportage and about its ethics as well,
about how and why books of all stripes are or are not nowadays getting
published or if they are getting published, and are worthy, why they
may hardly see the light of day, and so on.

I hasten to point out, moreover, that the issue contains not one article
on this subject, but six informed articles (not including a column called
"Media Matters," which I will choose to count as a seventh relevant piece).

Did you note these other articles before you, in my regard, and with all
due respect for what I believe, based on your past commentary on this list,
is your integrity and acuity, glibly trashed a very important news event?

I only hope that others on this list will still feel inclined to check out
the issue.  I thought to mention it here especially because so many of us
are involved in, and believe in, small press publishing, and in bookstores,
and in literature.

Best wishes,

Burt Kimmelman

This does very much sound like Xu Bing & his "A Book From The Sky" a
several volume masterwork. Each of the characters in his imaginary alphabet
was carved in wood and hand printed in China where Xu Bing lived until
1990. The design of the work is modeled after traditional Chinese scholarly
publishing. About a hundered copies were produced. The *entire edition* was
shown as one piece at the Elvehjem Museum of Art (Univ of Wisc-Madison)
several years ago. They made a useful catalog which is probably still
available at about $10. The catalog is called "Three Installations by Xu
Bing" (Elvehjem Museum of Art, 800 University Ave., Madison WI 53706.

Is this Xu Bing? I ask only because this is the only Chinese "book" artist I
know, but I don't know much about his work, would love to know more.

Dear Listees:  OINK! Magazine, 1971-1985, was an offset magazine.  Issues
5-11 were done in our own dining room on an AB Dick Offset table model
that rattled the whole place when it worked.  Then we'd use a coffee mug
to make the middle fold and have a stapling party.  It (the mag.) was the
precursor to NEW AMERICAN WRITING, which still publishes many of the same
people.

>In San Pedro, the men's prison where I work, and several other

>have begun a "huelga dura" (hard strike) in which they will not even
>chew coca or drink tea. They have actually sewn their mouths shut

>trials under "ley 1008," the aggresive Bolivian anti-narcotics law).
>A law was passed a while back saying that if prisoners with serious

>in many cases have simply refused to apply the law. The prisoners are

>guaranteed by one law, but another proposal has been passed by
>certain bodies aboloshing it. It is not clear whether the proposal

>these situations are especially urgent when one considers that San
>Pedro, not atypical of Bolivian prisons, was built for 300 prisoners
>and currently houses 1290, not counting the children who often stay
>there with their fathers.
>The hunger strike is a passive/pacifistic action. However, there were
>ugly incidents last night as the prisoners prepared to begin. A
>secret police agent was found posing as a prisoner and trying to turn
>other prisoners against the strike, and he was beaten up by cell-
>block delegates. Police then gassed the prison (tear gas is common
>and terrible enough in the streets of Bolivia, but in a prison there
>is nowhere to run to escape it). There are now over a hundred riot
>police inside the prison. Negotiations have been going on all day.
>The strikers have closed themselves into the chapel. Today as I stood
>with a group of women (family-members of inmates) across the street
>from San Pedro, the police
>came and tried to send the women away. They were threatening and
>insulting (I heard one offer tell a woman with one eye bandaged
>over that she needed to see the situation "with both eyes"), but I
>ran and got some press people who were down the street, and they came
>with camaras and scared the police away.
>I was inside San Pedro yesterday (before any of the ugliness began). I
>went to mass there, and then met with
>some of the inmates with whom I work (in theology classes and a Base
>Christian Community).  The men were prepared for the worst. They
>spoke of a strike "with all the consequences."  Last month, when I
>first heard talk of a strike, a friend said it would be a "Bobby
>Sands-type" strike, refering to the IRA prisoner who died in a
>British jail during a hunger strike for prison reforms.
>Needless to say, it was difficult to say good-bye to good
>friends as I left the prison yesterday, and hurt to watch the
>gate close behind me.
>Several situations make this a tough fight for the prisoners. Mainly,
>the MRTA hostage situation in Lima, Peru.  Many of the prisoners to
>whom the provisional liberty law should apply are political
>prisoners,
>charged with terrorism-related crimes. There are even MRTA prisoners
>here in La Paz. All the groups tend to be lumped together and viewed
>in the same light as the MRTA, and so no judge or politician is
>looking to do them any favors while the hostage crisis continues.
>Also, it is an election year, which makes public perception and
>misperception, especially regarding terrorism, more important than
>true justice. I got some insight into the attitudes of the
>authorities when the judge in charge of the case of one group of
>political prisoners said that the prisoners themselves were as
>responsible as anyone for the postponement of their trial because
>they had requested an investigation into their tortures! So, it looks
>like a long, hard struggle has begun.
>I promised my friends in San Pedro that I would write this message,

same deal here -- but now seems the wheels are rollin' again -- seven
msgs. lately circulated --

incidentally, though I usually get Poetics in digest form, I find
that if I care to go no-digest for a time, presto! the listserv sends
me an immediate part-digest of what's appeared since the last digest.
Very convenient.  But trying that yesterday & even earlier today,
nada! nuthin'! -- so I'd say, yep, the Buffalo had wandered to
another pasture.  Now guess it's back in the proper plot.

Thanks, Burt K., for the further notes re: the current Nation -- will
check it out.  Just now reading something or other in The New Yorker,
the Nation was characteized as a "neoliberal" publication (in
contrast to some other mentioned as "neoconservative") -- maybe I've
been living in the forest or something, but don't recall seeing this
"neoliberal" as a modifier much anywhere before.  Perhaps they merely
wanted a nice parallelism w/ the long-ballyhooed neocon adjectival.

hey guyzies, deadline has been pushed back to april 1.  i'm getting
anxious; not too much cross-cultural stuff's been passing thru my mailbox;
please share and circulate to other lists (postcolonial, american studies,
cultural studies, af-am, etc)!!!

CALL FOR PAPERS

Conference: Cross-Cultural Poetics
Dates: October 16-19, 1997
Place: University of Minnesota, Minneapolis Campus
Keynote Speakers: Kamau Brathwaite, Diane Glancy, Dennis Tedlock, Kirin
Narayan, David Antin

Despite artificial disciplinary barriers, ethnographers & poets have in
recent years come to realize how similar their projects are.
Cross-Cultural Poetics seeks to address the increasingly untenable
boundaries between poetic & ethnographic practices.  The conference will
focus on the role of poetry in the on-going discourses of multiculturalism,
ethnography, and literary theory and practice.  While recent years have
seen a debate in "how culture is written (about)" and most of these debates
make extensive use of the term "poetics," poetic discourse itself has not
been foregrounded in these debates.  Construing the term "poetry" fairly
broadly, we invite poets and scholars working in a broad range of fields --
anthropology, urban studies, ethnic studies, folklore, literature and
literary theory, sociology, history, publishing, film, American studies,
performance studies, ethnomusicology, cultural studies, etc. -- to propose
readings, papers or panels that address the topic of cross-cultural
poetics.  the following are suggested topics, but you need not feel limited
to them:

- Comparative Poetries &/or Poetic Traditions
- Oral/Literate Interfaces or Standoffs
- Anthropological Methodologies Applied to Poetic Texts, Communities,
Events, or      Individual Poems or Poets
- Ethnography as Poetry/Poetry as Ethnography
- Ethnic, Folkloric & Vernacular Poetries
- Poetry as Cultural & Social Praxis
- Poetry as Cultural & Social Critique
- Constituting Communities through Poetic Activity
- Poetry as Mass Culture
- Poetry & the Public Sphere
-Poetry and Politics
- The Anthropology of Writing & the Writing of Anthropology
- Representing Self/Other
- Issues in Cultural Translation
- "Ethnopoetics": Reappraisals?
- Poetry & Other Media (Song Lyrics, Music, Film, Movement, Visual Arts, etc.)
- Close Readings of &/or Listenings to Ethnographic Documents
- The Poetics of Thick Description
- Ritual, Play, etc. as Elements in Poetic Composition
- The Act of Inscription: Fieldnotes, Notebooks, etc.
- The Cultural Migration of Texts
- Hybridization of Genres & Traditions
-Trans/post/supra national Poetix?

PAPERS (and Writing Samples for people wanting to read) AND PANEL PROPOSALS
(a 1-2-page abstract) should be sent by April 1, 1997 to Maria Damon,
English Dept., 207 Lind Hall, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis MN
55455.

Strange, I had just been thinking/writing about the 'Book from the Sky'.
This is by the excellent Xu Bing (surname Xu), currently resident in NYC
and exhibiting widely. Not sure that I agree with 'all the words that do
not yet exist in written Chinese', I think they are a bit further out than
that (but coming closer so, *watch the skies*).

I plan to do an essay on Xu Bing's work for a forthcoming book on Chinese
literary/artistic culture in the 90s. Here is something I recently wrote
about Xu Bing's work and emailed to a well-known colleague of ours:

... Xu Bing, who now lives (mostly) in NYC and has exhibited widely in the
States, notably at the Elvehjem Museum of Art, University of
Wisconsin-Madison in 1992, when he showed 'Book from the Sky'. I used
characters from this book on the cover of the anthology of contemporary
Chinese writing which I (Wellsweep) published in 1994, _Under-Sky
Underground_. The following is the caption I wrote for the frontispiece of
that book:

- "The cover artwork and the above illustration incorporate pages from Xu
Bing's _Tian Shu_ or 'Book from the Sky'. This work, comprising a limited
edition of a four volume, traditionally bound Chinese book in the style of
a bibliographic rarity, was first exhibited in Beijing during October 1988
where it caused a sensation. Xu, a printmaker specializing in woodcuts, had
carved the printing blocks for the books himself, entirely of 'characters'
which are not found in any Chinese dictionary. His characters look as if
they should be legible to someone who reads Chinese - they contain familiar
strokes and components - but they are not. Neither is this a Chinese
_Finnegans Wake_ - although the *visual* effect of the text is comparable -
there are no construable segments of meaningful language. However, the
material cultural forms of the Chinese literary and scholarly tradition are
strictly, even lovingly, observed: a striking paradox and eloquent
contribution to the continuing debate which rages amongst Chinese
intellectuals concerning their relationship with their own tradition." - ?
as well as a very interesting piece of applied grammatology.

- Xu Bing's latest project is a set of books describing his so-called
'Square Writing'. This is a method he has devised for writing English words
in rectangular arrangements which resemble Chinese characters. There is a
code of calligraphic script elements which map to the 26 roman letters,
then relatively simple rules for the construction of the square words allow
you to write English using Chinese calligraphic principles. As a piece of
conceptual ?grammatological art, Xu Bing has composed and published a
manual of 'Chinese calligraphy' entirely in these English 'square words'
(it looks like a Chinese book, but once the code is learned it is perfectly
legible as English) along with a companion volume of calligraphic models
for (ink and brush) writing practice. (Books of this type are familiar and
common in Chinese educational contexts.)

One more miss:
Blue Suede Shoes edited by Keith Abbot. Wonderful covers,
not afeared of humor, etc. Went through about 20 issues with enough variant
numbers to keep collectors/libraries jumping for years. I sometimes suspect
that keeping a two page issue in an editon of say five of anything (book or
mag) is the small press publishers illusion of a pension fund.

One more techno item not mentioned. My memory of one definition of sixtie's
terror was the elecrtric stapler with the three quarter or one inch staples.
 (These staplers usually had to found stationary in a printers shop - I
forget if the "guns" had been invented yet) The huge seeming machine slam of
the staples going through a half inch of stacked paper  - and the question of
whether or not your fingers might be included in the binding - I always found
just plain scary as well as at odds  with the contents of what I was
publishing. But who said culture isn't built on violence!

>CONFERENCE DESCRIPTION:
>
>As a recent articles in _American Quarterly_ and the _Chronicle of
>Higher Education_  explain, there is a growing group of scholars who are
>working in a new field:  the study of whiteness.  This field has expanded
>over the past decade in part as a result of suggestions by intellectuals
>like Toni Morrison, who have long suggested that race studies must include
>a critical, self-reflexive body of work about whites
>which is both anti-racist and progressive.  Thus, the study of whiteness is
>both comparative, in that whiteness is understood as one specific race
>among others, and critical, in that whiteness is generally viewed as a
>socially-constructed identity which has historically helped to perpetuate
>social inequalities.  Scholars of whiteness represent a very diverse range
>of  disciplines.  Sociologists, historians, anthropologists, as well as
>practitioners of ethnic, legal, cultural, and literary studies, are
>bringing interdisciplinary methodologies and critical concerns to the study
>of whiteness. Additionally, many anti-racist activists have spoken to
>issues around whiteness as they appear in community organizing, coalition
>building, and other forms of political movement.
>
>Our chief goal is to promote dialogue among scholars of whiteness across
>the disciplines and throughout the UC system.  Although scholars in the
>field read and comment upon each other's work, there has not yet  been an
>opportunity for the kind of discussions and networking that a full- scale
>conference permits.  This conference is the first of its kind.
>Rigorously interdisciplinary,"The Making and Unmaking of Whiteness"
>features presentations, works-in-progress, and respondents at the graduate
>and professorial level.  We have chosen a conference format which will be
>conducive to discussion among participants. Audience members will be
>encouraged to ask questions and given ample time and space to do so.

I remember asking Ann Waldman one day while she was stapling copies of The
World magazine at St Mark's Church (as most of you probably know the home
of The Poetry Project) if she had stapled all those copies with that
cheesy little stapler and she said yes, and most of them herself (this was
in the early 70's). She showed me the callouses on the heels of her hands,
and I was so impressed I went out and bought the church a moderately
priced one that probably didn't help that much. This was one of those
experiences that taught me how much individuals can have an impact on the
world of poetry if they are willing- sometimes literally- to take matters
into their own, sometimes aching, hands.

looking for advice on whether i should pick up a used copy of "the loom"
(1975) in a used bookstore here.  makes a nice intro into his work does
it?  better suggestions on volumes to start with?  i'm familiar only with
the stuff he included in his "controversy of poets" anthology.  any decent
critical overviews of his work?  was fairly active in publishing journals
and small presses, incl. some of zukofsky's stuff i understand.

any and all enlightenment appreciated.

Burt,

I feel I've pissed you off somehow with my comment on the Miller article.  Not
my intention.

Still, I don't feel any differently about my post. I called Miller's article it
a mediocre rant which is not trashing it so much as categorizing it. I did read
the other articles, but like to keep my posts to the list brief.

I also follow this subject with great interest. I've learned a lot from reading
Michael Parenti, Edward Herman, Ben Bagdikian, Solomon & Cohen of FAIR, etc.
Miller's article, for me, illustrated previously made points with fresh
examples.  As for the world of small presses that we know, Miller seems unaware
of its existence.

Tom:
        Yes--pick up "The Loom"--quite a weave as they say--
        There's an excellent essay on "The Loom" by Edward Schelb in
Sulfur 36. (Schelb also has a good review of Irby collection in that issue.)

> what do people think about the message on umass amherst
> occupation -- is it for real?  is it a necessary stand?

well, is it for real is one thing. there are at least a few
(what is it) bostonians out there listening - any word?
i forwarded to some folks who oughtta know, but may
not hear back for awhile.

took the precaution of writing a short letter of support.
even if the event isnt for real, the demands are; in other
words, this could be designed as a sort of terrorist attack
& not a prank - possibly safer if less publically effective
than the seizure of a university office. so id be glad to
lend my support to that effort, too.

is it a necessary stand? well, the demands seem reasonable,
though i would like to see a more detailed report on the
situation surrounding their formulation. as to the means by
which they were/are(?)/may be made, well, people dont
usually take over offices & issue demands without some
kind of provocation. i take it that the action itself indicates
a climate of unrest & frustration, though of course only an
account of the sequence of actual events could really
legitimate that judgement.

so i guess no way to evaluate those claims from here
at the moment.

Daniel,

No you didn't piss me off but I was looking for some clarification and maybe
expansion.  Anyway, I bow to your deeper knowledge of this subject.
If you have the energy and time, I'd love to have a bibliog from you
about this (back channel, hard copy, or maybe others on the list would
welcome the same).

Warm wishes,

Subject:      perloff on anthologies

Hi everyone I'm back in digestible form, quiet & reserved, after a few
long weeks (days?) of lenten fasting.  Re: asteroids - not to worry.
I have engaged in lengthy negotiations while I was away with the
Space Commissariat division of the Girl Scouts of America.  They have
developed a new cookie, called the Biosphere Sponge, which both
earthlings and asteroids will be able to share and enjoy in a multi-
orbital, nondisruptive environment.

Have read M. Perloff's smart critique of toast-mod anthologies (_Who's
New American Poetry_, diacritics f/w 1996).  I guess it's probably already
been chewed over here.  Love the way she juxtaposes a Levertov with
an Ammons poem to highlight the vagaries of us/them groupings.  She
points out how the fin-de-siecle non-consensus on what exactly is good
poetry leads to both balkanization and pseudo-balkanization - and that
they are the SAME THING!!  What I'm not sure she succeeds in doing is
making a convincing argument that the anthologies she critiques are much
different, really, from the yearbook (_Exact Change Yearbook 1995_) she
applauds.  (None of them include either me or Jack Spandrift, for one
thing.  That proves it.)  Seriously, though, a good guide to all this
swimming mass of live fish poetry schools and groups is a prose writer:
Proust.  An anthology is a kind of crystallization of two kinds of Proustian
illusion: the false "prestige" of literature and the snobbery of social
groups.  America is big and rich enough to contain 3 or 4 levels of
insiders and outsiders - each with their own intricate techniques of
apprenticeship, acceptance, back-scratching, membership, publication,
and credentialism.  What holds them all together is self-interest and
snobbery.  What redeems them is each writer's naive love for a certain
style or approach to writing (regional, experimental, traditional in
variegated ways).  But the snobbery and the prestige are the same,
across the board.  (Paradoxically, in a survey conducted by Nordstrom
Brothers, Jack Spandrift (samisdat) was by far the most popular poet among
high school students in Wingdim, Wyo. They're all wearing "Spandrift
spurs" on the backs of their necks.)

Little poets swim through the anthology-schools, but nothing substitutes
for a lifetime, as Josephine Cliche wrote.  It would be worthwhile
looking for an approach to poetry which is conceptually deep enough
to stretch beyond the borders of visual-surreal, rebel-young-fun,
imagist-epical-engage, no-rhyme-antiestablishment-ha-ha, etc.
It would be worthwhile looking for the individualist poet (the joke's
on you, Club Poesie) like Jack Spandrift, who refuses to be included
in ANY anthology, on principle.  (Norton begged him for his sequence,
"Dream of the Cube Steak" - without success.)
- Henry Gould  (Henry's new CD, "Why I am Not a Poet", is available from
Providence School Fish & Aquarium Supplies, PO Box U-2, Prov RI 0299999.
Send fish food only - barter economy in place)

p.s. when a critic at a poetry conference in Russia called poet Ivan
Zhdanov "the first Russian postmodernist", Zhdanov broke a plate over
his head.  What say, Mandel?

e.
if it wasnt for photocopy, none of my
own work would have appeared in
print to date, & the same goes for

many poets I know. not self-promotion
but I think some of the best work
Ive seen circulates almost unseen
in our midst. wasnt going to say

anything about it until the project
was further along but Ive been working
clandestinely on a web site which
will be devoted mostly to the circulation

of self-published works & presses too
small to appear in SPD etc. the idea is
to make the work public, available for
trade or sale etc. its going to be coupled

with an ezine which will deal mostly
with the publications resident onsite but
really anything else too. what I mostly need
now I guess are people who would be

interested in participating. Ive got some
more work to do on the site but Im fast
approaching the point at which it has to be
opened up to contributors. that means books

etc that people would like to see posted there,
work, short essays, reviews. people are welcome
to come take a look at the site & then email
me with suggestions or material etc. the address is

http://choengmon.lib.utah.edu/~calexand/nonce/index.html
& you can reach me from there (or here). also Id
appreciate it if youd pass this information along to
people you know who publish their own work or

run very small presses or press collectives (like the
recently-announced newly-reconstituted SMALL
PRESS COLLECTIVE).

A refreshingly honest point of view on the snobbery/prestige issue.  Tell me
what you think of the Rothenberg/Norton Anthology though?  I think it its
important to set your "school" up against the traditions from which it draws,
an avant garde tradition let's say.  Doesn't the problem you outline make a
strong case for increasing student's sense of history in regards to poetry?
 I guess I found your comment about the naivete of the poet a little
flippant, but perhaps you did not intend it to be so.

More information would certainly help. I was under the impression that the
Amherst behemoth was in fact trying to do a good job in these areas, but
that may be outdated.

As an old academic disrupter it pains me to acknowledge that not all
protests make sense. A few years ago, when I was living down the road from U
Mass, a group of about 150 students occupied the deanery protesting the
school mascot, which is 'The Minuteman," whose picture, after the Daniel
Chester French, I think, statue, adorns teeshirts, etc., worn at football
games. This is "the embattled farmer" who "fired the shot heard round the
world" at Lexington and/or Concord. The gripe? It's a white guy with a gun.
That demo provoked a lot of clucked tongues and hysterical laughter. The
Minuteman still guards the bridge.

your jack spandrift sounds like a compatriot of mine -- missy laPrism.  missy
has an impressive resume -- she has not been included in the all the most
prestigious anthologies around.  norton sent flowers for weeks, had them
hand-delivered by the handsomest Bright Young Things in the intern department,
and even had some Bright Young Females in case they had got her all wrong...
and money, i won't even tell you!  but missy refused; no, she said, she had
to stand up for her principles.  she would not be included.  where, after
all, would her Rebel Outsider stance, her entire "i am uniquely underappreciated" position be?  and think of her career, based as it is on papers about the
real inside story of Boheme -- if she were anthologized, she would lose all
credibility.  she might even lose tenure, based, as it is on her distinguished
record of non-publication.  no, come what may, missy laPrism will not
anthologize...

Just a quick note to say that I found the article in question OK
(especially when judged in context with the others), but it does suffer
from an affliction that plagues a lot of NATION articles -- a kind of
"preaching-to-the-converted" laziness, so that one doesn't really know
anything new at the end, but already-formed biases and notions get
reconfirmed.

But Christopher Hitchens has been spectacular lately; check out his column
on Clinton (a month ago now), a masterpiece of invective, and the first
two paragraphs of his Mother Theresa column in this issue: it's just
politics, of course, but he has what they used to call "high style," and
it's very funny.

And David Levi-Strauss, whom some of you might know, has gotten a few
reviews published in THE NATION lately, as well, on Michael Palmer's
latest book and a book of letters from John Berger to his daughter; the
second, especially, I found very fine.

I too found the juxtaposition of Ammons and Levertov in Perloff's essay
quite illuminating, though there are differences in vocabulary, stance
toward subject, and line break that are not touched upon.  There were lots
of other wonderful moments in the piece too; as for Exact Change, her claims
will be more testable when & if Volume II comes out -- is that going to
happen or not?

However, Perloff's discussion of identity politics in that essay (as
elsewhere in Majorie's work) I find really quite disturbing.  It seems to me
that her attitude toward such issues exists in a tense relationship, to put
it mildly, with the surface pluralism of the piece.  (In this regard it's
interesting to find that her piece, for me, confirms some of my criticisms
of her work in the same issue of _Diacritics_.)

Anybody else want to juxtapose our respective contributions and see what
sparks fly?

Cheers,
David

Everything that allows men to become rooted, through

it as a conquering assertation. -- Maurice Blanchot

Bakker in Dinosaur Heresies proved conclusively not only that dinos were
not at all reptilian but in fact were not offed by an asteroid.  In fact,
multiculturalism did them in. It seems there was suddenly a land bridge
between the hemishpheres and wham bam all these diseases and unsavory
miscengenation extincted them.  The lesson here of course is to
give all your poetry not to stop stuff from outer stuff but
to Bennett's fight against the softening of traditional western
culture, pure and uncluttered. Thanks, Eric (ps Bakker did write that).

It's pleasing that my initial post on the coming asteroid caused so
many posts in return! That a first remark on impending,
irrevocable catastrophe would refine itself after 40 or so posts into
commentaries on a Chinese poet who composes in ethereal, invented
characters seems fitting and beautiful, even if I can't say exactly
why.

The universe imperceptibly corrects itself every so often without

This is Dodie Bellamy.  Again I "reach out" to the members of the poetics
list asking for brief reviews of recent small press books for an upcoming
issue of "Traffic," the newsletter of Small Press Traffic Literary Arts
Center.  This time the books in question don't even have to be recent, in
fact it would be great to get some reviews of neglected books, or
well-known books; whatever you feel like writing on--so long as it is or
was "innovative" of course!  When I say "brief" I mean circa 300 words,
that's not too long.  We want to have the next issue out in May, so the
deadline will be the end of April.  Is that too soon?  E-mail me back
channel if you're interested.  I'll be glad to be hear from you all.
Thanks everyone.

My new company, Periplum, released it's first CD, Suspended Music by Deep
Listening Band & Long String Instrument, earlier this year.  It's a really
great CD featuring the combined forces of DLB (Stu Dempster, David Gamper &
Pauline Oliveros) & Ellen Fullman's Long String Instrument performing
recent long works by Pauline Oliveros and Ellen Fullman. Other discs to be
released this year include the 2nd release by the collaborative group Land
(Jeff Greinke, Lesli Dalaba, Dennis Rea, et alia); New Songs commissioned
by David Mahler & Ann Obery from eleven US composers; and recordings of
interactive computer music by Martin Bartlett, including performances by
Peter Hannan, George E Lewis, & Frances-Marie Uitti.

We had a great CD party in Austin a couple of weeks ago with Ellen, and
there are more release parties on the way.  Hey, wait, here's some now,

Sorry about the message with this header showing up on the list. I've

My Eudora nicknames file is more screwed up than I'd thought when my

Having rubbed bellies with Ivan Zhdanov (literally: we were
attempting to move past each other at a very crowded party)
I can say from close up that he is much taller than I.

Fortunately we are in agreement on the subject and category called
post-modernism. It's a marketing term, like "crunch" or "classless."

BALLADE LITTERAIRE

I wanted to write.  I had it in mind
to astonish the world, with a vision quite new.
I memorized all the Great Verse I could find.
I measured, and metered, and rhymed a lot too.
I sent my work sailing to Kalamazoo,
and Great Neck and Austin and South Liverwurst...
kind Editors wrote back to ask - Who are you?
And one proverb stood by me.  Through every reverse.
The first shall be last - the last shall be first.

I saw my subjectivist Ego unwind.
I joined a Collective - they knew what to do.
We wrote for each other.  That Postmodern bind
of Theory and Action - l'Autre - c'est nu -
negativity - nebulous - transfigured - _blue_...
We Hugged and Supported.  Each Other we nursed.
Soon voluptuous Fame warbled..._Poetry! ooh!_
and read from a Book - with her lips pertly pursed:
The first shall be last - the last shall be first.

My peers were advising me - scrape through the rind
of conventional wisdom.  She just wants to screw.
So I went to the doorway.  Her boudoir was lined
(compacted, in fact) with a jostling crew
of suitors... New Critics, Old Masters - Langpo,
Beat, Formalist - Outsider, Insider - Cursed-and-
Blest - all Frustrated by that monotonous moo
glued on every last gallant (from fine-assed to worst) -
The first shall be last - the last shall be first.

I never made love to her.  Neither will you.
But I've mastered her mantra.  I've often rehearsed.
And if you want a glimpse - you'll whisper it too.
With lips pertly pursed (you should get undressed first).
The first shall be last - the last shall be first.

- Henry Gould

Subject:      Re: anthologies?

yes there is a clique mentality at work in anthologies, but you know,
there is clique mentality at work whenever two or more beings shall
gather in any name...

i'll do my usual ambiguous experiential fence-sit here: when i was a
kid, about 9, i found a poetry anthology in my brother's books, the
laurence perrine Sound and Sense, one of the early ones.  i remember
liking a few things in it, being fascinated enough to want to read but
not having quite the stamina yet.  i came back, periodically.  the
anthology worked perfectly as a vehicle for this, though to be fair,
it was a textbook, and that helped in that i got explanations for
things and historical notes.  i had a few books by individual poets,
but couldn't read them -- too much, too confusing.  the anthologies
gave me a chance to pick at particular poems, get a sense of how poems
work in general.  around the age of 15, i started being ready for books
of poems -- my first were sexton, plath, and dickinson.  and there lies
the rub: when i went back to the perrine in more of an age of reason, i
realized that there were almost no women writers in it.  almost no black
writers.  now, it was an old edition but still...

the norton, the massive compendium of about 1800 pages on thin thin paper,
was great in that i could find works that were referred to easily.  and i
could find work by authors whose names i came across right away, much of
the time.  BUT, again, BUT, women were grossly underrepresented, and, as
has been mentioned by someone else, what you read is the anthologist's
idea of a "great" poem.  often, with skilled anthologists, when i've gone
to complete works, i've agreed with the choices, but there have been
exceptions.  richard hart lovelace gets anthologized on the basis of lucasta,
to althea from prison, occasionally "The Grasshopper," and in a few (norton
is one), the gorgeous gorgeous "To Amarantha, that She Would Dishevel
Her Hair" ("Every tress must be confessed/ But neatly tangled at the best;/
Like a clue of golden thread,/Most excellently ravelled").

but what almost never gets anthologized, and which, when compared to the
well known lines of lucasta "I could not love thee, dear, so much/
loved I not honor more," is "A Loose Saraband."  Lucasta was written in
lovelace's early years, when he was a beautiful honored young man at court,
when Charles I presided with his family, when lovelace's life seemed to
open into a halcyon of family, honors, riches, glory... then came the civil
war, the massacres right and left, the despoilings, pillages, rapes.  it
has never been clear whether lovelace ever was a soldier, but he was put
in prison twice and his brothers fought.  he saw his family impoverished,
his future destroyed, his fortune confiscated... and then he wrote "A
Loose Saraband."  for a description of a country in a firestorm of civil
war, try, from the poem entreating a fellow drunk at a tavern to go off
and have sex, "See all the world how't staggers,/More ugly drunk than
we,/ As if far gone in daggers,/ And blood it seemed to be" and then,
in the final couplet, the wrenching (set in biographical/contextual frame)
"Now, is there such a trifle/ As Honour, the fool's giant?/ What is
there left to rifle,/ When wine makes all parts pliant?/ Let others
glory follow,/ In their false riches wallow,/ And with their grief be
merry;/ Leave me but love and sherry."

this poem doesn't make it into the anthologies -- i think because everyone
is so enamored of the image of the courtly cavalier poet that they don't
_see_ or want to see, or want to have as part of the writer, the bitter,
disillusioned, agony of the last years, as well as the no longer high
flown, but often more compassionate writings.  anthologies encourage quick
snapshots, easily tagged and sorted "representations."  all part of what
i hve railed on about before, the desire for Mastery OF All Texts.  if you
can sort, do quick and dirty and shallow summations of selection, you can
say you "Know" all about a writer.  i'd have less of Knowing All About
X or Y and how it Fits Into the Grand Critical Trend of the Blahblahblah
years, and more of a sensitive, deep, perhaps by necessity poet-by-poet,
analysis of bodies of text, with allowance given for much more complexity,
changes in feeling and opinion, effects of history...

all right, off my dull soapbox...

My friendly antagonist David Kellogg is "deeply disturbed" about what I
say about identity politics.  Sometimes I wonder if David reads what I
write.

What I say, for the record, is that, whereas in 1959 Don Allen could put
together an anthology of "the" new American poetry, an anthology that
pretty accurately pitted the counterculture against the establishment, in
the 1990s, there can no longer be ONE counterculture anthology and so
attempts to produce one that is "the" avant-garde can't wholly succeed.
And I write:
"More important: the eightiies witnessed the coming of the minority
communites. . . In their inception, many of these poetries were,
ironically, quite conservative so far as form, rhetoric, and the ontology
of the poem were concerned.  But counterculture poets and critics
couldn't--and still can't--say this out loud because they would have
immediately been labeled racist or sexist.  And thus the picture has
become increasingly clouded.  "  and then I go on to complain about the
absence of all but U.S. poets in most of the new anthologies.

Now David perfectly proves my point by implying I'm somehow making a
racist statement.  What I meant, of course, is that the mainstream
anthologies today like the Norton will include a lot of, say Rita Dove,
because she's a black woman when the Norton doesn't even include Zukofsky,
Reznikoff etc. not to mention Harryette Mullen, Erica Hunt, Will
Alexander, or Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, Lyn Hejinian--well, the list
goes on and on, right?  This is where identity politics does indeed cloud
the picture because if you object to these inclusions or exclusions you
are immediately branded.

I myself am "deeply disturbed"  that, at the moment, on this list, people
worry so much about what, say, Ed Dorn either said or didn't say and are
not deeply disturbed --it seems--by the erosion of all democracy in
Washington, where recent events make clear elected office or cabinet
appointments that need congressional approval mean less and less, the real
power coming only from those who can write a check for $100,000 at the
drop of a hat.  Clinton's remark that he just loves to listen to people
and get good ideas--that was deeply disturbing--since he obviously doesn't
listen to 99% of the population that doesn't have that kind of money.

The Left has recently written brilliantly on Clintonism--read Christopher
Hitchens, Alexander Cockburn etc.  But in the poetry world where post
"Reagan-Bush"  there seems to be no commentary on anything that goes on in
the White House, there has been a curious refusal to criticize.  How about
Clinton's demand yesterday that the Federal Government hire the welfare
people, whose money he cynically took away?  And now it turns out there
are no entry-level Federal jobs since he downsized the government just
last year.

What I'm trying to say, badly probably, because email is not the easiest
writing venue, is that, yes, I am opposed to identity politics in its
crude form  and no, that doesn't make me a racist, and if we want to be
political, let's be political and try to do something about what is
happening in Washington.

I agree with so much of what Marjorie Perloff has just said that my first
reaction is to NOT post anything that may merely reverberate like an "Aye" (as
opposed to a "Nay").  The problem--perhaps "my" problem-- is the dymanics of
e-mail interaction, so that when poet Dorn's remarks on race come up in
discussion, the "thread" resembles one of those hand-held aerosol canisters
that spray some kind of colored polymer goo more than it resembles a pattern,
as in a tapestry, etc.  The goo is fun but messy. Tapestries are useful and
ornamental.

If the list touches upon something like "the erosion of all democracy in
Washington" then the discussion, if it flourishes at all, will turn archival
and meditative, in diminutive posts, always going back to poets (& what they
may or may not have said) coeval with administrations of long ago.

People's sense of protocol differs; what wants to be included in the
discussion, disagreements about much. In a sense, the List epitomizes
democracy.

But generalizations are useless since most people signed on don't write
anything at all.

i'm struck by what marjorie is saying in her last post... i don't mean to
contribute to any vitriole here... but the problem goes back to this
question of judgment, as i see it... something that we hammer through on
poetix every now and again, but never seem to resolve... in part b/c it
*can't* be resolved for once and for all...

let me step back a moment, to an earlier variant:  while it's clear that
critics can now ask, fruitfully, what sort of cultural work is *done* by a
poem (or a novel, say, or whatever), it's likewise clear that this doesn't
resolve the judgment (quality) issues... i mean, to bracket the political
per se for just a second, it's constructive that we should be at odds over
our aesthetics per se... this is one aspect of what writers busy themselves
with when they're writing, for one... in such terms too---i don't always
scrutinize my politics first when i'm looking at my line breaks... which is
not to say that my line breaks are apolitical, but that perhaps my
aesthetic judgment is what's first and foremost, at times... even ex post
facto, for that matter...

at the same time, *as a teacher*, i find mself in a difficult situation
when my white male students bring in their more experimental writing, rife
with distended phalli, as exemplary moments in contemporary poetry... and
an even more difficult situation, as a white male, when i hear my
african-american women students voicing what sound like watered-down
versions of maya angelou's "phenomenal woman," a poem that clearly speaks
directly to their experience, as they see same... but is what's good for
the goose good for the gander?... if i rail against the unsubtle identity
gendering of male fantasy driven work, regardless how aesthetically
informed, then should i likewise rail against the unsubtle essentializing
of experience in the work of african-american women?... whereas the former
usually reinforces an existing power relationship, the latter seems on the
surface of things to act as a sort of corrective, at least short-term (i
set aside the fact that such poetry often positions its subject as an
object of male gaze)...

to flip things around, from a more nurturing pedagogical perspective:  do i
credit the aesthetic in the former, ignoring the more macho dimension?...
and do i credit the identity politics of the latter, and ignore the
aesthetic dimension?...

clearly, it seems to me, i need to do BOTH, somehow... i need to help
students grasp the gendering of the former, the ways the aesthetic at times
trivializes same, and the aesthetic simplicity-qua-simple identity of the
latter... i need to discuss both the sociopolitical/cultural *work* done by
the poems in varying communities, and the ways in which the aesthetics
*work* or don't in this process of meaning-making, of valuing and
revaluing... as contributors to this meaning-making process (along with
human beings, i mean), poems can work to produce mean-spirited de- and
connotations quite effectively, or well-intended de- and connotations not
so effectively (in tech. writing, incidentally, you can supplement
"mean-spirited" and "well-intended" with "inaccurate" and "accurate")...
but the field of meaning and possibility, the discourse of poetry, is such
that one's attention is (or should be) drawn not only to various
connotations, but to effectiveness (yeah, i'm slipping & sliding on a
form/content dualism here, and i'm using "effectiveness" itself to denote
aesthetic efficacy, but i trust i'm making my point)...

in any case, these are fraught waters, in the classroom and in other public
spheres... i don't mind saying *here*, anyway, that it's pretty easy to be
misunderstood when one slams the writing of a minority poet, however
justifiably... but i don't mind saying *here*, as well, that i've noted a
tendency at times on poetics to be down on more conventional work, even
more conventional work that, imnsho, is exemplary... i mean, marketplace
dynamics are one thing, aesthetics can be quite another... i can like the
best of all worlds, or try to...

incidentally, the new _chronicle_ has, as its back-page "point of view," an
article by simon frith, "john keats vs. bob dylan:  why value judgments
matter"...

best,

Joe, while I think what you say about teaching is very important and
interesting, I think you're talking apples and oranges here:  critiquing
undergraduates' shakey attempts at expression versus what gets included in
the Norton anthology (i.e., what is declared serious, important, of lasting
value).  Like nobody discusses what's included in the Whitney Biennial (or
however you spell that B word) in terms of pottery classes going on at
community colleges.  I get frustrated with the burdens literature has to
bear that nobody would place on visual art--or music.  I was at an arts
administration seminar recently on audience development and marketing, and
it started with everybody going around the room describing a particularly
memorable reading they'd been to (mine was James Schuyler's reading at the
SF Art Institute).  After each person talked, the facilitator extracted the
essence of what made the reading so memorable:  things like intimate,
emotional, musical accompaniment, made the audience feel good--even my
description of the Schuyler reading was reduced to these terms.  When the
list was completed with all these touchy-feely things, I rose my hand and
said that these things were fine, but that form was left out, that many of
my audience comes to readings to experience the formal pleasure of the
work.  She told me that if I thought form was important I would never
develop my audiences.  How funny that most of SPT's readings this past year
have been packed to capacity!

Most grants that I've seen are steeped in identity politics--like it would
be impossible to get any funding if you didn't write about your programming
in those terms.  There is immense pressure out there to maintain this
attitude which I think turns people into cartoons.  Like, would you like to
be known as Joe Amato, Working Class Writer?  Isn't that terribly
condescending?

Joan Retallack offers a wonderful, thoughtful, beautifully written critique
of identity politics (among other things) in
":RE:THINING:LITERARY:FEMINISM: (three essays onto shaky grounds)."
Unfortunately, I just read it from a xerox, so I don't know where it was
published.

dodie, i see your point... i'm finding it so very difficult to respond to
this issue w/o casting stones, as it were... and being my typical
long-winded self...

i bring up teaching b/c it's simply one public context in which i often
find mself... there are others, sure... let me say it this way:  i can see
marjorie's point, which i take to be your point --- that it's often
difficult as hell even to discuss matters of form, and that, perhaps partly
as a result, it's often difficult to be publicly critical of
minority/ethnic writers' work on the basis of form... of course this is a
function of audience, context...

but the same could be said for mainstream white guys' writing too... to be
critical of a white guy's conservative approach to form will not go over
big in many circles... albeit one might not be labeled a racist as a result
of such criticism... still, my point here is that it's one thing to concern
oneself with problems owing to critical reception (being viewed a racist,
say, b/c of one's critical response), it's another to suggest that problems
owing to critical reception stem from the formal tendencies of the writing
being critiqued... now i'm *not* saying anybody has said this, but it seems
to me that the intimation is present... if 'minority writing' is deemed
shallow, say, in terms of identity politics or formal innovation, this
doesn't mean that the writing itself is to be held accountable for (as
suggested) a certain reticence as to saying so... this reticence is more a
function of larger dynamics between communities, in which the writing in
question *as well as other such writing* (white guys' writing) does in fact
play a role...

so what's at issue here, as i see it, has still to do with the ways
different communities---poets and their critics, black white and
brown---come to the work... i mean, i still don't see, again, how we can
avoid both the matter of cultural work and the matter of aesthetics (which
latter we *can* discuss, as you suggest, in terms of the bias against
discussions of form as such)...

btw, as a white guy who grew up in so many ways in a working class
household (like you) i guess i don't mind so much that i should be so
associated... but i'd hate to be pigeon-holed as same, whatever this might
mean aesthetically (in fact i can't stand the thought of being pigeon-holed
aesthetically!)... so i see your point here... i suspect that my more
recent work, in fact, being both more conventional, more male-centered, and
more working class (and, dare i say it?, more marketable!) is likely down
the road to give me some real conniptions, critically... i mean, from
critics... it's already given my creative|critical side its share of
headaches...

Yes, _The Loom_ is one volume in a very impressive long poem series, from
an author who practically defines the term "prolific."

A very good overview essay on Kelly's massive oeuvre is by Patrick Meanor
in _Dictionary of Literary Biography:  American Poets Since World War II_
vol. 165.  It also contains a full primary and secondary bibliography.

This is a realy interesting discussion, and very intelligent on all

to an essay by Jed Rasula. My attempt was critical of certain early
langpo positions, and tho littered with grad school jargon I
was excited to spew at the time, I recall it raises soem issues (as
does Rasula's essay in his usual brilliant ways) that connect with
this new thread. Anyway, should anyone care to look, this is in
Sulfur 24. I vote for more people jumping in on this. This is

on the contrary, I think joe is articulating
a very real problem ["difficulty"] here,
viz. the unwillingness to separate ["the
attempt not to separate"] political, aesthetic,
& hortatory practice ["work"]. accepting
the sometimes contradictory political claims
of a left-guarde ["as opposed to right guard"]
modernism (not speaking for joe but for myself)
implies this kind of dilemma in teaching
writing, as does, more generally, an interest
in the cultural work of different writings. the
apples & oranges approach just doesn't make
sense to me; it seems to point up the basically
New Critical assumptions that underlie most
american creative writing workshops.

Joe:

I sympathize with you in both of your conundrums.

Regarding the first dilemma (good politics and bad aesthetics) :

What can you do with writing that is at the same time politically astute
or important and also the worst sort of kitsch?  Your painstaking
process of discussing "both the sociopolitical/cultural *work* done by
the poems . . . and the ways in which the aesthetics *work* or don't"
seems like the only reasonable way to treat the topic, better than an
easy dismissiveness based on either political or aesthetic grounds.

Regarding the second (exemplary conventional work):

The issue you raise is important, and deserves extended discussion on
this list.  Eavan Boland, widely considered to be both conventional and
exemplary, and now working among the Bay area's experimental community,
put the problem this way in a recent interview (forthcoming in the next
Notre Dame Review   http://www.nd.edu/~english/ndr/ndr.htm  ):

"The issue in poetry is not the multiplication of poetries.  It's the
fact that there isn't yet a language of respect between these poetries."

And the solution she advocates involves a painstaking process like that
you advocate for the first of your two dilemmas:

"I think one of the new tasks of workshops everywhere over the next
decade is going to be to widen their vocabulary not just to speak about
poetry, but to engage with, and develop a language of respect for the
energies of other communities and other ideas of craft.  The alternative
is just sterile division . . ."

This list seems like the right venue for notes toward such a language.

It will be a good interview to check out when it appears in the next
issue (and I'm not just saying that because I conducted it).

I applaud M. Perloff's post, bringing politix into the mix more directly
than it has been for some time on the list....I do feel that it's a
problematic challenge..As a socialist activist and a militant in the labor
movement since seventh grade (a very, very long time ago) I feel that it's
good that people on this list so often have a politix close to mine...
(The cultural-historical sociology of how the Left and the non-mainstream
poetry world have become intertwined, has yet to be written..)

But...if we address all the questions Marjorie brin gs up, will this
become primarily a listserv dealing with left issues?  For instance, I
could go on for the next eight screens, as to what I think "we," by which
I mean "the people of the U.s.", by which I mean the majority, who don't
vote for the republicrats, leaving it mainly to the far-right affluent to
vote, should do to address the political state of affairs she describes
quite well...It has to do with the structure of organizing, with dropping
single-issue and defensive struggles, and seriously facing issues of
organizational unity and putting forward a critique of the single
governmental machine (the Republicrat "party", which is not a party but a
voter-registration mechanism, as it is controlled by money and not by a
mass membership)...

But, obviously, I do value the list for its concern with poetry issues..At
least the other thread was about poets, and how they/we relate to racism
and violence (..altho' the latter two thirds of it kind of drifted away
from having much direct application to poetry, as things on the list will
do..) How we see politics as related to our work as poets or as people
concerned with poetry, is of course more germane.  That gets so intricate,
and so all-inclusive of most of my own day-to-day concerns, that it is
almost intimidating..

Dear Marjorie (and others who may be listening),

If I'm your antagonist, I am indeed a friendly one.  I neither intended to
nor in fact did imply that you were a racist.  I'm happy to read what you
wrote, however, though I'd enourage the same from you ;-).  I think we can
start to talk to (rather than past) each other.

So let's focus on the particulars you quote from your article:

> together an anthology of "the" new American poetry, an anthology that

OK fine.  Here I'm totally in agreement with you (and think the major
thrust of your argument quite on target).

First: "the eighties witnessed the coming of the minority communities."  I
honestly don't know what this means; I can't hold it in my head, it just
drains out between my skullplates.  Are you saying that there weren't
minority communities before the eighties?  Or just that there weren't
minority POETRY communites?  Or that these communities hadn't "come" (to
maturity, to coalescence, etc.)?  None of these interpretations seem to me
satisfying, because none of the assertions that result are, so far as I
can tell, true.  I'm not trying to bait you, honestly; I simply can't see
what that sort of generalizaion means, nor what its point is.

Second: "In their inception, many of these [minority community] poetries
were, ironically, quite conservative so far as form, rhetoric, and the
ontology of the poem were concerned.  But counterculture poets and critics
couldn't -- and still can't -- say that out loud because they would have
immediately been labeled racist or sexist."  Agreements: that many of
these poetries were conservative in the ways you mention.  Disagreements:
1) that this formal conservatism is ironic in any sense whatsoever; and 2)
that you can't say these poetries are conservative (etc.) without being
labeled racist or sexist.  I certainly labelled you neither, neither on
this list nor in my article.

You are reading into (as opposed to "not reading") what I wrote.  What I
wrote was that the pluralism of your approach is in tension with the
exclusivity of your actual critical practice.  This seems to me a
perfectly reasonable critique to make.  Sure I find this disturbing; but
not because I think you're a racist (I don't) -- rather, because of the
slippage that comes into play in passages like the one that follows:

> What I meant, of course, is that the mainstream

"Inclusions or exclusions."  This is not a symmetrical complaint.  The
complaint about exclusions is well taken, and I'm wholly on your side in
that struggle.  The complaint about inclusions is where I think your
pluralistic stance conflicts with your practice.  Mullen, Hunt, et al.
are not excluded because Rita Dove is included.  (Nor do I think it fair
to say that the Norton includes "a lot of . . . Dove, because she's a black
woman," barring evidence to support that assertion.)  Giving Dove less
space will do not one damn bit of good in making more space for Zukofsky,
Howe, or Bernstein.

1) identity politics: I do am opposed to "its crude form," but I think
such opposition must not be crude either;

2) that doesn't make you a racist.  Agreed (never thought otherwise);

3) politics: it's all over the place, both in Washington and in the poetry
community etc.  But I'd append also: If we want to do something about
excluded poetry, let's not act as though the currently included poets are
the problem.  If we want diversity, let's have diversity, and not some
revised Norton.

I don't really have any response to your comments on Dorn, because
(except for one moment at its inception) I did not really participate in
that thread.

I hope this is helpful in clarifying our disagreements.

David

Joe Amato's post was a great addition to the whole (very hard to get a
handle on) question, of what we are messing with, in relating poetry to
politix...As someone who is as far as can be from classroom and similar
situations, it's fascinating to hear from the trenches, about what comes
up in teaching situations regarding poetry...It strikes me that it
reflects much of what the rest of us are feeling, about how form and
politics inter-react; as if situations with students were sharper
crystalizations of what many of us are trying to come to grips with, who
don't teach..

As one who has written very little here, let me whisper a cheer for Marjorie Perloff's
last post in the "deeply disturbing" thread. As Joe Amato also intimated, much of what
seems to be happening on this list of late stinks of the worst type of judgment, i.e.
self-righteousness. Most of the Dorn/"deeply disturbed" discussion has come down to an
unfortunate and ill-conceived creation of binaries: form/content, right/wrong. Marjorie
Perloff makes a very apt point: those of us who dissent from "identity politics," or
more poetically speaking, from a poetics based only on one's identity (religion, race,
gender, etc.) set ourselves up for attack. I can flatly say that Maya Angelou is an
incredibly weak poet, on the grounds that her verse is systematic, formulaic,
reactionary, sentimental. Am I a racist? As a young member of the list (20s), I've had
to choke on these issues throughout my higher education. I left the Stanford graduate
program, where Marjorie Perloff teaches, because I knew that if I pursued my chosen
field (20th century American poetry, Objectivist, Black Mountain, New York, and Language
schools) I (male, white) would greatly restrict the possibilities of employment, i.e. my
"identity" did not succeed into the marketplace.

I don't know Dorn, but I respect and admire his poetry. I have no idea if he is a racist
or an anti-Semite. I think we had better consider some of the things that are going on
in Washington in an administration peppered with absolute base ignorance at best,
illegality at worst. I'm not arguing that a discussion of poetry need be political, but
when it becomes political it could at least consider larger issues that are critically
important to the mechanics of our society, not gossip relating to a poet who, to the
larger society, is an unknown.

Yes, I left graduate studies because I saw people (Gil Sorrentino for one) with real
convictions about the history and legitimacy of art crushed by the political weight of
the academy. Who wants to suffer through it? After all, great art should transcend these
things, politics in particular, and become something else. And that "something else" is
an irrational commodity.

robert and mark, thanx for your comments... and robert, i'll definitely
check out the next notre dame review...

and thanx to backchannel communique, i've been made aware that my example
of teaching glosses the sorts of resistance ALL students tend to have to
critique of form, and expression... this is true, and this complicates the
scenario pedagogically, illustrating the degree to which i exploit what is
in essence a stereotype... i like complications, hence i appreciate the
backchannel (thanx!)...

still, i don't think this fact alters the issue substantively, insofar as
the sorts of concerns i'm raising... i've been in situations where my
critical attitude toward both white and minority literatures has been
mistaken to mean that i'm opposed to minority literatures... i've also been
in situations where simply stating that i like, say, the work of sharon
olds (YES, i do) has been taken to mean that i'm opposed to or dislike the
work of less mainstream or less orthodox poets...

wrong on both counts... and mea culpa for those occasions that it's been ME
doing the "mistaking"...

fact is we're all, all of us, a product of our various institutions, to
varying degrees... and i can't imagine how this could not be the case...

best,

joe

Let me make my confession since everybody seems to be owning up to what
they admire or read. I find Harold Bloom's notion of agon, or the anxiety
of influence, hard to resist. I wouldn't put it in quite the Freudian
terms that he does, but I think that much of what we call creativity is
born in the "intentional" misreading of what has come before and what is
around right now. It is what I sometimes try to do with rhyme. I know it's
somewhat ridiculous to write couplets, but I am doing so in one poem
primarily because of the sense of absurdity it brings. I see the rhyme
scheme as some sort of dilapidated grid that tries to force the poem in
certain directions. Furthermore, there is an aleatory element to rhyming
that I find intriguing. As I list words to rhyme, I find my poem shoved in
directions I never anticipated. And sometimes that I don't even quite
understand. But damn, they sound good. At least to me! For anybody
interested in seeing this poem, it's called Joist and is at the Web
address below. I invite all backchannel comment.

Thanks,
Steven

Everything that allows men to become rooted, through
values or sentiments, in _one_ time, in _one_ history, in
_one_ language, is the principle of alienation which
constitutes man as privileged in so far as he is what he is,
[...] imprisoning him in contentment with his own reality
and encouraging him to offer it as an example or impose
it as a conquering assertion. -- Maurice Blanchot

A general catalog of writers' workshops would be beyond the scope of
SASIALIT (has anybody found such a catalog online, by the way), but
here's one that caught my eye:

Francis Coppola's Zoetrope organization is sponsoring a short story
writer's workshop in the mountains of Belize this July 8-15.  It sounds
like a great junket.  Info is available from 1-800-223-9832.

And I might as well mention where I heard about it.  I recently
received unsolicited the first issue of a new magazine of short fiction
started by Coppola and also named "Zoetrope".  It seems to be sort of a
vanity project, as Coppola writes in an editorial of the dreariness of
reading screenplays and his desire to revive the lost (?) art of the
short story.  A quick leaf-through of the magazine didn't reveal any
stories which grabbed me in particular, but the price is certainly
right:  subscriptions are free.

If you'd like to receive a sample copy, drop a line to:

        Zoetrope Short Stories
        126 Fifth Ave. Suite 300
        New York, NY 10011-5606

Now, to bring this back to the theme of SASIALIT: are there any writers'
workshops specializing in South Asian literature?  Or perhaps
"postcolonial" literature?  Or any good writing programs based in South
Asia?

I agree that this is an excellent essay! It is in a book called _Feminist
Measures: Soundings in Poetry and Theory_, edited by Lynn Keller and
Cristanne Miller. In the essay, Retallack calls for a "use theory" rather
than a "picture theory" of identity as communicated through language--a new
poetics to accompany new politics. She writes:

"A use theory of meaning, one that locates the making of meaning in a
collaborative engagement with interdynamically developing forms (rather
than in the interpretation of a fossil signified), allows exploration of
the medium of language itself, and thus the invention of new grammars,
where subject-object, master-mater relations can never be presupposed,
where nothing ever shrinks and stabilizes into an irresversible 'it.' The
picture is the prototypical 'it.'...What once flowed in all directions at
'once' is reduced to the servitude of the inanimate. In the picture all has
been isolated in space and stopped in time, reflecting not glorious,
multifarious (chaotic) reality, but the vanishing point of the
photographer's, painter's, or writer's single-point imagination."

If interested, check out the Keller-Miller book--they did a great job of
mixing what could be called "conventional" essays with essays that perform
their content, and thus test the limits of the genre. Also includes work by
Rachel Blau DuPlessis and M. Nourbese Philip, among others.

Subject:      Re: XEROX REVOLUTION

Does anyone recall how innovative clean and inexpensive Xerox copy
shops were in the seventies?  That was part of the premise of THE
POETRY MAILING LIST, which I put out with Kenneth Deifik in the mid-
seventies.  We published a one page poetry magazine. People were
still not used to spotless Xeroxes, and it often seemed like a
personal letter.

It had an immediate effect.  For instance, when I
asked Peter Schjeldahl for a poem, he told me that he had not written
one for a long, long time.  However, that night he found himself
writing DEAR ART OF VERSE, and he sent to me.  I Xeroxed it and put
it in about 300 hundred envelopes with Ken and out it in the return
mail.  Peter received many calls from people who thought he had
personally sent it to them, which I think he liked.

THE POETRY MAILING LIST created an unobstrusive focus on poetry.
Other poets and and artists included John Cage, Jackson MacLow, Lucio
Pozzi, Kathy Acker, David Shapiro, Beth Anderson, Jill Kroesen, Joel
Oppenheimer, and many others.

dear thomas (lecky), i *do* understand your decision to leave stanford (to
leave standford... wow!) on the basis of reduced job possibilities...

but please:  as a white male het (one having strong sympathies with that
olsonian line you mention), i must observe that your problems with the
academic job market, or most other job markets for that matter, do not
reduce to your identity... statistically speaking, it's other white guyz
whom you're losing out to, so to say... much as am i... this much is
verifiable...

and you're losing out, too, to a growing tendency to create part admin-part
faculty line positions, most with "writing" someplace in the job
description... which again is not a function of your, or anybody else's,
"identity" per se...

and you're losing out to the continuing, and perhaps growing, practice of
hiring adjuncts to teach courses instead of full-time, tenure track
faculty...

UNLESS, unless perhaps your field is, say, african-american lit, and you're
white?... knowing a few folks who are in this position, job placement is
undoubtedly at some level a function of identity politics...

which brings up another point about this thread:  i'm finding it difficult
as hell to articulate a position which is (please forgive me, marjorie) not
exactly marjorie's, but not exactly anti-marjorie's either... not exactly
david kellogg's, but not exactly anti-david kellogg's either...

that is, i'm finding it difficult to navigate these waters w/o finding
mself in the midst of various binaries, binaries that are themselves a
function, in part, of identifying [this or that]... in fact, i take this to
be confirmation of the sorts of public tensions raised when one attempts to
flush the aesthetic-political tangle...

best,

joe

i've read _zoetrope_ mself, and find the idea of coppola getting involved
in a literary mag intriguing, what with, e.g., william kennedy on the
masthead... i mean, coppola HAS made some great flicks, no?...

i don't necessarily share his desiderata (in that first issue) about the
short story, but he claims to be keenly interested in the written word...
so what the hell, then --why not?... i mean, for example:  in that first
issue, they reprint "the wisdom of eve," by mary orr... now this short
story was the basis for the film *all about eve*... personally, i love this
latter, and i find it fascinating to read the story and imagine its
transformation into film...

so as far as i'm concerned, if more hollywood types want to create more
fora that add to the flow, that's fine with me... it may well be -- i
assume this will be the case, based on this first issue -- that exposure
will be limited to more orthodox work, as is generally the case with more
mainstream pubs... but again---if the work published is exceptional, why
not?... i can't say that it'll 'squeeze out' in any way less orthodox work,
given that it seems to be coppola's money behind the mag... but let's wait
and see... and to be a bit crass about it (and i'm *not* just being
provocative here):  if they publish something of mine (i have every
intention of submitting short fiction), i'm going to find it really
difficult to complain...

Joe,

You've put forward some of the most interesting ideas on this whole thread.
Very sensitive and thoughtful -- I have learned a lot.

>which brings up another point about this thread:  i'm finding it difficult

>exactly marjorie's, but not exactly anti-marjorie's either... not exactly

You know, so am I ;-).  Actually, however, I think I'd take a position close
to yours regarding the job market.  Like you, I'm W-M-Het committed to
formally challenging poetry.  Probably among the twenty-one tenure-track
jobs I've come close to getting but didn't, some offers were made where the
applicant's gender, race, and/or investment in identity politics were at
issue. But so what?  I guess what I'm trying to say is that it would be easy
-- too easy -- to blame this situation on dominance of identity politics.
There are a lot of other factors at stake, including the funding of jobs in
general, resistance to contemporary work, resistance to the kind of
criticism/sociology/theory that I do (esp. with regard to contemporary
poetry), etc.

When Marjorie indirectly suggests that I'm too sympathetic to identity
politics, that I've somehow bought into the rhetoric of that whole line of
thinking, I want to laugh -- she should sit in on some of my interviews.

With regard to binaries, a crude opposition to identity politics that
assigns "it" (whatever "it" is) blame for whatever situtation (my lack of a
job, certain poets' exclusion from the Norton or some other standard
anthology) -- in their binary opposition, both submit to a zero-sum-game
view of poetic value.  If my poet's in, somebody else has got to leave.
There ain't room in this town . . .

Can't we get beyond that?

Cheers,
David

The Poets & Writers zine out on the bookstore shelves now has article on the
popularity of poetry. Haven't read it yet, but is probably the official verse
culture business as usual (Dana Goia is still worried about a downward trend).

i've been staying out of this one cuz it seemed like same old same old, but
i feel the need to ask: were identity politics *not* a part of what kept
women/folks of color *out* of the job market for so many years?  did we
invent identity politics? have they not always been a part of determining
who gets what?  why is it only a "problem" when normative identity's (ie.e
straight white male etc) normativity is called into question?  and for that
matter, why have "identity politics" suddenly become such anathema, as if
they were essentialist in nature?  compare income levels, education levels,
life opportunity levels of people of different "identities" and it seems
that there might actually be a need to talk about it.

david i don't see any reason why you should apologize for noticing that
there is social stratification in this country based on certain demographic
factors, and for thinking it might be not okay.  i *do* see a problem with
people's knee jerk reaction to attempts to talk about politics on this list.

Mark, I'll get numbers for Ian Patterson and Rod Mengham if they use them.
Meanwhile, you can try through me, as I'm partly involved and close by in

There are a few: I religiously read Musicworks (from Canada), Wire (from
England), and various stuff online, such as the ezine Juxtaposition.

I had a few pieces in Ear, long ago; it was a very cool magazine, and I
wish it had survived.

and more with which you qualified this, I know, as below and in later
posts, but:  1.  to you:  "exemplary moments in contemporary poetry"  ???

2.  in general:  Isn't it not just that you have to do both, as you answer
yourself, but that the macho dimension you're talking about and/or its
converses is actually informing the sense of what experiment is for and
is?  And that much as we may like messing about in the matter of our art,
doesn't "aesthetic" become limited to pretty reshuffle or stylistic
look-alike if that poetic matter isn't a vehicle for being able to see
anew in all senses?  My terms aren't rigorous here either, I just think
the question is important.

Oh, absolutely, I'm totally in agreement with you.  I guess I was using
"identity politics" in the narrower sense that Marjorie put forward, in
terms of something that has just emerged ("the coming of the minority
communities" etc.).  Of course, you're right, this very narrowing, or
exclusion of normative identity from the discourse, is part of the
political game that's played.

I'm not apologizing for that.  Fer sure.  I was thinking of certain kinds
of questions I get in interviews that are difficult to answer because of a
difference in vocabulary & critical syntax.  Not really worth going into
on this list, but -- to put it generally -- the repeated pattern of those
questions indicates how my work's failure to adhere to a certain
_disourse_ of cultural identity is taken in interviews to indicate
resistance to multiculturalism as such.  Which couldn't be farther from
the case, since my work is (in my estimation) as relativist as they come.

Cheers,
David

it seems to me that it would be better to do away with the Norton and just
work to develop a consensus around demystifying anthologies (there is no
one anthology nor should there ever be one or one that pretends to be one)
than to fight to get token language poets into the Norton (the old Norton
obviously I don't mean Paul Hoover's Norton: I mean it is nostalgic even
to worry about some anthology claiming to be central): teachers do tend to
want anthologies but it gets less and less likely that they can claim to
be covering modern poetry by using any anthology

On what are these estimates based? They seem pretty high to me, but
perhaps they are accurate?


Charles, et al. The figures in Pw about sales of some poetry books were
given to us by the publishers, i believe, though douglas messerli could
probably say if that isn't so.

What follows is the Publishers Weekly article itself, not quite a final
version i believe... it appeared in March 3 issue. And thanks to some of
the listfolk who got involved in a discussion with me prior to the writing
of this piece; it was written by a woman named Mallay Charters, and I
assigned and edited.


THE DIFFERENT FACES OF POETRY
"No one listens to poetry," complained the 1950's San Francisco poet
Jack Spicer.
 While it still hasn't stormed the bestseller lists, at least today poetry is
enjoying its broadest hearing in recent years. The sales climate is
warming, greater numbers of books are being published, and more and
more poetry-related events are popping up in the press. Says Bill
Wadsworth, the Executive Director for the Academy of American Poets,
"Poetry was strong in the culture in the 1960s and 70s, but by the
mid-80s it had been eclipsed by commercial art, glitz.
Since 1990 there's been a complete turnaround?people started looking
for more than junk food."So what kind of poetic fare is in the offing?
Certainly, there is something to please most every palate, from the most
traditional to the most avant-garde. Poetry in America is a diverse, highly
contested field, crowded with a variety of practices and philosophies,
none of which lend themselves easily to generalizations. How, for
example, to classify Rafael Campo, an acclaimed gay Hispanic poet who
writes often in formal verse? Or Allen Ginsberg, still as radical as in the
heyday of the Beat movement, but also one of the most famous?and,
relatively speaking, wealthiest?poets of his time? As literary critic and
Stanford professor Marjorie Perloff points out, "Thirty years ago you had
the establishment?Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop?and the
counterculture. Now you have endless overlapping, dispersed groups.
There is no one movement; rather, there are many movements."The
landscape of poetry publishing itself reflects and promotes this
heterodoxy. The number of small presses in America has grown
precipitously in the last three decades, fueled in part by advances in
desktop publishing. The 1,127 volumes of poetry produced in 1996 were
the offerings of a staggering 463 publishers, the majority of them
independent and small presses. In such a climate, it is not hard to
understand why there is no single poetic center of gravity, be it
aesthetic, ideological, or even geographical.Buying patterns reveal a
corresponding breadth of taste. "The poetry-reading audience has
probably never been larger... or more decentralized and fragmented,"
says Poets House Executive Director Lee Briccetti. The "establishment"
poets?those writers championed by the leading critics and literary
magazines?predictably sweep the prestigious awards, but their sales
that edge on their lower-profile brethren, from the avant-garde to the
multicultural, are less dramatic. Where Ecco Press reports sales of 8500
for 1995's The Dream of a Unified Field, the selected poems of Pulitzer
Prize-winner Jorie Graham, Curbstone Press can claim sales of 9000
copies of Poetry Like Bread, their 1993 anthology of leftist multicultural
writings; Sun & Moon estimates 4000 copies sold of language poet
Charles Bernstein's 1995 Dark City; and Incommunicado Press reports
5000 copies sold of punk rock poet Dave Alvin's 1995 Any Rough Times
Are Now Behind You. "We're in a period of ferment," says Herb
Lebowitz, editor of the poetry journal Parnassus. "There is no dominant
voice, there is no dominant school, and in a way that's healthy for
poetry."Certainly the relatively level playing field generates some
interesting intrapoetry sparring. One of the most controversial
movements is experimental poetry, particularly the segment that grew out
of the so-called "Language" poetry of the 1970s and 80s. Hailed
alternately as the future of poetry and a poetic dead end, Language
poetry is dense, quirky, intellectual, and above all politically and
stylistically radical, trading in the traditional poetic voice in favor of verbal
collages and suggestive sentence fragments."We wanted to keep the
language moving, changing and shifting, so it didn't become a dead
thing," says Doug Messerli, who became involved with Language poetry
while a graduate student in the 1970s and who now runs America's
largest publisher of experimental writing, the Los Angeles-based Sun &
Moon Press. In June Sun & Moon will bring out Republics of Reality, the
latest collection by Charles Bernstein, who, with Bruce Andrews, is
considered one of Language poetry's founders (they co-edited the
journal L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, from which the movement derived its name)
Other current writers closely associated with Language poetry include
Susan Howe, Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman, Bob Perelman, and Leslie
Scalapino, plus younger experimental writers such as Mark Wallace,
Juliana Spahr (editor of the journal Chain), Lee Ann Browne (whose Sun
& Moon collection Polyverse is due in May) and Rodrigo Toscano (a
Chicano writer whose Sun & Moon collection The Disparities is due in
August.)Good samplings of current Language and experimental writing
can be found in the anthologies The Other Side of the Century:
1960-1990 (Sun & Moon) and Postmodern American Poetry (Norton). In
1997 Incommunicado plans to publish Tense Present, an anthology of
West Coast Language and avant-garde writers.Other experimental
presses include Black Sparrow, Roof Books, O Books, Wesleyan and
Pittsburgh University presses, and the SPD-distributed Kelsey St., Tender
Buttons, Burning Deck and Hanging Loose. Sun & Moon's annual
Gertrude Stein Awards in Innovative American Poetry is Messerli's
"alternative" to Scribner's more traditional annual, The Best American
Poetry. (Says Messerli with cheerful resignation, "Innovative poetry
always gets excluded, and that has always been the way.")Language
poetry has found a warm reception in academic circles. Says Perloff,
"We recently invited Susan Howe to Stanford, and the reception was
just wonderful. That really encouraged me, and it seems to me that that's
the direction that poetry is going."In other quarters, it has raised hackles.
"Language poetry is highly personal, it's highly narcissistic, and it turns
its back on the audience," says Robert McDowell, the publisher of Story
Line Press. McDowell has conceived a rather radical response to what
he sees as contemporary poetry's inaccessibility to the general reader.
His press promotes the work of the so-called New Formalists, who use
traditional verse forms like rhymed couplets and sonnets and often tell
stories in their poems. "Narrative," says McDowell, "allows one to put
together all the elements of both poetry and storytelling to create a more
extended creative form." Prominent New Formalists include Dana Gioia,
Brad Leithauser, and Mary Jo Salter, all of whom are included in Story
Line's 1996 anthology Rebel Angels: 25 Poets of the New Formalism,
edited by Mark Jarman and David Mason. The New Formalists are also
showcased in the Hudson Review, a poetry journal edited by Frederick
Morgan. New Formalism itself has not been immune to criticism: says
Harvard professor and New Yorker critic Helen Vendler, "It's kind of a
red herring?some of our best poets, like James Merrill and Elizabeth
Bishop, wrote in both free and formal verse. It's not like it's an article of
faith or a dogma."The vigor of the current spoken word/performance
poetry scene owes much to Miguel Alarin and Bob Holman's "Poetry
Slams" at New York City's Nuyorican Poets' Cafe. The movement has its
roots in the theatrically charged 1960?s writings of Allen Ginsberg and
African American writers Amiri Baraka andGwendolyn Brooks, and in
the 1970s the movement received additional impetus from poet David
Antin's creation of the "talk poem." At a Nuyorican slam, poets recite their
work and are then rated numerically by randomly selected audience
members, although they are warned ahead of time that "the best poet
always loses." (The poems are anthologized in Holt's 1994 ABA-winning
Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets' Cafe.) Currently there are slams
in over 30 cities advertised in 10 spoken-word newsletters. While the
movement's vigorous, in-your-face style has brought poetry to the MTV
generation, it receives scant respect in many sectors of the poetry
industry. Louise Solano, the owner of the Grolier Bookshop, an all-poetry
bookstore in Cambridge, Mass., spoke for many whom PW interviewed
when she said that "I consider 'poetry slam' a contradiction in terms.
That's not poetry?they're spoken-word performances. True poetry is
about language, and it's meant to be read."Holman sees it otherwise. He
is currently on leave from hosting slams to work at Mouth
Almighty/Mercury Records, which he calls the "world's first poetry label,"
devoted exclusively to publishing albums of spoken-word
performances."What people don't realize is the number of books that
have been released through the generation that came through the slam,"
he says. "I don't see any other generation that has penetrated the
publishing or music business the way that this crew has." Nuyorican
Poets' Cafe alums include Paul Beattie (published by Penguin and
Houghton Mifflin), Willie Perdomo (Norton), Hal Sirowitz (Crown), Dana
Bryant (Boulevard) and Holman himself (Holt). Cafe alums with
spoken-word CDs include Reg E. Gaines (who also wrote the book for
the current Broadway hit Bring in ?Da Noise, Bring in ?Da Funk), Edwin
Torres, and Maggie Estep, whose second album, Love Is a Dog from Hell,
is due from Mouth Almighty in April. Mouth Almighty also recently
released Allen Ginsberg's The Ballad of the Skeletons, which was an
MTV Buzz Clip, and the soundtrack to Holman's 1996 PBS series The
United States of Poetry (the tie-in book is available from Abrams).The
spoken-word movement is closely allied with multicultural poetry. Miguel
Alarin himself was a leading figure of the Nuyorican movement of the
1970s, which established a literature of Puerto Rican identity, and is
currently an Arte Publico author. The prominent Hispanic poets Jimmy
Santiago Baca (published by Curbstone Press) and Victor Hernandez
Cruz (Coffee House Press) are also performance poets, as is the
African American poet Wanda Coleman (Black Sparrow). The connection
is partly an outgrowth of multicultural and spoken-word poetry's shared
roots in the radical political tradition of Baraka and Brooks; for certain
African American writers, it is also a reflection of the importance of jazz
and blues both as artistic heritage and as source of poetic rhythms."In
black poetry, we have always been very close to the musicians and the
music," says Haki Madhubuti, the publisher of the Chicago-based Third
World Press, America's largest African American press, who also plans
to begin "publishing" CDs this year. Madhubuti, who founded the press
30 years ago with $400 and a mimeograph machine, is the exclusive
publisher of Gwendolyn Brooks, and has also published Gil Scott-Heron
and Sonia Sanchez. His poetry titles for 1996 included The Sandman by
Sterling Plumpp, whose work was included in The Best American Poetry
of 1996. Other African American writers have found homes at a variety
of presses, large and small. Reginald Shepherd, a prize-winning gay
poet whose work has been singled out for praise by Vendler, published
his most recent collection, Angel Interrupted, in 1996 with the University
of Pittsburgh Press. Nathaniel Mackey, whose poems draw on African
rituals, folk wisdom and jazz rhythms, publishes with Sun & Moon and
Coffee House. Former Poet Laureate Rita Dove publishes with Norton.
Forthcoming 1997 African American poetry titles include Sonia
Sanchez's Does Your House Have Lions (Beacon, Apr.); Maketa Grove's
Red Hot on a Silver Note (Curbstone, May); Dark Eros, an anthology
edited by Reginald Martin (St. Martin's,Aug.); The Collected Poems of
Audre Lord (Norton, Aug.); Last Chance for Tarzan Holler, by MacArthur
Award-winning Thylias Moss (Persea Books, Sept.); and From the
Devotions, by NBCC Award and Lambda Award finalist Cary Phillips
(Graywolf, Nov.).In Hispanic poetry, notable presses include Curbstone
Press, Bilingual Press, Arte Publico, and White Pine Press.Curbstone,
founded in 1975 by Sandy Taylor and his wife, Judith Doyle, promotes
Latino and Chicano writers and publicizes human rights abuses in
Central America. Says Taylor, "We publish poetry that is accessible, and
deals with human issues in daily life, like poverty and political
oppression." Curbstone's authors include NBCC Award-winning Puerto
Rican poet Martin Espada (whose fifth collection, Imagine the Angels of
Bread, will be published by Norton in April); experimental Latino poet
Juan Felipe Herrera; and Daisy Zamora, featured on Bill Moyers's 1995
PBS series, The Language of Life. Set for April publication is Song of the
Simple Truth: The Complete Poems of Julia de Burgos.Bilingual Press and
Arte Publico are both active in the flourishing Southwestern Chicano
literature scene, which began in the 1960s in the context of the Chicano
civil rights movement. Says Bilingual Press managing editor Karen Van
Hooft, "U.S. Latino poetry is a very active field?there's a lot of publishing
going on, and the best-known poets are in a lot of demand for
appearances and readings." Bilingual Press published prominent Chicano
poet Alurista's Et Tu... Raza? in 1996, and has previously published
Espada, Puerto Rican poet Judith Ortiz Cofer and Demetria Martinez, who
is included in their popular anthology Three Times a Woman: Chicana
Poetry. Arte Publico is home to the experimental Miguel Alarin, and
published Rafael Campo's first collection, The Other Man Was Me, winner
of the 1993 National Poetry Series' Open Competition. Forthcoming 1997
collections by Hispanic writers at other houses include the paperback
edition of Chicana writer Pat Mora's Agua Santa: Holy Water (Beacon
Press, May); Chicano poet and National Book Award finalist Gary Soto's
Junior College (Chronicle Books, Apr.); and Mexican poet Jose Emilio
Pacheco's City of Memory and Other Poems, a bilingual edition from City
Lights (Apr.).A notable independent publishing house with a broadly
multicultural list is Minneapolis's Coffee House Press. Says publisher
Allan Kornblum, "We still publish as many white writers as ever, but our
growth has been in the multicultural area." Coffee House poets include
Adrian Castro, an Afro-Cuban writer who came out of performance
poetry; Native American writer and NBCC-finalist Linda Hogan; and
African American writer and NBCC-finalist Quincy Troupe, whose
collection Avalanche appeared last spring. On Coffee House's upcoming
publishing schedule is Drawing the Line (Apr.) by Japanese American
poet Lawson Fusao Inada, and Sacred Vow, a bilingual collection by
Cambodian poet U Sam Oeur. "One of my goals as a publisher is to
expand the sense of what we mean when we say 'we,' " says
Kornblum.A trend among some ethnic poets is a growing dissatisfaction
with the category "multicultural" itself. Reports Sun Young Li, associate
editor at the experimental, New York City-based Asian American
publishers Kaya Publications: "All of our poets are moving beyond the
issue of identity. It's a phase people have to go through, but it's ultimately
limiting. The writers at Kaya are much more concerned with aesthetic,
literary and political issues." Kaya's 1995 anthology Premonitions
included gay and lesbian, Buddhist, Language, Vietnamese American,
and Korean American poets, and was intended as a counterpart to
Doubleday's more traditional The Open Boat: Poems from Asian America
(1993).A similar theme is voiced by certain lesbian and gay writers.
Mainstream poets such as Adrienne Rich (who is published by Norton)
and Mark Doty (HarperCollins) dominate book sales and literary awards,
while their experimental counterparts struggle for reviews and shelf
space. "If you're gay and avant-garde, you suffer from a double
invisibility," says Eileen Myles, who recently edited The New Fuck You,
an anthology of gay and lesbian writing from Semiotext Press. On the
other hand, notes Myles, moving beyond the expected has its rewards.
"What's really exciting is that we're in this atmosphere of no 'nos.' Who's
driving the car of the culture? Me, you? There's such a sea of
possibilities."Myles herself is associated with the experimental New York
School, which was developed in the 1950s by the poets John Ashbery,
Kenneth Koch, James Schuyler and Frank O'Hara. It is identified with a
casual, spontaneous style, a foregrounding of personal material and an
urbane wit and sophistication. Second-generation New York School
writers include the late Ted Berrigan, Ron Padgett, Alice Notley and
Bernadette Mayer. (Myles's latest collection, School of Fish, is due from
Black Sparrow Press in April.)Upcoming gay and lesbian poetry titles for
1997 include Things Shaped in Passing: More 'Poets for Life' Writing from
the AIDS Pandemic, edited by Michael Klein and Richard McCann (Persea
Books, Mar.); Telling Things, by Michael J. Rosen (Harcourt Brace, Apr.);
Selected Poems: Revised and Enlarged by Robert Duncan, also
associated with the Black Mountain School (New Directions, Apr.); Cold
River, by Joan Larkin (Painted Leaf, Oct.); and Beautiful Signor, by Cyrus
Casselly, winner of the Poetry Society of America's 1994 William Carlos
Williams Award (Copper Canyon, June). Recently published titles include
an expanded, bilingual edition of Colombian poet Jaime Manrique's My
Night with/Mi Noche Con Federico Garcia Lorca (Painted Leaf).Several
major Beat poets are still actively publishing. In May New Directions will
bring out A Far Rockaway of the Heart, by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, a
follow-up to his 1958 classic, A Coney Island of the Mind, as well as two
new selections of the work of Denise Levertov. Black Sparrow will
publish Ed Sander's 1968 in June (and, in March, Bone Palace Ballet, a
new collection by recently deceased L.A. literary icon Charles
Bukowski). In November, Hanging Loose Press presents Hettie Jones's
Driver Lover Witness Woman. Prominent 1996 Beat titles included Allen
Ginsberg's Selected Poems 1947-1995 (HarperCollins) and Gary
Snyder's Mountains and Rivers without End (Counterpoint).America's
"establishment" poets have, of course, significantly participated in and
contributed to the aesthetic currents animating the other poetic
schools.Jorie Graham, for example, writes poetry with some
philosophical affinities to the work of John Ashbery. (Ashbery himself,
probably America's most celebrated experimental poet, publishes with
Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Knopf and Ecco Press.) Knopf's Anne Carson
incorporates prose sections into her work, stretching the conventional
definition of a poem. And Farrar, Straus & Giroux's August Kleinzahler
writes in a direct, colloquial voice that is a far cry from the formal diction
and abstruse vocabulary of traditional "high" poetry. What sets
mainstream poetry apart from other forms is its reliance on a coherent
central viewpoint, or "I"; its largely conventional syntax; and its generally
muted political stance. It has also been criticized by poets such as
Adrienne Rich for resisting ethnic voices.But Jonathan Galassi, the
editor-in- chief of FSG argues that a poet doesn't have to be explicitly
"experimental" to be progressive. "You can have new things in old
boxes," he says. "Sometimes the poets that seem the most traditional are
actually the most innovative."FSG's poetry program includes Nobel Prize
Laureates Seamus Heaney, Derek Walcott, Joseph Brodsky, Irish poet
Paul Muldoon (whose new collection, Kerry Slides, was published by
Dufour Editions in February), Gertrude Schnackenberg, Charles Wright
and C. K. Williams. FSG?s 1997 titles include Black Zodiac, by Lenore
Marshall Award-winner Charles Wright (Apr.);the paperback of last
year?s hardcover editon of The Figured Wheel: New and Collected Poems
by Robert Pinsky (Apr.); and Desire, by Frank Bidart (Sept.).Norton
boasts the likes of two-time NBA-winner Stanley Kunitz, Gerald Stern,
Rita Dove, Stephen Dunn, Martin Espada (see above), A. R. Ammons
(whose new long poem Glare is due in July), and Maxine Kumin (whose
Selected Poems is due out in May) on its poetry list. Says editor Carol
Houk-Smith, "I publish what I love, and I don't think about schools at all."
Norton editor Jill Bialosky, whose authors include lesbian writer Marilyn
Hacker, Irish writer Eavan Boland, James Lasdun (whose collection
Woman Police Officer in Elevator appeared in February), says she is
especially pleased to be bringing second books by Janet Sylvester (The
Mark of Flesh, June) and Marie Howe (What the Living Do, Nov.) in 1997.
"Unlike in fiction, where it is often the first novel that is really exciting, it
takes a little bit longer for a poet to establish him or herself," she says.
"Usually by the second or third book you begin to see an audience for
that poet." (Bialosky is also a poet in her own right; her first collection,
The End of Desire, is due from Knopf in March.)Knopf editor Harry Ford
finds that author appearances are the best way to promote their poetry
books. "We ask poets to read for us as much as possible," he says. "We
don't tour them like a big-time author, because we just don't have the
money, but there are many cities that welcome poets and have reading
series." Knopf's list includes W. S. Merwin, Donald Justice, and Lucie
Brock-Broido; in February they published Edgar Bowers's Collected
Poems and Marge Piercy's What Are Big Girls Made Of?, and in October
they will release The Collected Poems of Amy Clampitt.Ecco Press has a
heavily international list?Louise Gluck, Poet LaureateRobert Hass, James
Tate, Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer and Czech poet Czeslaw
Miloz?to rival that of a major publisher, even though it is an independent
press, located in Hopewell, N.J. Publisher and poet Daniel Halpern argues
that there are advantages for poets to working with a smaller house:
"We try to publish poets continuously, book after book, which is
something the bigger houses don't always do." The sentiment is echoed
by Sam Hamill, the publisher of Copper Canyon, one of the few presses
in America devoted exclusively to poetry. Says Hamill, "In New York
publishing, the poetry is at the very bottom of the list. We felt that if we
could produce a beautiful edition of something and keep it at a
reasonable price, we could keep it in print longer." Copper Canyon's
eclectic list includes Hayden Carruth, the Pulitzer Award-winning Carolyn
Kizer and Greek poet and Nobel Laureate Odysseas Elytis.Not everyone
associated with establishment poetry is defensive when questioned
about the relative lack of experimental and ethnic writers in the
mainstream. Wadsworth, whose academy administers some of
America's biggest poetry prizes, has sometimes been accused of being
part of an "official verse culture," but it doesn't bother him. "When the
academy was founded [in 1934], the whole point was to take some
poets who were not established and establish them," he says. "If we've
succeeded in that, we're glad. The misconception is that we're in some
kind of competition with people who are not established."Myles, for one,
is optimistic that today's open climate will eventually bring poetry's more
marginal movements greater recognition. "The big houses are starting to
look to the small houses for inspiration," she says. "And that's good
news for everyone."

     It would also be interesting to hear your own critical summary of what
you wrote in Sulfur.
     Below are some (extremely lengthy) thoughts. Perhaps I am only saying
what others have already said. At the same time I think the "deeply
disturbed" discussion might suffer from a lack of any agreement on terms.
More or less, I think anthologies are extremely useful, only they might be
(and often are) compiled for reasons we (you or I) disagree with, and are of
course influenced on a more general level by dominant ideologies, which in
fact they more reflect than create.
     I think that multi-culturalism, which is not only dramatized in recent
marketing trends concerning the creation of anthologies, and which is also
similar to anthologizing on the more profound level of method, is also much
too useful to be scorned, but in fact does not provide a very stable support
for any view of the world above and beyond immediate political situations:
in short, is not very revolutionary in the Marxist sense.
     I think it is important to try to keep a connection between poetry and
politics and have tried to do so when possible.

   Perhaps one reaon for this is that the compilers of these anthologies
want to classify thier subjects, and to keep the boundary lines neat.
Lovelace, as you describe him, writes during a period of intense political
and aesthetic upheavel: the bougeoise coup-de-grace of aristocratic power, a
shift in the make-up of the dominant class (perhaps make-up is not a good
word, since they all wore so much of it!?) which eventually becomes
reflected in poetry in the shift from courtly poetry to Romanticism. If
Lovelace was neither particularly progressive (as, say, Arnold or Whitman),
or particularly reactionary (as, say, Spenser or Milton), then it becomes
very difficult to decide on which side of the aesthetic he is to be placed.
Even anthologies claiming to provide an overview of "Literature in English"
always feel compelled to enforce certain groupings. Every "chapter" begins
with a pity little argument about why they have choosen to start the section
about the 1800's in 1789, or etc. Poor L-l. straddles the fence, as it were,
and so one half of his ouevre must be lopped-off in order to make him fit
without the aesthetic bounds (or at least to keep him from appearing "out of
place.")

     I remember from college the frustration of trying to understand these
groupings in the face of the poetry itself. It would all make sense in the
survey class, but back in the dorm I'd wonder: but HOW is this Victorian
verse (or what have you)? And it was never easy to pin it down. More than
most, Blake causes trouble, since you might pick up those anti-proverbs, for
example, and have no great difficulty in determining thier approximate date:
if I remember correctly Norton somewhat acknowledged this difficulty by
using Blake as the "dividing line" between the two volumnes of their
standard collection.
In this way, I agree that:

>anthologies encourage quick
>snapshots, easily tagged and sorted "representations."

     This is indeed the problem I have with them. And I have a similar
problem with identity politics, which none the less do much, imo, for
equality. However I have a couple thoughts: like anthologies identity
politics, as practiced, say, in hiring demographics, assumes a very easy
form of representation. One is either male or female, black or white,
opressed or un-opressed. This series of opposites arises from a priori
categories of sex or race that have been put in place and are still assumed
to be "natural." In other words, the fact that your sex is largely
determined by societal norms is ignored. Judith Butler, would, I believe, be
the most frequently cited source of these ideas. I wish I could remember the
name of the essayist and performance artist (and professor, and etc.) who
has a video work in the Chicago Contemporary Arts Museum in which she sits
at a desk and, looking directly into the camera, addressing "whites", proves
step by step that on a scientific, emperical level, regarding blood and
genes, they are part black; she then addresses issues of minority hiring
("Why don't you tell that to your boss? Your co-workers? You could get that
minority scholarship. Afterall, you are part black. Why deny this fact? Why
do you not admit it to yourself?"), etc.
     The "problem" with identity politics, as I see it, is a matter not of
what it does now, which is basically a good thing, but where it leads, what
channels of thought it sanctions, which ones it diverts from a public
discourse. For example, even though I.P.'s is mostly concerned today with
helping people to get jobs, it suggests a view of the world in which people
are not viewed in terms of their class-relationships and economic positions,
which I think is a dangerous thing to do because it only shifts the burden
of the problem--and does not solve the problem itself. It transforms class
solidarity into ethnic solidarity--and that is a shame because those two
solidarities in no way cancel each other out and might instead be combined
for greater effect, as the Black Panthers proved for a little while.

     Thank you for reading this far.

     Finally, I said in the beginning, "in the Marxist sense" and have tried
to carry my crude understanding of these politics on my sleeve through the
above--my point now being that anthologies are less offensive when they
state what and which and who they intend to represent (many posts have come
while I was writing this that have contained versions of this)--then when
they claim to represent an over-arching range.

     Ultimately this form of representation, ever dividing itself into small
and more detailed parts (like Borges book in the Babylonian library, with
pages so thin each page is two clinging toghether--into infinity [I've often
thought Norton's was after this effect]) leads to a decline in usefullness,
since much of that usefullness is in fact based on discrimination, which is
obviously a form of representation, and the more detailed representation you
get the less discrimination you have. And since anthologies are in point of
fact not people, it is acceptable to say of them: at what point do I
consider them useless? At what point do they stop being collections are
begin to simulate archives? How far will they go on including before I am
just as well off reading the individual books?

     Perhaps this sounds as though I am suggesting that minorities write
less "good" poetry: I in fact belive quite the opposite, as it seems to me
that our present historical situation in this country, and in the world, is
more attuned to minority representation than before, and that this leads to,
on the whole, better representations. However, about THAT whole issue--the
connections between clearly defined representation and aesthetic quality--we
would need another thread.

     Thanks for enduring.

Speaking as a finishing MFA candidate at UC Irvine, all of us teaching the
undergraduate introductory poetry writing course usually utilize an
anthology _in addition to_ frequent handouts.  Another common practice is to
put a homemade anthology pieced from magazines, individual books of
poetry, and anthologies on reserve and let students copy from that.  But
we have the freedom to design our own syllabi and to select our own texts;
I doubt this is true across the board.

Probably a very useful point to make...Many of us here are clearly
involved with small and alternative publishing ventures that direct
energy/attention away from large institutional/monumental power-nodes,
like The Anthology......Some of us (like me) tend to continue to think of
anthologies, in this large resonant sense, as important because we grew up
with NAP and other exemplars..But it is argueable that everyone, including
teachers, might usefully turn away from "tomes" to more fugative texts, as
a basis for evaluation/debate/struggle over what we want our poetries to
become...(On the other hand, I would hate to see a bad financial return
for those who have made the effort/gamble to put out alternative anthology
projects--Hoover's, but the several major anthologies from Sun & Moon
especially, recently...)
        It would also need to be said that there are anthologies and then
there are anthologies...The ongoing Rothenberg project of
reconceptualizing the structure, scope and function of the form, is
something else again; that is the other approach: not to abandon
anthologies but to radically redo their meaning and identity...

     This is some of the "problem" of identity politics I was trying to
describe near the tedious end of my last post:

> Poetry in America is a diverse, highly

>none of which lend themselves easily to generalizations.

     Absolutely true, or as Joseph Lease says, "Right On!"
     But then what is this?

> How, for
>example, to classify Rafael Campo, an acclaimed gay Hispanic poet who
>writes often in formal verse?

     Is this not classification? Does this sentence not actually read:

     How, for example to classify Rafael Campo? --An accalimed gay Hispanic
poet who writes often in formal verse.

     And the problem then is that the original disguises the actual claim.

 Marjorie Perloff points out, "Thirty years ago you had
>the establishment?Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop?and the
>counterculture. Now you have endless overlapping, dispersed groups.
>There is no one movement; rather, there are many movements.

     The reason for this, imo, being not some greater sensitivity or growth
in humanistic potential, but the poetry market itself, which has
considerably broadened its base. In other words, not:

"The
>landscape of poetry publishing itself reflects and promotes this

     But that it causes this heterodoxy. On the one hand, this is a
wonderful thing, leading to greater opportunity for more people to be heard,
and in part helping to begin the process of erasing racist, sexist,
homophobic aspects of the dominant ideology. On the other hand: more people
find more ways to make more money.

The number of small presses in America has grown
>precipitously in the last three decades, fueled in part by advances in

     In the final analysis, the people making the computers are the more
people making more money I was thinking of. I do not mean to suggest that
more small presses is not a Very Good Thing, only that it didn't come out of
nowhere.

 this is more or less what I did when teaching intermediate poetry writing
as an MFA candidate at Brown: obviously one key thing is to get the young
poet into the library both for current literary journals and for weird
books from the nineteen twenties or the sixteen twenties

reply to Mark: yeah of course I like the Hoover and Rothenberg anthologies
and Messerli's recent big one all very much: my point is that every time
we have to make the old Norton mean what it used to mean (my guess is it
never meant that: I mean not in the contexts that inform this one most
directly) we give it a big boost: we need to touch just teach our children
that anthologies are human institutions like a clubhouse in a tree (or
like a Joseph Cornell box in the case of Rothenberg especially)

Those numbers are pretty good (although I wonder what the print runs were).
One of the things that makes poetry publishing different is scale.  It's
not like your average poetry publisher is printing 50,000 copies of any
particular book. I work for a very small (about four titles a year) press,
Tia Chucha Press, and our print runs are about 1,000 to 2,500.  From what I
know, runs of that size are typical for books of poetry.  We're lucky that
we have a stable distributor at Northwestern University Press (our three
previous distributors went bankrupt and we lost a lot of money).  So long
as you don't get megalomaniacal and print too many books, it's not too hard
to sell out your printing run.  The books sell, some faster than others,
but they do sell.  Some of our titles are already in their third printings.

Absolutely. I was perhaps being a bit reductive: I left not for that reason alone, of
course, but because of a host of worries, fears, etc. that surround study. And I think
you've really hit on something with your phraseology: "losing out." And I do not exclude
myself from the equation; that is the real pity in parts of this discussion, the
exclusion of one's own self from the problems we as a species have created. As much as
we are all part of the solution, we are all part of the problem. My "identity" (I don't
even know what the hell that really means) is a mess. The academy is a mess too;
anthologies are a mess; so what? So, I like to read Robert Creeley and I am totally
uninterested in Rita Dove. All you on Dove's side attack. All of us on Creeley's side
will defend. And? This thread has swirled in and out of politics by way of the thing we
cannot name: taste.

There are so many factors at work making things sour that we could continue ad
infinitum. I'd rather go read Creeley. It is in his words, among so many others
(including, for me, many list members), that we approach the democracy of words Williams
recognized as the true source of freedom.

Williams to Creeley:
"My own (moral) program can be chiefly stated.  I send if for what it may be worth to
you: To write badly is an offense to the state since the government can never be more
than the government of the words... Bad art is then that which does not serve in the
continual service of cleansing the language of all fixations upon dead, stinking dead,
usages of the past.  Sanitation and hygiene or sanitation that we may have hygienic
writing."

And in "A 1 Pound Stein":
"It's the words, the words we need to get back to, words washed clean.  Until we get the
power of thought back through a new minting of the words we are actually sunk.  This is
a moral question at base, surely but a technical one also and first."

These are the best moral and political positions I can use to defend my own.

I couldn't agree more. It seems to me (at the risk of perhaps over simplifying
a complex issue) that taste or preference is at the heart of many discussions
on the value of poetry and the marginalization of this or that poet, or poetry
movement. But why isn't taste or preference named as such more often? I do
realize that in my position (outside of the universities and colleges) it is
easier for me to avoid the identity politics faced by those who teach and those
who interview to teach. But at home, do I practice discrimination when I browse
the bookstores and pick up, and read, and buy Zukofsky, Bernstein, Stein, etc.,
but not Rita Dove, Maya Angelou, or Adrienne Rich? In the stict sense of the
word yes! Am I a racist or sexist? No. It probably has more to do with what I
find engaging, interesting, mind-blowing, etc.

The "Different Faces of Poetry" by Mallay Charters also has:

This makes sense as a goal. Attainable? We'll see. Identity politics as a
vehicle for recognition and representation? Definitely. But when do the
training wheels come off?

Joe Amato --

your remarks abt. Coppola's new lit-mag read sensibly; as noted, I've not
yet seen it, but agree w/ your points (& "let's see!" stance).  Further: of
course the interface between literature & cinema is an important one
culturally.  Vital -- but poss. not enought thought about / grappled with /
considered.  If the "Faces of Eve" instance proves not isolated, but an
example of ongoing attention to that borderland, this in itself would do
Mr. C. some credit.

Too: readership of the Z zine is apt to include Hollywood-types -- who
(depending on editorial bent) might benefit . . . Inshallah, look forward to
your work therein (& anon on screen? ;-) ).

d.i.

p.s.: speaking of film, I'd meant to mention -- pursuant to now-long-ago
thread re: film heroines (don't have the posts right at hand -- but I was
the unwise chap [& Poetics newbie] who made mention of *Bandit
Queen* in connection w/ that query) --

So: here's another (I dare say better) suggestion:  director Ketan Mehta's
*Mirch Masala* (Hindi), in English circulated under title *SPICES*.

Remarkable -- beautiful film, w/ a strongly feminist POV, a historical
setting (I suppose circa 19th century), excellent use of image, music
(folksong), story (something of a morality tale, but told w/ an interesting
sense of the archetypal) -- dealing in fact w/ some of the same issues as
*Bandit Queen* endeavored to address, but in a different manner.

Saw it when new -- abt. a doz. years ago at Pacific Film Archive
(Berkeley).  So happens, San Francisco writer / sound-recordist Shafi
Hakim had a part in writing the script.  (If the Poetics chap who'd sought
such films might be interested in this but has a hard time tracking down a
copy, one could check w/ Shafi, I suppose.)

Or with the way you read? And are taught to read?
I'm not defending third rate non-white non-male writers but then i'm not
comparing them with the great dead whites either. There are some excellent
u.s.w. non-w non-m writers and have been for centuries. It's ridculous
comparing Angelou to Creeley. Perhaps to Heaney or Ted Hughes or more
popular/accessible 'poets'. And to write off the rest of the world by
'ethnicity' ooops except Baraka (who is okay) is REDUCTIVE in the extreme
and to rationalise this in almost Bloomsian terms as not racist but. Well...

I don't know i always try to stay out of discussions like this, but then
find myself dragged in. Its like letters to the editor in the local paper
(now there is a peculiar poetics) I read & read & get steamed up at least 2
letters out of three & slam the paper down - or leave it on a bus in disgust
& very rarely - usually when a whole lot of variables manage to line up -
time, convenience, writing implements, the planets, my mood, nothing better
to do (there is always something better to do) I write in response.

One of three things happens

1. i don't post it
2. i post they don't print
3. i post they print i regret

Obviously the first option is the best & least frustrating. Today I post
knowing it will be published (to the list at least).

So regrets in advance

& love & respect to all...

& more to those who agree with me - if they find i have really said anything
at all.

& more to those who disagree

& to those who really disagree - I'd love to step outside, it's sunny & warm
in Auckland today.

Oh resevoir,

First books targeted:

SM, by Jeffery DeShell, Blood of Mugwump, by Doug Rice,
The Mexican Trilogy, by D.N. Stuefloten, and Chick Lit 2,
edited by Chris Mazza.  It seems my book, Distorture, will
probably be the next to be targeted. After that, I'm not
certain who's next.

Even if this turns out to be good for individual writers,
the fact remains that it's bad news for BIB and for all
other literary academic presses. Please write letters of
support and do what you can.

Also:

                In celebration of two new books:

                        Distorture

                            &

                Beneath the Empire of the Birds

                        March 27, 7:00 p.m.

                        Tower Books

                        Readings by

                        Rob Hardin
                        Darius James

There will be posters, wine, beer, an ad in the Voice, a choice pic in
The NY Press: The place will be a madhouse.

An aside: All responses to me personally must be emailed to me
personally: After getting continuously flamed for punctuation,
and then getting flamed for calling a punctuation flame bad netiquette
(which it is: I worked for NetBooks for two years and copyedited the
Masquerade book on the internet--I use such neologisms accurately), I
don't really see much point in perpetuating arguments on listserv.
Therefore, I won't be reading the list and won't respond to messages
on the list.

Still, Black Ice Books/FC2 is more important than the logistics
of any personal exchange. Jeffery DeShell is a great writer and
future DeShells deserve to be published. Please support free speech
and let's forget about past differences.

All the best always,

First books targeted:

SM, by Jeffery DeShell, Blood of Mugwump, by Doug Rice,
The Mexican Trilogy, by D.N. Stuefloten, and Chick Lit 2,
edited by Chris Mazza.  It seems my book, Distorture, will
probably be the next to be targeted. After that, I'm not
certain who's next.

Even if this turns out to be good for individual writers,
the fact remains that it's bad news for BIB and for all
other literary academic presses. Please write letters of
support and do what you can.

Also:

                In celebration of two new books:

                        Distorture

                            &

                Beneath the Empire of the Birds

                        March 27, 7:00 p.m.

                        Tower Books

                        Readings by

                        Rob Hardin
                        Darius James

There will be posters, wine, beer, an ad in the Voice, a choice pic in
The NY Press: The place will be a madhouse.

An aside: All responses to me should be emailed to me
personally. After getting continuously flamed for punctuation,
and amassing further flames for calling a punctuation flame bad
netiquette (which it is: I worked for NetBooks for two years and
copyedited the Masquerade guide to the internet--I use such
neologisms accurately), I don't really see much point in perpetuating
arguments on listserv. Therefore, I won't be reading the list and
won't respond to messages on the list.

Still, Black Ice Books/FC2 is more important than the logistics
of any personal exchange. Jeffery DeShell is a great writer and
future DeShells deserve to be published. Let's all support free
speech and forget about our differences.

All the best always,

"Taste" may be be trivial, but love isn't.  Love is just the inadmissable
motor that gives energy (however waning) to judgment.  Perhaps if we could
own up to the poets who woke us we'd be better equipped to hear what
wakenings are available elsewhere?  Pound & Yeats & Stevens & Bassho &
Donne & Blake woke me, and I've had students teach me how Cummings &
Bukowski & even god help me Gerald Stern woke them.  It's not the same
second-hand, but it's not a bad place to start.

I've been watching with much interest (and dare I, at the risk of seeming an
irresponsible aesthete, say "with much pleasure) the recent "deeply
disturbed" thread and am excited by the possibility of something like a
"public sphere" beyond coterie debates and would like to address a few points
that hopefully could be further addressed, etc.---

At one point, Marjorie writes that these mutlicultural poets are "ironically,
quite conservative so far as form, rhetoric and the ontology of the poem are
concerned." Being a reader of Marjorie's work, I know what she means, but it
may not be self-evident to many why these forms AND ONTOLOGIES are
conservative, or naive, or unreflective, etc. For there IS a valid  point to
be made that much of what many of us (I'm including myself in a larger
interpretative community here, but any one of you may feel free to deny you
share these assumptions, in fact I myself do not ALWAYS share these
assumptions and who knows what tomorrow will bring) consider to be properly
self-conscious, sophisticated, reflexive, recursive, whatever, work may, for
many people, actually be a kind of decadent masturbatory work. I find such a
dialogue interesting and it is often the subject matter of my work, as well
as the work of many writers I admire--but it is NOT a necessary precondition
for GOOD POETRY for me (I am, by the way, not saying that anybody on the list
has said it was--just trying to raise some questions). And I guess what I
would like to see more of is the kind of dialogue, or "coalition building"
between some of these rigid factions. In the first place, to speak of
identity politics or multicult, whatever, as a recognizable kind of verse,
may very well elide the differences between several kinds of modes--i.e. RITA
DOVE (as current whipping woman DU JOUR) is very far away from say Sterling
Plummp(sic?) or Paul Beatty. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, and
suggested in Marjorie's calling attention to "the erosion of all democracy in
washington" and the "refusal to criticize" (at least in any blatant way) on
the part of many poets many of these problems, that there may be a UNION of
practictioners of "radical formal innovation" and "radical CONTENT
innovators" that can be emphasized more than it seems to have been in the
past. Even the union of "bohemian" and "avant-garde" is a good-place to start
(and certain gestures in Paul Hoover's anthology are to be very applauded for
moving in this direction). That a poet can be INTELLECTUALLY or EMOTIONALLY
or ETHICALLY radical, or at least challenging (even on a strict word level,
as say BRECHT or LANGSTON HUGHES or D.H. LAWRENCE, is, despite the lack of
what many would call formal innovation in their work--in ways, admittedly,
Angelou or Dove, FOR ME, are not) may "compensate" for the lack of the more
purely formal radical qualities in their work. I've said this before, but
will again--that there is no necessary connection between FORMALLY innvative
and SOCIALLY innovative work. It's great when a poem can be both, but for me
if it's at least ONE of these (and if often doesn't matter which one, as long
a it's at least one), it passes through my censors and is therefore deemed
INTERESTING, etc. What makes certain poets in the ALLEN anthology, for
instance, radical is NOT NECESSARILY form, or limited to form, or the formal
radicalism may, after 38 years, seem now incidental, more a matter of fashion
(see O'Hara's "Mayakovsky" for an example of a "speaker" theatrically aware
of the the STRICTURES of the avant-garde as much as say a Lowell would come
to feel the strictures of the "mainstream"--and in this light I could call
attention to the replacement in the 80's (the period that is largely in
questin here) of both Amiri Baraka by Michael Harper and of Kenneth Koch by
Gerald Stern in the widely taught Poulin anthology (the latter of which, in
both cases, are more benign both FORMALLY and SOCIALLY), or, more generally,
the way much black radicalism was replaced in anthologies (definitely the
NORTOn--not the Hoover one) by 1) more benign black writers (i.e. Dove again)
or 2) other "fashionable" minorities (which in many cases, and probably not
accidentally, are also more conservative, I think of Cathy Song, in
particular, but there are others)--which has the effect retroactively of
calling into question the decisions on the part of the anthologists to
publish the more radical writers in the first place (kinda like the way
"silly love songs" called into question the motives behind, say, Sgt.
Pepper--for those who didn't already suspect SGT. Pepper when it came
out--okay, sorry, a strained analogy). So, I would question David (Kellogg's)
remark that "MULLEN, HUNT, ET AL., are  not excluded because Rita Dove is
included...." Sure, I do not want to act as if "the currently included poets
are part of the problem" and I hope I will be forgiven for the use I am
making of RD (Dove, not Duncan or DuPlessis) here, as a kind of intellectual
shorthand, or synechdoche, for a certain style, but sometimes it is important
to entertain the possibility of conspiracy (as long as one does not get all
ghasthy serious about it) and realize that, YES, the poetry climate as well
as the "larger" political climate has indeed gotten much more conservative in
the last 20 odd years--but I do think that we should question what we mean by
"conservative" in several ways. 1) the rhymes in the work of many slam-type
poets (or rap) are not EXACTLY conservative in a new formalist way, as
Creeley once told me in a letter "NEVER TOO LATE TO RHYME!" (Bernstein is
rhyming alot lately, and Lee Ann Brown....others....). There is a whole set
of issues of orality involved, and to say I HATE SPEECH does not necessarily
make one a radical these days.
Also, conservative and conservation share a similar root, no? What if one
says "I am a conservative in exactly the ways that the so-called
'conservatives' are not"? COnservatives are actually some of the most
WASTEFUL, final-fronteir, macho, make it newers out there in many FIELDS
(clinton's techno "bridge' to the 21st century). Anyway, one can only go SO
FAR out, and the urge to be simple can be radical, it needn't implicate one
in a reductive sense of "identity politics" or "esentialism" (on this, Maria
Damon's point is also, well taken). I'll stop here, because I'll probably be
seen as contradicting myself, or confused, or trying to play more than one
part in this discursive situation--i definitely have more questions than
answers, but, then, if one can not help but define oneself maybe it's okay to
define oneself as undefinable.....at least as an opening gambit, in a
cultural climate that seems way too rigid (but then rigidity IS rather comic,
no?)----Chris Stroffolino

Ken Johnson remarks --

<< Just a heartfelt plug for Herb Levy's Periplum CD, Suspended Music.
The "long string instrument" is amazing. Totally new.

There used to be a magazine called _Ear_ devoted to new music--is there
anything out there comparable? >>

EAR (NYC-based), alas, bit the dust circa. '91-'92, sheerly for lack of
ready money to get through a rough spot.  Up till then, it was "growing"
in many ways, but hit a snag.  (FYI, EAR's latest till-the-end publisher,
Carol Tuynman, moved back to Beaufort, South Carolina some years
ago.)  I had pleasure of writing for (& doing some editing at) EAR in the
late '80s et seq. (while some of you'all mayhap were gathered at yonder
EAR Inn).

As for other, similar, extant magazines? -- I don't know full scope of
what's out there, but one that I know & like is:

MusicWorks
(based on Toronto).

(rather close to the old EAR in several respects)

Editorially savvy, the writing is various, sometimes arcane, typically
smart & well-informed.  Many of the more obscure & remarkable doings
& developments in new music find (sometimes rare) overage in the pages
of MusicWorks.

AND they include an accompanying CD w/ each issue, specially cut [if
that's the word], coordinated w/ feature articles.  (In truth, I gotta
re-subscribe.)  Last I knew, MusicWorks getting on-line (don't have
e-address on hand); by now, bet they may have a website.

d.i.

p.s.:  among EAR writers I knew, one bright young bloke, Neil Straus,
"graduated" (?) to (still-current) music coverage for the NY Times, btw.

This topic has been gnawing at me for the last couple of days.  I have
nothing illuminating to say on it.  I feel instead that it reveals
something disturbingly (deeply disturbingly) ill-luminated about me, about
us (poetics-us, but also U.S. us).  I too hate the anthology that
sacrifices interesting work for the mundane (though there are ways of
making the mundane interesting, and I take both Harriet Davidson's and Bob
Perelman's talks at the recent MLA on teaching poetry to be prods in the
direction of making us find and profess the interesting where we maybe
have deadedned our sensiblities toward it).  And I hate  the
professional impulse to sacrifice interesting minds, with all their lively
passions, to an essentialist paradigm that is (and that most everyone in
the profession agrees is) hot air. And I can't find a way to make THAT
interesting.

It's important to see how the "job market" problem crosses into the
"identity politics" problem: the tighter the market, the tighter the
pressure will be to think in narrow-reductionist terms.  (The scenario: we
can only hire one person, so it has to be someone who fits THIS
description.)  The profession (read students) is the biggest loser: just
as we are expanding (in the sense of becoming increasingly open to new
kinds of work from new kinds of people), we are also shrinking (fewer
jobs, steady conversion to adjunct labor).  So: we will invariably lose
good people, many of whom a generation back would have found their calling
in teaching.  It saddens me.  It seems our most urgent professional
responsibility, those of us who teach in college programs, is to resist
the adjunctification of the profession.  Let course enrollments grow, let
students complain?  Enlist the MLA's power of publicity?

yes; let's have some real conversation, but not at the expense of enlarged

Just would like to agree completely with Jonathan Levin (and Joseph Lease
and David Kellogg and Lisa Jarnot, I think) that the intersection of the
'job market' with 'identity politics' is the center of this particular
death star. There is no sound fiscal reason the humanities departments of
universities need constrict -- follow the money. Locate the bonuses. Get
better at fighting. Are we politically involved yet? Are we talking about
an invented need, like office supplies? Lose the administration! Lose the
professional development seminars! There is no sound long-term reason that
we should accept the short term gains of ... to lose weight Elvis would
have a coma induced? Hang the cost-cutters from the rotunda! Before the
opening of Depression II! And put your socks in a bad poet's mouth --

"The tradition is more than you can read.  It's an entire climate.  It has to
be total, I mean you can't preclude any department or tendency for any reason.
It's the total of what as a poet you belong to and can learn from and
contribute to.  Some poet might be there because of one line.  You can learn
from anybody.  Poetry's volatile,it can escape through the people who write it.
This is very unacademic of me but I believe it.  The academics, as I know them,
which is the Cambridge tradition, insist on a fewness.  It is very, very
important to them that in any stretch of literary history there be a few, and
their job, the critic's job, is to nominate that few.  It's surprising how that
attitude permeates to the most outlandish outposts of candle-power and
Tinkerbell poetry, but it does.  It's very academic.  From a creative point
of view it's much more important that there be many. It's more important to
search, quite assiduously if need be, for the good in someone's work than to
recognise the dangers in it, because there are dangers in everybody's work,
for others.  If you stand up in public like Leavis and insist on your selected
few, your discriminations, you just end up a cultural curiosity because your
few can only be a temporary historical partiality, an item of enforced waste,
and all you've done is try to prevent a large number of writers from being
read."

well i've just had the questionable pleasure of wading through sixty posts,
most of them from poetics, the order of which was completely scrambled
thanx to my system shutting down unexpectedly, and burping them forth in no
particular order... so i'll try to respond to various posts, apologies if
somebody posted remarks addressed primarily to me and i missed 'em (please
just backchannel):

fiona:  i think my sarcasm was just too thick for my own good... i was
trying to suggest that i generally have some young white guys in my classes
who submit work to me that often seems intended to shake up the
establishment, when in fact it doesn't do a heck of a lot more than, say,
the beats managed---four decades ago... to your observation as to "see[ing]
anew in all senses," i'd like simply to say YES... at least, my own
reshuffling is geared toward that (whether i succeed or no is another
story)... and YES too to wendy battin's remark about loving poetry... and
yes too to chris s.'s appropriately parenthetical-ed (?) longish post
plumbing the possibilities of talking about radical "content" as well as
"form"... long long overdue in these parts, from my pov... i am esp.
interested mself in work that broaches the various "literature"-"science"
interfaces...

david k:  thanx for your note... i know you know (that i know that you know
etc) what the job scene is about these days... as academix, we're probably
all too wound up on that score to be much good at remaining sangfroid...
but at the same time, i sometimes wish that, as academics, we'd get MORE
wound up... the job scene is creating some awfully complicated political
and economic realities for many of us, and it's difficult as academics to
shake the sense that what we do within the educational system as a result
has everything to do with how we come to poetry... of course it has
something to do with how we come to poetry... i suspect (read "know")
non-academics will in general find that we play our institutional card too
often, but it has to do with the fact that our institution (-al situation)
has become SO visible in the last decade... i would only ask that those who
are NOT academics (self-defined, if you like) take account of how their
workaday world figures into their writing (an old topic)... perhaps it
would behoove us academics, poets and critics, to imagine what effect
shifting careers might have on our writing, on our sense of commitment and
audience?... i mean, imagine if you didn't teach, and if you didn't have to
worry about tenure---how would this affect your writing?... and i'd ask
non-academics whether they might feel differently about their writing if
they were in a position to teach writing/literature every other day... this
is perhaps a bit empathically facile, but i've found such internal
rumination to be quite revealing, in my moments of solitude...

and most recently to keith:  your final lines... i believe, as do you, that
the question of evaluation is not going to go away, not only cultural but
aesthetic evaluation (which  in fact i take to be your point, and
marjorie's point)... for those who posted in about "taste," i would observe
only that (like "craft") this denotes something very particular (depending
on context, perhaps, but then---*here*---this one)... i'd rather too that
we find new idioms, if you like, in which to discuss our "tastes" (and
"craftS")... and it strikes me as revealing that not only should the
political be regarded in somewhat kneejerk terms hereabouts (to gloss
maria) but that questions pertaining to aesthetics  (both content and form)
are ALSO regarded in somewhat kneejerk terms in other, academic contexts...
as somebody who writes both poetry and criticism (i really DO have some
more conventional stuff 'out there') i've often had a HELLuva time
discussing my motivations as a writer with folks who write primarily
critical stuff for academic audiences... not to 'erect' any barriers here,
but just to make sure to indicate that the boundaries cut in multiple
directions...

and apologies for denoting all non-academics with the negative, my brain is
full at the moment...

best,

MLA members will soon have an opportunity to vote on a
resolution initiated by the MLA's Graduate Student Caucus and
passed almost unanimously by the Delegate Assembly at the recent
convention; it's language charges MLA in part to, "take the
lead in working with other disciplinary and higher-education
groups in encouraging legislative and policy bodies at the
national or state level to adopt and fund initiatives which
would provide for labor equity in graduate-employee and adjunct
work, and provide incentives for higher-education institutions
to begin reductions in their reliance upon such labor."

Yes. An essential consideration. How we develop as a reader over time. What
 directions we take. Or our we being carried along. Since I generally learn by
way of the discovery principle, I tend to locate what I read and buy through
exhaustive searching. But more and more, I am reading through references from
others, or their writing. If I start as a surrealist, I may find myself later
on in language and experimental poetry (because I tend toward the subversive
perhaps). This would preclude, for example, an interest in a poetry "selected
to represent cultural diversity, a poetry that accepts the model of
representation assumed by the dominant culture in the first place." Because, as
Charles Bernstein writes, "what can be decried as parochial patterns of reading
is in fact an essential strategy for survival, to have a deep immersion in a
contemporaneity and history that are difficult to locate and need to be
championed."

Right on! So is the official verse culture sanctioning, essentializing, and
tokenizing of signature styles of cultural difference.

Thomas and William et al.:

The bringing up of taste does indeed get at some of the (often unstated or
understated) issues that hang around just under the surface on this
list...As is my wont, I'm probably about to oversimplify dreadfully, but
there are two strong urges in the nonmainstream universe.  One is
inclusive and recognizes the legitimacy of many different poetries and the
preferences for them;  the other (often articulated by LangPo theory in
its early, heroic days) is less tolerant, and strongly critiques much of
the established award/workshop/grant scene for the artistic/ideological
bankruptcy of the poetry it produces and rewards...The latter often is
associated with theories (Brechtian in lineage) that see more innovative
writing as a form of political struggle, in which the reader is active
rather than passive and disempowered (or as Perelman somewhat confusingly
puts it, the reader is abolished, by which he means readers become active
members of a culture/community, become poets, the poet and reader meld
into one).  In fact the passages from WCW that Thomas quotes (great
passages!) read like early formulations of this second, more militant
point of view--one which is rather firm about making negative judgments
and doesn't foreground taste and preference.

Minority communities in the 80s:  I didn't think this needed spelling out.
I am referring to simple fact here:  namely, check out any anthology or
critical study of "contemporary poetry" prior to that time and you'll see
that the issue of minority poets is simply ignored.  (read, for example,
Altieri, J. Breslin, P. Breslin, von Hallberg--you name it).  The
anthologies may have included, say, Baraka and one or two other black
poets but the notion of "Chicano poetics" or "Asian-American poetics" did
not yet exist.  This isn't a value judgement, just a fact.

I didn't say the "formal conservatism" was ironic--I said it is ironic
that one kind of oppositionality (early exemplars of minority poetics)
were conservative formally.
This, incidentally, is now a hot and interesting debate.  In the new ALH,
James Longenbach slaps me and others on the wrist for assuming that, in
the case of Ashbery, his subject, formal innovation and semantic
innovation go hand in hand.  He says this in making the case against THE
TENNIS COURT OATH
I totally disagree.  For me, form and "content" cannot be separated; it's
the point Charles Bernstein makes so beautifully in "Artifice of
Absorption."  There is no "subject matter" outside form.  I've therefore
always objected to Adrienne Rich's supposedly radical stance which is
presented to us in the received lyric modes--to be that's a contradiction
in terms.
Therefore--and this is all I meant--the job of putting together an
"avant-garde" anthology in the 90s is very different from putting one
together in 1960.  Don Allen could just choose those poets that satisfied
what he took to be the New American Poetry.  Today, the anthologist does
not have that freedom because --witness what John Yau did to Eliot
Weinberger--s/he is under pressure to include X number of poets from this
or that grouping.  I am optimistic enough to think this phenomenon will
pass as there are increasing numbers of, say, Mexican-American poets to
choose from.  But at the moment it's tricky and so inclusions are often
somewhat cynical.  So--as I said in the article--the picture is clouded
and no anthologist can quite proceed freely as Don Allen could.

The "exclusivity of my actual critical practice"--I don't know what this
means.  I admire particular poets and those are the ones I write
about--yes.    If that's "exclusivity"  --I plead guilty.  I try, on the
other hand, to include non U.S. poets so in that sense I believe I'm much
more "inclusive"   than others.  There's only so much time.

I disagree with the last sentence above.  I believe it's Charles B who
noticed that the Norton, so far as poets born after 1950 goes, includes
not a single white man.  Our Quals list at Stanford is similar.  The list,
made up by a faculty committee includes Leslie Marmon Silko  Sandra
Cisneros but not Charles Olson or John Ashbery or Louis Zukofsky
If this isn't identity politics, what is it?  You will note, if you study
reading lists around the country that this is the case.  The post World
War II period has been turned into a kind of grievance list.

The very fact that we have to talk about""" included" and "excluded"
poetry is the problem. Which is all I originally said and which you found
"deeply disturbing."  And the Norton is not to be so easily dismissed,
given that 9/10 of Intro. poetry courses use it.  The newest edition is
virtually worthless so far as I'm concerned.  But the compilers get away
with it in the name of a spurious radicalism ("Look!  23 people of color,
etc. etc.).  What this cynical move on the part of the publishing industry
is doing does deserve comment, doesn't it.  Or--to take a second
example--look at Adrienne Rich's recent BEST AMERICAN POEMS of 1996.  She
has poems in their by highschool girls "of color" that are not even
competent--all in the name of some putative "diversity."

By the by, since we are addressing identity politics/left
politics/non-mainstream writing; on the basis of the one issue I've see,
TinFish and Susan should be applauded for a very creative start at
precisely the rapprochement people have been (very articulately) arguing
for... Awareness of regional/ethnic/political/formal lines, and how they
cut across each other... This magazine is to be VERY strongly recommended
to anyone who hasn't already seen it, and is a good reference point for
the current politics/form discussion here.

Accurately said. I used the words "taste" and "preference" for lack of a better
idiom with which to discuss my own preferences. The more I think of the word in
this context, the more it seems vague or nondescript, a cop-out, or biased. I
too "prefer" that we locate a new idiom for our tastes. Wendy used "love"
which, if I understand her correcetly, suits me far better (I'm going to run
out of synonyms soon).

I've read a couple of messages now in which "identity politics" and "job
market" have been spoken in the same pixellated breath, but where the actual
discussion seems to be about the increasing use of adjuncts and so on.  I'd
like to hear someone develop the argument about the relationship between
identity politics and jobs, though I promise to be skeptical.  Identity
politics has been around a lot longer than the inclusion of some conservative
ethnic (in its labored sense as "non-white") voices in the Norton.  And job
woes have been around a lot longer than multiculturalism.  I'm not in any way
defending the job market/process as it's now practiced, but I don't want to
see the problems with it racialized--which is not what anyone's meaning to
do, I know, but the language slippeth a bit.

very old fashioned words like love (as in Wendy Battin's usage), tone,
style, form, taste

can often be extremely useful in the storm created by radical aesthetics

marjorie, surely in conceptual terms, "form" and "content" are not
susceptible to any easy division... but the fact that there are reading
communities who insist on seeing these as (at least somewhat) separate,
whether one agrees or no that this behooves poetic practice in toto, is
itself at issue... i mean, we can argue (as i have mself) that seeing form
and content as dissociable permits for a sort of incursion of the
technological (there are those in cogsci circles who speak now, formal-ly,
of the mind as a technology)... perhaps this is broadly sociocultural,
effect-wise...

but in the immediacy often attendant to more political aims---and i would
agree with you that poets need not be shy about same---it seems to me that
there may be positive cultural work to be had BY maintaining this
distinction... for instance, there is work both by w. d. ehrhart and horace
coleman that is, on the one hand, not all that formally innovative, but on
the other, speaks directly to the experience of vietnam vets... with all
that "speaks directly to" implies, both in a positive as well as a negative
sense... it's here that, say, *my* tendency to regard such writing in terms
of its cultural work may be viewed---by, say, other readers of these
poets---as a kind of aesthetic condescension... that is, i've converted
issues of "taste" (note those quotes, puh-leez) into issues of reception...

worth noting too that the political aims of dominant groups often go
unchallenged in such terms, simply b/c "identity" as such operates as a
tacit given...

i trust i'm being clear here... i guess i'm trying to pinpoint and flesh
out what i see as the controversy in your comments---i surely don't mean to
intervene for david, even to mediate (though i've got this thing about
watching folks argue---)... i think one of the reasons much of *your*
writing appeals to us poets is b/c you bring to the writing a real
sensitivity as to formal considerations (which is not to suggest in any way
that you don't understand the stakes implicit in "identity politics")...
and the tendency of many academics to overlook such considerations---and
the evaluations that accompany them---is part of why i often have such a
problem talking with colleagues about my more writer-ly motivations...

when I talk about the usefulness of old fashioned words I am of course
assuming that their meanings are context-dependent: for example, there are
lots of poetry worlds in which poets who I think are great poets are
considered to be bad in the sense of incompetent: so when I use terms of
value I mean them with the activist awareness that their meanings are
context dependent:

therefore, it seems to me, that poets who love the avant-garde tradition
(on the next jenny jones)

are obligated (in order to be intellectually consistent) to at least
respect what different lefts define (determine, as in self determination)
to be terms of aesthetic excellence

(this in relation to Marjorie Perloff's evalaution of Rich's (granted
deeply problematic) anthology)

respectfully and tremblingly,

Chris Stroffolino raises some super-good points in his post (I won't quote
because I'd probably end up quoting the whole thing): rhyme is a perfect
example (and Creeley's poetics and yes Lee Ann Brown) of ways in which
something that once seemed old-fashioned can suddenly become (in a
different interpretive context) singing and zinging with pleasure and
even corrosive politics: ugliness (as in Chicago funk art (I'm from
Chicago not Harvard)), narrative, stanzaic structures, speech acts, and
even (gasp!) a lyric self-in-process (term from Kristeva, I mean to
distinguish from confessional unitary self) are also perfect examples of
aspects of poetics for which it is never too late:

because after all it could only be too late for a given aspect of poetics
if that aspect had only one fixed unitary meaning (Chakras on stun, as
Jordan points out)

STUDIES IN DEIXIS: WORKING THE MARGINS OF PRAGMATICS AND SEMANTICS

     for the Midwest Modern Language Association Meeting,
     Chicago, November 6-8, 1997, Ramada Congress Hotel

Abstracts are being accepted for "Studies in Deixis: Working the
Margins of Pragmatics and Semantics." The multidimensionality of
deixis, a linguistic phenomenon at the heart of communication,
remains one of the most intriguing aspects of human language. It is
impossible to imagine communication that functions without deixis.
Deictic elements such as pronouns, demonstrative adjectives, and
spatial or temporal adverbs, express a user-centered perspective on
time, place and person relationships in the social context of an
utterance; simultaneously, they denote formal grammatical functions
within an utterance. The aim of the forum is to bring together
scholars working on different aspects of deixis--from formal
linguistics to stylistics--to discuss the activity that occurs at
the intersection of language and reality/structure and function.
Publication of the proceedings is planned.

Abstracts/proposals should be a maximum of 150 words in length and
must be received by Friday, April 4, 1997.

Saturday evening at New College in San Francisco there was a benefit reading
for _Prosodia_ 7, the New College literary journal.  Tricia Roush, one of
the editors of this year's issue, started off with a reading from her work
_The Books of Danger_, starting with book one, "Danger Is My Business".
Some great lines included:

courage is something that keeps logic from working
I am rich and sick in the same moment
the bottom of the sea is my workshop, and I like it
I worked so hard I don't remember it
needless to say, the shark charmers are now in place
everyone was killed; it cannot be otherwise
it could have been shot over and over again, but everyone was so astonished

Kit Robinson then read a selection of stuff old and new, including a bit
from _Balance Sheet_ and the lines:

it is important to do something meaningless
three peacocks strut by.  They just say nothing.
it is the hour of the rampant shadow

There was more, and there were people there, but my pen ran out of ink and I
didn't get much more.  Let's see, who all was there?  I remember Kevin
Killian, Marina Lazzara, Steven Jones, Laura Moriarty, Nick Robinson, Adam
DeGraff, Mary Burger, Alex Cory, Mac from Santa Cruz, Cami Bontiates,
Stephanie Baker, Simon Pettet (more about him shortly), Jean Day and family,
and was that Margaret Butterfield?

After the reading Adam Mary Alex and I go to David Larson's 27th birthday
party in Oakland.  David's cooking a turkey (there's quite a spread; since
I'm a vegetarian I content myself with gnawing on the hollow white chocolate
easter bunny), and there's copies of his "Modern Dewlap Special" sitting
out, a collage of writing, drawing, cutting and pasting from David, Jia
Ching Chen, Raymond Pettibon and Aaron Sinift.

Sunday there's the Simon Pettet/Kathy Lou Schultz reading at Canessa Park.
Avery Burns introduces Kathy Lou Schultz first and she reads from a sonnet
sequence, a work called _Tool It Down_,  another called _Some Vague Wife_,
and yet still another, "Toward Fissures Forming Plots".  Her work can be
quite funny, to wit:

he set out in the rain in his theory suit and came back damp
precipitation bulb and annuals
there's something about writers:  they're damned hard to re-educate
very particular hell over this
lemon, late afternoon light, lawn of torso
supersensory abstinence
your leaving cleaves my (startled? starving?) heart
returning is a grand gesture emphasizing departure

Simon Pettet, in from New York, then got up somewhat nervously and read
(occasionally then re-reading) some new pieces and a bunch of stuff from the
_Selected_:

how fortunate to be alive for just this second
I am illegally parked in your heart
still life which is endlessly moving
the fool is the image of a life chosen
the evening jukebox sun goes down so quietly
so what do you select?

Witnesses included Adam DeGraff, Edward Berrigan, Yetta, Ed Foster (in town
for his own reading this Saturday at New College with Giovanni Singleton),
Bill Berkson, Spencer Selby, Mary Margaret Sloan, Jack and Adelle Foley,
Brian Lucas, Kevin Killian and Thoreau Lovell.

     An example of the fact that the antholigists are more comfortable with
accepting "minority" representation than with accepting white male
radicalism. Probably radicalism by anyone: so what are they including in the
defintition of radicalism then?
     The danger lies in then seeing the latter (revolutionary form) as being
oppossed to the former (political inclusion), which as this list
demonstrates it usually isn't.
     What if you substitute Doty for Olson, etc.?
     Can there be one fulcrum for this debate? I think it is frustrating but
important to act as though there could be.

That was, I thought, my point too: such scapegoating as red herring, a
missed opportunity for real debate, both in the job market and in the
poetry-anthology discussion.  As an adjuct, I feel this issue pretty acutely.

     when you say context-dependent do you mean because they perform the
dialectical function of reminding us of their meaning in another, previous
context? e.g., a context in which specific meaning could be ascertained?

Ed and Giovanni are reading FRIDAY for Small Press Traffic.  Though we are
located at New College, Small Press Traffic's series is separate from New
College's own reading series.

Small Press Traffic presents:

Edward Foster
Giovanni Singleton
New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street
$5

Edward Foster wears many hats. He=B9s the editor of Talisman, one of the
leading U.S. poetry magazines. His critical works include studies of
William Saroyan, the Beats, Jack Spicer, and a memoir of his friendship
with the poet Ted Berrigan. He=B9s the publisher of Talisman House Books and
has edited or co-edited the anthologies Postmodern Poetry: The Talisman
Interviews and Primary Trouble.  He is a controversialist whose essay
=B3Poetry Has Nothing To Do With Politics=B2 startled many with its insisten=

Giovanni Singleton=B9s work has appeared in Prosodia, Mass Ave., Mirage, No
Roses Review, and The Breast Anthology (Global City, 1995). She holds an
M.F.A. from the Poetics Program at New College and is currently writing an
M.A. thesis on the poet and activist Jayne Cortez. Her writing updates and
revises the modernisms of the Harlem Renaissance poets and the Black Arts
Movement of the 50s and 60s, as well as African-American modernist film,
visual art and music. Her poetry is sensual, exciting, formally radical,
like velcro on steel.

michael coffey, question:  that piece on poetry publications comes off as
so HAPPY!...

but like, what about the small press distribution problems we've been
witnessing in the last decade (at least)?... why is there no mention made
of same?...

dear joe amato:

the publishers weekly piece tried to focus on the diversity of poetry
being published, informing booksellers and others in the trade of that
fact, and hopefully giving them a notion of which publishers were doing
which kinds of work.

Issues of distribution, consolidation, returns, the plight of the independent
booksellers, the inroads of  internet bookselling, the expanding reach of
warehouse clubs, the costs of paper, the diminishment in arts funding
and other developments that imperil all manner of publishing, big and
small, poetry and no, were not addressed, although, in the pages of PW,
these are regularly monitored.

As for the damnably happy tone: I would say that poetry publishing is
pretty vital at the moment, and seems to be on the rise; distribution,
which 10 years ago was an absolutely dire situation for small literary
presses, has much improved, generally speaking. For new presses, and
very small presses that have no distributor, things are, as always, bleak
as regards sales in the trade, but no bleaker than in 1970 or 80.
Publishers still must find their audience in other ways and get a great
deal of contentment out of simply (!) producing a person's work in the
venerable form of a book.

One could argue that poetry is marginalized by culture, by commerce, by
most people. And that TV isn't. The reasons are clear, and perhaps not
to be wished away.


As for sales of poetry, the thorny issue arises as to how much poety
poets buy. Lovers of mysteries and romance and scifi read one a week;
lovers of fiction with a capital F read a couple a month; how much poetry
does a poetry lover buy? For that matter,  could a lover of poetry find
enough good new poetry to buy and read one a week? I don't think any
one's individual tastes are being published to that successfully, clearly.
There is a world of backlist to find and read, but do we? Poetry is not
consumed quite the way other literatures are, it seems to me. The
emphasis is on its production, and I think therefore it might be
wrong-headed to fret about its success in the marketplace. It's
encouraging to know that it is out there. To mean, perhaps, it simply must
be. To sell well, well, perhaps something else is going on. I'm not saying
a publisher (or poet) should be happy with a barn full of unsold books
but it is not a failure by any means. However, traincars full of unsold
book's by Johnnie Cochran, which one large New York publisher was
recently in receipt of, very well might be.

I concur with all of the various praise heaped upon Musicworks (right down
to the need to renew my sub).

But I'd like to add a few other zines that are far less frequently
published, which are also quite useful.  All three are particularly
interesting to me cause they helped me to understand some of the
connections between old (60s-80s) new music & some of the more recent
stuff that has a slightly younger demographic and more "pop" cachet (by
which I mean stuff that might be name checked in Spin magazine).

Unfortunately I don't have addresses with me, Luigi may, but I can supply
these if folks are interested early next week.  The zines, listed in the
order in which I find them most useful, are EST (roughly annual from
the UK), Halana also roughly annual, and ND, from Austin with a new issue
coming out "real soon now" after about a 2-3 year hiatus.

This theme is what most interests me most in the ongoing
Perloff-Kellog-"disturbed" threads:

How can we find a way to speak that will allow us to say that Bob Perelman
produces excellent work in his idiom (as I believe he does), and that Seamus
Heaney produces excellent work in his idiom (as I believe he does)?  Okay, there
are probably not that many people on this list who admire the work of both poets
(that David Antim dictum along the lines of "if what he does is poetry, what I do
isn't" seems more prevalent), but _I_ admire both, and I find myself having a hard
time articulating a critical language that can find a place for both poets.
Boland's call for "a language of respect" between poetries intrigues me, because
it admits of the possiblity for a kind of ecumenism that I long for.

Yes, the forms used by a poet like Heaney have political/ontological corollaries
about, for example, the nature of the self which I don't subscibe to -- but I
refuse to make this grounds for a categorical dismissal of his work -- he does
what he does with excellence, and I can understand my own (Perelman-esque) views
about the self better by looking to Heaney's work and seeing a fine articulation
of something quite "other" to my own convictions.  I am suspicious of any attempts
to dismiss whole genres of work as valueless, boring, or lifeless (although there
are certainly poems, and even poets, that fall into these categories).  I will not
make an idiom my enemy.  But I don't know that there is, at the moment, much by
way of a vocabulary in which to articulate an appreciation for many poetries, or
to explain an admiration for many poetries.  Where is there a poetics of
pluralism?

Shouldn't one of the tasks of this list to be to explore such a vocabulary?

I think that a lot of the discussion on this list is taking place in a
liberal dreamscape instead of the "real" world.  Isn't it traditionally
through dismissing "whole genres of work as valueless, boring, or lifeless"
that many groups and individual poets have generated the energy to go on
and do something interesting/innovative?

Good-citizen poets, do they also always buckle their seatbelts?

Tom Clark's rantings, which I keep hearing reports of, are starting to
sound refreshing to me.

And, Robert, this is no personal attack on you, good god, I just used your

Granted some poets may find the dishing of poetics unlike their own to be
psychologically ennabling (the ends -- good poetry -- can justify the means -- narrow
polemics).  But this doesn't help me, as a poet and reader who wants (foolishly?) to
understand his own very catholic tastes.  We have a critical language that honors
LANGUAGE poetry (in fact, much LANGUAGE poetry _is_ a critical language honoring
langugae poetry) and we have critical languages honoring other experimentalisms and more
traditional kinds of poetry.  What I wonder is this: what can the underpinings of a
language of respect between poetries be?

Sure, but if the nature of this poetry is so 'exclusive' and assured of its
own importance - it merely goes on as part of an elitist poetics history &
surely colludes with other power structures, language structures etc to
exclude those who perhaps are taking a more roundabout/or conservative
'poetic' route - but who may be fighting the same war. Kind of like the
whole spanish franco thing.

Sorry more/war metaphor. Yuck.

yes yes, I think this is a crucial strategy for
teaching contemporary poetry. for the cost
of most anthologies, you can teach several
smaller, entire books (& support several
smaller presses). you do lose the possibility
of more casual contact - the student who
discovers a poet's work by paging through the
anthology (it's rumored that this actually happens).
but along with that you lose the authoritative
gesture of the Anthology, & its possible to gain
1. a deeper immersion in the work at hand;
2. the students introduction to the small press, where
    most of contemporary poetry (or most of what I
    would teach) makes its public appearance;
3. a fleeting glimpse into the "field" of contemporary poetry,
    its socius - what poets do these days (many of us seem to
    have become proficient in publishing, organizing reading series,
    etc), the relation of contemporary poetry to its social situation,
    to publishing, etc.
all arguably good gains. I'm particularly interested
in the possibility of teaching not just poetry ("the
same vacuous workshop all over again", or " the
workshop in a vacuum all over again") but the
conditions of its production as a commodity--I mean
the various sorts of books & coterie work out there--
& its reception.

so that when Joseph asks:
> which basically new critical principles underlie most creative writing

my explanation is precisely the above,
& it seems to me, well "bad" if you like,
but I'd prefer to say a failing that we
tend to teach poetry as if it were
socially an other realm--as high art?
to the extent that american creative
writing workshops tend exclusively
toward an emphasis on the internal,
structural unities of the individual
poem or isolated self-expression &
turn away from social, theoretical,
political questions, I'd say that they
are distinctly the inheritors of
New Criticism. (I'm talking here
about the average program, & not
Brown--you have to remember
that my experience was considerably
more conservative than your own).
it seems to me problematic, for
instance,  that you wouldn't dream
of teaching Donne without teaching
Early Modern England in seminar, but
he'll be dragged into every workshop in
america in just that manner. if you believe
Marotti, as in fact I do, this kind of
treatment, first by critics but sustained
here, has lead to a terribly deformed
reception of his work. (one could speak
similarly of McGann's admirable work
on the English Romantic Epoch, but I
don't think anybody's actually teaching
Byron in workshop). Donne's coterie
readers would have understood his work
as a part of the social & yes political
fabric of their time. & we understand
our own, contemporary work as
similarly engaged: we understand it in
context. my point was simply to
applaud those of us (Joe) who make
an effort to teach it that way.

Just signing up for this list serve, I have only heard a few of the strands
being discussed but wanted to venture an observation or two about adjunct
teaching and "identity" politics.  I think the issue of adjuncts cannot be
separated from other dynamics outside of the literary/academic world, and
that this situation of working in the field with little stable material
renumeration, advancement, etc. vis a vis having a career with all of the
material and ideological capital is intimately tied with other forms of
oppression.  Women make up the vast majority of adjunct teachers, and it
seems crucial to me that we consider the demographics of adjunct teaching
as a manifestation of larger oppressions in the cultural matrix.

The other issue about the Norton anthology and identity politics/aesthetics
brings to mind, for me, how difficult it is to stand outside of one's own
ideologies and bear some deeper than a priori responsibility for the Other
and what that might look like in real terms beyond boutique
multiculturalism which I agree, is completely cynical and really a desire
to appropriate (and contain) hard won struggles for material and cultural
leverage in a system designed to render invisible all forms of
alterity--discoursively and bodily.  One of the things which interests me a
great deal is doing much more conscious work on (anglo)whiteness as race,
and the discoursive constructions of such whiteness as a method of making
partial, or returning to a relational/contingent position, the constructed
and equally socially-engineered nature of whiteness as "racelessness"--and
therefore the "neutral" racial position.

Robt. A writes (in a post to which I am largely sympathetic):

>Yes, the forms used by a poet like Heaney have political/ontological
>corollaries about, for example, the nature of the self which I don't
subscibe...

And I think herein lies part of the answer to why a "language of
understanding between poetics" (or whatever Robert said a few posts later)
is so difficult--it's the assumption that the forms HAVE these corrolaries
ESSENTIALLY, that they aren't a product of the use to which these forms are
put, which I suppose is a function of the complex relationship between the
form, the content, the context, the tradition, and who knows what else.  The
notion that form and content are inseparable in understanding a given poem
or poet tends to slide (Marjorie's view, and probably a correct one, or at
least one deeply entrenched in our whole understanding of what makes poetry
poetry and not something else) into the view that a certain form somehow
cannot help expressing a certain content (except perhaps when the form is
used ironically).  I think this is sort of a 'heroic lang-po' (someone used
that phrase here yesterday) article of faith, which can take either the form
that there are certain (radical) messages a (conservative) poetics JUST
COULDN'T convey by virtue of not enacting them in form, or, conversely, that
the use of certain (radical) forms will prevent us from re-enacting a
(conservative) content.  The pluralist poetics Robert wants (maybe not
everyone does) will have to question this.  I think that only someone (most
of us) with an abiding belief in the importance/power/specialness of poetry
would even be tempted to believe that form alone FORCES a content, an
ontology, a metaphysics the way that a magician forces a card, which is all
to the good, but the idea has its limitations.  Much of what I'm saying
isn't that different than what Chris S. said earlier.
       I think there's the start of an explanation here of what makes it so
hard for many folks (me included) to get their head around the Pound
problem, but it's too late as it is.

Unrelated: I second the recommendation of Halana as far as new music
magazines go.  The new one includes a CD w/ work by Tony Conrad, Japanese
noise artist Keiji Haino, and others.  The previous issue, if you can find
it, had a rare interview with LaMonte Young.  I don't think anyone's
mentioned The Wire, an English magazine that is a little too taken with the
wonders of techno, drum and bass, etc. for my taste, but which does cover a
lot of experimental music.

This is for Chris S., Joe D'Amato especially--
there's a confusion going on about the word "form."  It has nothing to do
with whether "rhyme" is or is not a good "form."  As someone who wrote her
dissertation/first book on "Rhyme and Meaning in the Poetry of Yeats"--I'm
actually quite a rhyme addict.  Form has nothing to do with technical
features as such.  It has to do with the connection to meaning, with
language use.  For instance, I've always disliked Adrienne Rich's "Diving
into the Wreck" because the theme--"I am he, I am she"--the
transformation, the androgyny, is presented as this (to me) dopey metaphor
about deep-sea diving, "First I put on my flippers...."  It's so willed.
If, as she claims to be saying, human identity is fluid, amormphous, and
sexuality open, then what the hell are we doing with these neat stanzas
and overriding metaphorical structure--one basic metaphor throughout.  The
form belies the intended  meaning and the tranformation "diving" produces
is just too easy to be interesting.   Conversely, one can use all the
fragments and dislocations around  and still not have a good "language
poem" if there is no real reason to fragment.  This all sounds like
English 101 I know, but it bears saying, given the comments about
"technically innovative" or "not that technically innovative."

As Hugh Kenner once put it, the avant-garde can be just as boring as
anything else.

This has been a great discussion and I've learned a lot from the postings1

I agree, for what its worth, with Marjorie Perloff's comment about Rich's
"Diving into the Wreck." - it's always bugged me, somewhat juvenilly I
admit, that friends whose minds and tastes I admire like that poem -
compare the gender fluidity that happens in, say, Carla Harryman's *there
Never was a Rose without a thorn* through the blurring of pronouns, the
non-specificity of narrators, etc, and...well it isn't much of a
comparison, Rich's "fluid" freezes up pretty quick.

Thanks, Dodie, for saying the sane thing.

I think it's mysticism to say that a form forces its message. "The suit
makes the person." "A book by its..." Form may lead with its chin, but
that's something else, and irony is too general a description to cover the
various counter-uses there are for formal writing.

Furthermore, at this point, aren't "earned" uses of fragmentation
predictable? Modern, even?

If poetry is part of larger free-standing art process - like science, as
a kind of work, develops a certain autonomy - (I'm talkin in the
abstract, youse adjunct cab door openers) - which "helps people live
their lives" (W. Stevens) - it can "open the doors of perception" in
some ways - encourage people to rethink their habits, expand, grow,
feel, think, enjoy reality (no kiddin) -

then on the one hand an expansive, generous critical attitude - not
exclusive - rather radical (in Jordan's sense) when it comes to making
room for it on campus or elsewhere - is the way to go -

but an expansive critical attitude also should be able to absorb a
CRITICAL attitude & include it (in Dodie's sense) - strategically,
both are important -

since the free-standing space for art should be recognized as a subset
of free-standing democratic space - where people build political
platforms that balance work, property, learning, and justice - and are
free from greed, hate, violence, and ignorance - constitutions, in other
words - hypotheses - and traditions (there are good things about
Anglo-American common law tradition, folks) - capitalism will be
curbed and tamed, not transcended - (as I'm sure we ALL agree) -
(check the Catholic Bishops' Statement on the Economy - they did their
homework) -

and the CRITICAL attitude which is a civic attitude - might temper the
natural tendency of free-standing art - to become simply self-absorbed
self-interest - this is a simple aesthetic - an illustration: has anyone
read Valery's "On Poetry and Abstract Thought"?  Do any of your
hotly-vaunted innovations actually DO what Valery proposes is the
basic thing poetry does?  and did anybody like my Ballade Litteraire?
it has rhymes - it makes fun of you -

Joe Amato asked how nonacademic jobs affect our writing.

I have two jobs:  1) Prep school teacher and 2) evening child care
while my wife works.

The big impact on my writing is that right now (funny pun?) I haven't
the time.  Next week I'm on vacation and I plan on writing away to my
heart's content.  But it probably won't work that way:  I don't suffer
from writer's block.  I suffer from writer's excess.  I have more
ideas, feelings, visceral urges than I have time to write them down.
And they all don't lie fallow, some just wither away.

I became a prep school teacher because I wanted a steady job that would
not compromise my principles that had time off to write.  I am a
trained academic, but I figured "who needs the bullshit of spending ten
years in part-time work before a chance at full-time finally comes
around?"  My wife and I found ourselves in the situation where I was
the one who had to get the job with benefits.

My child care job truly affects my writing:  In November and December I
managed to eek out a manuscript length poem-meditiation that swirls
around various perspectives on my daughter's moderate autism.  Most are
from her wordless perspective:  I translated her wordless being into
words.  It feels successful.

School?  Well, prep school connnects me with the elite class.  I
encounter their hang-ups, troubles, insecurities, and drivenness.  How
does it enter my writing?  Sometimes as a position for satire.  While I
believe in education in principle, I don't believe in it as "style" or
badge of social status.  But any eductational institution has its
watering down point.  I'm not complaining.

What impacts my writing more than anything else is my sense of a
dumbing down of the culture, of a pervasive lack of memory skills,
concentration skills, and discernment skills.  I see the work of
"innovative" poets as heroic -- I sincerely believe that we as a group
are among the few attempting to keep thinking alive amid this insanity.

"Culture" in the old sense is dissolving, and while I welcome the end
of bourgeois "we went to the ballet this weekend" braggart culture, I
am concerned about what is happening to our brains.

The way I see to address this "dumbing down" is to wade right in, and
make serious thought of the very material of the "dumbing down."  This
can be done in a lot of ways.  But poems about seeing a bear outside
your cabin don't work for me.

Responding late to this segment of the discussion, I would just add (in
response to Robert Archambeau's important urging of a "language of respect"
between and among otherwise seemingly "opposing" models of poetic practice)
that Robert Duncan remains perhaps the best contemporary example we have of
such an approach that regards a multiphasic conception of poetic art as
central to any real undertaking in the work.  Dismissing the conventions of
literary "taste" or the currently fashionable attachments of any one school
as useful to the apprehension of poetic meaning, Duncan remains exemplary in
showing us how, out of communal respect for the practice and activity of
poetries, the disparate, dissimilar strands can be woven together: Marianne
Moore and Garcia Lorca, Ezra Pound and Edith Sitwell,William Carlos Williams
and Mary Butts, etc.  "Movement and association are not arbitrary, but arise
from an inner need," Duncan writes in "Ideas of the Meaning of Form. "I must
study thru, deepen my experience, search out the challenge and salvation of
the work."

THE PARTS, by Loss Pequeno Glazier
Buffalo: Meow Press, 1995

"I recognize it in myself by this: that all possible objects of the ordinary
world, external or internal, beings, events, feelings, and actions, while
keeping their usual appearance, are suddenly placed in an indefinable but
wonderfully fitting relationship with the modes of our general sensibility.
That is to say that these well-known things and beings - or rather the ideas
that represent them - somehow change in value.  They attract one another,
they are connected in ways different from the ordinary; they become (if you
will permit the expression) _musicalized_, resonant, and, as it were,
musically related.  The poetic universe, thus defined, offers extensive
analogies with what we can postulate of the dream world...
 "A poet's function - do not be startled by this remark - is not to experience
the poetic state: that is a private affair.  His function is to create it in
others."  - Paul Valery, "Poetry and Abstract Thought"

    The whole of which Loss Glazier's THE PARTS is a small, refreshing part
is a poetic universe fallen into sin/sign/synecdoche.  Charles Olson
an early opponent of idle lyricism called for a "middle voice", little
knowing that a sober middle voice, neither inspired nor dis-re-despaired,
could emerge from the particulated nonspeech verbal medium of <language
poetry>.  Sober, but funny!  There are bits of Olson seeping through
these poems:

As with the hundreds of files
per dye formulation (but see
it's not the _number_ as much as

the "patching" - weave as the
ply resulting in branches seem to
make it find.  Sheer exhaustion!

a part of sense of what does pry
apart.  Until on the "line" other
issue of this.  It's as if the alert

where its brambles from the Fort
here and see with you who wrote
'not about bits, bytes, bells or whistles'
 . ...

                       (day in
D-town...your words on screen
marked as people's next-in-order.

- This is from a poem called "The Com'ns" - with the word INTERNET
stamped in bold oddly above the title.  Yon book reviewer finds much
in this little excerpt to illustrate the "whole".  To digress though:
many of these poems are wit-sly satires - the opener, called "The
Apex", a serious (in the Olson way) send-up of _Apex of the M_
calls for a "transparent" revolutionary poetry - which argues (by
example) that poetry's pith, spine, whatever, is to be both
opaque-resistant AND responsive-expressive (politically relevant).
Glazier's Apex satire though is a subset of the writing throughout
the chipbk - which takes apart both utilitarian mechano-chatter
and obsolete poetic phrasing from an exact middle-voice midpoint -
that zone of Glazier's special position - AS AN EXHAUSTED INFORMATION
SUPERHIGHWAY WORKER GRUNT. ("Sheer exhaustion!")  (_Poetry does not
/ gain from mummified speech_. - from the final [title] poem.)
   There is a real speaker standing paradoxically behind the
syntactically rhythmically and typesetfully SHREDDED bits & bytes
of these poems - who "places" poetry as a part of computerized
"speech" overkill - the worldwide web as a bizarre cocoon or womb
drifting with bits of dead speech-food - yet each bit reflecting
some origin or history, not devalued or dehumanized but ironized
like iron filings not yet translated.  Here is the beginning of
the prose piece "How I was Attila in a Past Life":

  "Losing its words.  Take some aegis or exit point where alpha types
disperse.  The family grows old and leaves without you.  There was some
hook to holdings how the etzels regenerated.  The 'rod and cones' of it.
As it was penned, the bull waited to bolt forward but the human cannot wait
until sunrise.  Hence dismemberment makes a myth of words salving a
permuted path."

This last sentence - the image of weaving/dismemberment appears here &
there - the archaic or archetypal suddenly showing beneath the techno-
jargon.  From "Five pieces for Sound File" (a funny little set maybe
written in England(?) - pathos of the nowhere bumping against the
immemorial):

on the verge - that constituent contact

ends - though I'm no diner King -

it meant so much and again will

break his I - does it falter?

Like the note passed in the row ahead

_these men's books are the whole of language_

how we navigate only - piecemeal

- there is the shadow of Old Ez visiting Londres here and readying his
fractions.  Glazier has put together a breathing chaos.  As the physicists
are starting to repeat ad nauseam, chaos is a species of order, the part
is an empty promise of an inescapable whole, the whole of poetry breathing
underneath the robotic shim of shunted language-bearers.  The Parts, perhaps
are part of the fibrillated stone wheel of the mother-demon Coatlicue
pulled up from a Mexico City subway excavation, alive, breathing and
terrible to behold in her furious dismemberment WHEELING AROUND AND AROUND
NOW IN THE MUSE'UM of walk-walk-talk-talk.  This is a cool and hilarious
little book.  Here's the last 2 stanzas:

"Elipsis" is incision point and
conversely prolapsed.  Whether there's
a break for want - strong pull-time

passes.  Kin to "living" in a period
of adapted measure.  There should only
be one book; texts weave through that.

        But why stop the investigation of form & content with accepting the
impasse? Why not say that the form does grow out of the content at some
other level, not nec. more abstract?

        I do not think form and content need "match up", need reflect each
other _nec._, : that is to say, not in the manner suggested above: but I
think they might both be seen as being formed by a situation in which just
that content, just that form was nec. Perhaps to articulate something new it
is something nec. to use an old form?

though I've been more dogmatic about this in
the past, this is an issue I've been rethinking
of late, & so I just want to agree that Chris
raises a very important point here, as did Joseph
with "respect". not too long ago, I watched
again one of my favorite films, Bunuel's
Exterminating Angel (El Angel Exterminador),
& since then I'm sort of haunted by this
vision (only superficially related to
the film) of a group of people, trapped in
this parlor, & fighting amongst themselves
because they are incapable of collective
action. on the other hand, I do think that a
critical approach to conservative methods
is necessary. as far as an issue like inclusion
in the Norton, well, I'd like personally to see
us get past the kind of divorce from context
that most anthologies represent. but isn't our
discussion of the Norton & similar anthologies
partly synecdochal for concerns of representation
of *our* left alongside a content-oriented left
(aside, of course, from a concern that *any*
left be represented there). I'm reminded ["that
boy, always with the films"] of Groucho Marx
in Duck Soup: "what if I put out my hand & he
[sic] doesn't take it?"

Thought I would let you all know that Musicworks magazine is currently
doing a series on New Music on World Instruments.  Last issue
Musicworks 66 contained two articles, one which was an overview on the
subject and the second was an interview with the Japanese koto
phenomenon Kazue Sawai, who was the originator of a lot of New Music
for traditional instruments in Japan.

This issue, Musicworks 67, has an interview with Japanese composer
Yuji Takahashi who is currently specializing in scores for traditional
Japanese instruments, koto, shamisen, gagaku, etc.  He talks about
writing for how the body moves, as a traditional / contemporary
approach!

Next issue will feature an interview with the Tuvan New
Music/traditional singer Sainkho Namtchylak.  I don't know if you have
heard of her yet but she has more sound in her throat than almost
anyone I have ever heard, from overtone and undertone, to Innuit
throat singing to extended vocals!

If you are interested in Musicworks, contact them and you can receive
a free sample issue (unfortunately without the CD that usually
accompanies the magazine, you have to subscribe for that or buy it
seperately). I don't know if you can request one of these issues, but
it is certainly worth a try!  It usually is published four times a
year and the subscription rates are low!

Good point -- I was writing a bit sloppily, and I agree that the work done by a form is
entirely contextual (hell, I wrote my dissertation about the different kinds of work
that neo-Romantic poetics can do in different postcolonial contexts).  This gives us all
the more reason to be open to a larger variety of poetries, and to work toward a
critical language that can value them.

I want to praise Robert Archambeau's call for a poetics of pluralism and
note Chris Alenxander's point that respect can (and often must) include
critique:

I also want to note that maximilism (as David Shapiro has named it) can be
more activist than mere liberal pluralism: maximalism can be a starting
point for writing and thinking about writing

I'd like to hear more about postromantic form in postcolonial contexts:
also it was the vicious and narrow Yvor Winters who makes the claim that a
certain kind of form always has a certain kind of cultural political
meaning (Winters among others of course): Jameson reading Perelman is a
good example of this problem

You maybe interested in the situation in New Zealand where 'whites' have
been called Pakeha for so long it has eventually become accepted by most of
the country as a way to describe non-Maori specifically white folk. Although
there are still those who are offended & claim them selves to be 'New
Zealanders' following the ol' meltin pot theory i guess. Still others are
'European'
Recent Asian immigration has spawned use of the term tauiwi - which really
means foreigner & it seems this term is becoming used politically to
describe 'pakeha' - which many find disconcerting. Pakeha was useful for
breaking down the racially neutral position & a hell of a lot of people
recently are discovering their irish/scottish/eastern european roots. But I
am aware the use of tauiwi  seems like a betrayal to those who see
themselves as sympathetic to Maori causes.
I do not feel strongly about it yet, but admit to certain difficulties with
being described as foreigner - tauiwi - whereas had grown up embracing
ethnicity Pakeha - cos it's sure as hell to far back for me to realistically
find any other national identity - except perhaps a bit of Tasmanian convict.

Yesterday someone wearing a tino rangatiratanga t-shirt ( a strong Maori
pol. movement) smashed up the 'America's Cup' with a sledge hammer. I don't
know how this is relevant - but makes an interesting statement & the
newspapers love this sort of thing. Guess i better go get me one,

Hope this reads as a discussion of your point Jocelyn

In voicing a support of  Robert Archambeau I wonder if the side of the
debate that writes off 'contemporary' non-language (and i use the term
loosely - i guess i really mean a tradition from Olson on - judging by this
debate) poetries is not just a bit mired in early marxism that managed also
to avoid/ignore the fact that there were other people who didn't always want
their battles fought by a (and i hate this almost-meaningless word) western
elite. I find a great deal to value in the poetry most usually championed on
this list and don't really read Heaney - but shitloads of Irish do -
internationally and he obviously fills a need. As Robert writes, why this
need for a reductive - even manichaen delineation of poetries.

It is easy to become infamous hating things, fundamentalists have been doing
it for years, and while i don't preach moderation  - & am incredibly
opinionated myself - (and am confident my opinions are the TRuTH) - i read
Walcott, Rich, Tuwhare, & others who examine a personal human condition
without (usually) entering into the language melee  (& may have to start
reading Heaney just so i can sleep nights) alongside the americans we all
know & love, sure I read them in different ways & for different things - but
christ if we can still listen to Bob Dylan surely we can read pretty much
anybody (except perhaps Rod McKewan (or however his name is spelt).

ANy not wanting to get peoples backs up - just concerned this thread could
begin going round in even tighter circles soon & trying to get it off the
rails a bit & other cliche metaphor.

Dan

btw like the Messerli anthology - maybe because i like big fat books,
probably affects my poetics far more than photocopied zines etc I can see it
& it can see me on the shelf & it always says you paid for this read it some
more - got to get $$$$ value out of these things - photocopies get lost in
office piles. Actually I read it more as from My side of the century - but
the other side of the world. Yuck.

Yeah, sort of like a white being called "gringo" in the Americas by some latin
american groups (even in the U.S.for that matter).

It's interesting how likeable the term "gringo" is (or seems -- or am I
wrong?) to the whites who get so dubbed (or maybe it's only when
self-dubbing, w/ some pleasant irony, that this somehow playful sense of
the term comes into play?)

A comparison, of course, is the Japanese "Gaijin" ("foreign [hu]man" --
the kanji character gai = the Chinese "wai" -- which could be rendered
more exactly, or more anciently, as "outside[er]").  So: from what I hear,
that term is by no means playful, in general (pervasive) use in Japan.

One thing I didn't quite get from DPSalmon's original post is what a
literal meaning (or even, what sort of sense) Pakeha might hold or evoke.

Anecdote:

Coincidentally, today I sent an e-note to a small group of South Asian
writers whom I'm joining in a "writer's critique" e-venture (sort of email
fiction-writing workshop: just these 8 So.Asians plus now moi, who'm
pan-Jewish in ancestral origin [E.Europe / Palestine], Calif. by birth).

The group is dubbed as of "So. Asian writers" -- & I thus found myself
tempted to self-describe as the lone (or so to say token) "gringo" in the
batch; then mentally edited that to "farenghi" [Hindi = foreigner /
european]; then (besides being doubtful abt. the transliteration) felt it just
as well to scuttle the whole adjectival issue altogether (rather than
seeming to make an issue of what they're liberally construing as a
non-issue in my case).

In any case:  Rolling into century 21, no doubt there'll increasing emerge
ways & contexts wherein we white guys find ourselves (surprisingly) the
exception rather than the rule, (even) in America.

Just a commendation to Jeff Hansen, for extending the notion of the
political and of identity in this discussion. So often it seems we discuss
ourselves as writers, or our positions within or without the academy, and I
really like the way Jeff put himself as person-in-family in the midst of all
of this. Used to be the phrase was "the personal is the political," but now
it often seems as if the political is the political and there is no personal
at all. Decentered self or not, there is something to be said for beginning
from the immediate, and getting wherever we get, around and about.

        Also in the midst of this identity discussion, I have been preparing
one grant proposal and helping with another, grants which will go before a
local (Tucson, Arizona, and Pima County, Arizona) arts council. The
categories of people recognized by this council, according to their
questions and statistics about boards, audience, and artists, which they
require, are only three:
white, hispanic, and other minority (not hispanic)
strikes me as a limited point of view about diversity

tauiwi - is more like gringo - Pakeha has become - an ethnicity - whether
some people like it or not. It is different again because of this countries
peculiar demographic.  I was mentioning it interms of Jocelyn's interest in
the study of whiteness.

By literal meaning - you mean direct translation? - well my dictionary says
- not Maori/ European - its practical (literal?) defintion is both of these
really - non-Maori of European descent. Though reactionary 'white' talkback
definitions range from ghosts, carrot and white turnip to other less
complimentary things.  I hadn't really intended to give a potted rundown of
ethnicity-New zealand - I'm sure there are folks with far greater knowledge
than me & I am wary of trying to define these terms from my limited lay
perspective.

Not really because as i said elsewhere it has become an ethnic identity in
itself - most white new zealanders (at least publicly) think of
themselves/ourselves as Pakeha - Paakehaa

Marjorie Perloff writes in response to David Kellogg:
"Minority communities in the 80s:  I didn't think this needed spelling out.
I am referring to simple fact here:  namely, check out any anthology or
critical study of "contemporary poetry" prior to that time and you'll see
that the issue of minority poets is simply ignored.  (read, for example,
Altieri, J. Breslin, P. Breslin, von Hallberg--you name it).  The
anthologies may have included, say, Baraka and one or two other black
poets but the notion of "Chicano poetics" or "Asian-American poetics" did
not yet exist.  This isn't a value judgement, just a fact."

If I'm not misunderstanding Marjorie Perloff's point, I think a number of
people would disagree with this assessment of minority writing prior to the
eighties. What I think she is actually saying is that other anthologists and
critics and she herself(?) were mostly unaware of "minority" writing that
began to strongly emerge with the various "liberations" of the late sixties
and early seventies (simultaneous with gay and feminist writing, as well) .
An obliviousness to the work of Victor Hernadez Cruz, Ntozake Shange, Jessica
Hagedorn, Sonia Sanchez, Etheridge Knight among many others who were
consistently published in books and periodicals is possibly more a reflection
of Town and Gown, "high and low" culture divisions-- unless there is an
assumed separation between the poets who make poems, and the critics who
create a "poetics" around the work - the latter sometimes not happening until
much after the fact. On the other hand, it's still not clear to me, if
Marjorie Perloff was familiar with any of the this writing, or whether or not
she is dismissing these and other writers out of an aesthetic principle --
 which I find a perfectly acceptable thing to do, as long as it's not
confused with an exclusive notion of "the one and only principle."

In response to another one of Kellogg's arguments, Perloff goes on to say:

"Therefore--and this is all I meant--the job of putting together an
"avant-garde" anthology in the 90s is very different from putting one
together in 1960.  Don Allen could just choose those poets that satisfied
what he took to be the New American Poetry.  Today, the anthologist does
not have that freedom because --witness what John Yau did to Eliot
Weinberger--s/he is under pressure to include X number of poets from this
or that grouping.  I am optimistic enough to think this phenomenon will
pass as there are increasing numbers of, say, Mexican-American poets to
choose from.  But at the moment it's tricky and so inclusions are often
somewhat cynical.  So--as I said in the article--the picture is clouded
and no anthologist can quite proceed freely as Don Allen could."

I'm again not sure of the point of view being expressed. Is her point that in
order to make an ideal avant garde anthology -- one that is not burdened by a
rhetoric of gender and ethno-identity issues -- we must wait another
generation or so for people of color and women to learn to write in an an
acceptable experimental mode?  If this is the view, I immediately want to
know who is the "who" that is determining what is acceptable here? With all
due respect to her reference to Charles Bernstein's criteria of substance and
form, might the presence of writers and editors of color, for example, bring
other criteria to the table that do not revolve around what Perloff sees
limited to issues of "grievance" and "identity," or, to further the net here,
what she and others have variously referred to and dismissed as "speech based
poetics."

Frankly I have a tough time with the "tongue cutter" character of that phrase
-- as if pure text is primary and that which is spoken is disposable, of no
significance, or resonance. If I understand what is being stated, cultures
that are orally
based -- which are often minority ones -- no matter how rigorous the
construction of their poems or songs, these groups or cultures are
automatically contained in a "less than" category. Personally I don't
understand why in a contemporary text that there is not room for voice(s) -
I'm daily surrounded by them and they give me great delight! And I am often
taken by voice as a textual component of a work. If I'm interpreting her
correctly, I think my own discomfort with Perloff's argument stems partly
from what appears to be this strict, exclusive  notion of text. It seems to
me that there is much more room on the playing field -- without implying a
return to a "me, voice" centered poem.

But, finally what I find most troubling is Perloff's implied point of view
that "we" must wait for minorities and others to catch up with what she
values in the way of experiment. I'm much more curious as to what happens
when the tables are turned. In particular, how have issues of "grievance" and
"identity", for example, impacted on the work of white experimental writers.
There has been much talk here of exp. writers not being able to find work on
account of issues of race and gender - which well might be true. But I hear
little of ways in which these issues -- which are vigorously alive in most of
the culture  --  have impacted on the making of experimental work. To be
quick and speculatively specific, what, by way of example, is the influence
of Cecil Taylor on line and structure in the work of Barrett Watten? If so,
how does he deal with issues of appropriation from Taylor or any "other"
cultural zone. What's the difference between cultural robbery, reciprocation
and respect? (This is not to suggest Barry's any one of them). In part I'm
wondering to what degree "experimental writers" are compelled to acknowledge
the larger cultural context - and what are the aesthetic issues and
consequences of that inner-change? ((Has anyone on this list addressed this
issue/process??). And, in a progressive English Department, shouldn't a
"white male" candidate who has engaged these issues in fresh way be
considered of more value than one who has not?

 I sometimes think "white"  artists/writers feel it is an option to ignore
this larger sphere. On the other hand this is not a position with which
minorities can very often "privilege" themselves. For example, I was recently
thinking, it's impossible to look at the photographs & texts of Carrie Mae
Weems and not be totally taken by her awareness and interpretation of a
history of both white and black worlds. For her, I don't believe one
functions without the other, and this largeness of vision gives her work a
major signifcance. In comparison, does the concept of "innovative poetics"
(which is the basis of this list)  make this awareness  -- or is it a
vulnerability to "the other(s)" and a willingness to acknowledge, wrestle and
change? --  an implicit responsibility of its project?

I guess what I'm hearing in Perloff's view is a mono-centric critical vision
of what constitutes a memebership in an avant-garde. Dropping the relatively
easy "grievance and identity" herrings, I believe we live in a much more
polycentric environment in which the containment of poetic and critical work
is a much more elusive task.

Cheers,
Stephen Vincent




 I do think Perloff rightly points out that these two criteria for
anthologies are cynically seized upon by probably "white" editors as
marketable, acceptable criteria. I'm just curious -- in terms of an ideal,
advanced anthology -- as to who she sees as the arbiters of what is
appropriate.   I assume Norton's way of "liberally" dealing with this
potential impasse is to give every major group an anthology - including the
current ones of Hoover for the experimental, Gates for the Afro-Americans and
on an on. (A parallel to this phenomenon is all various Smithsonian museums
that are planned up down the Washington Mall - American Indian, Afro-American
etc. etc.)  All this might look well on paper, but it avoids the issues and
great works of art that have occured because the various groups that
constitute this country are so historically inter-webbed.  Objectively --
especially in terms of making contemporary work -- I think it's silly for
anyone to imagine autonomous grounds for any particular group - experimental,
"minority" or otherwise. That said, given this country's history it's
understandable why many groups will want to secede into their own anthology
or museum.

I disagree with the last sentence above.  I believe it's Charles B who
noticed that the Norton, so far as poets born after 1950 goes, includes
not a single white man.  Our Quals list at Stanford is similar.  The list,
made up by a faculty committee includes Leslie Marmon Silko  Sandra
Cisneros but not Charles Olson or John Ashbery or Louis Zukofsky
If this isn't identity politics, what is it?  You will note, if you study
reading lists around the country that this is the case.  The post World
War II period has been turned into a kind of grievance list.

I empathise re working. What does this do for your writing, or to it?
Certaintly you do find a way to get it done. I write on the way to work and
on the way home I revise. There is no time to write at work. This means
that the way you write is dictated largely by circumstance: It takes me 15
minutes to get home so writing has to fit into fifteen minute blocks. These
blocks are separated by reasonable time periods: so the writing takes on a
disjointed tone ( if what is beng written is more than a few lines).

Writing can take a position in such circumstances (I am loathe to say
prioirity because I spend the greater part of most days working), but as
such it is a writing which is a victim of cirumstance, and to a certain
extent shaped by it.

Jennifer's Sonnet of Marbles and Brambles

Brambles have marbles by their bases, glass against knobby

They're in cahoots, marbles' burbled presence by Jennifer's toes.
One among each and each, each other. Jennifer's in throes
Of pain and anguish, delirious happenings. The sap drains
from Jennifer's waist down to the ground hoisted by the naval beach.
We're not going to the beach, to the ocean or the grotty sea. There are
no waves. Jennifer shaves her body, slides marble packets in and out.
They make rackets, Jennifer shouts with joy, delight, dissolution.
Proliferation of cornucopia of confusion, white wire tangling profusion,
the marbles are covered with dirt, whole villages of paramecia, stentor,
amoeba, nematodia clad and pillaged by Jennifer's souls.
We're not going anywhere, Jennifer-in-the-brambles monuments herself in

I always liked Heaney's stuff from the seventies, never gaga over them but
they're interesting and often political poems (*North* especially) - to
some extent I think his "formalness" is not passive acceptance but, at
least in his mind, an act of intervention: as he writes in "The Ministry
of Fear," "Ulster was British, but with no rights on / The English lyric:
all around us, though / We hadn't named it, the ministry of fear."  In the
end of "Punishment" he describes himself, in relation to a waoman's
mob-killing, as someone "who would connive / in civilized outrage / yet
understand the exact / and tribal, intimate revenge."  Perhaps its worth
thinking about the idea that the Irish have a different relation to the
English metric that Americans (I don't know, I'm just hypothesizing).  As
someone asked earlier, what's Eavan Bolamd doing in the west coast
experimental scene? - actually it makes a fair amount of sense to me
having talked to her a couple times - in her own context she's progressive
as hell and very involved on the grassroots levelof Irish feminism.  So,
what am I saying here? Well, I can't think of a single post-ww 2 formal
poet who I would list as a "favorite" but certainly several deserve a
careful, open minded reading.  I said earlier I didn't like "Diving into
the Wreck" and its true, I don't, but I've certainly gained by reading
Rich over the years, I mean, hell, she's interesting, the way someone you
meet might be - the poets we read don't have to be, transcendentally, on
"the right path," for me reading's usually more of a scavenging
expedition.

well i've been away for a day, oversaturating mself again, and return to
find all sortsa poetix things to discuss... you folks are great!... thanx
esp. to jeff hansen and others for taking me up on my request to elaborate
on other-than-academic contexts... i'd like to hear more too on the way
this shapes one's writing...

having just been hard at work on another list (litsci-l) a week or so ago
arguing that crossing the disciplines of "science" and "literature" (note
those quotes, puh-leez) requires both reverence AND irreverence, i'd hate
to see robert a's call for "respect" taken as a call for no critique (as
joseph l., chris a., and robert himself have indicated)... my point there
is equiv. to my point here, and even MORE controversial given that there
are great divides between (as among) sci phuds and lit phuds:   that being
critical of a particularly disciplinary knowledge is not quite the same
thing as being critical of a discipline's practitioners... and that the
best way to refrain from coming off as holier-than-thou in this regard is
to account for one's own institutional moorings...

that said, i might say, again and again, that it don't hurt none to be able
to critique poetry in terms of what works and what doesn't aesthetically
and culturally... i will be talking at the upcoming denver conference on
the problems with "craft" and "voice" as these are played out in the
creative writing classroom, and through a simple twist of fate (thank you
bob dylan) i will manage to poke a bit of fun at the way in which robert
frost, for example, gets used in popular versions of "the poet" (quotes
again)...

now from my pov, IN MY OWN WORK, 'taking account of my critical moorings'
has often amounted to *enacting* my theoretical claims *while* making
same... i'm certain that, if not my product, at least my intentions/motives
are likely to be appreciated in *this* forum... call it poetry, call it
criticism, call it neither... but at the same time, arguments twixt those
of you who, on the whole, tend to write scholarship in sentences and
paragraphs -- whatever the content content (as opposed to formal
content---if you'll permit me this slippage) -- *might* (i say *might*) be
taken to mean that you accept, without a whole lotta critical intervention,
your own critical moorings to varying degrees...

i mean, some might observe that marjorie perloff writes in paras, as does
stephen vincent, as do i (HERE)... this particular view is not meant as a
*criticism*, but IS offered (by ME) by way of (self-)critique... this is,
after all, the primary way of going public in this forum (some here, like
dbchirot, write in ways that are not so sequential---thanx david!)... but
what happens when you try to "do" theory and not "do it" the customary
way?...

we KNOW what happens---it's tough to get published!... or, it's tough to be
understood... or----

that's point the first, which i offer, unabashedly, as a wee bit of
mediation, intended to knock me and others offa our high hobbyhorses...

point the second cuts in a sort of opposite direction, requires a, well,
trip report:

yesterday i was down at u of i at urbana-champaign, where i used to teach,
to hang with some friends/acquaintances for a panel forum that was part of
their "cyberfest," a celebration of HAL from *2001:  a space odyssey* (HAL,
as i'm sure many of you know, designed and fired up down at uiuc, in 1997
(in the book version))...

anyway, the panelists:

n. katherine hayles -- writes some just incredible lit-sci critical, that
crosses multiple disciplines
richard powers -- a novelist who's written some, well, incredible novels
brad leithauser -- novelist/poet/essayist, i don't know brad's work
hans moravec -- perhaps the leading theorist of robot/ai technologies in
the world at the moment, at carnegie melon
bruno latour -- french sociologist of science, one of the beter known
social constructivists writing today

all moderated by michael berube... whose first book was on pynchon and
tolson, but who's written some astonishing stuff since on higher
learning...

needless to say, a very male-gendered discussion in all, but something
interesting turned up along the way, something from leithauser about, in
his opine, the current status of the novel, its refusal to really deal with
science and technology... i can't say that i entirely agreed with him (for
all sortsa reasons i won't detail here---though i *was* thankful to hear
him praise h. g. wells' work) but his point about the novel form is
methinks pertinent here:  that much if not most scifi in fact, though
'conservative' at the level of the sentence and in terms of structure,
nevertheless *is* radical in many ways in terms of ideas (some scifi does
both, of course)... and that the failure to value this latter sort of
literary endeavor vis-a-vis what is now called literary fiction results in
a hierarchy that perhaps we oughtta take a long hard look at...

but hold!---i mean, i appreciate the need for literary fiction too, and i
AM suspicious, as a poet, of 'junk prose,' of pulp... it's just that i've
read some damned good scifi on occasion, and LOTS of damned good COMIC
BOOKS... gotta come at it all with somewhat altered expectations though,
aesthetically and in terms of the cultural work that gets done... and yeah,
sure, with critical prophylaxis intact...

making any sense?... too much?...

looking to learn more from this exchange...

best,

joe

michael coffey, thanx for your reply!... you raise some good points...

part of my thing, both as an educator and as somebody who just talks with
other writers about writing, has to do with getting a fix on the states of
the arts, helping to generate some public recognition about what's going
on... i find it tough as hell sometimes to discuss, even with writers (esp.
established writers published in the larger publishing venues) the
situation in the small press world... the absence of a solid distribution
network, save for spd (and the web notwithstanding---heck, i've been making
arguments about using the web to promote distribution for five years
anyway), is something that needs, as i see it, more press---and i say this
regardless of the realities (read *numbers*) of poetry consumption and
production... i can't help but observe that---if ten years ago things were
bad, and today things are better---then it would be nice if things got a
LOT better!...

for example, to reference my own tiny little woes:  i've been unsuccessful
in getting seminary co-op down the street from me (one of the best academic
bookshops in the nation) to stock my first book... first thing that screwed
me up was the collapse of inland... a year later, although i could provide
catalogs and samples etc., they were unwilling to contact the publisher...
the first response is always, "yes, we stock local authors"... the second
response is NOTHING HAPPENS... what it comes down to is whether spd stocks
same (i understand now that spd will stock my press's inventory, and i
await that *material* transfer)...

the point here is that there are just not a helluvalotta options... i've
taken a few books up to woodland pattern, where the folks there were nice
enough to inventory same formally (i'm not looking to make money here)...
but in fact many bookstores don't WANT you to give them copies!... and
working on consignment---me trying to inventory my own 'stock'---well some
of you can speak to same better than me...

anyway... i appreciate your response... i wonder if the audience for
_publishers' weekly_ would care to read an article on the current
situation?... now i'm *not* the guy to write same---i just don't have the
background... but mebbe somebody in these parts is?...

best,

Two quick points in response to Chris Jenkins, David K and others:

1)  I am NOT NOT NOT saying that I hope after things shake out we can once
again have THE anthology.  That's the antithesis of what I said in the
article.  My whole point is that you can't and don't want to because there
are such varied poetries and not one avant-garde.
Moreover, I don't particular want any anthology--I never use one in class
if I can avoid it.  I go with David Antin's quip that anthologies are to
poets like the zoo to animals.

2) However--for those who do want to construct anthologies or reanimate
the canon (which has never been my sport--I hate the canon debates and
think they're a great distraction from real issues), you might as well be
upfront and define your own criteria.  Clearly, there is no anthology
without a principle of selection.  So all this talk of reaching out,
opening up, caring about others is slightly specious.  Reaching out to
whom?  why?  And why not to a million others?

Enough already!

This is a great example of the kind of contextually specific work done by
poetic forms that Franklin Bruno was posting about -- kudos to Michael.

The only danger in pursuing this kind of speculation (and we haven't fallen
into this trap yet by any means) is to end up concluding that only one kind of
form can do positive work in any particular context. It would be wrong to argue
along the lines of  -- "oh, well, traditional form is alright for the Irish,
but none of it can ever be any good in America" or the analogous "the Irish
ought to stick to traditional form and leave experimentalism to Buffalo and SF"
--(I don't mean that Michael has done anything like this, far from it, I just
mean that this _could_ be a hazard when thinking through a "contextualist
poetics").

[There are, by the way, a number of fascinating Irish experimentalist poets,
who very deliberatley choose innovative form as a way to respond to their
environment -- Billy Mills, Catherine Walsh, Randolph Healy, and Maurice Scully
spring to mind.  There is a review of some of them coming out (by yours truly)
in the same issue of the Notre Dame Review that has the Boland interview.]

.  I go with David Antin's quip that anthologies are to

I've been thinking about this. One strong defence of Zoos is educational/ We
have just had a simulated underground antarctic open up in this city.
Auckland. With live penguins. Many people are upset by the idea of sticking
pengies underground although there has been no formal protests.
I am uncomfortable with it, but feel there is a necessary trade off. If all
the people who go to it went to antarctica the resulting polution would be
horrific. And polution is a very real problem down there already. As one of
the last still relatively untouched environments on earth i believe very
strongly we should attempt to preserve it. Keep out all proposed
development, pillage, military shit etc...  Having access to the simulated
environment and seeing these penguins - as the real penguins are undeniably
the ATTRACTION - brings to many casual tourism punters the reality of a
place most of the world does not even think about. & particularly the
generation of school children who are being introduced to the antarctic as
the habitat of these curious & attractive creatures rather than the great
conqueable whiteness that ed hillary scott shakleton et al so valiantly
tried to CONQUER. Anyway my hope is some good will come of it, given all the
obvious problems many of have with captivity. The same argument applies
generally to the new generation of zoos as the current trend for recreating
environments etc increases the animals health, welfare & comfort.

& anyway there's a bad poetry metaphor here somewhere.

Sorry for a not-very-poetic query, but does anyone out there remember what

Subject:      DIVING Into The (Human) Zoo...

I'd like to address a couple of points re "Rich" (notice how we've gone from
Dove to Rich, as if this is the REAL issue "Dove" disguised). Marjorie's
point (which is very similar to a point Perelman makes in THE
MARGINALIZATION--and by the way, I will once again plug next saturday's event
at the SEGUE space ostensibly on Perelman's book, for, as I foresee it, the
discussion will not be limited to the book hopefully but to such issues as
these, and beyond ((like MUSIC, etc....))I digress)--anyway, Marjorie's
objections (echoed by Mike Magee) seem to be twofold here. First, she
critiques the poem because "It's so willed". In this, I would agree with
Jordan Davis that it very well may be a form of "mysticism to say that form
forces its message" in a way more "indeterminate" poetics do not. Or, again,
I'd point to the seeming parodox of "you HAVE TO let (as opposed to will) in
poetry" assuming that description as a way of becoming injunction, and that
the "will" vs. "letting" dualism may be as troublesome as the "mind" vs.
"body" dualism (and, no, I am not denying that we may need such dualisms at
least strategically, and at least in order to seem to be able to communicate,
or even "think"--but of course then there often comes the point where these
dualisms go meta and what's "at stake" is the "dualism" between "monism" and
"dualism" etc.). In any rate, I do not think that the form of Rich's poem
NECESSARILY undercuts its message and I guess this leads me (though not
seamlessly) to my second point.
The issue of what I will call "metaphysical conceits" in poetry.
Mike Magee (and Perelman in the MARGINALIZATION) contrasts Carla Harryman
favorably to Rich because the former is more
formally fluid while the latter is not. Specifically, Magee mentions "THERE
NEVER WAS A ROSE...." Now, I have been more interested and engaged in
studying Harryman's work than in RIch's (I am trying to avoid the dogmatism
of saying that I like it and will always like it better however) and yes I do
believe there's a lot of truth in Magee's statement. However, if one wants
the more FLUID Harryman it is, I believe in ANIMAL INSTINCTS and especially
VICE....although even in vice she's looking for that "adequate vice to LIMIT
the liquid of this voice" (i.e, she's trying to come to terms with WILL, and
forms or in Dan Salmon's analogy ZOOS?) and in many of the new pieces in
"NEVER WAS..ROSE..." Harryman does, far more than anywhere else in her
PUBLISHED ouevre (thinking of the GAME "poems" in particular) employ
something that, to me, seems very similar to "a metaphysical conceit"--it may
be done more SELF-Consciously than Rich does (though there is, I believe, a
way to read rich's poem as an allegory of its own form as well), but it is
not SO self-conscious that the conceit shatters before it is constructed.
This, in my opinion, is largely the strength of these new works of
Harryman's. I do believe that metaphysical conceits are hard to sustain, and
I do not WISH to make them into a STANDARD by which we judge poetry (by such
a standard of course I'd have to shoot myself in the foot and admit that I'm
just not a poet, etc.)--but I do think there is a thrill in constructing and
sustaining such an illusion and that it needn't destroy one's allegedly
postmodern love of "work that rejects easy closure" etc. Now, maybe
Marjorie's (and others') rejection (that may not be the right word) of Rich's
poem has more to do with its tight STANZAIC FORM than it has to do with the
fact that it employs such conceit(s)--Marjorie, I WOULD appreciate
clarification on this point, since they are two DIFFERENT criticisms---and if
so, we have to deal with other issues than the issue of "conceit", but I'd
like to extend this question of "conceit" beyond Harryman and even towards
more seemingly PURE "language poetry", which seems to me to be as "cooked"
(raw vs. cooked allusion) as Rich, and that therefore the silliness of Rich's
FLIPPERS may be seen as part of its charm and even power. I don't think
Rich's poem CAN be as written off as easily as say William Stafford's
TRAVELLING THROUGH THE YARD, partially because the former is less
conservative on a content level, or at least CAN BE (if we really do believe
in THE READER), in a way it seems the stafford poem can not....because, to
invert Jordan's claim, it's possible the MESSAGE can force the form without
being a form of mysticism.....
Well, just some thoughts....
And, thank you Jonathon Levin for the word "adjunctification" and thank you
Dan Salmon for the ZOO metaphor ("we're all inmates of the human zoo" or do i
mean "the prisonhouse of language" which might as well be "sestina") and
thanks Keith Tuma, Franklin Bruno, and Susan Wheeler, and Chris Alexander and
Joseph Lease (and others) for interesting posts in this in the last few days.

the only thing i would add to chris s's last post, which again i enjoyed,
is this:  that there are surely poems with teeth that are formally more
traditional... i don't mean (though i could mean!) traditional form... it
seems to me, as i'll say again and again, that different communities will
handle the form/content issues differently (and i've tried to suggest that
this happens in different genres---the novel, scifi, etc)...

i mean, there are other poems in _diving into the wreck_ that i find
effective ("trying to talk with a man"), but these poems  may be viewed as
didactic or some such from those who prefer (gross shorthand coming) more
nuance... i won't go on here except to say that yes, there are probably
more folks in the mainstreams who'll appreciate rich's work than, say,
mayer's... and that i'll continue to make the argument --- what i would say
amounts to fighting the good fight --- for recognition of aesthetics and
formal maneuvers such as mayer's (making that argument, that is to say, in
whatever institutions)... but this doesn't stop me from actually "liking,"
de facto, rich's poetry... in fact what troubles me actually --- just to be
a bit personal about it ---  is when i'm faced with somebody whose
aesthetic i appreciate, but who doesn't appreciate *mine*!... this is bound
to create all sorts of hard feelings... and yes---i've rec'd this treatment
in mainstream circles from folks i've met, in some cases from folks i've
met who are good writers... but hey -- i've also *on occasion* experienced
this sort of rejection in specifically un-mainstream circles...

anyway, i would like to address, briefly, marjorie's question (and i think
she's correct to keep pushing this point of selection) about 'reaching out
to whom':  from a strictly (and perhaps reductively) critical pov, the
issue of critics recuperating particular poetic writing can be viewed in
terms of appropriation (and i don't mean this in a 'bad' sense only)...
when we select what we write 'about' (speaking as a reductively-defined
critic now), we generally have mixed motives... we may find the work really
challenging aesthetically, or we may just plain love it and want to write
about it... we may find that the various appeals it makes to us, or to
others, deserve a more public appraisal (this is the 'function of the
critic' in more 'public intellectual' terms)... or any mix really----i'm
not trying to be exhaustive here... our motives may have to do with any
combination of passion, excitement, curiosity, justice, ______...

so ok:  why reach out as a critic to, say, the work of high school
students?... i can think of LOTS of reasons -- though if you'll permit me
just a bit of nasty sarcasm here, i already have plenty of so-so poems to
read from my student-writers! (i say this just to keep in mind that
teaching poetry is not the same thing necessarily as teaching writers how
to write poetry)... for one, reaching out to high school students in such
terms defines the status of poetry in those communities---communities that
will one day shape the readership for published poets, as well as the poets
themselves... i can imagine all sorts of interesting conclusions one might
draw, ethnographically speaking... for another thing, writing by
high-school students IS writing, deserves some attention on its own
account, and speaks to the cultural status of writing in this society...
for another still, i've come across some REALLY GOOD writing in my classes,
with no condescension implied or intended and with every aesthetic register
in place when i say this...

(some of you can help me out here, this ain't my field...

and the really controversial point:  why scrutinize the writing of high
school students (please don't take me to mean this latter as a monolith
either!) as opposed to the work of more, shall we say, polished or
professional poets? (eek, there's that p word applied to poetry again!)...
well, even if, as a writer, i am NOT so predisposed, i must observe that,
as a writer, there IS something to be gained from listening to and
examining writing that isn't so caught up with the various conventions of
poetry---i mean mainstream, radical, avant-garde, etc... of course, in
writing about such writing, critics will nonetheless be making a
*selection* from *among these sample of writing* to make whatever points
they wish to make... that is, and not to condescend again, there is an
aesthetics to consider here as well---which is that 'reach' to which
marjorie alludes, finally, coming in, if not the front, then at least the
back door (yes, like nature, as i mentioned to a friend backchannel)... and
to whom does such a critic write?---well, same answer as 'before':  to
other critics, other writers, who are so interested...

personally, i've found maria damon's work on teenage women writing (women
who live in the projects) to be quite revitalizing (_the dark end of the
street_, a book with which i'm sure many of you are familiar)... in fact i
need, as a writer, for folks like maria to keep doing what they do even as
i need, as a writer, for folks like marjorie to keep doing what they do...
and i do not see why such critical work need be treated in terms of the
implicit dichotomy through which i've advanced same, either, except as this
helps to clarify things (or does it?)...

best,

I'm deeply disturbed that I neglected to mention Experimental Musical

It's a very good mag, comes out quarterly, even seems to have reasonable
newsstand distribution.  Always worth looking at, though I don't buy every

In-Reply-To:  Message of Sun, 16 Mar 1997 00:05:51 -0500 from
              <LISTSERV@LISTSERV.ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU>

I've been a bad lurker, not having enough time to keep up with the immense
volume of learned discourse here, but once in a while I do try ...

Marjorie and others, about anthologies and zoos ...

I've always had a very similar feeling of distaste for anthologies and
desire to get students to read _books_.  And yet ...

1)  I confess that, despite all the obvious problems and flaws, I _vastly_
admire _all_ the Norton anthologies.  It's just _great_, especially for
poetry _before WWII_--before our time--to be able to _find_ something
quickly and have _notes_ to it!  Some of the notes are wrong or misleading,
but it's nice to have them anyway.  And, when it comes to other languages,
anthologies can be a real blessing, too--as a way to try to get started,
or to find some poem that you know everybody quotes (in French or German
or Italian or Latin or Hebrew or Portuguese or whatever).

2)  Aren't literary magazines, actually, anthologies?  You can see that,
here, the boundary is a bit fuzzy, isn't it?

I think Marjorie's last comment really _does_ address point #2 a bit.
She'd just as soon have _no_ anthologies, but, if we must have them,
let's be up front about our selection criteria.  The same could surely
be said for magazines.  I think we have less of a problem with magazines--
sometimes--because, after a while, you learn the "map" and know what the
_implicit_ criteria are for those magazines that don't make them
_explicit_ (which is of course the great majority of them and all of the
ones with prestige--_Poetry_, _Paris Review_, etc.).

But, insofar as one learns the "map" of magazines, doesn't one do the
same with anthologies?

I think Marjorie's initial problem, as I take it, is with what seems
to be internal and unspoken conflicts between criteria systems within
any given anthology (or magazine, for that matter?)--between the
"poetic" or "aesthetic" criteria and the "political" criteria of "inclusion"
or "representation."

And I took Marjorie's comment about Mexican-American poets, etc.--
did I mistake you, Marjorie?--as simply meaning that, the more of
these poets get published, the more eventually will be available to
editors to make decisions _not_ primarily motivated by the desire
for "inclusion" but rather some criteria not related to the identity
of the author ("aesthetic" criteria).  It's a matter of probability,
and this is precisely--or was, anyway--the hope of affirmative
action to begin with:  if we put up with this institutionalized
artifice for a while, there will _eventually_ be enough people from
various hitherto underrepresented minorities within the pool of
applicants (or whatever) so that one can simply make a truly race-blind,
sex-blind choice based on truly relevant (job-related, project-related)
criteria, because probability would now ensure that representation would
occur by default.

In the case of affirmative action, this didn't work because the
money wasn't put behind it, in the form of scholarships and fellowships
for students (of any ethnic or racial background or sex) who needed the
money.  And salaries in academics, though nowadays somewhat reasonable
if you're lucky to get a tenure track job, do not compete with salaries
in business or some of the other professions, which naturally seem
more attractive to those minority groups that have been excluded from
wealth for generations.

But the same logic _could_ reasonably apply in the field of choosing
poets to include in an anthology, it seems to me.  And I think, in general,
it _has_ been working--the canon _has_ been changing, and, in many cases,
the "new" works entering the canon have been quite _good_.

I couldn't resist posting that one, but only as a light aside. I am about to
marry an Ecuadorian national, and while she doesn't use the term, others in
Ecuador have with me. She explains to me that it's ok--not derogatory--to be so
dubbed. To me, it could have been a dubbing or a drubbing depending on how I
felt at the time. I explained to her (as a private joke) that we North
Americans (thanks George for the clarification) have a bad time with that term
because of its ignoble use in the Hollywood (and sphagetti) westerns (which
also provided a stereotype of the Mexican man I think).

All of that aside, isn't this thread, in its most general terms, just another
instance of Blanchot's principle of alienation?

Subject:      Blarnes oeuvre

Has anyone read the poetry (early, especially) of Eric Blarnes?  Controversial
to say the least - he was born in Belize in 1907, grew up in BENARES (believe
it or not) (family old-time colonial Brit) - became Hindu in 1929 - wrote under
pseudonym of Pravat Singh.  Poetry, for the most part, also Pessoa-like
take-offs on Eliot-like criticism of 30s anglo-Indian poets (unknown outside
India).  Here's a sample:


ELEPHANT SHADOW

Trumpet of the marvelous.
Bellicose traveler, you trample across
deep-chested dreams.

This is from 1923.  Blarnes was all of sixteen - completely isolated,
living in a convent school for Catholic daughters of (Portuguese, for the
most part) merchant families (he worked as a part-time tutor there for
2 years - the Siringarh Convent School of Benares).

I'd be curious if others have come upon this obscure work - Henry Gould
p.s. any S. Ray fans out there?

               The line is the individual of the social.
               The phrase is her habit.
               Words? There isn't that kind of hope.

                    Alan Davies, _Candor_, 1990

JOHN WIENERS reads and launches the publication of his journals
(just out from Sun & Moon) in Philadelphia April 11th. Alan
Davies, Bob Perelman, Joshua Schuster, others including myself
will each speak some words of introduction. ALAN DAVIES reads the
following day, Saturday, at noon. Thanks to Laura Moriarty we are
broadcasting Robert Duncan's 1975 interview with Wieners during
the week prior to the reading. This is at Writers House,
University of Pennsylvania. All are invited!

Not to horse a dead beat, but with this event in mind, and having
just read recent listserv posts (worst of the worst for months
I've been a lapsed lurker) I looked up "John Wieners" in
Hoover's Norton. And there he is. Now I could well be mistaken,
and/or naive to think otherwise, but little criticism seems to be
written on Wieners' work - he is, like many in the Hoover,
Nortonized (erstwhile sign of "tradition") sans the legitimacy of
a "citational matrix" (its absence the erstwhile sign of "innovation").
- The sign of modernist time is out of joint. Hoover's three paragraphs of
introduction to the Wieners selection stands him in the company of the
best (only) readers of Wieners' ouevre.

If listmembers know of writing on John Wieners that is
unavailable through usual library channels, I would appreciate
your posting news of it here (or to me backchannel). Of
listmembers, Douglas Messerli wrote a review - I believe so,
although I haven't found a copy of it yet - of Behind the State
Capitol or Cincinnati Pike in 1976. Bruce Andrews' review came
out in 1978.... I might be overlooking chapters of or
references/footnotes to JW in books by listmembers (please
forgive this haste) and by others, books that may be well-known -
but what I have in mind in addition would be smallpress materials like
Charles Shively's review of Behind the State publ the year it
came out, 1975 (in Gay Sunshine no. 25; I've yet to get hold of a
copy of it).

Which leads me perhaps too unceremoniously and inevitably to ask:
what role/influence has Wieners' work had on your own work?

This event that we're doing can't come near to what could be done
to properly address Wieners' (life and the context of his)
writing. Nevertheless, responses to this listserv query could conceivably
be read at the event, or possibly (speaking for myself) cited and
incorporated into the presentations for the event, with your
permission. At the very least a list of reviews and such, if any, from
hard-to-find periodicals might be compiled here for later use.
I'd welcome news/opinions/memories of any kind and from anyone.

Thanks in advance,
Louis Cabri

Organizers of this event also include Kristen Gallagher and Shawn
Walker

Have been reading the dialogue re: Rich & form & suchlike things a
bit patchily, tho w/ interest --

Chris Stroffolino's strand in this thread cites the recent (worthy)
observation of

an observation reminiscent -- jumping from form to notions of
word-sounds themselves -- to broader mysticisms in poetry (such as
that connecting sound & meaning -- a topic I think O. Paz [to name
one] did a good riff on in an old, perhaps well-known essay) --

This here will (I daresay) amount to pulling the strand out of the
thread (or, the thread out of the rug?) -- but I felt (on re-greeting
Jordan D.'s utterance thus afresh today) that it might not be
altogether amiss to propose this notion:

there is (can be) no poetry w/o mysticism

Seems axiomatic from where I sit.
Where (how) might others sit w/ it, I wonder?

In one of its earliest issues/incarnations, before it became
#4/Period(ical), Mirage devoted an entire invaluable issue to John
Weiners.
Contributers included Steve Abbott, Bruce Boone, R. Creeley, Alan Davies,
Bob Gluck,Fanny Howe, Kevin Killian, me too, among quite a few others.With
Wieners
poems. 1985. Beautiful work.

well that's perhaps where the trope breaks down? --

coincidentally, I spent a nice afternoon w/ friends in the DC Zoo
today (thus missing, come to think of it, some avant-garde poets
reading locally abt. the same hour) -- the bird house is the best.

First books targeted:

SM, by Jeffery DeShell, Blood of Mugwump, by Doug Rice,
The Mexican Trilogy, by D.N. Stuefloten, and Chick Lit 2,
edited by Chris Mazza.  It seems my book, Distorture, will
probably be the next to be targeted. After that, I'm not
certain who's next.

Even if this turns out to be good for individual writers,
the fact remains that it's bad news for BIB and for all
other literary academic presses. Please write letters of
support and do what you can.

Also:

An aside: All responses to me should be emailed to me
personally. After getting continuously flamed for punctuation,
and amassing further flames for calling a punctuation flame bad
netiquette (which it is: I worked for NetBooks for two years and
copyedited the Masquerade guide to the internet--I use such
neologisms accurately), I don't really see much point in perpetuating
arguments on listserv. Therefore, I won't be reading the list and
won't respond to messages on the list.

Still, Black Ice Books/FC2 is more important than the logistics
of any personal exchange. Jeffery DeShell is a great writer and
future DeShells deserve to be published. Let's all support free
speech and forget about our differences.

All the best always,

There's a review of _Ace of Pentacles_ by Kenneth Irby in _Kulchur_ 19,
and an interview with Wieners in _Chicago Review_ 26:1.

There's an essay called "To Celebrate this Broken Man: the Poetry of
John Wieners" at

http://angel-exhaust.offworld.org/html/issue-11/Wieners.html

and an interview with Raymond Foye and David Trinidad (with a few
paragraphs on Wieners) at

http://www.levity.com/hanuman/inter.html

I'd like to know if the issue of _Mirage_ mentioned by Aaron Shurin is
still available.

There's so little.

This is partly bouncing off Robert Archambeau's post...But also he was
stating something I've seen now so many times, on the list in the last
year, and in printed discussions by pretty nonmainstream folks, that I
take it to represent a new emerging consensus.

Which doesn't by a long shot mean everyone agrees with it; but there is an
unmistakeable swing in this direction, obviously a corrective to earlier
intolerance/militance..

The emerging consensus, a sort of Rodney King line ("can't we all just get
along?") is phrased in Robert's post by saying he likes both Perelman and
Heaney.  Similar dunciations of party-lineism can be found with increasing
frequency; in Rasula's fabulous Wax Museum book, someone is quoted in a
footnote as stating a similar warning on this listserv.  (I have the book
next to me, but can't find the reference right now.)

I have great sympathy with this; I also feel that the new consensus is
rising to dominance without as much discussion as I'd like...That was why
I posted about five days ago, pointing out in very simplistic terms the
two (now quite old) contemporary nonmainstream paradigms.  The one opposed
to get-alongism can be articulated, as I pointed out, in a sharply
left-political way, as in classic LangPo theory; i.e. Seamus Heaney (or
Amy Clampitt, or Philip Levine, or Adrienne Rich) work with form in such a
way as to deaden the sensibility of readers, whereas more challenging
formal work can empower by demanding that the reader become an active
co-creator of culture, polity, of the world she lives in.  I also have
great sympathy with this argument, which gets pushed aside without enuff
thought if we simply agree to have broad tastes.

And then there's another verison of the intolerant line.  This I've oftern
heard from friends who were poets or editor/poets.  This doesn't drag
politics in much, but might be seen as embodying a kind of Blakean "mental
fight;"  this attitude simply rejects having a lot to do with poetry that
is (argueably) too mass-commodified and unchallenging, as being without
interest or artistic force in our time.  I have sympathy with this impulse
as well...

I remain suspended in negative capability.  Which in this case may just
mean, I possess the negative attribute of being incapable of making up my
mind!...But I'm afraid of too easy an agreement to move on to a new
consensus, without engaging the harder, more intolerant lines that have
had a huge impact, as I see it, on the poetic space many of us now occupy.

This brings up losts of interesting stuff....I see some good points to
this critique, but...First off, it simply takes it for granted that form
need not be discussed; if the militant post-Olson line has even the
slightest legitimacy, then some of the formal quesitons are still real,
even if there are folks who feel that they do not belong to a white
western (male, straight, affluent) elite, and that it shouldn't talk for
them; second, the questions of the form of politics, are sometimes being
debated to clarify one's own practice as a poet (or editor, or publisher,
or reader!) and not necessarily to impose judgments or practices on
Others; third, as a revolutionary socialist, I think it muddies things
quite a bit to conflate Olson and various more recent practitioners in a
vague way with a somewhat fuzzy "early marxism."  The various
political/poetical formulations at issue here are more carefully worked
out, in many cases, than to deserve that!

My own practice on the left, as an activist, for 25 years, makes me VERY
wary of folks questioning my beliefs, on the grounds that by being
militant I'm forcing my values on some (less empowered) other; that is
almost always the argument of the right against the left, in my opinion.
My answer, which I feel is accurate, is: this is my struggle, I'm fighting
it for me, and for others who I'm in solidarity with; ain't tryng to force
anything on anyone;....and mutatis mutanda that applies here.

By the by, since Heaney has been figuring in this cluster of threads....A
story in the Sunday NYT yesterday announced that he is considered a
serious candidate for next president of the Irish Republic.  (Not
surprisingly, the republic considers political leadership open to anyone
born in the north, as he was.)  The story also points out that this is a
"largely symbolic" post (guess the overall governmental form is
parlimentary...)  Is that an ironic wink from history's gods, for all of
us who think poetry matters politically?

Well they no doubt, along with their zoo-keepers (the reflective ones
anyway), contemplate oblivion. Oblivion being that idee-maitresse (not
just metaphysical star-dust, mind you) in this one of the single
greatest periods of species extinction in the history of the planet.
That means now.

So go homo sapiens-sapiens to the zoo and peer side-long into that
post-evolutionary abyss.

But then again, I suppose, oblivion is not always pedegogically
efficacious; so, indeed, what do the poor creatures (the reflective ones
anyway)  . . . learn.

mark, you're probably already aware of this, but speaking as a teacher
(again!), i've seen the unreconstructed left argument (what teresa ebert
calls a "pedagogy of critique" over and against a "pedagogy of pleasure")
take precisely the dogmatic turn you yourself wish to avoid... i.e., 'in
order for my students to learn from me, they must accept this version of
the world'... in its worse manifestation, i mean---a sort of conversion
process, with the terms of said conversion already worked out (by the
instructor-authority)... and of course, this matches rather precisely the
old guard connoisseur-driven pedagogy, predicated on students tacitly
ceding that certain authors/texts are worth reading (and sometimes worth
reading *this* way, yknow) simply b/c the instructor sez so, goddammit...

just a thought as to how ideology can play itself out in the classroom in
undesirable ways... and perhaps in other institutions... the problem, old
or new, is that there is insufficient critique of pedagogical authority *in
the first place*... which is not to wish away instructional authority...

btw, i like that you're foregrounding the 'consensus' position in such
terms---thanx!... i think, in order to continue to turn these conflicts
over & over, we'll probably have to agree that it's not a 'consensus' folks
are after exactly, except as to our willingness to turn these conflicts
over & over!... i mean, the problem is more that certain positions get
drowned out, certain aesthetics go unanswered (and unquestioned), than that
we don't "agree" (or even "agree to disagree") about same... so it's really
more of a dissensus i'm seeking, anyway---which is to say that some 'we'
recognizes that there ARE actually controversies, regardless the direction
one turns...

best,

Joe: I'm interested in some of the places this thread is going, particularly
re: teaching. I think you are quite correct to point out that there has
been little if any "critique of pedagogicaly authority" as such, even in
some decidedly lefty pedagogical theorists, practitioners, etc. I can
think of Graff's teaching the conflicts book some years ago as an
example, where I believe that the difference practice of teaching
began to be articulated (as far as I know).
  What strikes me as odd in all this is a kind of elision in any pedagogy
in that no one seems to talk about what we think we're doing as teachers.
I.e., what the goal of teaching is?  This usually gets worked out in terms
of a dialectic, unquestioned, of indocrination or improvement. In that
those more on the right see teaching as a sort of rite of passage,
whereby the student learns "his" culture in order to more properly
live as a responsible student within it, such as Bennett's "virtue."
Or on the other hand those more on the left see it as some sort of
improvement: making better kids, better citizens, better folk in
general. The former has at least the benefit of being somewhat
practical, but I wonder about the latter. For what, exactly, are
we improving them?  As O'Hara would ask "for death?" What usually
gets taught more than anything else in all this is precisely the
pedagogy of authority, which more and more seems to me what the real
hidden goal of actually existing teaching.  This troubles me, but I wonder
what else we can do.  In an institutional framework, how do we avoid
teaching institutionalization?  Just some scattered questions, which
ultimately, I think conclude any dialogue re: pedagogy.
     Thanks, Eric.

I don't know: there are anthologies where the only honest principle of
selection (the only one that can be discenred and sustained) is the fact
of the editor(s): and sometimes, in a weird way, those are more honest
than the others

my previous post (on the fact of the editor(s)) might sound individualist:
I don't think it is (the fact of the editor(s) is cultural and historical
thick, specific): probable more honestly aware of materialist cultural
critique than most soi-disant principles of selection: that (speaking of
the phrase soi-disant, which Ashbery supposedly once used, as in the
soi-disant NY School): reminds me of why (apart from that old past/present
dichotomy) the NY School often seems more theoretically sophisticated than
the langpo discourse

Joe---
Yes, I think what you say below (and in the rest of your post) is very on
target...A number of folks have posted comments saying that not rejecting
and despising "mainstream" verse does not preclude critiquing it, engaging
in qualifications and debate, etc., and I think those points are in the
same spirit as your call for a dissensus...

I was beginning to feel impatient for someone to point to a form that such
a critique-with-respect might take; I feel that Marjorie and Chris S. kind
of began to answer that, by getting very concrete in their debate over
"Diving into the Wreck."  Lots of kudos are due to them, for a good
well-focused debate and for turning our discussion somewhat in a more
concrete direction.

well, I'd say yes ok.
I mean clearly there is no paraphrase etc
so the form of utterance is doing some
kind of work, whatever that form happens
to be. sorry if this is totally disjointed,
for instance. & as several people (joseph?)
have pointed out, a given form can be
enlisted to do various kinds of political
work in different contexts. so for instance,
we both know the argument can be made
for derek walcott's work being in a certain
kind of dialogue with english colonialism that
is differently but not less political than
brathwaite (see for ex terry eagleton's
review of midsummer); & along those lines
would be a sort of adrienne rich or even
marilyn hacker as "stealing the language"
argu. on the other hand, I think it's appropriate
to point up (& I think this is what was
being pointed up in previous posts in this
& the "disturbed" thread) the shortcomings
of those forms, too, particularly as they can
persist unquestioned in the work itself or,
that is, to the degree that the relation of
the form of utterance to meaning remains
unproblematized (form as vessel). ["it's
all-natural & packed with goodness"]. which
is not to imply that we don't at times see
a similar problem in so-called innovative
work, nor to say that problematizing that
relation means necessarily rehearsing the
question in the same way that, for instance,
I (think I) do in my work--a sort of dogmatic etc.
obviously I'm not talking "form" as rhyme
& meter etc anymore but something
broader. hope this is somewhat coherent--
I'm at work & things keep happening
around/to me to pull me away from the pc.

I hear this said a lot round here, & I know,
to be forever saying I'm bored is to admit
that I have "no inner resources"--but, for
what it's worth, one of the problems I have
personally with much of this work is the sense
of having things served to me on a platter:
identity/assertion/tale du jour served up in
a clear glass. whereas, to my mind, thought
involves a bit more work than just "yes, yes"
or "heavens I know the place" or that (god
I hate this) poetry-noise people make at certain
readings I get roped into attending from time
to time, a kind of semi-orgasmic "oh" that
signals "yes, I've been touched" & is sometimes,
for maximal effect, emphasized by bringing
one hand up to brush the chest...

possibly this is less a matter of critique or even
disrespect to the modes in question than disgust
with Patrons of the Arts. but though there are
greater complexities to some of these works,
they do seem to encourage these responses,
which bespeak a kind of "goes down smooth"
commodifying presentation of their ostensibly
political content. too, I have to question [says
"rhetorically"] the rhetoric of visibility &
representation that often supports this mode
of discourse: whether certain language-forms
don't distort what they ostensibly represent by
disallowing some forms of expression altogether.
the difference between chi-chi & mexico is
palpable. & there is the possibility, isn't there,
that arguments for access legitimate the
authority of the dominant culture. which isn't
of course to say "separatism" or "hold the [party]
line, please"--but does explain why a broader
acceptance on both sides is necessary. it's not
a problem with me if gay couples want to
live monogamously in the suburbs--the problem
starts when people think gay couples *have*
to live monogamously in the suburbs in order
to be "legitimate".

a language of "respect" is fine by me, though
I'm not sure what form that would take for
many of us, except possibly Absence of Malice.
I suppose that's what we're trying to work out now.
what does it mean to "respect", let alone "support"
writers whose works I don't have any interest to
read, even if we all "have an interest in" them?

Is there a term that's the equivalent of literacy for
consciousness?

So that an empathetic consciousness, able
to play and be open, is "literate", and this "literacy"
is more important, more a priority for the kind of
moralistic educationalist approach one finds in many
postings on this thread (or that is expected in halls
of learning)?

Isn't literacy a secondary priority to,
for example, raising consciousness that we don't kill
each other and hurt each other and needlessly miss our
opportunities for synergy with each other (human synergy in
action, or what we may call caritas)?

What is the bad
that results from literary narrowmindedness, or formal
conservatism *in writing*?

Can formal conservatism, or even
illiteracy, sometimes be the lynchpin of a kind person;
and to rattle it is to lose the kind
person, a destablising which can be like brainwashing?

(:i.e. the person who's been rattled, by one's negative
dialectic, can either go back to where they were through
amnesia, or to acceeding to the brainwasher's line: don't
very few go on to the independence of mind that is assumed
as the point of education, yet is rarely achieved?)

Cannot speech be seen as what's trying to come through the
writing, and a kind of consciousness-literacy of a speech
community be coming though?

Could this consciousness-raising be being impeded by
literacy education, our premium on it, and should itself
be impeded?

Is the argument against impeding literacy education
the need to have information written down where it can be
debated, i.e. law, because without writing you
could not challenge leaders in a speech community?

Then, has writing helped us challenge leaders?


I chime most with Fiona Templeton's post:

        "And that much as we may like messing about in the
        matter of our art, doesn't "aesthetic" become
        limited to pretty reshuffle or stylistic
        look-alike if that poetic matter isn't a vehicle for
        being able to see anew in all senses?  My terms
        aren't rigorous here either, I just think
        the question is important...."

And these were my other questions.

     CALL FOR ABSTRACTS/PROPOSALS for a two-session forum

STUDIES IN DEIXIS: WORKING THE MARGINS OF PRAGMATICS AND SEMANTICS

     for the Midwest Modern Language Association Meeting,
     Chicago, November 6-8, 1997, Ramada Congress Hotel

Abstracts are being accepted for "Studies in Deixis: Working the
Margins of Pragmatics and Semantics." The multidimensionality of
deixis, a linguistic phenomenon at the heart of communication,
remains one of the most intriguing aspects of human language. It is
impossible to imagine communication that functions without deixis.
Deictic elements such as pronouns, demonstrative adjectives, and
spatial or temporal adverbs, express a user-centered perspective on
time, place and person relationships in the social context of an
utterance; simultaneously, they denote formal grammatical functions
within an utterance. The aim of the forum is to bring together
scholars working on different aspects of deixis--from formal
linguistics to stylistics--to discuss the activity that occurs at
the intersection of language and reality/structure and function.
Publication of the proceedings is planned.

Abstracts/proposals should be a maximum of 150 words in length and
must be received by Friday, April 4, 1997.

I've loved reading manifestos ever since I first started getting
interested in this biz, which, for me, was William Blake and the English
Dept., circa 1971 or so. Blake, as some of us might remember, thought that
a good fight had the great virtue of clearing the air -- "without
Contraries there's no Progression" -- and thus provocative positions (ANY
provocative positions) might help us think through exactly what we feel
about the issue at hand. Shelley's (and Sidney's) "Defense(s) of Poetry,"
Pound's "Three Don'ts," Olson's "Projective Verse," Silliman's "The New
Sentence" -- these are all contentious manifestos, demanding response
and articulation, not just a lukewarm "Yes but I like Robert Service too"
(fill in the blank). So I applaud Mark's post here, and Dodie's earlier
one, to the effect that we can and should be arguing different principles
of poetics on this list -- with "respect" of course -- and beware of
premature synthesis. I mean, what's a poetics list for? Hopefully poetics
informs the work (which, by the way, is the OTHER thing we see too little
of here! and thanks to Henry and Alan/Jennifer for that); sometimes it's
just a necessary clearing of the ground before the work, sometimes it has
nothing to do with the work! But, hopefully it has some kind of wit,
style, humor, intelligence, i.e. "value" of its own. So, that said . . .

. . . I have a lot of difficulties with the premise that Mark and Joseph
advance above. Apologies in advance to the avant-garde gods -- I certainly
wouldn't want to be seen as "conventional" -- but for me, Creeley's
ancient dictum that Olson takes up in "Projective Verse" solved a lot of
problems. That is, CONTENT (however defined) has to start the process --
something is the world is perceived (or "apperceived," as Whitehead would
say) -- and this "thing" then creates its own form, which could be
endlessly mutable and random, or could be a sonnet. Starting with an idea
of form, for me, trivializes the work -- it brings in too many ancillary
considerations, it provides work for academics (!), it ultimately deflects
attention from the WORK, itself. We follow, if we do, a poem, or book of
poems, through to the end because we're momentarily entranced, we want to
know what happens, we feel it's important for our lives, that our lives in
fact can't proceed until we finish the poem -- yes, of course we help
create the meaning as we read, of course we're active participants, but
that doesn't arise as a consequence of FORM, it arises because there's
something there that preceded the form, that has demanded to be
articulated in (yes) just this form, in just this way. (Was it Duncan that
said "out of deep need"?)

In other words, it's not an exercise.

So arguing about traditional forms versus post-modernist forms, Rich
versus Harryman, etc., I don't know, I just don't see it. A poem "works"
-- or not -- for other reasons.

But of course I welcome critique . . .

one problem with conversations about form and innovation is the desire for
caricature:

it is not precise to say traditional equals conservative:

and:

it is not precise to say traditional does not equal conservative:

so many are suggesting that we start with innovative/traditional with
regard to what and why:

and those thick specific descriptions can be starting points:

re: why reach out and to whom?: well, if I may sound Black Mountain
(please let me):

the particulars of the poem generate the poet's need to reach out: for
example Duncan felt he needed to reach out to George Herbert and what
would it have meant to say no that is conservative

my whole point is that form is not an exercise: that it must be a
discovery and must embody a real need


also I don't think (I'm writing a bit fast this morning) that those were
the paragraphs from Mark's post that I included in mine

eric, i think one way to institutionalize things in constructive ways is to
consider turning a certain amount of responsibility over to students... to
ask students to take an equal share of responsibility in their own
educations... how this plays out in particular classrooms will vary... but
in general, when i use a term like "student-centered," i mean instructors
learning to let go some... learning to construct courses in which, for
example, students have a hand in constructing "assignments"... which, btw,
is *not* what is meant, generally --- as i'm sure you know --- when admins
use the term (what they mean is that students are now, as consumers,
entitled to "excellence" in education --- entitled, that is, to the sort of
education that corporations expect of good consumers)...

i hope this doesn't sound like a dodge on my part, as an instructor... i'm
willing to accept responsibility --- i just can't be held completely
responsible for a desire to learn... albeit i *can be* responsible for
creating an environment in which such desire --- its absence or presence,
its type and degree of presence --- is an accessible, active part of a
course (or discourse)...

i have much in sympathy with the left here in general, and not with the
right, insofar as what my ultimate agenda is (a sloppy version would be
something like 'helping to build a better world' --- which includes the
world of education, mself)... but certainly there are abuses of
instructional authority on both the left AND the right --- if we take
"left" and "right" to mean where our more specific political sympathies
lie... once some folks get to lording it over others, they become real
dictators --- no matter their party loyalties... of course, "lording it
over" varies in terms of amount of institutional sanction rec'd... a
"strict" prof is often viewed positively --- esp. by 'advanced' students in
the sciences (believe me) --- *but* if the prof is strict about inculcating
the "masterpieces" of "world lit," she will probably face fewer problems
from the admin and from students than if she's strict about theorizing the
nature of the educational process itself... sad to say, more functional,
consumer-oriented types are likely to regard this latter as mere
navel-gazing...

The zoo-nalogy has never really persuaded me and the more I think about it
the more I am troubled by its implicit organicism.  On the face of it,
the comparison seems to depend on the idea of representativeness: two
polar bears, two poems by x.  Poems, however, are not individuals but
always exist in multiple states, whereas polar bears are both unique
entities and members of a reproductive and ecological class.  Sure,
both poems and polar bears originate in situations which zoos and
anthologies cannot hope to replicate; but the being of bears is
altered, probably for the worse, and I do not think of poetry as having
the kind of ontological status which can be distorted in that way.  Of
course, anthologies which aim for representativeness carve up a poem,
the work of a poet or of a group, in ways which are usually unsatisfactory
to those who are devoted to the uncarved texts and contexts.  But when
Duncan in "Ideas of the Meaning of Forms" appeals to his "immediate
concerns in living" and to "inner need" as justifications for Allen's
anthology-groups, he dismisses the possibility of reconfiguring the
poetry of his contemporaries in ways other than that which is dependent
on his private understanding of his own social network.  This network
colludes with his poetics of forms, and in the context of an anthology
substitutes for it. The collusion is ultimately a kind of organicism
which like the zoo analogy is nostalgic for the unbroken body and its
radiating concentric textual affiliations.  Anthologies can do a better
or worse job of sampling poets; to repudiate such sampling I think
requires more than a clever quip.  I think anthologies can help
re-frame poems in ways which are responsible to contexts but which
do not make essential claims for definitive representation; they can
serve the end of promoting poetry when understood as provisional
collections, works in progress.  They should never serve as an evasion
of the work of discovering and questioning principles of selection,
but instead should be an invitation to do so, which is only what we
have been stating or suggesting.  Comparison to zoos rests on questionable
premises.

From James Scully, _Line Break: Poetry as Social Practice_ (Seattle: Bay
Press, 1988)

"We need a provisional, intramural history of poetic technique: one that may
not explicitly engage the subtler extra-poetic conditions of poetic
practice, but that will approach technique(s) historically, dialectically,
rather than as a succession of devices or still lifes.  The absence of this
history is disabling.  Writers (not stylists, who are locked in
synchronicity) do assume a technical history.  Yet in our time there has
been no serious attempt to theorize that history.  When and where a history
appears, it is as an encyclopedia of discrete fragments and arbitrary
givens: a catalog of forms in space.  The reasons why there is no such
history are many and complex.  For instance, even my generalizations about
technique are based on the unarticulated technical history that informs,
_and is a consequence of_, my own technical practice.  There is no
metahistorical source of illumination or (re)construction.  I understand and
reconstitute past technical practices by the light of my own practice
(itself 'born' among untheorized absorptions), but that's all any writer
does.  The point is, this discussion must take place in a primitive
half-light.  We haven't even begun to _desire_ a shared understanding of
what it is that we have been doing.  Or why.  There is no Darwin or Marx of
poetry.  Not even a L=E9vi-Strauss.  Poetic technique, like a de rigueur=
 dead
saint, is shrouded in more mist than the relations of (economic) production
ever were."

"Respect" and "support" of course are completely different things from
"like", "admire" or even "advocate".

To respect a work implies an understanding of the poetics which underpins
it. If you can understand what impells a poem or poetry, see the logic and
agree that the logic is sound, I think you have a degree of respect, and
the potential for support; whereas if you see the logic and feel it is
flawed in any way, there is unlikely to be any respect and this certaintly
precludes support.

You can have a language of respect without liking, admiring or advocating,
but I don't believe you can do so without an interest. It should not be a
given that it is necessary to respect or support for any given writing, but
this doesn't rule out having an open-minded interest to begin with.

No it doesn't. I believe strongly form should be discussed, but don't expect

I  think your post Mark, while articulating your position well, misses
Robert's point. I saw no such pat homile (could be the name of a c&w poet)
as 'can't we all just get along'. Rather a discussion of the different
values of other less 'experimental' poetries.

The point i made earlier about old marxist politics - i think is partly
reflected in your statement below. My question is - What good left wing
politics if the only time you think they are valid in poetry is when linked
up with 'language' poetry. Surely politics is about change, and for change
you need to reach those people who make change, or pull to gether enough to
shout loud enough. So Walcott, Heaney, Rich etc are written off as not
adressing adequately questions of language.

So their poetry is not of your taste... I think you can articulate that
without dismissing their value to the THOUSANDS of lesser committed poetry
participants who glean at least a little political empathy - be that gender,
race or colonial issues from their accessible populist art.

I am just aware that many talented, educated non-White poetry readers i have
come accross dismiss langpo as WHITE & elitist. While i do not think this a
fair accusation & argue my case for langpo frequently, there exists a strong
distrust - and you have to admit that on the surface it is a white movement.

I am aware of the necessary value of langpo politics - but what good from
sitting on the top of a hill & never going down to drink with other folk &
by this action never making them feel welcome in your turf.

I hope none of us are quite in favor of "starting with form," so that we
have no interest in actual human experience!!  But please remember that
many a Richard Wilbur fan will look at some of the following and say,
there is no real human experience there, it's only about form (I know,
because I've had it happen in conversation more than once):

Finnegans Wake
The Kingfishers
Spicer
anything by Zukofsky, practically
Rene Char
Mac Low
Joe Ceravolo


Now, I can't speak for anyone else, but that's a pretty basic reading-list
of some works that have shaped me, and that I don't think anyone should
consider beyond the pale, too lacking in contact with human experience.
When I speak of nonmainstream wrk, that's the ground level from which I
assume we're building....Is that a group of poets and works too
preoccupied only with form??!!! Yee gods!

Thanks, Eric, for bringing some of these points back to teaching & its
responsibility.  There's the rub, eh?

>  What strikes me as odd in all this is a kind of elision in any pedagogy

I can only speak in personal terms, and this trope of improvement is
necessary to these terms: I can only hope that they are better for the
experience after putting in the hours.  But by better I mean that they are
considering more alternatives, making more conscious choices, questioning
their assumptions, understanding a larger dimension (political/ethical/etc.)
in these choices and assumptions.

I try to do this in a workshop by giving them a huge breadth of "poetics"
texts (journalism as well as theory, and from throughout the 20th century
terrain).  Because I feel I'm not much of a talker I have never felt
comfortable with holding forth, and I still have not found an adequate way
of questioning the entire (learned, albeit invested) approach to poetry on
the part of a student.  I also always begin discussion of a student poem by
asking what operations it's employing, as a way of orienting us to it,
rather than vice versa and running the risk of skewing all work just to
please my own aesthetic/politics.  But by reading all of these questioning
texts, students generally begin to raise a lot of the bigger issues, and
perhaps 80% of the time begin to question themselves, too, before the other
students get the chance.  They give each other material on a lot of
structure aspects (space, metrics, traditional forms, etc.), and here too I
supplement with many sides of various arguments around what appears to them
at first glance as cut-and-dry "purely formal" approaches.   I'm more like
an indulgent mom that I want to admit: I don't ever assign them say a
sonnet, but I like them to have the whole array, the whole toy chest, at
their disposal.  What I do give are a lot of throwaway in-class exercises
(chance, etc.) to help melt the deep-freeze both graduate and undergraduate
writers can lock into when honing this kind of ambivalence about every
"speech act."

  In an institutional framework, how do we avoid
>teaching institutionalization?

Included in the texts I make them read are a lot of critiques of an academic
context for poetry.  Students usually come in after reading these impatient
with the whole kit&kaboodle, and keen on altering the idea of a workshop.
Once again undermining the teacher/writer spell is a big relief to me.

The biggest tangle in this though, privately, is that sometimes I leave a
classroom feeling more like a resource room than the kind of critical guide
I learned so much from by working against in my own edification.  To
counteract this, I comment and steer a great deal individually, ever
bracketing with my own bias.  It often feels ridiculously labyrinthine, this
hobbled process o.

Someone noted a week back or so Simon Frith's piece on "value" in the
Chronicle of Higher Education 3/14.  He wrote that students "should have to
think about evaluation and why it matters," but the only example he can
offer his participation in a UK jury that awards a music prize and its
agreeing that "our decision would be determined not by vote but by
persuasion."
This conjures articulate defenders of abysmal poems, in the classroom,
dissuading other students from their good questions.  In truth, I admit, I
do judge some poems abysmal, and do my best to explore those good questions.

No doubt this has been discussed ad infinitum in years past on this list and
it's been skirted since I signed on (I remember some helpful postings from
Dodie), but as someone who went through no MFA mill except now to teach in
one, ideas on teaching in an era of etherized value would be much, much
appreciated.

ah david, thanx for that!... how's the rest of that  book?...

this is why (and where) the question of poetry opens to that of
technology... i would think it impossible to discuss "technique" without
reference to what's been going on in history of science/history of
technology, and for that matter, without reference to broader sociocultural
trends in the workplace and elsewhere (and texts which have plumbed, again,
that "lit-sci" interface)... of course poets have, depending on the poet,
been more or less attuned to such developments...

Before I get cast as the Pat Boone of poetic blandness, smiling sweetly
in my white bucks, let me say this: what I've said is not that we should
appreciate all poetries equally everywhere and always, nor is it that we
should simply play nice -- what I've been asking for is an investigation
of the plurality of tastes.  That is, if someone out there can both
assent to Perelman's or Olson's or Pound's dicta, and still say "yes but
I like Robert Service too" (a low blow, that, makes me sound
unbelievably sniveling) -- what is at work in this person's act of
distinction?  What work do these (apparently contradictory) aesthetic
commitments involve, in a particular context?  What I've been asking for
is an exploration of this kind.

["pause for a brief inquiry"]:
I heard last night that SUNY profs, with
all negotiations stalled, have been working
9 months without a contract. is this true?!
I admit that I don't always follow the list
so closely, but surely I would have heard

Subject:      FC2/BIB funding cuts
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

To the list:
Publishers Weekly (3/17/97 issue) has a story about how Rep. Pete Hoekstra
is calling into question a $25,000 grant to FC2/BIB. He is the chairman of
the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation. He says that he is
upset by the sexually explicit material which is "an offense to the senses
of this Subcomittee and, I would presume, to the taxpayers that have been
unwittingly forced to pay for it." (I suppose that explains that curious
pain I've been feeling in my shoulder.) He is also questioning a $45,000
grant to the Unit for Contemporary Literature at Illinois State. Seems he
is also upset that they are going to use this money to put up a Web site
showing their smutty books.  Meanwhile, the university and FC2 have a week
to produce requested documentation for the Subcommittee. There goes some
of that grant money, but then that's almost certainly the intent.

Story is by Bridget Kinsella. Perhaps Michael Coffey could post the entire
article to the list. Not so coincidentally, there is another story on the
same page about Wole Soyinka being charged with treason by the Nigerian
government. They claim he is connected to a series of bombings of army
installations.

Not too much when you just hone in on individual writers writing their
individual poems.

But what happens when such narrowminded people sit in positions of
authority over other people's writing:  editors, teachers, publishers,
grant judges, etc.  Having experienced more than a few narrowminded
editors, teachers, publishers, grant judges, etc., I can say it is
wonderful if they like you and you jibe with their tastes, and pretty darn
miserable when you don't.

thanks for a good & serious response, demian.
I like your thoughts on "respect", though honestly
I think the poetic logic which informs some of
the work I (& others) mentioned is flawed; & as
much sympathy as I may have with the impetus
of the work--be that irish nationalism or any of
various feminisms or an attempt to increase class
consciousness--I am suspicious of much of it
on the basis of the subject relations it sets up &
the relationship of content to form, which can
seem more like language as hand-truck, loaded
with pre-determined meaning, than a deep encounter
with the medium & its relation to meaning (which,
yes, can happen outside of what we here term--
most recently--"innovative" work).

I guess I'm suspicious--though probably not so
dismissive as I let on earlier--of a poetry that is
primarily attractive to me by means of what
it says, the sort of gestalt of political ideas
visible through the poem, or which the poem
stands for (acts as a representative of), than
what the poem itself actually says, i.e., the poem
itself as an evolution of meaning as inextricable
from form & vice versa. & if I'm not or if I
try not to be dismissive of such a poetry, it's
more because of my enthusiasm for the kind
of social relations of which that poetry partakes--
as with joe amato's mention of poetry that appeals
to the experience of vietnam vets, poetry that they
can "relate to" directly, or (ever been to a marilyn
hacker reading?)--than out of enthusiasm for
that poetry. & when I am dismissive, as often
I am, it's at least in part because, outside of the
immediate social context (i.e., a way of bringing
people together physically), I think there's more
benefit in reading a good provocative essay or a
book which engages those political questions
specifically & in detail, than in the usual sort of
head-nodding recognition.

I guess, though, that when I asked "what does
it mean to respect/support etc", I should have
specified that I was thinking in more practical
terms, viz., what form, in practice, does this
"respect" or "support" take? it's a very fine
thing to announce it here ["everybody I love
you"], but what is actually being proposed?
will we teach these poets? buy their books?
read their books? attend their readings? invite
them to read with us? I'm not sure I'm willing
to do these things. I've read enough of heaney
& walcott, for instance, to last me; & enough
"hard-hitting" "tell-it-like-it-is" american "poetry
of protest" to consider reading more. I own this
could be my intolerant streak showing--I do
have one. [straight edge = "hate edge"]. but,
he asks in a friendly manner, how far, then, or
where specifically, do others intend to go?

A POETRY READING & Reception

TOM MANDEL

Sunday, March 23, 7:30 pm
at the Chax Press Studio
101 West Sixth St., no. 6
(enter on west side of warehouse building, the middle of three doors)
no admission charge
Call Chax Press at 620-1626 for more information

Tom Mandel's book of poetry, Prospect of Release, was recently published by
Chax Press.

Tom Mandel was born in Chicago in 1942, the American child of Austrian Jews
fleeing Hitler. He was educated in Chicago's public schools and jazz/blues
clubs, and at the University of Chicago. He has lived in New York, Paris,
and San Francisco, and now resides in Washington DC.

Mandel is the author of ten books of poetry. His first book, Ency (Tuumba,
1978), was a foundational work in th early history of language poetry.
Recent books include Four Strange Books (GAZ, 1990), Realism (Burning Deck,
1991), Letters of the Law (Sun & Moon, 1994), Ancestral Cave (Zasterle,
1996), Prospect of Release (Chax, 1996), and, with the late Daniel Davidson,
Absence Sensorium (Potes & Poets, 1996).

The poet Ron Silliman says of Prospect of Release, "These are the most
intensely felt poems I have ever read."

from Prospect of Release, by Tom Mandel:

Subtle, handsome vanity visits me.
Hands large, fingers long, face modeled
and content, a bare spark binding to
release, soul dances in the prospect.

Hands drew across his face. None to
comfort me but him, and he is gone.
My reverence is modeled on his absence

the absence of his lips and eyes. Dust
entered a window behind his head,
whirred in a shaft of Autumn light.

Winter light. Silent, a message it did
not bear but now suggests, long settled
like an issue, election or argument,
cleaved rock, or two that never joined.

Damn good, actually.  In my view, one of the best books of its kind in
recent memory, up there with Silliman's _New Sentence_ tho not nearly so
well known.  Scully takes his Marxism very seriously, and to good
effect.  In the essay quoted, he distains what he calls "stylistics" in
advocating an approach to form deriving from Macherey and Althusser.
Buyt despite that, the prose is never dry.

Glad you alerted us about this. Now, if Bromige claims that I was a
co-author of his scabrous unpublished novel _Piccolo Mondo_, I want to go
on record as saying I didnt have anything to do with it. In fact, I could
not finish reading it. It is not only gratuitously pornographic, but it is
also politically insensitive. I wash my hands and declare innocence.

A very large question to which I can give only this small answer. As a
reviewer of nonmainstream poetry, I try not only to place reviews with the
magazines and reviews which serve this group (I know these are all very
general terms, but I'm trying to be brief), but with more mainstream
journals as well. I only review what I enjoy and fully understand so my
reviews are written more from a descriptive than evaluative perspective.
This, I think, helps readers unfamiliar with innovative poetry to find a
thread which they can follow. I don't how "far" this goes but I hope that
it is supportive.

cheers,
Steven (proud winner of the Golden Shamrock Award)

Yes, apparently he did this as a joke for some TV music awards thing, but
it got him in a hell of a lot of trouble with his Christian TV audience for
his daily sunday program (somewhere) and apparently, in thinking about the
censorship he's gotten from that audience, he's rethinking some of his more
doctrinal assumptions about appearance vs. reality, and humour.  A happy
ending.

Isn't your "(however defined)" precisely the issue, Joe? You can read
the Creeley at least two ways, one of which blurs into a kind of sloppy
Platonic dualism, the other of which sees these two domains (of
thinking?--is this an ontological problem--or a taxonomic one?) to be
immanent each within the other. And it is important to keep in mind
(as someone--I think Professor Perloff--pointed out) that form is NOT
rhymes and quantities, but--what?--a kind of thinking? (your "work"?).

After reading a hundred books of poems for an omnibus review for
University of Tornto Quarterly, I was sharply reminded of what both
Olson and Creeley were concerned to get away from--that self-satisfied
display of the poet's skill (at doing what's been done). It
doesn't really matter, finally, whether the device is the perfect
metaphor or the perfect syntagmatic distortion. The YAWN is the same.

YES to the Duncan (tho now I think maybe it's originally Pound), but
is there any way to separate that "need" from what you're calling
"form"?

Contrarily,
Mike

Once again, I find all the talk about "formal innovation" and "challenging
the reader" vs. "manipulating the reader" with "conventional rhyme and meter"
set in a "political" context of "radical" and "conservative"

to be

pure

unadulterated

yimmer-yammer &

hogwash.

I refer you all to Baudelaire, Villon, or recent hip-hop "breakthroughs".
I refer you to Edgar Poe & Valery.  I refer you to Whitman's constancy, his
readable expressiveness.  I donate you to Emily, if you dare stand in the
same room with her.

You are still living among the tombs of John Crowe Ransom & pals, the 1950s
and Wilbur's (and Ashbery's, and Lowell's, and Rich's, and Ginsburg's & all
dat generation's) SLEEP.  And they snore on the veritable edge, the periphery,
the surface, the shim, the slag, the nothing, of what poetry is all about.
Your idea of "conservative form" is not even THE BEGINNING of what it's about.

I will allow all manner of bravery and daring and innovation - but I will
judge by results - the impact of the whole thing.  Show me something found
and won - not something mumbled and put-over, and justified as "experimental."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        I've been following this mini-thread about form as exploratory or
predetermined with some interest, and I did want to point out that there
is, in fact, quite a bit of interesting avant garde poetry that works with
certain elements of predetermined form. The non-intentional methods of
Jackson Mac Low, for instance, have often used a variety of pre-determined
mathematical, computer, and other techniques to shape the form of his
poems, and indeed much of his work revolves around such structures.
Similar examples--Silliman's use of Fibonacci sequences in, I believe,
Tjanting (I'm at work--no books in front of me), Tina Darragh's use of the
dictionary. Given time, I could probably come up with more--but I've got
no time this morning.

        In any case, the relation between exploratory and pre-determined
form is quite complex--in some cases, predetermined forms of various types
and degrees can certainly be exploratory and about discovery.

henry, the only possible way i can take your more recent provocation is
thusly:  that we're busy, around here usually, talking *about*, not
actually enacting, poetry (whatever this latter)... and i don't quite
understand -- though i trust you have some writing in mind here? -- how
our, well, more critical demeanors are going to "measure up" or some such
to poetry in poetic terms... or to be a bit provocative mself,  how poetry
is going to "measure up" or some such to criticism in critical terms...

(if you'll permit me this one archaism) my heart may lie with trying to
write a poem... but i'm still not about to dismiss all commentary as merely
ex post facto... as a matter of fact, i don't think we're all still barking
at the new critical moon, either... so though i believe it's correct to
point, say, to hip-hop as apropos of what's happening these days --- the
spirit of your post (?) --- i think it's probably not so helpful to dismiss
the chatter in these parts as "hogwash"... seems to me this is a function
of how one comes to these regions --- and while i'll allow that there are
all sortsa motivations possible, i take it as an article of faith that most
of us are here to learn something from one another...

which again is not to suggest that you or i don't have a sense of humor...
i know you do, and i do too --- so to return the gesture in kind --- and
what i've been trying, in so many words, to say --- is that, dear henry,
your post strikes me as, well, balderdash...

best, really

Gary's response is excellent, and very helpful...I do feel though that
Antin's remark was more than a "clever quip" --to some extent it was a cri
de coeur; it reflects a way poets often feel, when dismembered in order to
be remembered.  It's a reasonably serious feeling in relation to one's
work (one's self-construction); it needn't be taken primarily as a snide
attack on anthologists; if you place yourself at the existential point of
the writer being anthologized, it has some honest resonance (like any real
cry from the heart, it's validity doesn't mean that it isn't also a
limited point of view; on the contrary of course it emphasizes its
partiality as a pserspective!)

Well, I'm not sure.....Uh, you say I missed soneone else's point, but none
of your arguments in your posting to me seem to be replying to positions
I've articulated...I explicitly said that the "tolerant" position is one
with which I feel a lot of sympathy; the poets you firmly list as ones who
may not be to my taste (Walcott, Heaney, Rich)..I haven't been disparaging
'em here (on the Poetix list), I specifically mentioned that I have
sympathy with ALL these positions;,,,that's one of the reasons I was
trying to get more debate stirred up (--this thread has been very exciting
to me; too often the list gets bogged down, in my opinion, in personal
chit-chat, or topics very far from its ostensible theme).  I've read the
3 poets you accuse me of disliking for 20 years or so, know them well, and
have plenty of respect for them.  Now what various Black or female etc.
poets or readers think about LangPo, I can't precisely help...One of the
basic lessons I take from both publishing my work and working on the left
since around 1969 (when I was in 7th grade) is, that you can't let anyone
else make your choices for you.  I think it's very interesting that few
people ask jazz musicians/affecianados to justify to working or Black
people their love of Ornette Coleman's music! But he occupies a similar
place in the universe of musical expression that say Clark Coolidge does
in universe of poetry...So no, I don't really give a damn that some people
don't like my work or Coolidges..I'm no longer young and there isn't time
to be held back by browbeating.  I don't identify myself or my work with
LangPo, which is a term I believe shd. be used specifically for the folks
who used it of themselves and involved themselves with that circle's
activities...Meserli, Silliman, Perelman, Hejinian, Harryman, our great
list-owner,etc.  But I of course think their work has been helpful and
empowering.  However, I do indeed think that those more
establishment-approved poets should be read and responded to; by
expressing a hope that we on the list could thresh out these positions
(the tolerant vs. the sharp-edged political poetix of someone like Bruce
Andrews, say) I meant just that: that I hoped we could have a broader and
broader dialogue.

You seem to be implying that I was putting people (and positions) down
where I most difintely wasn't, and trying to shut off dialoge, which I
most
definitely wasn't..

Let me chime in:

Yeah, sure.  But in practice talk about poetry seems to keep privileging
one over the other; either we talk about content in terms of form (form
comes first), or vice versa (the form "fitting" the content).  The
problem is, reading Creeley's dicta rigorously doesn't necessary last
into our reading of actual poems.  Besides, this "immanentist" reading
actually blurs Creeley's words.  Form as an extension of content is NOT
the same thing as Content as an extension form.  "Extension" suggests
temporal and ontological priority.  I'm not saying we should not dissolve
such priorities; I'm only saying that dissolving them in practice is
pretty damn difficult.  That was one element of my critique of Perloff in
_Diacritics_.

my balderdash is very specifically motivated, Joe.  Let me hedge my remarks
by acknowledging my limitations.  I too am a dweller among the tombs.
I'm Gould.  I'm ghosted.  I'm spooked.  In poetry, I face backwards (both
faces) and listen.  My daily grind in a library only augments that
particular narrow strength/limitation.  (Not to say libraries face
backwards - far from it.  But it gives me fuel for my particular
aim.)  My approach has always been to inhabit & build on past methods.
This is inherently conservative (no matter what models you choose).

What most people find innovative & exciting in poetry today builds on the
border between poetry per se and other things: music, math, theory,
marginality, other cultures, performance, visual art, bizarre language
practices, etc.  But I say poetry's on a continuum between such things
and poetry per se, which is made of words.  Words themselves are already
so distended, deep, distortable, dimensional, messy, mundane, non-poetic,
that adjacent arts - music, visual - are, for me, always just that:
adjacent.  Poetry per se is, I agree with Mandelstam, a sort of verbal
crystal - a stone with an unprepossessing surface and a "terrible
density" hidden inside. Poetry is other-textual.  Poetry is verbal
espionage.  Marlowe & Shakespeare understood this VERY well.  So did
the writers of the Bible.  So did Celan.

My quarrel with the "disturbed" discussion is that it really does replay,
and play over the surface, of issues of form/cultural politics which
end up stereotyping MY particular approach to poetry - without even
knowing what formal questions involve.  It all boils down to "rhyme & meter",
"willed form", "formal innovation", blah blah... meaningless counters in
an endless merry-go-round of superficial nonsense.  Not to mention
politics...  it IS a constant echoing of issues more relevant to bubbling
blab of 50s new critics and beats.  What I said in a previous post still
holds: get poor.  What does this mean?  "Read it back to me - quietly,
quietly."

I read recently that his strong ties to fundamentalist family-values Xian
cultural events have taken some hits because of this new image (but other

wondered whether being exhibit A against cultural deadness in Moore's

I'd agree with your judgement of
these simplistic terms, henry, but
are these the terms of the discussion,
or an easy dismissal of same? &
are the variety of questions raised
regarding the subject relations of a
poem & so forth really as separate
from aesthetic concerns as you
seem to imply below?

I sympathize with your lack of patience--
our handling of this re-/current discussion
can & does get too sloppy--but then I
tire of attempts to grandly sweep away
what could be, though again often is
not, an important questioning of our own
assumptions about art & its political functions
(rather than, say, a renumeration of the "views"
& "values" that make us a "community").

or maybe I'm just cranky at 9 am.

btw, what are these recent hip-hop breakthroughs?

I see your point henry, but again I'd argue that what
you're reacting to is an unfortunate slippage, which
several participants have tried explicitly to prevent or
correct (thanks marjorie et al.), from form as "the relation
of language to meaning" to form as "received versus
(so-called) innovative form". certainly it hasn't been
my intent, & I'm not the only one, to disparage work
which is formal in the latter sense. I'd hate as much as
you would for this discussion to degenerate into a
round of sonnet-bashing, because I don't learn anything
from that at all. whereas I am concerned about an easy
acceptance, easy both as hastily-made & as non-commital,
of a sort of content-oriented left poetry, & I would, like
mark, hope to see more discussion in that vein.

Does anyone know of poetry, music or any other
art form influenced by astrology and the zodiac,
esp. twentieth century work? I'm currently
working creatively on this, and am drawing inspiration
from two works especially: Finnegans Wake, and
Zodiac, a musical piece by Stockhausen. Is anyone
interested, for example, in contemplating the
astrological influences on the experimental
poets mentioned or contributing to this list? I look them
up from time to time because the reference volume,
Contemporary Poets, gives exact birthdays; time of
birth is rarely printed, unfortunately....

Any tips from anyone would be truly appreciated.

In my view there is only poetry.  Discussions at this level of generality
(left poetry, formal poetry, innovative poetry) somehow miss the poetry.
OK I'm being tendentious & vociferous.  It's a way of underlining.

henry, thanx for your last post... i think there's a distinction to be
drawn (albeit a subtle one) twixt "conservative" and *preservative*... esp.
given the various political registers one is likely to hit with the
former... universities are in general highly preservative institutions...

but by way of answering directly to your sense that more needs to be
discussed wrt contemporary poetries, however "innovative," i can only say
for my part that i've always assumed that poetry is not just about language
--- that in fact i don't see why poetry shouldn't be, among so many other
things, a matter of persuasion... albeit there are so many different ways
to go about persuading... which is probably as oracular as i'll be
hereabouts...

best,

ALLEGORY OF THE POETS

The were clustered together in the Crystal Room,
the Poets.  Dressed in leather and velvet, and
sprawled across the loveseats with carefree
insouciance, they spoke in measured sentences
of the coming Reading; of their various
accomplishments; their travels near and far;
their books, their audiences, their salaries.
They laughed and winked and nodded and stared
like ordinary men and women.

                              No one
sat in the Chair that faced them, solitary,
at the end of the room.  They waited
for someone to come, but no one came.
They chatted on, waiting, for hours there...
but I can't remember what they said,
and I forget their names.

I appreciate the roundness of your post. With all due respect to your
interests, what hip-hop "breakthroughs" have we seen of late. Is any of it
truly "new"? Is anything ever "new"? Are we just dwarves on the backs of the
literary giants? (Born at the wrong time I guess). Rilke had as high an
estimation of poetry, but we all know that he too could be boring or
predictable at times. Breakthroughs as breakaways, break outs, break offs,
break ins, breakdowns. Regardless, great verse still gets written.

I do like where all this discussion is going. To me though, this post seems to
suggest the death of poetry (?) The endgame as Marjorie suggests in Radical
Artifice.

Best to all in a great discussion,

Bill B.

Ira --

This was never my thing exactly, but there was a time (if I remember right)
when poets near and dear to me were exploring older, more recently occulted
sciences like astrology & alchemy, etc.  I would trace it back to surrealist
roots at the very least -- the kind of thing that Artaud denounces Breton
for in his great letter & outcry of February 1947 (a surrealist exhibit
structured on the 12 houses of the zodiac).  I'm sure, once you get started
on this, that the examples will be astronomical (not only astrological).
But one to look out for -- totally neglected on this list -- is Wakoski,
who was at one time into casting charts & who surely has it running through
the work -- at least the early work.  (Di Prima too, who was otherwise a
close student of alchemy & such.)  You might also check back into AMERICA
A PROPHECY (if available to you) -- the anthology that George Quasha & I
committed in the early 70s -- & there you'll find (on p. 239) a "horoscope
[with illustrated chart] of a tentative north American republic / born
Philadelphia, Pa., 4 July 1776" -- the work credited to "anonymous" but
revealed as transmitted "per R.K. Amanuensis" [aka Robert Kelly].  This
was also around the time (a few years later) that Richard Grossinger
put out an astronomy issue of his magazine IO but including takes on that
that would more readily be identified with astrology.  And David Antin
has a lovely take-off on the reading of constellations in the second
section of his poem "The Black Plague" (reprinted in the Sun & Moon
Selected).  It is all -- as you know and, if I remember, have recently
expressed -- an indication of the closeness between poetry (& art) &
"mysticism" of all sorts that makes for a lot of current problematics in
our practice.  It is something that fell out of (or never really got into)
the talk around language poetry and has therefore obscured -- to my
mind -- a sense of where poetry comes from and (by extension) where it
can conceivably go.

And I would also, while I'm at it, want to put in a word about David
Antin & anthologies, since David is my oldest & remains one of my dearest
friends over all these many years, viz that David's crack about anthologies
 -- like others about Lowell and the (so-called) sacred and the dreams
that he once claimed not to have -- is a very directed remark aimed at
something that he wants to get at or around under very particular
circumstances.  He has therefore been my closest (silent) collaborator
on various anthologies, beinning with Technicians of the SACRED about
which he knows as much (or more) as anyone around.

I would also be very interested in what your own project is -- to get a
better handle on it.  But maybe it would be better to continue this, if
you want to, by the back channel method.

With all best,

from HOW ARE VERSES MADE
                         by V. MAYAKOVSKY

                                        (Moscow, 1926; London: Jonathan
                                                               Cape, 1970
                                                               translated
                                                                G. M Hyde)
        Here there is no call to take up the metaphysical question of who
is better, Demyn Bedny("an example of a social command for today which
has been properly understood") or Kruchonykh("its aim or purpose is to
assist future poets").  These are poetcial achievements of
very different kinds, on different planes, and each of them can exist
without excluding the other and without competing with the other . . .

        I am deliberately exagerting because I want to show more
strikingly that the essence of modern literary work doesn't lie in the
evaluation of this or that ready-made thing from the standpointof
literary taste, but in a correct approach to the study of the productive
process itself . . .

        How are verses made?
        Work begins long before one receives or is aware of a social command.
        Preliminary work goes on incessantly . . .

        A poet regards every meeting, every signpost, every event in
whatever circumstances simply as material to be shaped into words(20-21,24).

        Mike Boughn made a good point re "this or that ready-made
thing"--and expectancy--

        incessant preliminary work--study of process--every event-material
shaped into words-

        Mayakovsky's book was written for a series for schools and such--along
with books on" How are  . . .s made"  (ships, shoes, paste, paper, etc etc)

        maybe instead of anthology arguments (and noticed no one has as yet
mentioned very good one--Primary Trouble--from Talisman House)--

        some how to books---

        "Do you want to write, and want to know how it's done . . .You're
right to demand of poets that they shouldn't carry with them to the grave
the secrets of their skill.
        "I want to write about poetry not as a pedant, but as a
practitioner.  My article has no scholarly significance.  I write about
my work, which by the light of my observations and convictions, I see as
differing very little from the work of other professional poets.
        "Once again I want to insist that I offer no rules to make anyone
a poet, by following which he can write poetry.  Such rules simply don't
exist.  A poet is a person who creates these very rules" (12-13)

jerry, what i would mself find very useful would be a discussion of the
"mystic" (shorthand) as this might be made to resonate with the "social"
(more shorthand)... i'm not so interested in classroom practices -- where
i'm pretty certain the "mystic" is no less harmful than, say (again)
"craft"... i am, though, interested in what to do about more popular,
representational biases against poet-madmen/women -- which i find a
damaging and problematic mysti-fication on so many fronts... seems to me
there's also this issue of social responsibility, however ecstatic one's
apprehension (not meaning to raise any eyebrows around here but---)...

all to steal a bit of thunder from a short conference paper i'm busy tweaking...

seems to me that, going back some, whitman is one obvious north american
lead-in...

best,

Ira,

You can always count on Yeats when it comes to such atavistic
enthusiasms...astrology figured into his syncretism along
with mysticism (various kinds), ceremonial magic (always subject, for
Yeats, to empirical verification), alchemy, Theosophy, Rosicrucianism,
etc. etc...

Best,
O.

Ok Hrothgar. I can appreciate the "battling with giants" homily for now. Let's
say I too am a tomb dweller, but hip-hop? Isn't that going from tomb to
Hollywood (by present indications at any rate)? How does today's hip-hop stand
in with the symbolists, Whitman, and Dickinson? I wouldn't dare stand in the
same room with Ice-T for fear of being riddled by something other than words.

But the experience might be an experience of experiencing form.

The perfect sentence.

Okay, I vote that the next post that mentions either "form" OR "content"
be relegated to oblivion -- or at least ignored for a few days.

I mean, this can get to be head-hurting stuff, and as a sweeping
rejection of that possibility, I salute Henry's exemplary balderdash.

I myself had to go back into the archives (i.e., last week's posts) to try
and make sense of what, exactly, we were talking about: one of Joe Amato's
earliest posts last week said he was "slipping and sliding on a form/
content dualism here" -- implying that that dualism was really
artificial -- and this has since been echoed by many comments,
including Ms. Perloff's that, for her, "there is no subject matter outside
form" and "form and content can't be separated." Appreciating David
Kellogg's latest, that it is in fact almost impossible to talk about poems
without separating them, I want to say I AGREE with those who say we
should try and keep them together: I was trying to demean empty form
without content (and by the way, Mark P., did you know that Pound
considered _Finnegans Wake_ "decadent"?), while others have disparaged
poems that appear to be just "content" (or poems that come from
and speak to various "identity" communities) which don't seem to have
"innovative" form.

Of course these are all loaded terms and mean different things to
different people. But if there's an issue here for me, it's that, once
these terms are separated, or talked about as if they were separate,
mischief begins. That is, I agree with Jordan that it's mystification to
think that a form can force a message -- I agree with Marjorie that "one
can use all the fragments and dislocations around and still not have a
good 'langpo' " -- and I CERTAINLY agree with the (perhaps unintended)
hilarity contained in this post (sorry, I forgot its author):

" . . . a critical language that honors lang-po -- in fact, much
lang-po IS a critical language honoring lang-po"

Is this not form without content?

So it's not an ontological argument, Michael -- it's a phenomenological
argument. The "work" of the poem, as it's undertaken -- that "stuff",
those (ap)perceptions, that dynamically developing, meaning-making
articulation -- creates its own form, the only form that can possibly
encompass that meaning. Who would possibly WANT to separate them, except
politicians of some order?

Robert A., I look forward to your interview, and it wasn't a low blow or
personal attack;

Mark P., glad to see your list of influences, many of whom are
in fact problematic for me (even the sainted Zukofsky), but hey, I'm
starting to think I'm almost illiterate compared to the denizens of this
list; maybe this post is a bit less confusing about what I meant.

and thank you especially Chris S., for your wonderful contributions to
this and other issues. I really want to talk about astrology now . . .

Robert Mittenthal brilliantly critiques James Scully's book,
_Line Break_, starting from the fact that while the book is about
the "the social practice of poetry" poetry is hardly ever
referred to described or invoked. And Scully didn't even write
his book on a listserv! (See Mittenthal's review in _Writing_ 25
[1990].) Of course arguing from out of - from within - poetry
does not _garantee_ a better argument either - that is, a truly
"deep encounter," for instance, as Christopher Alexander would
urge practitioners to experience with their medium. Does close
reading even garantee an argument? No longer - yet perhaps if you are
reading the Metaphysicals, Chris. Thus it might be necessary in
arguing for the "social practice of poetry" to not mention poetry
at all. Of course arguing _alongside_ poetry, in paralogue as it
were, does not garantee a better argument either - that is, a
truly deep encounter with "social practice...." Apart from saying
that, I may as well also state that for me there are so many
unhelpful contradictions and connotations in the language of the
quotation from Scully's book, that I think David Kellogg posted,
I don't know where to even begin in pointing them out. Here's
one, not necessarily the best: Is he for or against a
"metahistorical source of illumination" for poetry? From his own
disparaging language, I would say definitely not. Yet I can't
figure out from the quotation how he proposes that "shared
understanding" would occur elsewise. Share my cropper.

Ira, re: astrology, try Cdn. Gwendolyn MacEwan (b.1941)--
          There is a great unspeakable wheel which keeps
          Us slender as myths, and green with sleep.
Warning: This is a general reference in that I have no investment,
psychical speculative or otherwise, in MacEwan's work. Force that
mystifies a message is form.

I've always liked Steve McCaffery's early concept of the cipheral
(he later rejected it) to think about that aspect of language
practice which eludes exhaustion by conventions of sense making
and contextual reception. Neither "form" nor "innovative form" do
the same work as "cipheral" of disclosing the poem as a visual
materialized surface and also as a set of devices that jam the
codes of sense-making beyond the means of the best close reader,
while reaching out, in the same stroke, to other readers: far
readers (anybodies, nobodies, other communities, classes,
subgroups). "Nonsense," which has been variously used to invoke
this sort of poetry, forever indefinable yet concrete, that is
"at the edge" "vanguard" "etc," is inadequate - far too taming of
the social revolutionary practice of the poem. This does not
resolve itself as a tame question of genre, as "nonsense" has
suggested it can be - to, for example, Marnie Parsons, and others
who have written on Bernstein, Hejinian, Lear, etc. The cipheral
aspect of poetry is perhaps its spectral aspect, which has to do
with tombs, those that Henry mentions, the dead letter, but not
as much with the mystic mists as with the future as mysterious,
future readings yet to be articulated. The social practice of the
poem would operate on the analogy of Ernesto Laclau's "empty
signifier." He is talking of the empty signifier on a macro
political scale. For him, for instance, "social" would be an
empty signifier, around which rallies a movement for change; and
the reason why it's empty for him is that it's meaning is
indefinite, and open to multiple, conflicting interpretations by
various communities. Until it is realized to have no meaning, at
which point it is dropped as valueless.

Chop it off,
Louis Cabri

Re: Ira Lightman's --

<<Does anyone know of poetry, music or any other art form influenced

here's one stray item:

record album *Venus in Cancer* by the late Robbie Basho (Tacoma
Records, I think was the label) -- Robbie (like the present e-writer)
happened to have said planet in said sign; (Basho recorded abt. a dozen
albums, till his demise (early 80s); he was a steel-string guitar innovator,
sometimes linked with John Fahey & Leo Kotke as a threesome of
antecedents to the so-called Windham Hill school of solo guitar); he
explained the title *Venus in Cancer* (as I recall) simply by noting that
he'd always had a certain feeling abt. Venus in Cancer, and that same was
given expression (I think in an eponymous track).  BTW, Robbie was
unhappy w/ the absurd cover-art (involving a pair of nubile women, I
think) -- not quite his own design; so he would paste-over Indian prints
of Meher Baba attired as Krishna (on copies he sold of this album ...)

(& BTW Henry Gould -- this is not apocryphal nor blarney -- I sold
copies of same at the Meher Baba Bookstore in Pasadena, circa 1973)

You might be interested in the angelology & mathematics of H.D.'s long poem
SAGESSE (1957), in which degrees of an astrological chart become
angel-visitants.  The poem is in HERMETIC DEFINITION.

Joe, I always think of Valery's proposal of the poem erupting or
arising out of the insistence of a specific rhythm that invades the
mind. That would seem to anticipate Kristeva. Doesn't the
phenomenological return us to some point before the intervention of
taxonomy?

I like the term "cipheral" - this is sort of what I was getting
at when I said "poetry is verbal espionage".  I guess I question
the revolutionary potential of it.  It's more like subversive -
a practice that grows up under repressive state apparati.  But
for  me the political aspect is less interesting than the allegorical
literary aspect of sending a very specific secret message.

I'm glad you brought up Valery.  I think this whole form/content slosh
was best articulated in his essay "Poetry and Abstract Thought" where
he differentiates poetry from prose in terms of a pendulum effect.
There IS pure form - the hypnotic rhythm/sound/meaning of the actual
words - which swings like a pendulum into the reader's mind and sets
off its cognitive/emotive effects, enacts its changes.  Then the pendulum
swings back and the pure form REMAINS - in memory, in culture (2nd life
of art).  Prose, on the other hand, swings its effects into the mind -
and dissolves after completing its work.

Could there not be a dynamics of form to accomodate such varying practices
as Rod Smith's Carolyn Forche's Joan Retallack's and Joe Ross's? Could we
not bottle it and call it DC Spring? How long until the cherry blossoms
start?

All of this about form and content seems so far from what has been said by

I have to agree with Mark Wallace:

"        In any case, the relation between exploratory and pre-determined
form is quite complex--in some cases, predetermined forms of various types
and degrees can certainly be exploratory and about discovery."

And Marjorie has written a lot about such things. I do think that Creeley's
mantra still works in relation to such. And then, as someone who reads
poetry & SF, I think of Samuel R. Delany's somewhat similar statement "Put
in opposition to 'style'[form], there is no such thing as 'content'." Which
makes clear that the opposition _is_ a false dichotomy, a constructed one.
One thing is for sure: setting up some arbitrary formal controls often
allows for creative discovery in the writing, & that, if (or when) it
works, can create a poem worth reading.

Well, hey, what about all those 'sonnets' in _In the Analogy_ -- a
stunningly beautiful book, & one that's going to take a long time to read,
but given _From Feathers to Iron_ I know I'm going to find it stunning as
poetry too. I do recommend it to all.

Whew!  there sure have been a lot of superior-sounding posts recently..I
personally found a lot of the posts on the recent thread very useful and
provocative--Several comments by these folks who are apparently much
smarter than the rest of us, have characterized the thread as being about
form and content..If they're thinking about the same thread I am, it was
about a number of poetics issues, not all of which could be so
characterized.  Maybe these folks, being so much more "reasonable and
amusing," actually have some poetics cherry blossoms of their own to
contribute??

Dear Ira, it's Kevin Killian.  Here's a piece by Jack Spicer which is an
*anti-astrology* poem, I hope this counts in your survey.

=B3If you don=B9t believe in a god, don=B9t quote him,=B2
        Val=E9ry once said when he was about ready to give
        up poetry. The purposefull suspension of dis-
        belief has about the chance of a snowball in hell.
Lamias maybe, or succubi but they are about as real in
        California as night-crawlers
Gods or stars or totems are not game-animals.
        Snark-hunting
        is not like discussing baseball.
Against wisdom as such. Such
Tired wisdoms as the game-hunters develop
Shooting Zeus, Alpha Centauri, wolf with the same toy gun.
It is deadly hard to worship god, star, and totem. Deadly
        easy
To use them like worn-out condoms spattered by your own
        gleeful, crass, and unworshiping
Wisdom

The Duncan-Spicer crowd was way influenced by astrology--in this poem
Spicer is attacking Robert Duncan, George Stanley and Harold Dull for their
repetitive use of astrology in their then (1964) current projects . . .
aligning himself with Charles Olson who in his 50s essay "Against Wisdom as
Such" had warned American readers about San Francisco writing as a school
of mages "ominous as Ojai."

This poem is from Spicer's "Love Poems" in his book "Language."

Now I get to repeat my *songspiel.*  A marvelous benefactor has given Small
Press Traffic a number of copies of the first edition of Spicer's
"Language" allowing us to sell them to benefit the organization.  They are
in mint condition and you have never seen anything as beautiful as this
book, more often now seen in rare book catalogues looking tattered, dirty,
and gray and still costing a bomb.  She (anonymous benefactor) wants us to
make sure they get into what she calls "the right hands" (those of artists
and poets) so, a couple months ago, Dodie Bellamy announced this offer
through the poetics list to *quelle* response.  There are however still a
few copies left, so, if anyone is interested, back channel me or Dodie at
dbkk@sirius.com for more information.  And now back to regularly scheduled
programming.

As a library worker, I have some special access.  I checked with a Signor
Borges, who referred me to certain archives of the future.  Under the subject
AMERICAN LITERATURE - POETRY - LATE 20th CENTURY, you will find eight
titles published between 2012 and 2120, specifically dealing with the
rap/langpo dialectic as an index of cultural dissonance in late-20th
cent. US culture.  You will find 3 books on Rap metrics/rhyme, and an whopping
85 titles on poetry as performance in late millenial caffeine etiquette.

Sorry. Looked from here like there was a lot about 'force' 'mouth'
'content'. I will try to work up a paraphrase of the findings for the

There is a composer named Dane Rudyar, I think, who is more conservative
than Stockhausen. He has also written several books on astrology. That's
all I have. Now if you were doing a study on martyrology ... :-)

Those symbols, quite fascinating in themselves and a good source for a
Zodiac poem of whatever sort, were later collected and given a gloss by Dane
Rudhyar.

About 30 years after Marc Edmund Jones' Sabian Symbols, all 360 of them,
supposedly "channeled" (canal-ed like Mars?) but quite a poem in itself.

Ok ok. You got me, Rod. I just mad.

I'd like to go back to Chris Stroffolino's post on Harryman, metaphysics,
and whether message forces form. Isn't there an essay by Kleist about
puppet theater that warns against this kind of analysis? that the
self-consciousness it induces destroys the possibility of formulating the
message in a beautiful way? I realize this is exactly the injunction Chris
is betting against with most of what he writes. Hyperconsciousness (Bach)?
Or, as Steve Evans calls it, the mordantly recursive work of Chris
Stroffolino. That is, he worries about the moral life of words and the
linguistic activity around the ethics of the person engaged in the pursuit
of ordinary unhappiness. Not to make this a discussion of individual
writers, but following the work of say Milman Parry on Homer, I'd suggest
that there are a number of strategies that a writer uses, a number of
'moves' that are combined, not mechanistically but something like that,
kinesthetically. These 'moves' are connected to but different from the
writer's 'ideas', which it seems to me are the ways the writer looks at
[listens to?] what is written (coordination). The 'moves' are often
acquired from the texts of other writers (influence), while the 'ideas'
seem to be more closely connected to people talking -- the social lives of
upbringing, education, etc etc. Then there are the ongoing biographical
entropic/building-up effects on the writing -- the moves and the ideas --
that are legible also in the individual's behavior (okay I'm a mystical
Freudian).

The 'amusing and reasonable' statute hasn't been on the books for a hundred
years, sorry I tried to prosecute.

Now if you wanna talk about mysticism ...

Ira:

My book Persia (Chance Additions)  was written in relation to tarot cards -
though not apparent from the work the Roman numerals stand for the cards -
some astrological stuff in there - and there is also mention of such in
Symmetry (Avec Books) - even a poem called Astrology - I've alwasy been
interested in the detritus of western civ/con game aspect of the pseudo
sciences -

Norma Cole's book Mars (Listening Chamber) does have to do with the god of
war, Dante etc so that should relate - the cover (by Jess) is an
interesting use of that kind of material -

Would be happy to backchannel more thought about this -

Might as well beg the obvious--Gustave Holst's The Planets is about
astrology, not space travel. I think it's garbage, but there it is.

I'm piggy-backing on others to save time. The zodiac is a common theme in
the decoration of medieval and renaissance churches, particularly in Italy,
but I forget just where. Should be easy to track down.

UNBOUND: A BOOK OF AIDS
by Aaron Shurin

Witnessing the illnes and death of many of friends
from AIDS, San Francisco poet Aaron Shurin began a
series of writings that, as he puts it, "are the
stations of an elarging question: the question,
alarmed, of a cell aroused by invasion, or the
yearning curl of a lover's body awake on the vacated
sheets."
   The startlingly original and provocative book
that resulted was not a project but a process of
learning about AIDS and its implications THROUGH
the activity of writing itself. It is, in that
context, not a book ABOUT AIDS but, growing
from Shurin's attempt to understand and reach out
to those around him, a book OF AIDS.

Cloth $19.95


SEEKING AIR, by Barbara Guest

Guest's 1978 novel, a truly original and
fabulous work, is now reprinted into Sun &
Moon's Classics Series.

Paperback, $12.95


THE BLIND CAT BLACK and ORTHODOXIES
by Ece Ayhan
Translated from the Turkish by Murat
Nemet-Nejat

Wonderfully experimental poetry by the
great Turkish poet, Ece Ayhan. Both works
printed here take the reader through the
dark streets of the Galata district of
Istanbul, an area where European minorities
lives historically side by side with red
light sexual activities. Like a modern-day
Rimbaud, Ayhan explores a world of fear,
love, and wonderment.


MAY SKY: THERE IS ALWAYS TOMORROW
A History and Anthology of Haiku in
the World War II Interment Camps for
Japanese American Citizens
Edited and Translated by Violet Kazue
de Christoforo

Sun & Moon is extremely proud to have
published this profoundly moving history
of the Japanese Haiku clubs and their
continution, along with other artistic

World War II. Kazue de Christoforo recounts
the background of the California clubs, the
painful process of arrest and internment, and
translates a large selection of haiku written
in the camps. She has tracked down most of
the active members of the various haiku clubs
and presented biographies of them as well. With
maps, photographs, and many other fascinating
details.

Small Press Traffic presents

Friday March 21, 7:30 p.m.

Pamela Lu
Ann Veronica Simon

New College Theater
777 Valencia Street
$5

Pamela Lu, from Southern California, received a B.A. in math from U.C.
Berkeley, and her groundbreaking work has appeared in Explosive, Prosodia,
Chain and Clamour. Lu's writing weaves in and out between poetry and
fiction, mixing the theoretical wit and spark of Barthes or Avital Ronell
with a bewildered confusion and terror-like some Berkeley-born mutant blend
of Gayatri Spivak, Shirley Jackson and Kurt Cobain.

Ann Veronica Simon is originally from Michigan. She received her M.F.A.
from Louisiana State University and is currently in the Ph.D. program in
Rhetoric at U.C. Berkeley. Her work has appeared in Exquisite Corpse,
Trivia, Prosodia, Idiom and is forthcoming in Mirage and Clamour.  A
brilliant performer, Simon is the Ruth Draper de nos jours. Reading her
cool, angular poetry is like following the dance notations of Martha Graham.

This event was programmed by Renee Gladman.

You also might want to look at James Merrill's long poem, The Changing
Light at Sandover, structured (and supposedly channeled through) a Ouija
Board.

Also Ira, you might want to investigate non-western astrologies.  I think
Francisco Alarcon did some work using Aztec materials.  Leslie Silko's the
Almanac of the Dead is another place.  I'm sure there's been some
interesting stuff using Chinese and other Asian divination resources as
well.

Joe and Susan: I tried to send separate posts a day ago but my server somehoww
kicked it back to me. Hence the delay.
     I'm glad to see someone else is willing to face the sloppiness of the idea
of teaching as "making a better world." It is  sloppy, of course, to say so,
and entirely impractical, but it's something I keep abutting against in my
own teaching. I think, really, its all the hope I have, at least in the
more general pedagogical terms we've been addressing. Of course, there is
all the hope in the world on a student by student basis, and perhaps that's
the point after all. But at some point, I think, we will have to more
rigorously explain what we mean by a better world, but that will have
to deal with questionsof revolution, utopia, etc, which can't clearly
be addressed here.But this must be the central ideal of any pedagogy.
    Yes,Susan, this threadhas come up before several times, with some
very interesting results. If I remember properly, Gwyn and Carolyn
Forche had some particularly important things to say in this context
(I hope I'm not putting words in folks's mouths). But I think this is
something that will keep coming up not only in poetic situations, since
so many poets now teach, but also for "radicals,"since so many radicals
also teach. Of course, this is not to say, here on this list more so, that
poetry or radical politics has come to find a privileged site      in
academia.  I certainly hope not, since I may soon be leaving the profession.
Nevertheless, for those of us caught between, so to speak, it is important
we keep talking about this stuff.
     Finally, I like to think that I too teach my students how to be more
critical consumers of culture, questioners, etc.  Most of the time, though
I think I just entertainthem for awhile and release them to do their own
work.  I remember how important it was for me to find out that there was
a context in which such stuff as poetry mattered, and maybe that's the
best thing I can provide them.  I just hope, basically, that I don't get
in their way. Thanks, Eric.

Reminds of Octavio Paz's *Puerto del Sol* (I think?) -- based (if memory
serves) on (or inspired by) the Aztec calendar.  Enjoyable translation was
done by Elliot Weinberger.

BTW, I recall seeing "new formalist" Dana Gioia's vol. entitled *Daily
Horoscope* (Graywolf Press) --though I somehow doubt it has much to
do w/ horoscopes.

As interesting as poetry based on astrological themes might be a study of
astrological coordinates of poets.  I find myself wondering about some of
the classics -- Whitman vs. Dickinsen (Leo vs. Virgo? -- a wild guess);
Williams vs. Pound (Taurus vs. Scorpio? -- ditto).  (I was never much

Yeah, but it is literally true that one loves only form, & form comes into

You got Pound right--Oct. 30, just shy of All Souls'.  Williams is the
Virgo, Sept. 17. Whitman, May 31--Gemini, like Yeats & Dylan & Emerson.
Dickinson, Dec. 10, Sagittarius.  All courtesy of book of days from a

I like Jordan't tag line, so keep it.

I've been wondering much lately myself about form/content, though in a
different context.  I'm tempted to want to say, in Rorty fashion, that
it's a bad metaphor and we're better off just letting go of it.  Where
does it come from?  I can't imagine anyone in a Renaissance context,
sonneteers, say, really having any use for it.  Poetic practice would
simply make the distinction irrelevant, and even impossible to formulate.
When is it formulable?  After, I think, Goethe and Coleridge, who make a
point of saying form is content in order to combat a hyperrationalized
scheme governed by analysis, taking things apart, murdering to dissect,
etc.  Form/Content is a product of the analysis wing of 18th century
rationalism.  (Frankly, I don't know if I have my history right here: I'm
shooting from the hip, but I've been trying to understand the larger
contexts of organicism, in order to understand the larger contexts of
contemporary holism/ecology metaphors.)

Here's where I'm heading: from an organic point of view, or from the
modified organicism that now passes as holism, form is necessarily an
expression of content and content is necessarily a manifestation of form.
They can't be teased apart.  And the effort to keep talking in that
language can only reflect our continued abasement before the gods of
enlightenment analysis.

I'm still thinking about the practical implications for poetry and
"formal" "experiment."  "!"   This could take a long time.

Joe Safdie makes some good points (although I didnt read his call to arms
until I had sent in my previous post with those terms in it). But all this
talk about conservative & innovative form/content keeps coming up because
it is important & it does have something to do with what many of us do.
Hands up: how many of us have to teach poets we dont always admire as much
as some of the poets we dont get a good chance to teach?

I taught a 3rd year course on Post-WW2 poetry in the US & the UK: it's a
coverage course, so I have to teach such as Larkin, Lowell, those "L"s
(both of whom, btw, Marjorie has written extremely interesting recent[last
decade anyway] essays on), as well as Creeley, Olson, Levertov, O'Hara. I
gave up on the Norton (partly because I even disagreed with its choices of
poems by *its* poets, let alone appalling representation of those I care
for (when they're in there). But some students really 'like' Larkin or
Lowell or Plath. They find their work 'liberating,' 'moving.' say it
'speaks' to them. Wanting, like Joe, to let them find their own ways (as
much as I can do so when I am up front & have all that power), I can
certainly alert them to my biases, but also praise them for not just
following my lead. Besides, there are interesting things to say about some
of these writers' poems, both positive & critical (Larkin is fascinating as
a figure of his culture, which so many in that culture 'trust': why?). Rich
tends to capture the attention of many young women. Perhaps they will go
beyond her & eventually find her writing a problem because it doesnt fully
enact the free flow it announces, Perhaps not. There is an argument to be
made for the reach of writing that carries a somewhat radical message in a
way that allows many readers to connect with it (but there I am somehow
falling into that division again; even as I say, everyday, that it is a
construct & false, it's hard to teach without invoking it on some level, &
then immediately, again, saying, no, no, that's not whatI meant at all...)

All of which is just to say, I've found this thread really interesting & do
want to keep thinking the dangers inherent in what goes on when we carry
our desires & biases into the classroom, a place where we dont always have
complete control over what we teach.

The idealist concept-philosophy that Jonathan Levin traces for
one dichotomy - form/content - of the discursive trade on poetry
haunts this list much more than any tomb of a living poet.
Actually Spicer's theory, in the quote Kevin Killian posted from
_Language_, has been, in the laboratories of the university
humanities departments, recently confirmed (much like Einstein's theories
were by later empirical observation of the galaxy): for if you
trace the history of the condom - materials employed, its link-up
with industrial manufacture, embeddedness [literally] in the
domestic patriarchal economy, etc etc, and its recent marketing,
etc., the whole social-historical works connected with it - you
will find it parallels the development of the form/content
dichotomy (and/or identity) in poetics.

jonathan,

I don't know when "form" and "content" began to play these particular
roles as TERMS, but the concepts are older than you allow-- you _might_
start with Bacon, whose critique of eloquence distinguishes between copia
verborum and copia rerum-- so that augmentation, increase, discovery,
PROPERLY takes place in relation to things rather than words, which are
consigned to poetry.  Poetry, for Bacon, marks the outside of the
knowledge system...poetry is not error, it is that which is known not to
be true.

But the appearance of copia with reference to vernacular English goes
back to Puttenham...who annexes the rhetorical taxonomy of figures (in
the Arte of English Poesie) on behalf of poetry, making the figuration
the essence of poetry and backforming rhetoric into a mode of speech
resistant to figuration.  Puttenham's kind is account of poetry as the
change in the word that MAKES NO DIFFERENCE even as it is different (thus
preserving 'innovation' while bracketing its association with factions
and violence), is the prior move that allows Bacon to eliminate poetry from
counting as knowledge at all.

The Romantics had to "recover" form, not just from the Enlightenment , but
from the whole long history of epistemology as such, which depends in
large measure on the invention of the difference between words and
things--a difference in which poetry was a main antagonist and patsy.

take care,
O.

I'd forgotten that lovely quote from Spicer, but thanks, it reminded me of
George Bowering's long poem, _Allophanes_, which begins "The snowball
appears in Hell / every morniing at seven." & continues:

                Dr. Babel contends
        about the world's form, striking
        its prepared strings
                endlessly, a pleasure
          moving rings outward thru
                        the universe. All
                sentences are to be served.

It then keeps its eyes fixed firmly far away from the stars. Probably
doesnt fit either, since whatever 'mysticism' it engages it denies with wit
-- including astrology. "Fixed" things & ideas: "Drive right past that
lady, that's / St. As. Is."

every so often it's worth remembering George writes some damn fine poems,
as well as all these fun postings...

 oren's post strikes me as a very good comment on the f/c
business -- as though 'form' and 'content' were easy terms to
dismantle!  i'd say 'the whole long history of epistemology as
such' =is= where we have to 'start' -- whatever it is we
propose, exactly, to 'start' doing or changing or overcoming.

 one book i have found very useful for these matters is marcia
colish's =the mirror of language. a study in the medieval
theory of knowledge= (revised edition, nebraska, 1983).  she
explains that classical philosophers tended to treat words as
one type of sign, while augustine and other medieval thinkers
tended to view signification as primarily verbal.  meanwhile
christianity encouraged the notion that knowledge was semiotic;
but knowledge of god was inexact and so that encouraged the
notion of signs as inexact.  while medieval sign theory saw the
=aenigma= of language as essential to understanding the content
of the world, the development of formal logic (12th-14th
centuries) decisively separated reality, thought, and language.

can we have aquinas's '=verbum mentis='?  only if language is
the whole world.  that's why the form/content debate won't
go away, i think, though it can be profitably imagined in less
binary ways.

       Form might be very popular now, might have been very popular for the
modernists, but I'm not so sure that "one loves _only_ form" would apply to
much eng. poetry before 1900. Hopkins makes a pretty good case against love
of form in "Kingfishers Catch Fire"; and I think Herbert in _The Temple_
ultimately discards form, a vehicle for this known world only.
        I make this case to suggest that in at least eng. lit. the love of
form and form alone is relatively new and perhaps we shouldn't take it so
much for granted. For the modernists the form/content dualism is analagous
to, if not another word for, a dualism between individual, different details
and abstractions. (This dualism breaks down when the idea of a single right
abstraction dissolves, Truth becoming hegemony.)
        (I'm absolutely NOT advocating some wildly reactionary return to
poetry of a Christian God as the above examples, taken alone, might
indicate.This is more an effort to describe what people today think when
they think about "poetry.")
        Someone in the astrological poetry thread recently mentioned
Merrill: what was form for him? I belive _Changing Light_ makes use of
almost every major "poetic form" in eng. (This discussion hasn't been
limited to traditional ideas of form, but as a shorthand signifier of poetic
form historical rhymes & meters work well.) And of course the whole poem
claims it was originally to be a novel. Is the message something other than
its form when a Ouji board is used?

It's not the questions around form/content  (which seem to be endless and
inherent, whether you're coming from a theoretical/philosophical/historical
interest or from a fabricator's perspective)  over which I lose my easily-
lost temper.  It's the other binary - the idea that a poet goes for
"traditional" (rhyme/meter) or "innovative" - that loses me.  But yes
nobody really said that anyway so let's not start that wheel going, Hank...

I liked what Mark Wallace said about people like Mac Low & other "innovators"
working from their own "strict" forms.  This ground has been plowed many a time
but it's worth remembering...   & for my book, again Valery's essays are
a gold mine of insight on these questions.  See "Man and the Seashell" on
form & content - and the useless freedom of art-making as its only truly
HUMAN characteristic.  Such a position should give pause to both philosophical
"enemies" of poetry (Bacon?) and philosophical "friends" (all those false
friends in the Party of Ideology - are you listening, "Poetry & the
Public Sphereoids"?  I's bein provocative, I thinks uh hopes) - Henry Gould

Thanks, Louis, for the reference to Mittenthal, which I did not know.  I'm
somewhat mystified by the broad brush of your dismissal, however, as well as
its specifics.  For example, I don't understand the critique about poetry
being "hardly ever referred to described or invoked"; my copy, anyway,
invokes poetry in every essay except for the chapter entitled "in defense of
ideology."  Poets quoted in block form include Auden, Marvell, Blake,
Tadeusz R=F3zewicz, Mahmoud Darwish, Roque Dalton, Erich Fried, Nazim=
 Hikmet,
Herberto Padilla, Andrei Voznesensky, Robert Bly, Bob Perelman, and Scully
himself. =20

Again, I guess I'm lost.  Of course he's not for such a "metahistorical
source of illumination."  The point of invoking such a source in order to
dismiss it, in my reading, is to qualify his own pronouncements as both
provisional and presumptuous, in other words to press up against the limits
of the sayable within the discourse of talk (writing) about poetry.  The
contradictions are in the field itself before they're in Scully's
intervention -- not to say they're _not_ in his interventions, which is
precisely his point. =20

Perhaps I blurbed his book too highly.  I came across it when I was
particularly distressed by the numbingly repeated gestures of most poetry
criticism; Scully's book, for me, avoided these gestures, and thus was (and
is) a positive event. =20

Cheers,
David

Trane was very much involved w/ astrology. Bill Cole makes a point about
this, if I remember correctly, in his biography. Look into Braxton as well.
Graham Lock's book _Forces in Motion_ gives an overview of Braxton's
chart...

On angelology (but not astrology): there is of course Henri Corbin, whose
work has been applied and/or alluded to by Olson, Duncan, Clarke, and
Mackey (among many others I'm sure).

        Just wanted to call everyone's attention to two interesting magazines
coming out of Los Angeles.
        The older more established one is Ribot (ree-boe) edited/published by
Paul Vangelisti.  The sixth issue has a "history" as a theme.  A
corresponding conference will be held on the island of Catalina in May.
 Guests will include Ray DiPalma, Douglas Messerli, Dennis Phillips, Kevin
Young, and others.
         The second magazine is called Rhizome and it was started by some
younger people, myself included, in order to facilitate a conversation
between east coast and west coast writers.  Writers included are Cole
Swenson, Mac Wellman, Charles Bernstein, Juliana Spahr, Martine Bellen,
Martha Ronk, Spencer Selby, Paul Vangelisti, and many others.  It is
available for $10.00.  Checks should be written to Standard Schaefer.  366
S.Mentor Ave. #108, Pasadena, CA 91106.  It will also be distributed by Small
Press Distributors, Fine Print, Berhard DeBoers in short time.  Submissions
will accepted through July.  Rhizome also carries reviews and should be
queried if anyone would like to submit one of those.

Subject:      Against Wisdom as Such

It's delightful that Kevin Killian quotes Spicer, and in particular
that poem.   The Seminar on Mythos at Runcible Mountain College (here
in Vancouver) was discussing the poem in our class just last week.

I'm not clear on how the poem can be seen as aligning itself with
Olson contra Duncan.  We thought that the poem passed judgement over
both of them as false prophets.  But also, there's something odd in
Spicer's positive conception of the mythic within his own poetry.

Olson's polemic against Duncan charges him with illegitimately
dragging in figures external to art and scolds him for not being
properly subordinate to the moment of composition.

"I fall back on a difference I am certain the poet at least has to be

that there are no symbols to him, there are only his own composed
forms, and each one soley the issue of the time of the moment of its
creation, not any ultimate except what he in his heat and that
instant in its solidity yield.  That the poet cannot afford to
traffick in any other 'sign' that his one, his self, the man or woman
he is.  Otherwise God does rush in.  And art is washed away, turned
into that second force, religion."  (Human Universe, 68-9)

Our seminar thought that Spicer's criticism of the arrogance of the
poet extended to Olson because of the latter's insistence upon the
MOMENT of writing, upon the primacy of the poet IN that moment, and
hence the "usability" of anything which may enter the field--
including god, star, totem.  But it is odd, too, that Spicer brings
in the image of the condom.  To what use does one put a spattered,
worn-out condom?

More troubling for us, however, was the question of what this thing
called belief has to do with poetry.  ("If you don't believe in a god,
don't quote him").  Doesn't the very idea betray the principle of
dictation?  What business is it of the poet to be dabbling in
epistemology at all?

Also troubling was the question of distinguishing the mythological
from the non-mythological within a poem.  Why point to the presence
of "Zeus" as a problem while "house" remains an understood
commonplace, readily assimilated into a readerly unpacking.  Is
there a clear basis for making the distinction without reverting to
some form of scientism ("that which is non-cognitive does not exist")?

I'm curious to hear any replies to these comments, here, or
elsewhere.

I realize only now, David, that I left out one important word in my
account--and I have disserviced Mittenthal's critique as a result:
Scully does not directly write of _living_ poets (except thirdhand of
two besides himself). I would likely not have overlooked this had I
a copy of Scully's book at hand--which I don't. Robert Mittenthal
says:

        The only reference to living North American writers (save
        Scully's discussion of his own work) comes to us third hand
        via an article in the _New York Times Book Review_, by
        Michael Davidson, which briefly contrasts two paragraphs
        from Robert Bly and Bob Perelman. That Scully discounts
        both these writers' works as symptomatic of bourgeois
        ideology without referring to more than two
        decontextualized paragraphs in Davidson's article is
        indicative of just how (in Scully's words) "little curiosity
        many poets have regarding their own language" (p. 73
        [_Line Break_]). In eight essays, two of which are not
        about poetry at all, Scully tries to make a case for a poetry
        that would communicate (i.e., convert or commit us to) his
        political ideals. This idealized poetry, instead of physically
        embodyting language, would use it as if it had no physical
        presence.... (_Writing_ 25, p. 87)

That is: as if language has no physical--in the sense of living--
presence. And yet (this is Mittenthal's point, I think) Scully argues
for a social practice (of commitment, for/by poetry).
        It's undoubtfully important to remember that Scully is
writing in the 1980s, as is Mittenthal, almost. In a way, Mittenthal's
review neatly summarizes Language Writing doxa, and thereby also the
larger debate of how the politics of language in the 1980s seemed, for
some, to be divided into (not surprisingly) two camps, on one side
intralanguage-oriented, and on the other extralanguage-oriented
views on politics and the political--Mitttenthal and Scully,
respectively.
        Together with some others including Maria Damon I think
you have, in your response to Marjorie Perloff's last post (the one
that proposes to narrate a history of the "rise" of a representational
politics of poetries) you have alluded to the concept of the field itself
in which these two camps lay (in which I have M and S as allegorical
figure-generals), and to, therefore, the existence of other camps,
which were overlooked, elided by these two camps. But it is
precisely the field itself--that is, equal to the field itself--that was
in contestation by these two camps. No better proof of how bitter and
divisive this contest was, I think, than Erica Hunt's essay in _The
Politics of Poetic Form_. That moment, historical, of equivalency to
the field itself, has passed, as Steve Evans knows, or is at least no
longer recognizable in those terms today, I think. And so now the
field looks larger, or large, or horizontal (when before it all
seemed verticle and oppressive) and is, besides, changing. Gosh!
Where was I...?
        What about others' views on this history?
        Meanwhile--or, elsewhere--_Mirage_, in San Francisco, ed. Kevin
Killlian, puts out a special on John Wieners in 1985. Some of it is in
tension with a getting-ready-to-have-been-"dominant"-subordinate poetics:

        Dear John [Wieners, presumably],
                I'm so tired of being serious now tho the 80s writing
        scene increasingly demands it. And where's all my fancy
        French crit vocab gotten me? Into _Poetics Journal_? Fat
        chance! (Steve Abbott, "Wienerschnitzel," _Mirage_ p. 7)

In any event I will photocopy Mittenthal's review for you, if your library
doesn't have _Writing_ 25 (1990)--this is to anyone, I guess.

Well, today's postings are so intresting so I think I'll throw in a word
or two after a week or so of being too tired to respond to all the deeply
disturbing allegations etc.

I've been reading the various new books on Duchamp (the bio by Calvin
Tompkins only so-so, but I recommend strongly Jerrold Siegel's new book--a
kind of psychobiography that really says new things about the work.  It's
called THE PRIVATE WORLDS OF MARCEL DUCHAMP (California, 1996).  Anyway,
Duchamp, who is hardly a "formalist" has in fact an incredible sense of
"form" in that the how always surpasses the what--in fact there is no
"what."  Take, for instance, the care D took to have the urinal
photographed by Stieglitz in front of the Mardsen Hartley painting so that
the inverted "fountain" matches the shape in Hartley with the Buddha.
It's so brilliant and that's how we almost always see "Fountain."  So what
is "content" here outside form?

In contrast--and here comes content--I'm reading with sick fascination the
recently published (thus far only in German) diaries by Victor Klemperer,
1933-45, a best-seller in Germany and reviewed recently in TLS.  Klemperer
was one of the few Jewish intellectuals (maybe the only one) who stayed in
Germany--Dresden, where he was a French prof--throughout the whole Nazi
time and his diary, begun the day Hitler became Chancellor and Klemperer
sees exactly what goes on day by day as all his friends are fired and
stores are shut down and the most vile stuff goes on and yet, for complex
set of reasons doesn't try to leave.  I shall have nightmares about these
diaries no doubt.  They are very well written.  But I would never read
them a second time because there would be no point--I'm absorbing the
content.  Wheras, as the man said, Poetry is news that stays news."

I know--there's no hard and fast contrast between art and non-art but
that, to me, is the difference between poetry and, say, these Klemperer
diaries.  Poetry is what must be reread--can only be reread.  And by that
criterion, a lot that passes for "poetry" at the moment just isn't.  It's
absorbable in a linear way.  Five years from now no one will give a damn.
And so I don't think we need be so generous that we say, oh great, I love
it all!  Let's reach out--and all that bla bla.  But "form" can never just
mean stanza form or generative device.  Generative devices can be
brilliantly used as in Oulipo, Sorrentino, Silliman, Hejinian, etc etc.
but per se no device is either good or bad.

I agree that reverting to some form of scientism is not the answer, not in
poetry. Outside of poetry, rational-scientific-critical thinking has already
killed the god. Inside of poetry, (it's too dark to read) that has always been
something to be contained so that it's not so terrifying. As for a "house" (or
other thingy for that matter), I hope it never becomes "understood,
commonplace, readily assimilated into a readerly unpacking." I don't need
poetry to tell me that! No; "make it strange" for me. A search for that unknown
something in  everyday experience but cannot be merely pointed to or described
without being altered or diminished. Lyn Hejinian does this so well when she
writes as she thinks and feels. The meditational needn't be purely cognitive
per se (perceived as a kind of scientism).

Intense individualism without the freedom. The poet only the poet of a moment?
The moment when you have your mojo working. But I don't think that Olson is
advocating chance methods here.

Thanks everyone for a reading list I'm going to
chase up in all its details!

        My own interest in astrology is a) I seem to
be able to guess people's sun, and often moon, signs
in up to 3 guesses so there's something in it for me.
Plus, I trawl around horoscope columns, and those that
seem to match up somewhat with my day (as a sun sign
Aries), I go back to, and use as another of those
correctives to self and ego: "I thought the meaning of
my day was this, but look at it this way too...". *Not*
as what *rules* my life, though. The more I look into
the various columns (in newspapers, in the gay press,
in Cosmopolitan etc), the more I see how it's an act
of using metaphor to interpret, through topological
assumptions, data held in common (i.e. conjunctions
of the planets each day), and I find that fascinating.
One column will interpret the influence of a water moon
on a fire sign as drowning it, another as allowing it
emotional space etc, depending on a kind of "chicken
and the egg", "what's the ground of your being" analysis;
which is also the root of metaphor; refraction through
which one can "return" to what's "really" indicated. My
take is more all things are a-flowing, sage Heraclitus
says, though even that is too much "grounded" in one
ideal state: water, not air, not fire, not earth.
        I also find the fact that I can guess people
quite well indicates (to me) that, like Lacan and
Derrida might say, we're genres, with a rising sign
genre and moon sign genre grafted onto our sun sign
genres. Astrology gives me one way to articulate too
my reservation about Lacan (which I think is Derrida's
too): that even if the unconscious is structured like
a language, that doesn't mean it's rewriteable like
computer language; the self is genre collision, from
personal and cultural histories, and the chemistry in
one from them.
        Does that interest anyone (or answer Spicer?)

Marjorie--

Your point is well taken, and of course, we do read in this way--I don't
store away my newspapers either.  But this is of course not to say there
is no form in these cases--only that as readers--and as readers (yourself,
myself, others like us who would bother to follow these postings on a
daily basis) who have developed an interest in form per se--we find it
more interesting to read and write about and teach formally innovative
(or, as I'd probably prefer to say, playful) works.  There is as much form
to the Klemperer diaries, I suspect, as there is to journalism, or
text-book writing.  These forms carry their own meanings (have their own
ontologies), and are potentially as interesting as any other forms,
depending, ultimately, on one's going interests and standards of
evaluation.

We all know people (some of us may be them!) who will always prefer
reading books and poems that don't foreground formal issues, who will
dislike, say, The English Patient (the book) because it doesn't just tell
its love story (I didn't know it was a love story till I finally saw the
movie!).  People surely have returned to all the great "realist"
novelists--just to use one kind of example--despite the relative
"bacgrounding" of formal issues.  In other words, using the terms I so
dislike, content-focus doesn't make a work of only passing interest, even
as a work. It all depends on what the content is, how one chooses to frame
it with other content issues, and so on.  I remember an essay by D. A.
Miller some time back in which he commented that he always reads Jane
Austen novels when he is laid up sick in bed. Now I'm sure, with Miller,
it is hard to disentangle form and content, but that's my point--just when
you think you've isolated a content, you're left holding a form.

So: what about the Klemperer, or the newspaper, or the textbook?  I
suspect you could return to the Klemperer, if you were interested enough
in it, if you were working on, say, diaries written by people undergoing
traumatic experiences.  You might find certain details, tics,
interesting, so that the content is illuminated in unusual, interesting
ways by the form.  I don't think you're going to put it away forever
because there is something essentially different about its formal
ontology, only that you won't return to it because its particular formal
ontology doesn't interest you enough.  It's not a form/content
distinction, but a difference between two varying form/content matrices.

My point is just that by keeping the boundary between content-works and
form-works operative,  we lose sight of the way in which
writing that is "content-based" is also a formal (and I would add
rhetorical, thinking of the old rhetoric/philosophy divide) construction.

Well, best regards, as ever,

Jonathan

Actually, several posts have agreed with the general point Jonathan
makes below; I agree with it too, for sure..

The nub, for me is in Jonathan's last line.  I sort of thought most of us
who get characterized in this way by others (i.e. as people doing
"formally experimental" poetry) were rather strongly in agreement on this
point: & that it was the worst end of reflective work-shop verse (as well
as much neo-formalist verse) that proceeded on the basis of a sharp
perceptible chasm between form and content...

Some of the hectic posts challenging form/content language, when I look
back at it, were I think set off by folks who were talking about "form"
as a way of addressing questions of technique; technique with regard to
self-aware, nonmainstream writing..

Is there anyone on the list who actually wants to DEFEND the idea that
form and content are seperate??

And I would like to say 'hi'. I would like to defend the idea that 'form'
and 'content' are not categories worth defending at this point -- since we
see no useful distinction, or rather since we see no isolable quality of
one or the other category, why keep talking about them? Why not try and
develop a vocabulary we can think of as valid? Sure, people will think it's
odd when they hear us referring to a 'querzblatz' poetics from time to
time. Stendhal flipped out at the beginning of _Love_ when he had to
introduce the concept of 'crystalization' of affection.

The Joe Brainard show at Tibor de Nagy (nazh -- 724 Fifth Ave, btw 56 &
57). Nancies, portraits, cut-paper works, collages, bead sculptures,
paintings on plastic, Porteresque landscapes with dog, catalog with
foreword by John Ashbery and essay by Robert Rosenblum. Wow, wow, wow. My
particular favorite was "Portrait of Pat, 1971", but "Whippoorwill's World"
was the one I laughed at the hardest. I tried to describe some of the
cut-paper tall-grasses-and-flowers works to people, but it came out wrong.

All best,

Eugene Guillevic, the French or rather the Breton poet who wrote in

poetry that says more than it sings the objects of his scapes. In

Ms. Perloff's example of Duchamp is to the point regarding form.  Formal
composition shapes what Adorno calls the mimetic impulse.  Form squeezes
out the extraneous elements of creative impulse, thus producing content and
giving it the most expedient vehicle of expression.  For me, art exhibits a
unison of form and content. Form directs, helping content become what it
needs to become during the creative act.  Duchamp's Fountain is a good
example. Like the Shakespeare of Sonnets, Duchamp clearly understood how
form determines an economy of expression in art works.

Ms. Perloff is also right when she says that "a lot that passes for
'poetry' at the moment just isn't."  Formal experiments can sometimes lead
to wonderful art.  But without the value content provides, strictly formal
experiments provide very little usable substance.  Moral conflict, humor,
and conflicting human emotional exchanges--found in artists like Tolstoy or
Jack Kerouac--are value-laden elements content provides.  Form shapes these
into compact, expressive art.  Too much that is written by contemporary
poets denies the power form can provide. Often poets allow form to exist in
itself without the complication of aesthetically valuable content, which is
focused and expresses something of that original impulse which urges the
poet to create in the first place.

I know Ira originally called for 20th century astrological poetics, but it
seems to me that if one is serious about this practice (more than just
casual sun sign questions or newspaper column borrowings) we do in fact
have to go back to those thrilling days of yesteryear -- which may also
shed a little light on medieval language theory. What exactly WAS Spicer
talking about with "snark hunting"? To wit:

"Astrology dominated all the natural sciences in the Middle Ages and
Renaissance, and even the Church (!) had to compromise with superstition.
Pagan gods and heroes became identified with the astral divinities that
ruled the cosmos; to this deification of the natural world was added the
doctrine of number. Number was the key to _scientia universalis_, and
numerical 'correspondences' between things of every class -- seven metals,
seven planets, seven virtues, seven sins, seven gifts of the Holy Spirit,
seven joys of Mary, seven liberal arts, and so on -- were supplemented by
the idea of melothesia, the correspondence of the microcosm and macrocoms,
especially the planets. The theory of numerical correspondences was also
part and parcel of the Neopythagorean and Neoplatonic philosophies, both
of which flourished at the beginning of the Middle Ages, and taught that
the universe is made according to geometric forms, abstract relations, and
proportions which can be expressed numerically. Each of these proportions
corresponded to a musical interval, and altogether, therefore, the
universe is a harmony. This idea was usually expressed in the image of the
music of the spheres, but all things, not only the spheres, harmonize (or
ought to) with everything else. The soul of man was a harmony -- this
Platonic idea is familiar -- and so is his body. Moreover, both body and
soul are a harmony corresponding to the cosmic harmony . . . the cosmos is
a 'book,' whose symbols, which must be 'read,' are made of plant fibres,
starlight, fur and feathers."  (Patricia Vicari, "Orpheus Among the
Christians," in _Orpheus: Metamorphoses of a Myth, ed. John Warden, U.
of Toronto).

I love that last sentence best -- but one can see Trane, I think, here --
as well as Giordano Bruno and Frances Yates and all the Warburg Institute
folks -- in Robert Kelly's "The Loom" (asked about two weeks ago) Ramon
Lull is one of the major personae --

correspondences in his Baudelaire essay as well as an earlier one on

I think you might read Olson a little closer, tighter. more literally. I
mean he is saying that it is form that makes us love. It is unlikely, for
instance, that one will love the content of a person--intestines, bones,
shit, etc. One notices her or him make a certain move, sees a light on
her/his face, hears her/his voice say things in a certain way, and love
starts up again. Similarly, for instance, with a sculpture by Rodin. One
doesnt particularly love the chemical makeup of bronze, but loves the way
it shines, or the way it is molded. How about the Grecian Urn? Does one
love clay? Probably not. More likely the shape left by the hands of the
sylvan historian.

Remember this song: "The way you sip your tea, the way you wear your
hat...." etc.

What do people think about these statements as statements of
aesthetic value?  To what extent is "expressive" contingent on
"compact" (if I am reading the implication correctly, or even if
 I am not)?
How well does Kerouac fit the statements?

This is a nice post to put next to the form/content thread.  What does it
mean to define form in terms of what makes us love? One indeterminate
chasing another.  This isn't algebra and I don't want it to be, but to
make a charged statement in context into a formula out of context is
tricky.  It makes me want to say that anything that sparks my love is
form, and that's too easy.  How is form/content distinguished from
mind/body?  You think you think when the chemistry goes dead and the body
doesn't move (e-motion)?

I suspect metaphor is lurking in the wings here, and that there's a
critique of metaphor implicit in these converging threads.  I stand by it,
myself, since all my experience tells me that the real work doesn't happen
in the narrow band of consciousness.  But I'd be grateful to anyone who'd
fill me in on the other side of this large unsaid.

I hope you don't take it that seriously.  I had a friend who used to write
the astrology column for the Boston Globe, and although she had a rough
guideline for the various signs, she basically made everything up.

Hi All.

I tend to think that talking about the fundamental abstractions of poetry is
too theological for me.  I'm hardly a literalist, but all this seems too
dependent on things that I can't see or hear, like worrying about whether
God can make a rock too heavy for Him to lift.  In other words, I don't
think that poetry can be experienced as a suprasensuous entity without
ceasing to be poetry.

That said, I also think that the whole form/content dichotomy is much
less interesting than the interplay between form and genre.  For example
you have things like the ODE that began in English as something defined
by its form and ended up as a genre (after the Romantics were
through with it!) or things like the VILLANELLE that began as a genre
(defined by its pastoral subject) and ended up as a form (oh, those
French!).

Maybe I'm too oriented toward the reader-response approach to poetry and
not enough oriented toward aesthetics (and all the metaphysics
that goes along with it), but form vs. content just doesn't do it for
me.  I tend to think that content is something to be consumed and that
language which is consumed isn't poetry.  After all, Bataille said that
poetry is language which is consumed (in the sense of used up), but
Heidegger said that poetry is language which is never consumed (in the sense
of something used as a commodity).

To use an example that keeps coming up, l am much more interested in
thinking about how something like the SONNET went through all these
formal changes as it moved from its status so close to legal discourse
(an entertainment for a bunch of Italian lawyers) to something via
Petrarch in which its wordplay became much more about the conversation
between self and other.  Or to rip off an idea from _The Birth of the
Modern Mind_ (not a book which I would necessarily endorse) what does it
mean to talk about the form of the sonnet -- not just it's vertical and
horizontal orientation on the visual page, but its AURAL symmetries and
asymmetries -- when you are talking about a type of poetry which assumed
(for the first time since the Roman Empire) that it be read in SILENCE?

With all the "defense of form" nonsense of the past few years I can't help
but think that a defense of genre could use more crusaders and
mercenaries alike.  I wonder how much of contemporary poetry which is
attacked for its lack of form suffers much more from its lack of genre.

Liz

Albeit admittedly one of your typical lurkers, I've been closey following
this form/content thread, and, at the risk of beating a wobbling, if not a
dead horse, I think the underlying issue here is one of boundaries. It is
not form, per se, or content per se, that interests, confronts and so much
and effects us poets, but the fact that we can't help but be astonished athow
the boundaries between the two are becoming (sic)so  blurred. It is
also that we poets must study ways of comprehending the energies that so
frequently seem to emit from suchsources, and learn to exploit these for
our "special effects." Coming near
to and being prone to such such energies often make many other folks feel
disoriented and threatened (sometimes less obviously a lot of our own folk
too,in part, occupational hazard, in part, a spontaneous obsessive
inquisitiveness into the effects of certain unusual juxtapositions.  The
more content we see, the more we sometimes
oddly get interested in what this tells us about the underlying forces,
and the more we specify those, the more we turn back to the objects of
this world within a revisualized and reconstitued set of forms. One
question this brings forward for me is- within this reformulated
relationship between form and content doesn't there also arise a parallel
(if anxiety provoking) reformulation between otherwise clearcut
disciplinel like poetry and criticism (two types of professional activity)
and, say, psychoanalysis and poetry, poetry and polical activity,
writing poetry and and
talking, writing poetry and teaching, etc.

Thanks Jordan Davis for mentioning the Joe Brainard show so vividly. I
heard it mentioned last night at the Granary Books book art show where
some wonderfully boundary-breaking work was on display from Kimberly Lyons
and Joe Eppings sumptuous and metaphysically witty Mettle, a compilation
of poems and images, to Susan Bee and Charles Bernstein's Little Orphan
Anagram, a wise and wise-acre witty poem/painting tap-dance duet, a Kurt
Schwitters round translated by Jerome Rothemberg with drawings by Barbara
Fahrner, and Kin, a text by Ann Waldman with drawings by (shhh) Susan
Rothenberg. Also heard mentioned were the Alice Neel show and the
fantastic Hannah Hoch montages at the Modern.

Elizabeth,

Where does Bataille say this? I've only read things in _Visions of Excess_
and in the _Encyclopedia Acephalica_ which tangentially speak of poetry
(as such), but I'm very curious about this idea of poetry as
"expenditure." Incidentally, R. Smithson says: "Poetry is always a dying
language, but never a dead language." Which is, something becoming "used
up," but never totally so.

Hi.
        Having eavesdropped on this thread for a few weeks, I'd like to
offer the following:
        Forms form; form forms--by accretion, by direction, by cascade &
interruption [as in embryo: "Eternity is no match for the zygote," Bob
Hogg said]. A feedback loop.
        Freud pointed, in "The Antithetical Sense of Primary Words," to
bifurcations, e.g., host/hostile. When not content with the inn's
content, host turns bouncer. Otherwise, why reject unsuccessful poems? If
only because of their content, change the content. But the form--
extensive from (or at least throughout) and superordinate to content--
resists change more intractably. Otherwise, the inn would assimilate the
surly and disruptive guest [losing its form as inn in the process and
becoming--what? A drunk tank?]. Not that, on occasion, a gatecrasher
can't liven up a party, but until that determination becomes clear, the
party metamorphoses from party to polygraph, then either ejects or
welcomes the uninvited, then reforms itself as party. If the gatecrasher
becomes a guest, the imminent becomes immanent.
        In his triadic theory of the Parasite, Michel Serres argues the
necessity, for communication, of both the presence of the static by which
the parasite seeks to disrupt communication between two interlocutors and
the need for the interlocutors continually [continuously?] to resist the
intrusion, allying themselves to allay the threat. When they stop
resisting, communication ends.
        Does form, parasitizing contents, unify them? Do contents,
resisting the imposition, form alliances? "One man's ceiling is another
man's floor."
        Don't you hate it when people finish your sentences for you?
Don't you love it when, if they seem about to, you reorient the sentence,
leaving them somewhere different from and better than either of your
expected destinations? "Because the whole sentence meaning is inherently
present in the mind of each person, it is quite possible for the pratibha
of the sphota to be grasped by the listener even before the whole
sentence has been uttered." --Harold G. Coward, The Sphota Theory of
Language.

Some of these upcoming events I've mentioned before, but I'll summarize here
once again.

 I know it's very late notice, but if anyone's in the Tucson area tomorrow,
in the Chax Press studio we're having a reading by poet Tom Mandel at 7:30
pm (101 W. Sixth St., no. 6/ call 520-620-1626 for information). And on
Saturday April 12 at 7 pm, a reading by Canadian poets Karen Mac Cormack &
Steve McCaffery, with a new book from us by Karen Mac Cormack, at Dinnerware
Contemporary Gallery, 135 E. Congress St., in Tucson. This second reading is
also something of a celebration of Chax's return to Tucson after a 3-year
stay in Minnesota, and a celebration of National Poetry Month. Both events
are free. For more of a look at the handmade books we've been making since
1984 in Tucson (and altogether since 1981), come to our open studio as part
of our entire warehouse art building's open studio party, Friday, April 12,
from 5 until 7 pm, at 101 W. Sixth St. The readings are co-sponsored by POG
in Tucson. POG will also sponsor a reading at Dinnerware Gallery on May 17
by David Bromige.

In addition to the works mentioned above also presented were
Funagainstawake, Harry Reese's monotypes in dialogue with "The Ten
Thunderclaps", reprints of The Word Made Flesh by Johanna Drucker and The
Book, Spiritual Instrument, the famed collection edited by Jerome
Rothenberg and David Guss, a classic in approaching the ethnopoetics of
the book; and works in progress, Vulva'a Morphia, by Carolee Schneeman,
the
beginning stages of Ted Berrigan: An Annotated Checklist (keep your eyes
open for the arrival of this one, some choice items will be made available
from the Berrigan oevre) and If It Rained Here, a fascinating mixed media
work including video images by Julie Harrison and modular poems by Joe
Elliot,also in progress.

Granary Books is fast becoming the most interesting new
gallery/bookstore/showplace for innovative works at the
boundaries of all current literary/artistic genres. This is important,
because Granary is helping to make happen what I believe to be what has
been most missing in contemporary artistic production  are the
connections,
the links between the genres. This, of course, encourages connection
between some of the most energetic and productive people in these areas.
I've always been fascinated (as have been many others) in the dynamics of
the belle epoque, as discussed in The Banquet Years by Shattuck,for
example. The interconnections between the arts as seen during that era
have led to innovations and artistic "threads" which have continued to
date. Check out the Granary at 568 Broadway (corner of Prince) or contact

They are separate to the extent that we have two words for two different
aspects of a composition.  Separate to the extent that we have the poetry
echo-effect as opposed to the prose absorption-effect.  Correlated to the
extent that we have a particular "work" of art in front of us.

Yeah.  trouble is with the word: "form". sounds like a kind of envelope,
or tax form, a thing you fill out, fill in.  "content" too.  what the heck.
"Please describe the content of MADAME BOVARY, in 25 wrds or less."
Whereas what we are calling form is the actuality, the visceral thing
itself. The content of a poem is the more formal aspect - the topos, the
subject,the directional arrows, the icon, the outline, the set of
signals. The farm produces the content.  The farm is... the former
continent.  What ARE the ramifications of incontinence with regard to
foam?  CONTENT IS FOAM.  AND FOAM IS CONTENTMENT.  MENTAL FOAM +
EARWAX = ODYSSEUS.  - Ezra J. Gould Hallelujah

addendum: prose is poetry translated by reality into readable French.
Poetry came before Proust - and yet, there would be no poetry without
Proust!  This is Zeno's paradox writ large and illegible!

Ironically, I've always found Valery's prose much more readable than his
poetry. His
_Collected Works_ is pub. by Princeton UP/Bollingen. _Art of Poetry_, to
which Hank alludes, is the place to start.

Bollingen / Princeton did a great 15 vol series of Valery, and almost
every volume is worth snapping in two. (Though it may be difficult to care
for the plays, and the autobiographical volume Moi.) About seven years ago
Princeton reprinted a few volumes of Valery's essays, the best of which
volumes were _The Art of Poetry_ and _The Outlook for Intelligence_. Of
the non-reprinted [in English] work, _Idee Fixe_ is a wild "novel", a
conversation between a narrator whose dialogue sounds very much like
Valery's essays, and an intellectual doctor, as the two walk across a
beach. The man loved the ocean, there's a description of thinking as
attempting to stand on a wet rock. Also unreprinted is _Analects_, a
selection from Valery's rather huge and ungodly witty journals.

Before the Boolean, there was a selected Valery from New Directions, and a
selected essays titled _Variety_ which has most of the pieces Henry's
referred to.

Subject:      form is emptiness

Much of this content/form discussion has been fascinating, very
educating, and it's a relief to see that a consensus seems to be
"forming" around the idea that the relationship between the two terms
is an endless paradox with no hope of resolution. What would we do,
actually, if we figured it all out? What poems would be left to
write? I for one sure hope that there is much more to this
"problem" than an intellectual puzzle to be assembled, as if the
form/content conundrum were some kind of "dream of a final theory"
waiting to come true.

Isn't it more likely that the mystery and intractability of the
form/content paradox constitutes the very essence and life-force of
everything poetic? That it's the ground out of which everything
in the past along with New Formalist sonnets, Oulipian
lipograms, sentimental workshop poems and so on has grown and
grows? Weeds
and bizarre looking vegetables and sweet smelling flowers (and *not*
that one poet's weed is another poet's flower, but just that there
are simply weeds and flowers and that they wouldn't exist, simply,
one without the other).

So the fight about what counts as good, I'd offer, takes place
very much on the surface of things, where each gardening club has
its distinct patches to sow and hoe. Some clubs plant in neat,
unvaried rows and spray their plots with chemicals; others use more
unconventional methods that actually *invite* insects and weeds, and
the villagers scratch their heads and accuse and whisper and so on.
(Some of these experimantal plots wither miserably, but a few
give fruit in astounding, mind-boggling ways.) This list is a club
that grows weirdly deformed heirlooms, to the point that they
don't even qualify for any ofthe contest categories at the State
Fair-- and hopefully never will.

In any case, Marjorie Perloff (who, we might remember, started
allthis talk) mentioned in a second or third post Duchamp's urinal:
"(He) has an incredible sense of"form" in that the how always
surpasses the what--in fact there is no "what." Taake for instance
the care D took to have the urinal photographed by Stieglitz in front
of the Marsden Hartley painting so that the inverted "fountain"
matches the shape in Hartley with the Buddha. It's so brillliant and
that's how we almost always see "Fountain." So what is "content" here
outside form?"

Wasn't Duchamp's urinal one of those great irrigation spouts shooting
content all over the planted field of form? (and reverse the syntax.)

And apropos Marjorie's above example, it's interesting that one of
the most cherished aphorisms of Buddhism is this (from the Heart
Sutra):

    *Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.*

I might be wrong, but doesn't Buddhism propose here that there is
something at bottom that is
beyond "figuring out" in the usual way? And can't one attempt to
fully set one's practice as an artist within this mystery? Not to
figure it out but to make the mystery even more bewildering, wild,
and strange. Or as Nick Piombino put it yesterday, to bring forth how
"It is not form per se, or content per se, that interests, confronts
and so much effects us poets, but the fact that we can't help but be
astonished at how the boundaries between the two are becoming (s=i=c)
so blurred." Thanks, Nick. You've written twice, I think, and offered
everyone a lesson in a few sentences.

A personal anecdote: I studied with Samu Sunim, a Korean
teacher at the Zen Buddhist Temple Ann Arbor back in 88 and 89. During
what I had taken to be an informal meeting with him he suddenly
shouted and gestured in a thrusting way at a poem written by an
idiosyncratic Korean monk and old friend of Sunim's (I can't recall
his name) who painted and wrote poems with a calligraphy brush tied
onto his penis with the hairs of deceased relatives. This artist
would--or still does(?)--squat over large sheets of rice-paper and
thus create works of powerful and ethereal beauty. The work
in question had a line of migrating geese, delicately rendered,
though flying vertically upward, beside a line of characters I could
not decipher. "Now," Sunim said, "I'd like you to go to this poem and
point out its content." I walked over to the poem and put my finger
on the cracked glass. "Now," he said, " point to its form." I did so,
quite confidently, putting my finger on the same spot. "And now," he
said, "point to your own original nature." Though by Zen terms this
challenge was quite conventional, my inability to answer
impressively inthe manner of an avant-garde poet in-the-know has been
haunting me since.

Here's a question: Isn't this list space also a particular form, in
*essence* no different from a sonnet or a villanelle? I
can't imagine anyone saying it isn't, especially when you consider
(even as new as it is) how deeply rooted its rituals and mechanisms
are , and how what we say here--both its content and form--is
determined by what we are given to speak within.
One could ask: is there a content here separate from the form?
Prior to it? After it? Where would one separate? There's no way of
doing it.

Emptiness is vast, and for a fleeting moment (before the
inevitable asteroid hits to irreversibly erase everything we
have done) we assume its form and sit down to write.

I think Herbert in _The Temple_ultimately discards form, a vehicle for this
known world only.


In the form/content conversation I wanted to inquire more about the above
statement (sorry--I can't find the original posting) as it seems most
puzzling to me; is discarding meant to be read as Fish's sense of a
self-consuming artifact.  Herbert invented more than 2/3rds of the forms in
The Temple, and the forms, more than anything, seem to be a method of
measuring (making visible.audible) the distance between this world and the
next; the struggle of faith vis a vis the always already completed
redemption through Christ's sacrafice (for Herbert); more than anythinng, I
read H's poems as a prolonged formal investigation into the exact nature of
the distance between the self and other (in H's case, Other), a project
which his perfection of form is designed to reveal as ultimately
impossible.  We could map on to Herbert's terms sign/signified, etc--not
necessary to read, linguistically, only within his High Anglican context.

Can boring poems operate as critique, until a critique of boredom is
formulated?

Why do I get bored by poems?  But at the same time, why am I most
interested in poems that s(t)imulate boredom, making me blank & drain?

If boredom were a commodity, would it be desirable?

And what if a poem is so boring it invites readers to question why
they're bored?

By whom? For who? Isn't this a question of audience. And how does a poem
_operate_? And how does it _operate as_? If it's boring, what would also
make it a critique?

Are these questions autobiographical? What poems are boring to you? Do you
require psychoanalytical/psychological answers or do you feel there is a
philosophical critique (via your first questions) at work?
>
> If boredom were a commodity, would it be desirable?
>
Again, this seems to pertain to audience. Desirable for whom? In other
words? Or do you feel there is a general economy of desire, such that this
question can be answered sub specie aeternis?

> And what if a poem is so boring it invites readers to question why
> they're bored?
>
What if? Do you mean is it still boring?

When I was teaching in artschools, watching painting teachers at work,
critiques usually ran along the lines of "this isn't working here"
(perhaps pointing to a particular section of the canvas) - instead of
"this doesn't work for me" (never mind the need to deconstruct "work").
Audience is replaced by universal, taste becomes transcendent, reified
into theoretical position.

So these questions would seem, i.e. "poem _is_ boring" to reference your/
our reading; thus a lot of people are bored by Chaucer, depending on
demographics/century/habitus/cultural economies, and so forth.

Schuchat Simon (writing from an avant timezone -- Sun, 23 Mar 1997

Can you site an instance of what would represent "form as such"?  If
so, then (as an instance of those "on this list" -- not to say, as
"most" thereof) I could try to consider a more considered reply.

Or, I mean:  is it that there's a back of other fools who are content
with form as such, whereas we -- a cut above -- are discontent with
it?  But what is it?

Is there anywhere, in any canon, textbook, notebook, any medium, some
poem that exemplifies [mere] "form as such"? --

I am, in a word, doubtful.

I'm presently working through L. Turco's Book of Forms.  And no I'm not a
new formalist or an old formalist.  I hate formalisms.  formalities always
make me nervous.  Have written a sestina, a villanelle, a roundel, a
madrigal, a large ode, a sonnet, four ballades, and a chant royal.
The occasion, for me, is mysterious.  I feel lucky to have the time/space
to be doing this right now.  But the impulse behind the individual poems
is not the ambition to "do the forms".  No, I am not content with the forms.
In fact, the impulse for each poem and for the series as a whole (from my
blinkered perspective, at least) is the CONTENT.  The best way I can put it
is: just as in those social formalities which make us nervous, we
nevertheless somehow to some faltering extent RISE TO THE OCCASION,
so these forms seem to me to be attaching themselves like barnacles
to the OCCASION of the general impulse (content, thought) behind them.
The fact that I have a lot of practice behind me & can DO the forms
is a considerable factor.  The fact that (in my blinkered view) the
content & the style JUSTIFY the forms - that is, make them actually possible
and not workshop run-throughs or antiquated anachronisms - makes it worth
doing.  Because I find it exciting to do something in the teeth of the
zeitgeist (i.e. postmodern barnacle-poems, neo-archaic barnacle-poems,
neo-Beat barnacle-poems, neo-fifties formalist barnacle-poems, eterno-
experimento barnacle-poems, etc. etc.).  Because my philosophy differs
from the reigning postmodernist zeitgeist.  I will outline my philosophy
yet again in Poetics List Henry Posting #1345708, due out in 3 weeks or so.

I look forward to that w/ informal anticipation.

Speakin' btw of zeitgeist, this past week's New Yorker carries an
amazing bit of chutzpa in the form of a brazen specimen of
theory-mongering (clearly satirical, in a way, but successful not
merely as satire, but rather, in the theory it alleges to espouse)
anent the nature of the zeitgeist / popular-culture-wise.  The essay
concerns a supposed "Iron Law of Stardom" which boils down to the
proposition that a Star (film, music, politics, whatever) experiences
proper & true Stardom for a specific limited term of 3 years (or, in
certain, carefully explained exceptions, 6 years -- where there's
been a re-make of identity . . .) -- don't have the mag on hand, and
I didn't even take note of the author's name (pardon to be so
non-attentive) -- but whoever the chap is, he wrote a memorable item.

The final-paragraph theory self-destruct mechanism was, in a word,
awesome.  I venture to recommend this mass-culture moiety to the
august theoreticals here gathered.

best,
d.i.

p.s.:  Mr. Gould -- also do look forward to your spectrum-spanning
formalities, at whatever-such point as done & available.  I went thru
a villannelle phase myself, abt. a year ago last summer -- lasted for
a couple months, and I really enjoyed it.  When one's in that sort of
groove, it can be groovy.

Subject:      Henry Philosophy in Small Nutshell

Modern philosophy began with Descartes, who created the Mind/External Reality
dichotomy.  Postmodernism, confronted with the 20th century techno-
police state-dead universe positivist worldview of the triumphant Modern,
countered with this dichotomy: Mind/No External Reality (or its variable:
No Mind/No Reality). (see Nietzsche, etc.)
   Henry thinks postmodernism is a dialectical coin-flip.  He goeth back
to the pre-modern.  Not to the irrational archaic, nor to Heraclitus'
dialectical yin-yang of united-opposing forces.  He goes to Heraclitus'
philosophical interlocutor: Philo.  According to Philo, the opposites
in reality are not united in eternal war.  They are help apart-together
by the supernatural dividing Word, the ineffable which keeps opposites
in balance.  Cosmos is thus not a dichotomy but a trichotomy:
Humankind/Supernatural/Nature.  This olden worldview has been a
resource for poetry before: for me, a little academic treatise by Sanford
Burdick - a study of Milton, called _Dividing Muse_ (Yale U.P., 1985)
is a very important little book. Humankind as ANALOGY, as IMAGO DEI,
for a transcendent HEART-SPIRIT - the ancient imago displayed very
forcefully in the Byzantium exhibit in NY right now at the Met (which
I would love to see) - well, it ain't dead yet, ye philosophes.
Reality is a text, yes - but Nietzsche/Derrida's only chapter 13.
Wait til you get to Chapt. 24.  - Henri Gould de l'Ecole de Providence

provocative p.s.: Where are ye then, ye academic barnacles of postmodern
style?  And where are ye, archao-huffapuffers of the new primitif?
And ye also, fussy neo-formalistes?  The physics of postmodernism is irrel-
evant, compared to the chemistry-biology of social criticism (see issue
one of Tim Woods' NEGATIONS magazine to see what I mean)...let us descend
through style into the interstices of the soup kitchen, sistren & brethren...
perhaps there our poems will be remembered...in the echo-chamber of real
world... (hear dat ghoul a-callin?) (whew, dassa ghost-voice, man)

Here's a roundel.  It was written after a long meeting of the Poetry Mission,
in Cranston, a litte ways from Ted Berrigan's b-place (this old-fashiooned
poem will sound like sacrilege to many).  The "pioneers' are them forthright
compagnards making a non-institutional civic poetry space.

NOCTURNE

The night air is soft, the trees hold their places,

The streetlight illuminates (diverted faces).
The night air is soft.

Words, words, tarred with a treacherous weft...
heart's treason, scars.  Posthumous traces
you'll replicate later--when no one's left.

Soul... death will bear your disgraces.
Friend... let this river be--raft.
Soon, soon--the deep gulf will displace us.  And
the night air is soft.

though sun ra was heavily space and planet oriented, it was not so much
from an interest in astrology (as i understand it) as from a feeling that
he and other Black people were not welcome on Earth, and would in fact
prefer to live elsewhere (saturn in particular) given the current state of
the earth. about a year ago we had a discussion on this list about how gay
writers etc often used tropes of otherworldliness (angels, outerspace etc)
not so much out of a graviation twoard systems of esoterica as an
articulation of otherness and a sense that "somewhere a place for us...".
etc.,  so i hesitated to suggest his name in connection with this thread

I've done this too, (but about 12 years ago with Turco's old Book of Forms
-- the thin red one -- is that the same one you're using or is it the new
one, the thick black one?) I think how HG articulated his interest is not
that different than how most people who try these things feel, even if
they can't say it as well.  I wonder if there's a way this discussion
obliges that second sentence in counter to the "guilty"  confession.
Well, I won't do it, and besides I have no idea what "form as such" might
be.  But I'm curious.  Has anyone else on this list worked through this or
other books, or other ideas on form, as a way to something else?

        Invoking McCord's name here might interestingly allow a

with astrology, angelology, form/content (and the history of), lists like
this one I'm writing and the one we're on, Spicer and Duncan and Olson on
wisdom, and institutional versus community memory and praxis.
        Last year I picked up, in Calgary, secondhand, a 1971 Sand
Dollar (Berkeley) chapbook by McCord, *Gnomonology: A
Handbook of Systems* and gifted it to Fred Wah, figuring, rightly
as it turned out, that Fred would know who this interesting-seeming
poet is. I would like to hear from others on his work and context--
and to pose the question: how might McCord's project be recognizexd today
as one of constituting a reading-horizon for a community out of and to
which new poetry is written? This question relates directly to the
status of "knowledge" in the work, in the community. (In asking this
question via McCord of today, the heroic individualism endemic to the New
American moment would have to be revised and "community" substituted for
"individual" as a constitutive pregiven--or would it.)
        Perhaps the title of this post--playing on Howard's last
name--should be: "Synthesis in the age of MacDonald's."
"Synthesis" as being, of course, something that poetry might
propose to do--and that McCord's poetics has a specific approach to, one
that is a form of "direct action" where action is verbal.
        From my cursory knowledge of McCord, it seems that his
"handbook" grows from Olson's well-known etymological seed-
injunction to poets to take history as they (should) take themselves,
since "history" derives from "'istorin," to find out for oneself.
McCord's handbook, then, follows Olson. It's a synthesis of books,
maps, worldviews, prioritizing the local grounded, literally, in the
land. But "land" turns out to be as much as code-word for
context that comprises a reading-horizon. Indexically it's got, as would
be expected in Olson's line, a singular *range*-- from Wittgenstein to
Sauer, Foucault to Yi-Fu Tuan.
        I find the utopic hope thrusting McCord's singular synthesis
forward and outward to be articulated five years later by Ed
Sanders, who also belongs, for a time, to this same Olsonian
impulse (that itself has a history predating Olson), in his notion of
an "investigative poetry," whose chapbook by that name is
dedicated to the memory of Olson:
                Investigative poesy is freed from capitalism,
                churchism, and other totalitarianisms; free from
                racisms, free from allegiance to napalm-dropping
                military police states--a poetry adequate to discharge
                from its verse-grids the undefiled high energy
                purely-distilled verse-frags, using *every* bardic
                skill and meter and method of the last 5 or 6
                generations, in order to describe *every* aspect (no
                more secret governments!) of the historical present,
                while aiding the future, even placing bard-babble
                once again into a role as shaper of the future.
                (Ed Sanders, *Investigative Poetry*, City Lights,
                1976, p. 11)
        The gist and grist of such a poetics stance is encapsulated in
the McCord statement: "I take the lyric as an epistemic form."
        Knowledge and poetry, knowing and writing, how does that jointure
take place where.
        This post sent to the list, instead of my harddrive under
"doodles."

Boredom & desire are opposites.
Or rather: there's desire & antipathy (w/ boredom at the fulcrum)?

Reverse the rhetoric, invert the formulation:
If desire were a commodity, would it be boring?

One can only commodify needful things (if the need is real, imagined,
pre-existent, or insta-manufactured -- those are secondary issues)

I'd say some more abt. this, but hesitate

Alan,

When I was painting in artschools, I often had a hard time figuring out
what my teachers meant by "this works" and "this doesn't work" too.

I realize my questions last night were de-historicized, and not at all
rigourously framed.  To be more specific, but not entirely specific, I'm
thinking of the contemporary *use* value of easy to access
excitement/entertainment, as opposed to waste, boredom, expenditure,
general economy etc.

Imagine a virtual sub-culture who invert the excitement / boredom binary,
and who organize their enjoyment on wasting time (anti-time=money).  Their
existence as a sub-culture is based on their enjoyment of boredom.  At the
same time, they see this boredom as a critique of the commodification of
excitement--after all, they are revolutionaries, and poets too.  The
question is whether their criticism actually reaches and impacts on the
world of entertainment, or whether it merely serves as a focus for
maintaining their own social coherency as a sub-group.  To my mind, the
potential of their critique outweighs the limitations (the foreclosure) of
reducing their boredom to a mere site for structuring enjoyment.

Is it better to bore large than excite small?

Peter

This sounds very much like Situationism - you might look into the work of
Guy Debord and the others - and their thinking did impact (for example,
detournement, flaneurship, etc. that was a kind of drifting related to,
but not equilvalent to, boredom) in a lot of areas, particularly around
May '68 - but they were also critically tuned into the culture at that
point.

There is also a lassitude in a lot of Bataille...

As far as impact, I doubt it would have any whatsoever today; there is a
combination of boredom and skittering in Websurfing (something related to
a concept I developed, "defuge," described in my texts) that would simply
short-circuit or bypass the site. There was also enormous attention
devoted to the aesthetics of boredom vis-a-vis Warhol; it was, as I re-
member, Laurie Anderson who first, for example, promoted the idea of en-
tertainment to combat a kind of boring structuralism that had taken over a
lot of performance art at one point. (I'm too tired, sorry, for citations
here.)

It strikes me that among the ways we talk about form two stand out: one as
product (this is a sonnet, that's a rondel); another as process (I am
writing a sonnet, I am working on a rondel).

Having studied as an undergraduate with genuine unreconstructed new
formalists, I remember being ordered to write in iambic pentameter, and the
profs would pick my poem apart either at the points where the scansion
broke down, or I had used an easy fix to work my way out.  I kept Miller
Williams, John Hollander and Dacey and Jauss's anthology _Strong Measures_
on my desk beside the dictionary.  I learned a lot, but I often felt like a
six year old forced to take piano lessons because it would make me more
cultured.

But with a few years behind this experience, I think I understand why they
acted the way they did.

I think it's a lot easier to talk about poems, especially in the workshop
environment, by only engaging with the formal/technical aspects of the work
at hand. This is often why so many workshop poems look and sound alike.  An
ideal form is assumed, which is then used as a yardstick to which the poems
on the worksheet are compared.  Issues of content, what the poem is about,
are seldom broached because workshops are social as well as pedagogical
beasts, and one of the rules seems to be that because authors have the
right to write about anything they please, no person's content should be
privileged over another's.  This makes sure everyone plays nice.  It also
guarantees a certain sloppiness in the ideas of the poem, in much the same
way as a person's ideas become sloppy when no one disagrees with them.

I think my profs were operating under the assumption that if you imposed a
formal strictness or rectitude upon the poem, the content would also have
to straighten up.

I don't agree with this.  It's just as easy to write a bad poem that scans
as one that doesn't.

One of the reasons why traditional forms (I would also throw traditional
free verse such as the so-called Iowa poem into this category) are often
treated with a certain degree of animosity is because they occupy a
priviliged position.  They're like the aristocracy of poetry, they have
long pedigrees and insist on a certain amount of deferrence (which is
assumed but seldom earned).

Yet despite this critical/historical baggage, I think these forms and the
language used to analyze the formal aspects of a poem are useful for the
act of reading and writing poems.  Not good.  Not bad.  Just useful.

Much like finally learning how to play the piano.

I think what you're fishing for, Peter, is sort of interesting -- but
have a feeling there's a problem with use of the word "boredom."

There are surely many levels & types of enjoyment, involvement,
attention, engagement, interest, awareness, consciousness, etc.,
which are dissimilar to & far from industrial-strength "excitement"
(especially as mass-culturally purveyed & cultivated -- or as you
say, "commodified").

A problem with your notion & proposition abt. "boredom" as a
culturally fruitful principle involves the fact that boredom seems
(in most common senses of the term) to suggest a mere falling off of
attention & interest.  Perhaps there could be nuances of meaning &
feeling huddled under that clunky catch-all moniker "boredom" -- but
to proceed in general terms here, I find it hard to see boredom per se
as the basis of anything very vital or interesting -- or I dare say,
all that worthwhile.

Boredom, however, is in the brain of the beholder.  You speak of "the
enjoyment of boredom."  I say: if it's enjoyment, is it really boredom?

Many of us have -- at various times, in various ways -- experienced
the paradoxical response you described: being most interested in
poetry that seemingly articulates an experience of boredom.  I can't
say I've had that exact experience -- but memories of (e.g.) concerts
from the likes of the estimable John Cage do come to mind -- in which
one must sometimes work (or be willing to work, if need be) to be
fully attentive to what's happening.  The challenge is to find the
interesting side(s) of what might at first blush seem uninteresting.
The payoff is in the finding of such.  If it were *strictly* boring --
if it always failed to engage -- it would be something very different
from what (in my view, & that of many) it is.

If one succeeds & manages to be attentive -- & further discovers
something worth attending to -- presto! one is involved in a process
transcending boredom.  Boredom might be one phase or aspect or
(initial) *gambit* of the overall process, but the whole hardly fits
under the B rubric.If one attends to the work -- ipso facto, one is
not properly bored.

Boredom is (isn't it?) the waning of attention & interest.  Out of
knee-jerk antipathy for boredom, the pop-culturites try (as we all
know) to turn up the volume & knock the socks off, playing the
excitement game for fun & profit.  There's a fear of boredom behind
this (partly); but the fear is somewhat purile.  Serious (or for that
matter playful) interest in (so to say) *the secrets of the mundane*
can short-circuit the boredom phobia, -- and much of 20th century art
has (arguably) sprung from practitioners who've walked that path.

There are  a few thoughts on this -- I think it's a complex topic; the
above is (at best) an imprecise precis.

d.i.

p.s.: boredom is one thing, but bland (say) is another.

Ni Tsan -- painter & poet of Yuan-dynasty China -- was, like many of
his insoucient chums, fond of the term "bland" (tan, I think, is the
Chinese).  It became, in fact, a term of high critical praise.

Another comparative reference that comes to mind is the remarkable
opening text in Chogyam Trungpa's little introductory volume about
meditation entitled *The Path is the Goal* (Shambhala Books).  He
characterizes meditation as "wasting time" -- a very worthwhile
wasting of time, in his view.  This likely has something to do with
what you're endeavoring to get at here.

Yes, very much so (Ra, of course, was both black and gay). I would want to
add, however, that Sun Ra's reputedly vast knowledge of astrology (along
with many other 'esotoric' systems) was based in a belief, however ironic,
that such a 'somehwere' did in fact exist, and was related to the stars,
planets, etc. (as with Coltrane, or certainly Braxton). I think of Duncan's
'Atlantis'  here - a place which ultimately becomes very 'real' in the
poetry ("a made place" etc.) as much as it stands as a figure for loss. Or
- specifically in relation to music - the sense I get in Nate Mackey's work
of New World African religious and cosmological practice being carried out
_not only_ as critique of the current state of affairs, but as continuation
of (or participation in) models of thought the 'otherness' of which has
caused them to suffer a marginalization at the hands of imperializing
discourse which itself warrants redress. I think, that is to say, that Ra's
thought does call attention to the latter as well as the former...

George Oppen saw boredom (or "the knowledge of boredom"), following
Heidegger, as a means to knowledge - an instrument of clarity (see the
first poem, in his first book). His sense, tho, is obviously not of the
kind of boredom referred to here. The Heidegger passage makes this clear:

        Real boredom is still far off when this book or that play,
        this activity or that stretch of idelness merely bores us.
        Real boredom comes when "one is bored." This profound boredom,
        drifting hither and thither in the abysses of existence like
        a mute fog, draws all things, all men and oneself along with
        them, together in a queer kind of indifference. This boredom
        reveals what-is in totality.

In Oppen, it is quite literally "what-is:" "the world, weather-swept, with
which/ one shares the century," that boredom reveals. It becomes a common
theme Oppen, especially in _Of Being Numerous_...

True, but as one who teaches Undergraduate Creative Writing courses, and
who doesn't spend much time on sonnets and the like, I find that it is not
only easier but more useful to talk about matters of form than to discuss
"content"--the latter discussion often breaks down into "What did you mean
here?" (which then turns into the even less productive "What _I_ was
trying to say here. . .")

True, this retreat to easy questions and answers can happen with formal
discussions, too, it's not nearly as often.  By form, since I'm not a
"formalist," I take to be the actual use of the words--I concentrate on
sound patterns (though I discourage end rhyme since its just too easy to write
simplistically in that mode) and heavily on lineation.  I ask them to
justify each line break (a task I wonder if I myself could perform
convincingly).  So the questions from the class are more along the lines
of "why did you do this _here_?" rather than "why'd you say that?"  At
least that's what I hope for.  Often, just to get a discussion of form
going in a beginning writing class is a victory.

Presenting form as ubiquitous (that everything they write is formed) is, I

I agree with Hugh here completely, except I would go so far as to argue that
meter & rhyme & form (sonnet, etc.) are not even the formal aspects.  In
my own writing work, it seems to me that unless these are treated as almost
trivial scaffolding - there to be bent and twisted & fooled around with
in whatever way you please - you'll never get out of the straitjecket.
These formalist workshop teachers (sounds like a nightmare) have got it
backwards.  30 years practice, let's say, at my own speeds & lineations etc.
make these forms malleable.  Piano playing - scales - free verse or metered,
it comes to the same thing.  & if it don't swing to begin with...

Easier, according to Auden. No doubt about it, according to me. 99% are bad
for you.  Better to go down the street & have a donut dunked in whiskey.

Again I go back to the point Mark Wallace raised about U.S. experimentalists
who set their own formal parameters & see what develops.  I see no
difference between this and what the forms do.  A lot of the forms actually
WORK (at least in my dumb lowbrow workshop).  I did a "glose" last night
(no, it's not a drug - it's a Portuguese form).  You start with a 4-line
rhymed "text" - then each line is the refrain, in order, of a ten-line
stanza, rhymed or whatever any way you like.  It works - it underlines
the text, sets up an echo-chamber.  - Henry G.

I, too, had undergrad creative writing profs who emphasized form at the
expense of content, but their reason, and as I get older I agree (read:
become more stodgey?), was that the purpose of such a class was to teach
tools so that when we finally had something to say, those tools would be
at our disposal--very much like piano lessons, indeed.

The famous myth (I mean I'm pretty sure it is factually true, but a bit of
mythologizing too), wherein Pound wrote that he had written a sonnet a day
for a year, then burnt them all, was very impressive to me in my teens
(long ago).  The idea of formal frames (form in the prosodic sense) is
still to be really clarified for us at this historical moment...Just what
is the relation between the two impulses...The one represented by working
(partly "to learn") with older forms, as mentioned by Henry and Katherine;
and the other impulse represented by more innovative "formal exercises"
--the B.Mayer list of St. Marks ideas, the spinoff used by CB in teaching,
which is on the Web...??  Are we thinking about "form" very differently in
the two different instances?  or is the one just an "updated" version of
trying sonnets and terza rima?  (I personally do get a lot out of playing
with such form ideas; I have one rather long poem which I attempted to
make consist of nothing but verbs; which I rather like; most such things
get tossed tho'......And as for my own provisional sense of the answer to
my question:  I think the two impulses are related, but crucially
different, not just versions of the same thing..But haven't yet thought it
thru....)

Henry's roundel was wonderful...

In regard to boredom: didn't Freud say something about boredom being a form
of anxiety? Didn't John Cage say, if something is boring, keep going for
half an hour; if it's still boring, keep going for an hour?

The first few years I went to poetry readings I logged a lot of boredom.
This had a lot to do with not knowing how to hear the work, sure, but it
may have had to do with the work being read being not totally great. At any
rate, ten years later I am seldom _bored_ at readings within the social
circle of poetry downtown New York. Uptown, well, I don't know the people.

When my students report that they're bored, I decode this as meaning that I
haven't made the project at hand available to them.

When I notice my mind wandering when I'm reading, I go as far as I can in
that other direction, then I come back.

That is a wonderful quote! I like Stephen Cope's post on Oppen/Heidegger,
too, and wld just add that bordeom is a writer's best friend. To be stripped
of the usual objects or purposes of desire is to be compelled to create new
ones. So I wld disagree with the good David Israel's remark that boredom and
desire are opposites. I see them working very much in tandem. Bordeom fuels
desire. But does desire lead to boredom? I wld guess it does.

i thinkk boredom is like depression, a cover up for something else, like
anger or loneliness. nothing is inherently boring, so the gaze should go
inward to find out why. so if a poem is boring to you it can still teach

my first reaction to Mark's interesting post is probably an obvious one
(I'm famous for being obvious).  The main difference between "working
through the old forms" and doing more experimental work is that the two
paths are usually aimed-at and responded-to by different audiences.
There is a contemporary art world, with which experimental poetry has a
(more or less) close relationship.  Experiment, to some degree, MEANS
autonomy or liberation from these traditional forms, studied (are they
still?) in academia, read by old fogies, trudged through in formalist
"writing workshops", published in strange anthologies, etc. etc.
And the whole thing has been "politicized" forever & ever by
Pound & Williams, especially, along with Eliot, etc.  Wallace
Stevens was different - he basically said in various ways & times
that the whole form question is a bore. (Agreed, Wally.)

But the question for the maker is, do I need to be bound by these
dialectics?  When I get down into the subatomic level of form &
creation, do they even exist?  I see a fabric, a verbal fabric.
Someone at a meeting the other day read Hart Crane's "Chaplinesque"
out loud, & very well.  She displayed just at what depth of
performance & innuendo this amazing poet (who played across all
kinds of trad/experimental lines) was working.  Ed Honig was there -
he said he was around when Chaplin was flourishing - & that Crane
was verbally mimicking Chaplin's mannerisms in a number of ways.
Yet this is only one level on which that poem works.  Now that's
an example of technique which blows your meter/rhyme/form-as-technique
claptrap (workshop-lingo) out of the water.

Technically, Turco is not "new" but old formalist.  That red book was
published in 67, I think, and he just last year retired from SUNY.
The women taking jobs away from men thing is infuriating, but this
baloney is ubiquitous (which is not to say that i don't fight it).  But
I've heard marxists and medievalists and, yes, postmodernists say the same
thing and then hire five white men in succession in a predominantly male
department.  ain't no movement owns that lame position.  I've written
about the troubled politics in new formalism, so please don't mistake _my_
position, but I'm not sure this characterization of Turco is fair.  Did he
_say_ he had this problem with queers?  Or did he have a problem with your
argument about queers?  There is a difference.

yes, yes, yes. I had an editor at a newspaper some time ago who overheard
a fellow reporter whining about a boring story. "There are no boring
stories, only boring writers." And to prove his point, he went on a drive
through the town which the reporter covered and came up with about a dozen
fascinating stories. He hated reporters who never left the office and
rounded up the usual "supsects" on the telephone to use for quotes in a
story. Talk about writing to an already conceived form!

agree!: absolutely and it's a key point: there should be a post on the way
about boredom and Warhol and Dada

often people defend against scary ideas by saying oh that old thing that's
boring we've heard that before (that's we construction in relation to
boredom): Warhol did it to Neruda: may tried to do it to Ashbery:

but surely we can learn from the old farts: I mean imagine a poem that
actually combines what's long and weird and heterogeneous in say (name a
language poet) with the versions of long and weird and heterogeneous in
(name a narrative poet from the twenties or thirties): that wouldn't bore
me

Hi.
        I posted the following to the listserv a few days ago, but didn't
use the reply function [my first time posting], so I believe it may not
have gone out to everyone. Here goes again:

        Having eavesdropped on this thread for a few weeks, I'd like to
offer the following:
        Forms form; form forms--by accretion, by direction, by cascade &
interruption [as in embryo: "Eternity is no match for the zygote," Bob
Hogg said]. A feedback loop.
        Freud pointed, in "The Antithetical Sense of Primary Words," to
bifurcations, e.g., host/hostile. When not content with the inn's
content, host turns bouncer. Otherwise, why reject unsuccessful poems? If
only because of their content, change the content. But the form--
extensive from (or at least throughout) and superordinate to content--
resists change more intractably. Otherwise, the inn would assimilate the
surly and disruptive guest [losing its form as inn in the process and
becoming--what? A drunk tank?]. Not that, on occasion, a gatecrasher
can't liven up a party, but until that determination becomes clear, the
party metamorphoses from party to polygraph, then either ejects or
welcomes the uninvited, then reforms itself as party. If the gatecrasher
becomes a guest, the imminent becomes immanent.
        In his triadic theory of the Parasite, Michel Serres argues the
necessity, for communication, of both the presence of the static by which
the parasite seeks to disrupt communication between two interlocutors and
the need for the interlocutors continually [continuously?] to resist the
intrusion, allying themselves to allay the threat. When they stop
resisting, communication ends.
        Does form, parasitizing contents, unify them? Do contents,
resisting the imposition, form alliances? "One man's ceiing is another
man's floor."
        Don't you hate it when people finish your sentences for you?
Don't you love it when, if they seem about to, you reorient the sentence,
leaving them (and yourself) somewhere different from and better than
either of your expected or intended destinations? "Because the whole
sentence meaning is inherently present in the mind of each person, it is
quite possible for the pratibha of the sphota to be grasped by the
listener even before the whole sentence has been uttered." --Harold G.
Coward, The Sphota Theory of Language.

I don't know much about the politics of phone book publishers (maybe I should)
but I just go ahead and use it.  And this is the 2nd time I've been noted
for "eclecticism" on this list.  I will not be smeared with that popcorn
butter!  Wilbur Delaze Potato, my lawyer, is documenting these accusations.

As i sayed to Joe Amato, I have my own narrow motivations, & these machine-
gun blabs of mine have probably distorted, once again, the "big picture".
The EPOCH-MAKING BREAKTHROUGH of 20th cent HAS been the breakdown of
trad formalisms in poetry.  It has ushered in an explosion of just plain
"writing" and "performance" which is powerful/authentic/original art
in ways far beyond the 19th cent or previous could imagine.  This goes
back to as M.Perloff mentioned, Duchamp & his frames.  You put a frame
around it - even an invisible, surreal/ironic frame - and it says something
new.  The question is whether by now these frames haven't gotten awful
heavy, clunky, expensive, and recherche. (i.e. boring????)
   But the question for anybody working in "forms" - trad. poetry forms -
is whether they really CAN be authentic/original/new & interesting to
any degree comparable with the experiments.  I don't know the answer to
this - may be one reason I'm doing them (at the moment).

   I am not a formalist and I am not eclectic.  If you look on the underside
of the paper on which each and every one of my poems is written, down on
the lower left corner, you'll see a small fingerprint in green ink.  That
is MY PERSONAL TRADEMARK which runs like a motif through ALL my work.
I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU which finger it represents.  Eclectic, pish.

          POLICE BREAK UP ACADEMIC O.F. RING

South Liverwurst, NY (ap).  After a tip-off from Prof. Dendra Smothaird
and campus police, Liverwurst authorities were able to penetrate and
arrest 5 members of an Old Formalist ring they said had been "active"
for years in the upstate NY area.  "We don't know why they chose Buffalo,"
said Luongo Frim, chief detective. "It looks like a very professional
operation.  These guys - if you can believe it - were operating under
a front, a punk rock band called Angry Young Dandruff - most of them
are in their sixties, seventies!  Writing sonnets & stuff.
I don't know - upstate NY used to be a nice, clean, progressive
experimental area..."  Lois Mechanique, owner of Lois's Lo-Fat
Diner, said - "And I used to serve them coffee.  I shoulda known -
these were eggs-over-hard guys.  Every morning - and they'd be
mumblin over their coffee - like, rhymes and stuff."  The five men,
who's names have been withheld (they have tenure), are being held
without bail in the Louisville Lock-Up, for some reason.

all I really wanted to say was: it doesn't make sense to use Turco against

Maria, I think you're right that boredom often does mask some emotional
state that's gone willfully unrecognized. But there's another sense in which
I think writers deliberately attempt to cultivate bordeom as a means with
which to "break out/into" a fresh line on things.  Perhaps cultivate is the
wrong word. But when boredom comes, it ought not to be eschewed as it can
lead to a new avenue. Which links to Jordan's remarks about anxiety and
Cage.

i thinkk boredom is like depression, a cover up for something else, like
anger or loneliness. nothing is inherently boring, so the gaze should go
inward to find out why. so if a poem is boring to you it can still teach
you stuff, if only more about your own desires.  i like this thread of
theorizing boredom, it seems far more fruitful than the old form/content
treadmill.--md

On Ontological Activism:

            It's often pointed to as the oldest and most fundamental
complex of questions to occur in human consciousness:  "Who am I, and what
am I doing here?"  Questions of this type, along with the resources needed
to ask them and give them adequate reflection, are increasingly proscribed
by the conditions currently structuring much of our daily experience, which
ultimately threatens that human consciousness that makes such questioning
possible and even necessary.

            The phrase "ontological activism" announces itself as the
public asking of the questions of being, transforming the individual "who
am I?" through re-integration with the communal--"who are we?" in such a
way that the opening up of personal perspectives may continually transform
the communal as well, by offering examples of investigative strategies.  In
this way, the question becomes, "Do we as human beings wish to continue
being, and if so, how?"

...and if you keep at it, it will no longer be boring to you. I think that
Gertrude Stein had a good handle on this. Reading Stein may force one to have
to redefine one's own definition of boredom.

Wonderful and insightful comments from md. I found that boredom (as opposed to
entertaining) was most often an excuse on my part. When that feeling occurs, I
go back to reread the poem with renewed vigor since I may actually be missing
something. In this negatively capable manner, I have been able to expand my own
interests to include poets that I never considered before.

About eight years ago I used to hang on the periphery of this group of
writers who published under the name of Apathy Press (I still have their
t-shirt, which consists of an anatomically acurate brain with swans' wings
attached).  Anyhow, the origin of the name of the press, according to Tom
DiVenti, was the idea that it is only out of a state of apathy can anything
start.

Boredom strikes me as a particularly negative energy source, much like a
black hole or drug addiction.  The trick is to come close enough so that
you slingshot out into something fresh.  The risk is that you fall in,
perhaps forever.

Personally, I find I have more than enough boredom at my job that I need to
seek out other experiences to bore me as well.  It's not like boredom is
ever a scarce commodity.

It also strikes me that this discussion of boredom is linked with either
flight or transformation:  either one runs from what is boring towards what
is not boring, or one sticks with what is boring until it is no longer
boring.

What if it's boring for years?  What if it will always be boring?  When is

Existentialism and the bad picnic


After 'The Marginalization of Poetry, An Evening of responses to Bob
Perelman's recent book from Princeton University Press' I was asked by one
of the respondents what question I would like to have asked. I thought
later that it would have been something along the lines of whether the
panel and discussion would have been any differently constituted if the
work being dealt with had been a poem. This I sent as an observation to
someone who replied 'But some of the work in that book IS poetry...'


around and about marginalia:

Identity politics is only and inevitably ironic*.

Yes, fault was found in the work's not being something else** (evidenced
by the author's polite stammering, an eloquent mea cupla so long as you
didn't pay attention to the words), however the discussion was generally
overshadowed by the I-know-coz-I-was-there school of inanity represented
(and I use the word advisedly) by the academic trope of 'about'.
'Aboutness' was evidently the topic under discussion. However 'aboutness'
has no logical intersection with change. It is a decorative form of
identity which yields to description and is indulgently pathetic. And as
to the politics of ancestor snatching (semantics), we already knew that
it's easier to be embarrassed by our friends - enemies at least have the
moral integrity of not being right for the wrong reasons. They at least
have no confusion of  form and content, no 'about'. And no blame. They at
least are blessed with the possibility (decadence) of changing they're
minds.



* It in no way requires a me to be understood. In it, I has the
exclusively romantic status of a victim.

** 'I am' is the blessing of stupidity - write your own fucking book.

Hey, I was in the audience for this (was it MMLA or MLA? Chicago or
Washington? Anyway) if I remember correctly Diane Wakowski was the third
panelist, and she also apparently got on his nerves, because within a year
he published a hissy-fit disguised as an essay attacking her views on the
politics of form (which are open to criticism, but you could tell by the
ferocity of his "essay" that she got under his skin). Mercifully, I missed
the wounded white guy screed.

the hardest part, when working
with budding writers, is initially to instill the
confidence in them that what they have
to say is worthwhile. doesn't the molding
of the craft _then_ come after? i mean...
with dedication comes the venturing to explore
different forms and styles which will best
bestow the voice with a resonant clarity,
but the first step,
i think, is the initiation of breathing
into those words, and then with the
discipline of form and texture of language
comes the compression and necessity of
each aspect of the piece (ie: why _this_ word,
does _this_ form best illustrate the sanctity of
the piece as a whole?)

working with a jorie graham-esque aspect of
language (the invisible stitches being just as
essential to the working whole as the stitches
that you can see), and as the students engage not only in
the exploration of their own writing, but the
analytical study of other poets, they can decipher
the methodology which best suits the content of their piece.

the words on the page are just as essential
as the precise placement of the white space
that remains _around_ those words. they all
work as a whole to bring the language to life.
call this all form, if you will.

basically what i think a lot of this comes down to,
is that with experience you begin to utilize
the tools of your trade. intro creative writing poetry
courses are the most intimidating place for the
little freshman/sophomore undergraduate to
be when they're still struggling with the intimacy
of their writing. the crafting comes with experience.
_that's_ when the tools (ie: more confining forms,
more confining topics, etc) will become generative
for them.

its' all about illuminating that spark and
letting it start a brush fire in their minds, eh?

but isn't that what teaching is supposed to be about?

which leads us to henry's statement of:

 henry <AP201070@BROWNVM.BROWN.EDU>
>  Experiment, to some degree, MEANS
>autonomy or liberation from these traditional forms, studied (are they
>still?) in academia, read by old fogies, trudged through in formalist

how many classes teach traditional form in
present day academia?

wow. think about that one. do any of you
offer classes that focus on the specialized use of
what some would call more 'traditional' form?
i think that this would be wonderful in aiding
many students today.... kids are _screaming_ for
opportunities to mold their craft... they're
doing excersizes on their own in writing
cantos, sestinas, villanella's, etc,
if only to _impose_ a form upon themselves
in order to explore the boundaries of language
and see what is hiding
in the 'narrw diary of [their] mind' (sexton).

but what it comes down to, is that if they're
doing this work on their own, they are
obviously starving for the opportunity
to engage in this 'mental foreplay' in a
classroom setting. they're raging on
challenges. we can't underestimate their passion.

Not that familiar w/ Graham's work, but this notion sounds a lot like
something I contended about music in something I just wrote.  (What's
important to me is that the invisible stiches are, in fact, still stiches.)
Where would I find Graham discussing this?

2) Someone mentioned a few days ago that 'a consensus' seemed to be forming
around the form/content discussion, to the general effect that they're
inextricable from one another.  But isn't this where we started?  And,
though I understand the -form- of the consensus, I don't think I've quite
gotten its -content-.  Someone else said that this listserv was a form, and
rhetorically asked if it had a content separable from it.  Well, if not,
then this list has the same content as, say, the white-power-music list that
has been mentioned (as something to vote against the existence of, though
I'm not clear on the details).  This seems an odd conclusion.
        "I love the Mets," "I hate the Mets," and "I misuse the olive fork"
all have the same grammatical form, but might be said in -some- sense to
have different contents.  Now that sounds like the kind of banality John
Searle might perpetrate, but I'd like to know -specifically- how we are to
go beyond it.  Is the sense in which these have the same (I'd just say
similar--nothing's ever the same) content just the sense in which they all
make certain assumptions about the relation of subject to object?  What else
can be said?  (I'm not being rhetorical -at all- here, I want to know what
people will say--and I realize that I'm treating the sentences above as
linguistic abstractions, divorced from any particular utterance or use, as
in a poem.  Still...)

3) Recent discussions about teaching form boil down, for me, to this
question:  Why couldn't "Write a sonnet in strict iambic pentameter" be an
entry on Bernadette Mayer's or Charles Bernstein's experiments lists?  I
think the answer has to do w/ breaking the hold of the cultural capital such
forms possess.  At Pomona College, the main creative writing teacher was
Robert Mezey, the ex-"Naked Poetry" editor who recanted at became, at least
when I encountered him, an arch-formalist.  I remember being in a workshop
with a talented student who gave him a sestina that the student had, I
gathered, worked over a number of times.  The gist of his comments was
something like, "It's getting there, but it's not there yet."  To me, this
is an indicator of how -mystified- (in something like the John Berger sense)
the Unity-of-Form-and-Content can be for a certain sort of teacher.  All
Mezey seemed to be saying was: Go back and revise and revise this until it
is 'perfected' according to some standard that does not admit of analysis,
but can only be apprehended by pure artistic intuition.  Then, my son,
you'll be a poet.  In a word, feh.  (Jed Rasula was a visiting prof my
senior year, and that loosened things up a bit.)

4)  Could Maria (or anyone) tell me where to look for info on Sun Ra's
gayness?  I've never encountered this in print, even (unless I've forgotten)
in John Corbett's excellent -Extended Play-, which has a great chapter on
alien-ness in Sun Ra and George Clinton.

5)  This was from a few days ago, but: Plato would be surprised to learn
that the medievals invented the difference between words and things.  (I'd
like to be quoting the -Cratylus- in this regard, but I don't have a copy here.)

heterogenously,

        David Bromige here, I'm back on the list, so careful what you are
seen saying about me if anybody does.  Apart from George.

I understand Bowering has for the third time renounced his good work in
_Piccolo Mondo_ .  How about if I post some bits of George's chapters, and
let listmembers gauge whether my parodic powers could possibly reach that

Subject:      THEY WANNA COVER US WITH MARGARINE(alization)

Dear to whom it may concern:

Although I've been suspicious about what "call" it is that I am exactly
responding to, I will try to "suspend" (or at least diffuse) such suspicions
and try to address some of what for me seemed the issues that were (and were
not discussed) at the MARGINALIZATION event.....

Perhaps the best place to begin would be at the "ending...." (in real time)
The last question asked at the event was by Jackson Maclow (who, earlier that
day, had given one of the best readings I'd seen him give--despite that damn
ear inn perennial p.a. problem), and it was a question that, had it been
asked earlier, may have changed the whole discussion. It was something to the
effect of---(warning: all following 'quotes' are paraphrases and if I
misrepresent anyone PLEASE let me know)
"I came here thinking that this was going to be a talk about
THE MARGINALIZATION OF POETRY, and it turned out it was a talk about a
particular book called "The Marginalization of Poetry" and...." Jackson
apologized for his ignorance and naivete, on a "face value" level, but also
addressed, although in his rather childlike zen-master way, a question that
in some ways was "very near the surface (or the heart)" of what seemed to be
Silliman's challenge (which I'll address shortly) to Perelman's project here.
The question, for me, and that seemed to get lost in the discussion that
night, might be phrased in terms of Steve Carll's "ontological activism" (why
am I here? etc or how do do we position ourselves viz-a-viz certain
questions).
Marginalization is a LOADED term and perhaps (as Steve Evans and others
pointed out) a cliche by now--and its meaning (like the "sublime object")
depends on its context, and WHAT WAS the context of the event? Was there a
context? Can there be a context? Maybe it hasn't been constructed yet and of
course *I* can not construct it here, but only in questoning....

Jackson's question elicited from Bob the response and REMINDER that the
book's title grew out of the essay/poem (or whatever you wanna call it) that
he wrote for a very specifically academic context in response to a call for
papers
from Marjorie Perloff (see book for details). Had this REMINDER been made at
the beginning of the event, I think the discussion would have gone quite
differently. For, IN ACADEMIC DISCOURSE (as Jonathon Levin and others), and
in English Departments, poetry is marginalized viz-a-viz novels, cultural
studies, etc (again, take a look at the latest MLA call for papers, etc.) in
a way it might not have been in previous eras (I'm not going to get into that
one here though....).
Marginalized in general, and there is perhaps a desire amongst poets who work
in the academy to DEFEND poetry against such a status (there is even a
desire, for understandable reasons, of teachers of poetry to do so)--this is
perhaps as true of champions of "the western canon" as much as it is of
champions of "language" or "new york school" etc. etc. writing

Yet, when we take Perelman's book OUT of this particular context, and bring
it to the SEGUE space, suddenly it becomes a DIFFERENT book. Suddenly we see
a Professor at an Ivy League school on the defensive because the audience
(and perhaps the fellow panellists) was mostly people who see themselves as
MORE MARGINALIZED than Perelman as poets, and one could imagine the satiric
scenario depicted in Kenneth Koch's "FRESH AIR" being updated, and instead of
the "you make me sick with your talk of swans and candy hearts" etc of that
poem, there was "Free Bob Perelman" stickers and whispers in the wings of
him, from both the linguistic left (as a native informer), the social left
(as an unmarginalized white middle-to-upper class male) (which may be seen as
a "linguistic right" though I that's why I objected to what I saw as
Marjorie's distinction a few weeks back although I certainly agree that poems
that CAN'T STAND UP AMONG REPEATED READINGS are 99% of the time boring and
dull) and others.
The point I'm trying to centralize here is that, as far as I could tell,
THERE WASN'T ANYBODY MORE ACADEMIC THAN BOB in the audience (or on the panel)
and this certainly informed the tone of the event and seemed to ironize the
book and at least its title in ways that could have been made clearer BEFORE
Jackson's pointed question.
Ron Silliman's paper (which began the event, after a pointed introduction by
moderator Sean Killian in which he lamented the lack of intellectual forums
in NYC and hoped this event would begin to change what he perceives as the
rather anti-intellectual bent of the "downtown" NYC poetry scene
and after a recital of the poem by Bob about being abducted by (academic?)
aliens he posted to this list)
did seem to make many of these points about Bob's book as
he pointed out that it was primarily addressed TO ACADEMICS  rather than to
poets and considered that the primary FAULT of the book---that the
distortions of the kind of NORMATIVE ACADEMIC DISCOURSE Bp is working in here
simply CAN NOT do justice to what, for ROn, is the most exciting and
interesting strains and achievements of LP (Hannah Weiner and Bob Grenier)
and centered on BP's reading of Grenier as an example of this method. Ron
made a conceptual distinction between "critical" and "academic" writing (as
if the latter is always already more corrupted) and found Bob's attempt to
create a NARRATIVE for Grenier's poetry as well as for his PLACE in "poetry"
(canon, etc.) deeply disturbing, as if narratve is always more corrupt than
poetry that "is not ABOUT" or "about the nanosecond before choice itself
occurs" (and as I digression I wonder about what the implications of Ron's
seeming preference of Grenier's project to Bob's--especially considering
Ron's problems with the "Burning Deck" or "French minimalism" thing, which to
me seems to have much more in common with Grenier than it does with Perelman
in terms of this "nanosecond" standard Ron is setting...but this is another
topic)
Ann Lauterbach took a different tactic. Not needing to SPEAK FOR THE HEART
AND SOUL of LANGUAGE POETRY as Ron's argument with Bob seemed to, she dealt
more with what she perceived as Bob's ghettoization of emotions and the
personal.
One of the high moments of her talk in this connection was her reading of
Bob's reading of a Creeley poem aout him having sex with another woman as his
wife drives the kids to school or something. I think she did a very
interesting job of pointing out an aporetic hedging on Bp's part as he tried
to disclaim the importance of content in a writer who write "form is nothing
but an extention....". She also addressed some gender questions--for
instance, why THEORISTS are gendered male and PRACTICTIONERS are gendered
female in this book. Of course, Lauterbach concluded, PRACTICE subsumes
theory, and BP was not necessarily claiming a hierarchical privilege of one
over the other--but, then, he doesn't really devote that much page space to
the women writers he addresses and that might be telling (again, this may be
a severe misrepresentation of the thrust of Lauterbach's paper)....

This is going on too long (I think I understand Joe Amato)....
but Juliana SPahr was next and spoke about what she perceived as Bob's
COASTAL bias, and (as if NEW YORK is the NEW COAST)
focussed on what for me seemed to be a defense of Bruce A. and Charles B.
against what she perceived as Perelman's neglect. She claimed that, in
contrast to BP's assertion, that these writers CAN be taught...
Then Steve Evans did a long and funny (and almost dada-like)
performance of a reading of a Bunuel movie, and claimed to have DIRECT
EVIDENCE of how academia dulls people and used some VERY interesting
DOWNSTREAM metaphor in which I would like to cast myself as the missing
SALMON swimming upstream....
But, all these discussions (and most of the Q and A session afterwards)
stayed within the confines of the agenda the book set up. In the Q and A
session, bp was primarily on the defensive, as i said before. It would have
been interesting had THE MARGINALIZATION oF POETRY (the issue as much as the
book) in SOCIETY as well as in the academy had been addressed...It would have
been at least interesting not to single out Bob but to ask what role the L
poets have played in marginalizing poetry? Did they willfully marginalize it?
(with their own networks of publishing and not needing to make certain
compromises in the beginning that other, perhaps pooer (economically
speaking) poets, must, at least at the beginning? And in this light, can this
vindicate Bob for at least trying to break out of a small, perhaps too
self-satisfied coterie, and fight certain academic battles? Or is poetry
marginalized through no fault of poets? Is it one of the exigencies of heavy
"LITE CAPITALISM" (who said that?) that
poets are helpless against, and in such a light are the strategies the L
poets adopted (I'm talking about "circulation of texts" as much as the actual
writing of them) seen as at least NOT making matters worse in the increasing
rifts and poetry wars? Or has poetry ALWAYS been marginalized and is it
perhaps okay that it is best so? (always best so, or at least sometimes, as
in Evans' quoting Auden's "poetry makes nothing happen" and stressing the
positive side of such a formulation--as if this "nothing" is kind of like
Silliman's "nanosecond before choice is made" and CLASS IS SUSPENDED)?
These questions, as well as why are so many poets deciding to go back to
school later in life (not just bob, but myself and Ben Friedlander come to
mind)--after already publishing at least one book, are interesting questions,
as are the questions of the workplace and race and class that were attempted
to be discussed in the Q and A session......(hope this helps

Just wanted to say that earlier this month I saw
readings by Thomas Sayers Ellis and Tom Breydenbach (sic)
in NYC. Both excellant writers circa 30 years old and both
excellant readings. Names to look out for,
as is Joe Ross, whose FUZZY LOGIC SERIES has just been been published by
Texture Press). I consider it to be one of his best
(along with GUARDS OF THE HEART), though I may be biased, because the work
does seem EXTREMELY similar to some of my own....(mordantly recursive?) and

thanks Chris for the thorough report from the frontlines of Edg.Po.  Some
off-the-cuff widgets:

1. WHO WILL ARISE and write the good definitive popular academic book about
me & my poetry friends and tell it like it is?  Back, sharks...

2. If poetry has circled the wagons & has only academics left to handle
the winchesters... well, I wouldn't bet on it.  Hey, they care.  Take care.
Let's think about it. Baby sharks have mothers too.

3. Maybe part of the problem - maybe this is what Mac Low was getting at?
Is the draining struggle to approach poetry as if it were a political
campaign or a community organization?  WHO SPEAKS FOR US TODAY?  HERE!!
READ THIS PROSE POEM!!  (It's easy to criticize from the easy critical chair
though... I'm a member of the ECC organization (Easy Critics Club))

when you're providing info/analysis that many have called for!  Now, could
you, or anyone, give me some events/readings happening March 27-30? I'll be

The words flight and transportation make a nice addition to the vocabulary of

yeah, wakoski was one of the four of us.  she also insisted that spicer's
only interest was "poetry" (i.e. stay away from those queer politix, little
girl --as if there's such a thing as "only poetry") but at least she wasn't
turco, and didn't add insult to injury by implying that women were
responsible for the job shortage.

There is such a thing as only poetry.  It's just hard to write disses on
it these days unless you relate it to something else.  I'm starting a
new school of poetry, folks, for those of you for whom Providence School
is too heavy on heaven.  It's called Edg.po - here are the guidelines
for joining THIS new school:

1. Ephebes will have to make a good-faith effort to write only poetry
for a while.

2. Ephebes will through trial and error & exploration over the millenia
try to infuse either the whippoorwill-effect (Russians), the mockingbird-
effect (Ghould), the pendulum-effect (Valery), and/or the boomerang-effect
(Edgar Poe) into their poetic compositions.

3. Each member of the Edg.po school will NOT be required to write a lengthy
treatise or compile an anthology illustrating one or more of the above modes
of Edg.poetics.  This will be done by the grad students - not to worry.

4. Edg.poets will wear little black string ties, shoes that are too small for
them, and walk around with a pained look most of the time.  They will remain
for long periods in their place of residence and will not attend conferences
or ham it up with their compadres - no shop talk allowed.  They will correspond
in longhand with their readers at large - that is IT, folks.

- Henry Gould, Edg.poet  (today I will take a walk down Benefit St, where
Eddie had maybe his last (& most famous) photo taken (the one with the
pained look), drunkenly wooed the demure Helen Whitman, and got ready to die.)

"With regard to 'Neo-Formalism': ever since I studied linguistics when I
was a kid, it's bothered me that the word 'Formalist' has been used to talk
about exactly the opposite people from those whom I think of as Formalists,
to talk about people who would never question ideas of form, but are only
interested in what they call content, and are really happy to use whatever
Edward Arlington Robinson used in their versification. What is called
Formalism displays no interest in Formalism at all. That's not what is
meant by Formalism in talking about European painters of the early
twentieth century. If they had not been Formalists they would have been
doing Poussin."
George Bowering, on a panel in Ottawa, 1986.
I've always liked this statement, & I tend to think it's on the nose.

Have to admit that in my classes I tend to be as specific as I can about
formal aspects of the students' poems, & try to get them to ask questions
along those lines, not specifically about 'content' (?) as such. But
setting some formal challenges can help them to see that working on the
challenge often frees new content into being. bpNichol always talked about
that: he sought new forms in order to free up possible statments he might
not otherwise make, especially if he stuck with the way of saying things he
already knew too well.

The idea of a National Poetry Month was recently attacked by Richard Howard
in a speech reprinted in the latest Harpers.  Basically, he says that the
idea of such a "celebration" ghettoizes poetry, reducing it from something
lofty and "millennial" to something commodified and sanitized, on a par with
National Secretary's Week.

Of course this is "the logic of late capitalism" and while I'm inclined to
agree with him in a way, his denunciation begs the question of the
relationship between poets and the public: who is the audience for poetry
and isn't that audience in fact not one but many? Poetry, I've often
thought, needs all the press it can get and yet - writing poetry is also a
wager that the poem will eventually "find" its reader, thus obviating the
need for "crass" promotionalism. Ultimately, gestures like National Poetry
Month wld seem lost on its intended recipients. But if it leads just a few
people to pick up some poetry books, well then, why not?

That's as far as I can think this morning.

Juliette Binoche was really classy, wasn't she -- except for that rather
ghoulish (sorry, Henry) dress. I think she was the best thing about "The
English Patient," which I found rather empty at the core -- the movie, I
mean, not the book.

BUT -- Pat's mention of the latest Harper's makes me wonder if anyone
here is interested in responding to Lewis Lapham's challenge -- in an
extended three-part essay, the first two of which have now been published
-- of the impossibility of writing (historical) narrative in a culture
organized solely around media images. Here's some quotes:

"The sensibility shaped by the electronic media over the last forty-odd
years has by now acquired a distinctive form--impatient, easily bored,
geared to increasingly short bursts of attention, intuitive, musical,
tuned to abrupt changes of mood and scene. Most importantly, it is a
senbsibility bereft of memory."

"Three years ago at Yale I taught a course of English composition and
found only four of twelve students capable of writing a well-arranged
paragraph -- not because they weren't intelligent but because they had
never acquired the habit of reading. Familiar with a vast archive of
visual images, they could easily recall scenes and fragments of scenes
from {he mentions several movies and TV shows here} but books were grim
tasks instead of pleasant diversions, foreign objects, unfamiliar and
vaguely ominous, meant to be studied as if they were cancer cells . . ."

And, finally, he quotes the historian Bernard DeVoto (his _1846: Year of
Decision_ is a great book on American history, recommended by Pound and
Olson, among others) on Gertrude Stein:

". . . but how do we write history in a language like Gertrude Stein's,
one that floats freely 'in a medium of pure caprice sustained by nothing
except its awareness of its own inner wondrousness' ".

As I say, he's talking mainly about the writing of history, but I think
his remarks can be extended to all narrative writing -- I was just
wondering if anyone who's read it had any response.

Henry (et alia)--

Am interested in your new-school notes, partly bec. the "Ephebes"
admonishments remind (not irrelevantly?) of Wally Stevens (whom I
admit to liking) & partly for other reasons not yet much investigated.

Now, in re: Poe's (?) "boomerang effect" --   quoth you,

<< 2. Ephebes will through trial and error & exploration over the millenia
try to infuse either the whippoorwill-effect (Russians), the mockingbird-
effect (Ghould), the pendulum-effect (Valery), and/or the
boomerang-effect (Edgar Poe) into their poetic compositions. >>

f.y.i., a few years ago, I invented (so I thought) a form of poem which I
styled the "boomerang poem" -- actually, I borrowed same from some
medieval Chinese sources (not now sure who'all; I've seen a couple in
translation somewhere, but others I was saw in untranslated books while
browsing the hundreds, nay thousands such hidden volumes away on
upper levels of the East Asiatic Library at UC Berkeley [where I worked
shelving books, circa '79]) . . . anyway, here's one specimen of a
boomerang poem (from an early '90s summer) [better to illustrate than
merely to laboring out a description):

|  this is where the meeting oft' convenes
|  this is where the circus plants the tent
|  through this window watch the limpid scenes
|  by this river hear the soft lament
|  fragrant flowers gather here their scent
|  leafage here attains the coolest greens
|  in this box a myriad dreams are pent
|  this is where the meeting oft' convenes

[boomerang, here, signifying final line = first line, ergo boomerang; &
rhyme-form being ABAB  BABA (or alternatively, ABAB CACA)]

My problem w/ your new school though, Henry, mainly involves dictum
#1.  Epheebe though I be, I'll not presently swear off no-po writing.
(Specially not now when I'm just getting going with some such.)

Thanks anyway, will be interested in developments withal.

I found myself agreeing enthusiastically with the comments relayed by
Douglas Barbour today, and I believed they were his. "Right on, Douglas!" I
was saying, "I myself always say 'the trouble with the Neo-Formalists is
that they're not nearly Formalist enough.'" Imagine, then, with what
chagrin I found he had led me into agreeing with a comment (and a
decade-old comment at that) by George Bowering.

"How is the poem built up?" Is what I always ask students, just that it's
what i always wonder. "What keeps one reading?" is potentially handy, also.
Think of _Malone Dies_ .

right on, Doug.  But then some of the greatest painters & poets of this
century (Max Beckmann, W. Stevens) specifically repudiated formalism al-
together.  Maybe because they were grappling with a more basic art issue:
finding a connection, a bridge, a continuum, between the general and the
specific, the symbolic and everyday experience, the tradition of art and
the real.  There is no quick fix or ornamental flavor to their work, no form
for utility's sake. Has to be lived & felt (at least vicariously).  Art as
search for truth &authenticity, not display of mastery. (But forms - CAN be
made to feel & speak - transcend their formalities. And maybe making old forms
work again is a way of saying - all formalisms are equal.)
& right on, George.

Content


Content or content
What is this about
The words speak for themselves or do they

Wherever there are words there's content
What is the subject of this poem
Are you content with what the words say

Writing is not talking
Poems are not freight cars
What are you getting at

I do not understand your poem's form
Some say form is extension of content
The other way around seems just as likely

Are the words the content
Many say the meaning is the content
Do they mean meaning or meanings

What about the poems
Where one word has led to another
And the meaning is enacted by perceivers

And the other kind of poem
Where the poet has one thing to say
And says it

No wonder there are poetry wars

Some poems are made by invented procedures
The poet faithfully carries out
Neutral as a referee

Other poems seem to come
Directly from the mind of the poet
What was in the mind's what's on the page

Many poems come to be
Between the mind and the mouth and the page
Or both in the mind and the mouth and on the page

Many poets are partisans
Only one way of writing is right
Others are wrong

For other poets one way of writing
Is right for making some poems
Other ways for other poems

Some want only what they mean to say
To be conveyed
To readers and hearers

Others welcome many
Among a multitude of meanings
But not all of them

A very few let the poems
Mean whatever they mean
To whomever they reach

They are content
With the meanings that come to be
As the words are seen or heard

Many believe one kind of meaning
Is far more important than others
And deplore the absence of that kind

The catchword is privilege
Some privilege political meanings
Others religion or morality or the real

And a few poets privilege private meanings
Ones that are theirs and no one else's
That never would have come to be without them

Some write poems
Only to get such a privileged meaning
Across

Some want poems to cause actions
Others seek changes in consciousness
Many want themselves to come across

And a few desire chiefly
That the poems come to be
More than makers they are midwives

The coming-to-be of the poems
That each poem becomes itself
Contents the midwife poet

But that contentment never lasts
So poets' midwifery
Proliferates new poems

And soon the poems of all the kinds of poets
May proliferate and interpenetrate
Throughout our space and time

Will this end the poetry wars

David, thanks for poem & scholarly interest in Poe's boomerang.  In my
book a great generator of the boomerang effect is the Malayan form
the pantoum (abab bcbc cdcd etc. until xaxa). The pantoum echoes twice
but if the poem has any momentum it has a dizzying vibration-effect -
like you're hearing MORE than one echo.
Now as to Poe's boomerang effect.  This has a couple of meanings.  On the
ur-cult-ur-ologic-ur-l level, it simply refers to the fact that a dead
American Poet became a live French Symbolist.  I'm trying out this effect
over in Russia, as we speak. Now specifically on the comp-o-sition-ur-l
level (which is related to the other): Valery's pendulum-effect is in effect
a miniaturized, highly calibrated/refined version of the boomerang-effect;
in fact Poe satirized this situation ahead of time in his story (prose!)
_The Pit and the Pendulum_, which is about how cutting edge continental
writing emerged from the pits of Baltimore & New York - it has to do with
that edgy Angoisse du Neant, so popular among decadent symbolists - Poe
would have laughed his head off (not literally).  - HG edg.po

The question isn't how to write history in Gertrude Steinese, but why? A
fork is good for what it's made for, but it's a lousy shovel.
I agree that Juliette Binoche would have looked better if she hadn't been
wearing a dress.

Franklin, Maria, and others:

That Sun Ra was gay is a "rumour" that seems to have taken the leap from
that staus to the status of "truth" among those who would whisper. I've
often heard it mentioned in conversation as if it was common knowledge. I
know of no books which deal with it explicitly (Val Wilmer's _As Serious As
Your Life_ might make breif mention). It was a ridiculous point of
contention on the Sun Ra list a while back (maybe a year), prompting an
alarming flurry of homophobic responses, and finally prompting my own
signoff. One thing that I know can be gleaned from Wilmer's book is that
Sun Ra was most definitely a misogynist (he was apparently very vocal about
his desire to exclude women from membership in Bill Dixon's Jazz Composer's
Guild, among other things). How much these two aspects of Ra are connected
I don't know. Nor do I know the extent to which they influenced his music.
Some informed speculation about the latter would certainly be welcome
considering the dearth of gender/sexuality-related critical work in music
studies (If anyone, by the way, knows of books on this topic, let me know
either here or backchannel - thanks). In a less (and more) related vein:
Sun Ra was also a poet who produced a large body of lyrical work, where his
cosmological views are often very apparent...

ok,     best to all,

Stephen Cope

ps - I second the Corbett book. I'd consider him one of the more
interesting theorists of music working...

Dear Chris Stroffolino:

Thank you for taking the trouble to write that report on the discussion of
the papers on the book of the poem entitled the m of p in relation to the
academy.

Dear Chris Mann,

What's your beef with about as such?  Despite the above.  See my Talk
About About, in a Raddle Moon I forget which number, recently reprinted in
the 94-5 Gertrude Stein anthology.  About would be on all sides.

susan mcclary, now at ucla, has done a great deal of feminist work in
musicology. her husband rob walzer (walser?) (also at ucla) has done work
on masculinity in heavy metal.  in addition, a lot of work on and by gay
men and opera has appeared in the last couple of years, including wayne
koestenbaum's the queen's throat, and something by richard mohr (?) on
wagner i blieve.

Was Angelou doing the inauguration lofty? The problem is largely the profuse
amounts of corn porn (I think that is Perelman's phrase) that accompany any
media version of late American poetry. The media and whoever else gives a damn
will seek out the officially licensed and bonded poets of the land for nice

Social realist and populist sentiments on the part of any poetry spokesperson
not withstanding, a secret readership of one individual at a time will always
exist as long as the goods are put out there (text and speech),and therein lies
the rub.

Good questions that will spurn a new and lively thread I hope.

Chris:

In your fantaastic long post (which I have to still go back to
digest), you refer to Bob Perleman as "bp." May I ask that you don't
do so any more? This confuses him with a poet that I suspect Bob
Perelman would agree is bound to be (if justice is to be done) of
more historical import than he: bp nichol. Let's keep bp as bp and
Bob Perleman as Bob Perleman, or Ivy Bob, or just Bob P., or
whatever.

1) Actually, Mark, there is a Tibetan nun who composes traditional
calligraphy with a brush inserted into her vagina. Why do you assume
that this is less viable a mode of artistic composition than a man
attaching a brush to his penis?

2) I've never seen "nude" works by Kwang, though after seeing his
work, you might feel embarrassed by asking such a "skin-deep"
question.

3) Flaccid or erect? In the photos I've seen, his beautiful, creative
cock is flaccid.

Joke? That bp nichol is a writer light years beyond what Bob Perelman
or nearly all of us could aspire to? No, Matt (pat on the head)
Kirschenbaum. Is Bob P. on your dissertation committee? Hurry up and
defend your thesis, 'cause the big one is on its way!

Actually, I meant the idea that anyone might find this
"confusing."

By the way, isn't it properly bpNichol -- or at least that's how
I always refer to him in my thesis.

Seems to me that if it matters it matters.

check out the new LIFE brand shampoo that they're selling down at the
wal-mart. it has a "bp" writ on it in gold: Balsam & Protein: LIFE and EXTRA
BODY! i bought 5 and passed them round my seminars as found poems! why not?
bp asked the question originally in book 5: "if i become a brand name."

god i am having a ball working on my dissertation on that incredible
poet! he is everywhere -- and this is his school.

Hugh:

Good point. I just received two mailings from a former colleague who
currently teaches at U or Kent/Salem with Doug Rice, the author of
_Blood of Mugwump_, the work under investigation, and a book that is,
no question, pushing the edge. Actually, the book makes me want to
puke. But I suppose that's the whole issue here. If something is
truly out there, and is out there no matter how out there (and here
we are talking about CONTENT in the first instance folks--check it
out), what do we do when it is threatened with censorship by the
state? I have copies of the letters written by the Christian Coalition
Congressional Representatives
in question who are trying to use this as an issue to permanently
erase all government funding for the arts--I'll post more info when I
get these from home and give addresses, etc. But isn't this an
urgent thing to consider on this list? As Hugh points out, who's next?

Fiona, I'd be happy to give examples. First I am going to
read Kent Johnson's article "Howard McCord and
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E." I was about to flame Professor
Kent Johnson, and handily (only a pocket flame needed),
after his bp/BP adventure into the wide and dizzy land of
the patter of lettered feet--and then I looked him up on ol'
MLA. I realize I don't know him in the sky well enough yet.
But I have read almost everything bpNichol has ever written--he's
not so much a comet as a Christmaslight for the literary
industry in Canada, after all. He's enabled a lot of critics to thematize
and thereby dumb-down and take the sharp political edge
off of radical theory--and critics from prestigious
universities and departments, too. The beauty of Nichol is
his political neutrality of language (some might puke at that,
however)--that he often performs wordplay without ever
stirring into the social meanings that those words connote
(except in *love: a book of remembrances* and in his early
letter-based works, as well as his concrete and sound
poetry). His essays, on the other hand, are more feisty--the
parodies of academic and scientific jargon, for instance,
many co-written with McCaffery. But neutrality is
something Perelman's poetry never is--if anything, it refuses
itself as poetry so long as it fails to incite social meanings,
and meanings/forms lodged the more centrally in the literary
establishment/tradition the better for defamiliarizing effects.
Even his "academic poem" "Marginalization of Poetry"
figuratively insults (to only begin) the professor-role and institutional
context of its occasion of delivery--it would be absurd, for a
professor, to politely clap on hearing this read, unless that
professor were a Bouvard or Pecuchet. Perelman too has
outdistanced the fetishization of the new, in that he is
absent, for example, from Marjorie Perloff's critical
appropriation and promotion of Language Writing as the
next-last movement-moment. I think *Marginalization of
Poetry*, regardless of how you judge it, and I do, could
be looked at in context of his work as a whole for startling
contrastive (and instructive) news, and *that* in context of
the broader concept of "politics" of language propounded
by Language Writing writing. Anyway I am looking at this
in an essay right now so keep your hat near, Bill. I don't
think Perelman needs an apologist so much as readers of his
poetry. I do think the event, however, needs an apologist. Post-panel
discussion did barely materialize. It was like listening to
lectures. Not even a lecture: Steve Evans felt that for the
NYC crowd he had to mock the very theory he is steeped
up to his intellect in--and, get this, noone reacted liked he
was condescending! Chris S. mentioned Mac Low's
question in his last post (I won't repeat it here). Why is it
that it seemed to me at the time of hearing it that Mac Low's
question was off topic? Putting Mac  Low's que at the beginning of the
discussion would have helped--but for me the odd realization now is that
answering Mac Low's question is *exactly* what Perelman's book
proposes to deal with. So, if critical of the book as project, is that
even the que which should be asked? James Sherry asked why
even bother doing a literary history, and that particular kind
of literary history. Lisa Jarnot questioned--as a complement
to Ann Lauterbach's questioning of the contents of
Perelman's book--the representativity of the panel,
since all the panelists are in a position to write a book about
the same poets and issues as Perelman. Lee Ann Brown's
question brought formal discussion to an end: she surprised
us all and instead of asking a question, read-out the next
event at Segue, which was her own event, and up and
coming events--and so the relentless calendar of events, the
very form that Sean Killian wanted to disrupt by organizing
a discussion panel in the first place, seamlessly reasserted
itself over the night. And discussion was left for the critics.
No, for the poets. No, for the critics. No, for--Hi, I'm Louis
Cabri. Ya. Ya. Oh ya. Hah. Yas.

Thanks, Louis, and good to have yr e-ddress. _Hole_ #6 has some excellent
reads. I think Lisa Robertson's "The Device" is a knockout. From the p-o-v
of that poem, and one who wasnt at the NYC event, we must ask why it didnt
prove more pleasurable; were the superego's imperatives being muffled by
unsupervised _id_iots? With yr account, we have something quite other than
Chris Stroffolino's, and thus the picture grows bigger and more spherical
and jagged. Good. I was saddened to hear Bob P was put on the defensive,
never an attractive mode, at least when phrased that way. I would sooner
imagine him a-brim with lively conjecture, where he seems happiest. There,
and in the dismissing of fools lightly. How did this miscarriage of
pleasure transpire--who nudged whom?

I dont even know the names of all the players. Does someone want to mail me
a spare program? I suppose the proceedings will be part of a book, but i'd
sooner not wait, who would.

The shuffling of reputations by initials this morning I found bemusing.
Thought I was on the stock exchange list thru some error of my own. Nearly
phoned my broker to order a spare set of everything bpNichol ever
published,and entertained a number of offers for my signed copy of _7
Works_ . But then I remembered these names had people attached to them
somewhere. History refuses to die.

It was fun to see Bouvard and Pecuchet on the list. I thought they were
running an arts program in Ft.Milltown.

I hope to read further accounts of the NYC event. Things have been a little
quiet in Sebastopol since the Canadians  were here. db.

Does anyone know if there are any commercially available recordings of

reading from the Book of Ephraim.  I was told by someone that there was
a recording at one time from a now-defunct press.

Secondly, I badly need to order Lisa Jarnot's book from Burning Deck Press

There are dozens of sound recordings of Merrill -- one of the best is by
the Academy of American Poets recorded in 1992 at NYU. The Poets in Person
series from the Modern Poetry Association also has a cassette
interview/reading available -- They have a website where you may find more

Louis,

I wonder if you could talk a bit about how and why you think bp's concrete
and sound poetry are more concerned with social meanings than his other
stuff. yes, his interest in the concretist "play activity" of Gomringer
and the Brazillian Noigrandes group invites the reader to produce meaning,
and therefore re-oreints the social role of the reader.  But it seems to
me that his sound poetry comes not only out of the dada trad., but also
out of his experience as a "lay analyst" at the therafields therapeutic
community, where he worked from 1966-82, and was vice-president from 1968
onwards.  The types of sounds made by the horsemen owe a great deal to the
healing dimensions therafields attached to associational word games and to
primal scream therapy.  However, therafields set itself up as an isolated
island where participants could discover their "inner child" (again, a bp
desire) outside of the larger pressures of the social world at large,
before returning to the world to function as healthy individuals.  In this
respect, therafields upheld the kind of complicity with capitalism that
Deleuze and Guattari criticized the psychoanalytic institution for--i.e.,
the creation of a normalized subject, without self-reflexively criticizing
its own collusion with normalcy.  Steve McCaffery's approach to sound
poetry seems far more concerned with the social, because in both his early
and late writing on sound poetry he centres on sound as the site for
investigation of the subject of socio-linguistic relations.

Serac (accent aigu over the e) is a sort of ice-tower--means the glacier's
moving down the mountain & is unpredictable.  Hey, it's Nabokov, remember.

Hasn't Jeremy Irons been playing Humber Humbert for the last dozen years?

sections between <text> and </text> are visible. Formally, using <!-- and
--> locates comments, but browsers tend to ignore extraneous uninterpret-
able commands.

Thus a document can be written to be doubly read, one way with .htm ex-
tensions, and one way without; further, it can be additionally encoded as
well, so that, saving it as .txt then results in another document that can
be moved to .htm. Over and over again, things thicken, take on attributes
of the book of the world, dense, particulate, broken or sheared, _talus_
sloping nowhere.

The breathing-apparatus of the second Lieu/place places Jennifer at the
heart of commands; the text is no longer performative, but mimics the body
constructed by repeated sed 's/foo/bar/g' commands. The first Lieu pro-
duces the second; in creating the second, I am well aware of the _body of
the text_ itself, sed an operator _onto_ totality, the text hidden as I
shuttle back and forth between twin files, churning itself according to
the pronouncement of surgery or suture: sed 's/foo1/bar1/g' < z1 > z2, and
sed 's/foo2/bar2/g' < z2 > z1, etc. What results is a simulacrum of the
hysterical embodiment of attempted speech, Jennifer-Alan-suppuration.

By way of explanation, in place of / Lieu.

Subject:      Re: Howard McCord

Dear Louis:

Actually, when you teach at a community college (even
with tenure) you are an instructor, not a "Professor." Are you a
Professor yet?

The article you refer to ('87?) was written when I was a graduate
student at Bowling Green. Howard McCord was my dissertation advisor,
and in this
essay I go after him for waht I see as his shortsightedness re:
Language writing. As far as I know, it was among the first defenses
of Langpo written by someone not in that circle, and I remember it
brought friendly letters from Bob Perelman, Michael Palmer, and
Marjorie Perloff (out of which began for me a sporadic but very
fruitful intellectual association with her).

It's great that you brought Howard to the list's attention, for he is
certainly a "forgotten" writer. Back during the early
70's he was actually a "big" name in the world of poetry, but then
faded, through partial fault, surely, of his own indifference to the
name game, from sight. I can say that I have never met a single
person in my life who is more eclectically brilliant than he. The man
just knows an incredible amount across a great range.

But I would say you are wrong (if I'm reading you right) when you
suggest in an earlier post that his work and career might point in
the direction of a hidden *comunitas* on the margins of New American
Poetry individualism. If there is a poet alive today who has more
consistently espoused the ideals of self-reliant libertarianism than
Howard has (and his politics would *not* be at all welcome by most
people on this list--he and Dorn are good buddies) then he or she has
retired to the mountains.
In fact, Bowling Green is kind of like the mountains, flat as
northwestern Ohio is. Howard is its quiet hermit sage, hunting and
writing now mainly for the gun magazines.

He's quite a person. I care for him immensely and admire him deeply.
Gnomonology: A Handbook of Systems is a wild work. There's much more,
including most recent a novel soon to appear from Macpherson, titled
The Man Who Walked to the Moon.

Now for what its worth, I'll say I was being a bit silly last night
with my remark about Bob Perleman who is not better or lesser than
bpNichol, whatever such zero-sum evaluations might ever mean! Ok, ok,
it was a moment of iconoclasm, against what seems to often be some
hero worship on this list of names that are already operating under
the inertia of the Name. (tho I admire Bob Perleman's work!) Enough
for now, but is no one going to step up and say something decent
about bpNichol? Is Steve McCaffery on this list? (for those not
familiar, his essay in North of Intention is a great intro to the
work.) Do you honestly feel, Louis, that his work is merely a
"Christmas light"? Such language doesn't really open one up to a
generous reading of seriously undertaken work, does it?

I'd been dipping into (picking at?) this thread, and then by one of those
strange coincidences (you know the kind) i chanced on this poem:

Indian

I don't know who this Indian is,
A bow within his hand,
But he is hiding by a tree
And watching white men land.
They may be gods--they may be fiends--
They certainly look rum.
He wonders who on earth they are
And why on earth they've come.

He knows his streams are full of fish,
His forests full of deer,
And his tribe is the mighty tribe
That all the others fear.
--And, when French or English land,
The Spanish or the Dutch,
They'll tell him they're the mighty tribe
And no one else is much.

They'll kill his deer and net his fish
And clear away his wood,
And frequently remark to him
They do it for his good.
Then he will scalp and he will shoot
And he will burn and slay
And break the treaties he has mad
--And, children, so will they.

We won't go into all of that
Fir it's too long a story,
And some is brave and some is sad
And nearly all is gory.
But, just remember this about
Our ancestors so dear:
They didn't find an empty land.
The Indians were *here*.

from *A Book of Americans*--Rosemary and Stephen Vincent Benet (1933), and
stamped in my copy in red ink are the words Greenwood Elementary School...

Mike,
        The last time I went out with Jack Clarke (& you) we saw Sun Ra
in Buffalo at the (new) Tralf. The next time I go out with Jack, I'll
read from my collaboration with him--Blue Horitals (Amman, Jordan: Oasii,
1997 --Stephen Ellis' press)--which includes poems from his In the
Analogy from your shuffaloff books (just come, beautifully, in the
mail)--on April 12 at Middlesex County College in Edison, NJ [at the New
Jersey College English Assn. Conference] & (more publicly) on April 20 at
the Old Bridge, NJ, public library. Wish you were here, &c.

Subject:      puking and the state

A couple days ago I mentioned the controversy around FC2 (originally
the Fiction Collective), and one of its books currently at the
center of a little Congressional maelstrom, _Blood of Mugwump_, by
Doug Rice. I had said that the book made me "want to puke," so to
elaborate and clarify a bit, I thought I'd offer an hors d'oeuvre of
sorts, though one quite randomly found by flipping through:

"Grandma Mugwump had marked our blood with her own blood. Blue under
our shallow skin, visible and waiting to be touched. Now under
Caddie's suffering white voice we were making Grandma vanish. Caddie
began by sewing Grandma's decrepit eyes shut. Closed and throbbing
with blind blood. Inside the pain she cried out: "Let what God so
joined together, man never tear asunder." She stared out at the
knives we held in our hands. Fingers cut and bleeding. Quickly to
stop her screams, Caddie trapped Grandma's slippery tongue in her
strong hand. Then in one continuous, swift musical motion, Caddie cut
Grandma's tongue free and swallowed it whole intoher own belly.
Wedding of all those unknown familial desires. This, here is the
birth of no longer being able to to remain silent. Noise jammed her
mouth, filled her, choking her parched throat. Thread and needle,
Caddie sewed Garndma's lips together. Blood trapped Grandma.
Gurgling, growling, Grandma's revolting stomach caved. Hunger. Not
words, just sounds stormed out of Grandma's belly. Words unspeakable
sprung forth from the thunder caught one last time in her dry cunt.
Time inthe mirror. Grandma created herself into a shape only there to
fill a lack as the words of Caddie opened her wounds. Moon clouds
slicing across the Ides of midnight. Time. Floating. Grandma's
buzzard hands rose from the bed and fell. Nearly dead now. etc..."

It actually gets better. Many other things in this book get
eaten, and it's not pretty. Clayton Eshelman and other lower-body
poets move over! You've barely cracked the surface!

But seriously, what seems involved here is an incipient repeat of the
Mapplethorp affair, only this time in the field of exploratory,risk-
taking writing. I'm sure many people onthis list would
regard the attack on FC2 as a matter importance and
basic principle, though there has been little stirring yet here on
FC2's call for solidarity--though I realize that there may be stuff
goign on backchannel, etc. Anyway, I have documemts here from the NEA
Literature Program, including a long, threatening memo from Rep. Pete
Hoekstra, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations of the Committee on Education and the Workforce
(ominous sounding, no?) to Jane Alexander. This and other information
(including newspaper articles and an unpublished stomach-churning
interview with Doug Rice) is available from Rice's colleague Craig
Paulenich at University of Kent/Salem. His e-mail:
   paulenic@salem.kent.edu

Interestingly, Craig P. was co-editor with me of an anthology of
American Buddhist poets, published back in '89. Rice's book is
dedicated to Craig! The Dharma is vast. Or as Gary Snyder puts it
ecstatically in a poem somewhere, "Ah, eating each other..."

Hope this provokes some checking into the issue and further action on
it!

Actually it's:

        Eating each other's seed
                    eating
         ah, each other.

Would it be possible to post the Hoekstra memo on the list? I believe that
might incite something in the name of action. From what we have heard of so
far, the subcommittee's intent is to use this as an example of why funding for
the arts and literature should be cut, which suggests a memo replete with
sweeping generalizations.

Bill:

The memo is four detailed pages, and I'm currently very involved and
in last five days of a Mayoral race against the northwestern
Illinois mafia. No time to type it all up! But you might ask Craig
Paulenich who should have a way of scanning a clear copy and then
posting it. Or, perhaps the Unit for Contemporary Literature at
Illinois State University could be contacted (home of FC2): phone:
309-438-3523, fax: 309-438-3523. In fact, I'm goign to call them
right now and see if they can help and send something to us all.

Oh, and thanks, Rachel, for the correction. My accuracy seems to be
off the past couple of days!

I never thought of it that way. I think of it as a synonym for shape. As a

That is, structure might be premeditated, but not form.

Hey Henry:

"how does innovative writing avoid being 'innovative?'"

Penetrating question! Thank you.

But tell me, you who have been the liveliest voice on this list the
past couple or three weeks: What do you think of the recent attempt of
the Christian fascists to use FC2 as a wedge against free speech in
the arts? And what do you think of the apparent silence on this list
about it?

Probing questions of the kind I like to see! Interesting as a lead-in for a
discussion on received form (ahem) vs innovation. The last Louis Cabri post
comes to mind:
> Perelman too has outdistanced the fetishization of the new, in that he is
> absent, for example, from Marjorie Perloff's critical appropriation and
      > promotion of Language Writing as the next-last movement-moment.
where "Language writing as the next-last movement-moment" strikes me in an odd
way. What does it mean? This must have been heard before in the wake of past
Research and Development movements. Yes? Received form (as conformtent?) is
probably inescapable and non-lethal in small doses. Can we say that we are in
any greater crisis than any who have come before us? (I know this is turning
millenial and that's fine; I like a good maudlin "where we have been and where
we are going" discussion)

Speaking only for myself, and as one among many who have come into Language
writing from the "outside," innovative experimental writing has been both
liberating and liberalizing in a personal sense first, in a social-community
sense second, and lastly a political sense. Therein lies its value with me. It
seems that most poetries suffer from the more or less same
non-commodifiability.

Well, enough rambling from me for now. Thanks henry for the much needed probing
in the area of the heretofore thought dead threads.

Maybe because theres nothing to say.  What is remarkable about a
congressman cynically affecting moral outrage in order to get money away
from the poor so that it may be given to the rich?

Thanks for the tip, some list one, i looked under "whatsnew" and found the
chapter from one of the novelists in question as well as an interview with
Doug Rice. I liked the writing in the novel. Enjoyed the orgasm. Of course,
its one more man writing abt woman's sexuality.  Do any of the women on the
list find it accurate?

The congressman might be genuinely outraged, i suppose.  That he wasnt
there to help. Perhaps he feels left out. But I really doubt that we need
to hunt for unconscious motives. That NEA money is needed for corporate
welfare. db.

I take it very seriously.  I write the NEA grants (and final reports) for
Tia Chucha and the Guild Complex in Chicago.  We recently had a reading
featuring FC2 writers.  And frankly, the attacks on the NEA wreck havoc on
the organizations that support literature in this country.  It's gotten a
lot harder to get money because of this, at a time when money is becoming
ever more dear (for example, the cost of publishing a book has doubled in
the last five years).  Plus, when the effects of welfare reform sink in,
there'll be even less for luxuries such as literary publishing.

I don't know of a term. I'd guess it's too recent a development to have
fallen within any period in which it was particularly fashionable to give
Greek or Latin terms to such things. "Lacuna" is good, though
traditionally it refers to an accidental and damaging gap. When Jimmy
Merrill uses blanks in "Losing the Marbles," he produces a section that
looks like a contemporary "spaced-out" poem, but the gaps prove to be
lacunae left by rain on an ink manuscript, which get filled back up
(reconstructed?) in a later section. I do like "lacuna," because usually
the gap _does_ signify something missing, some syntactical ligature, if
only a mark of punctuation.

Total agreement, Hugh. But David Bromige (you, one of my favorite
writers), I have to admit I'm bewildered
by your response which seems to suggest there is nothing to do and
bemused silence is the answer? Please correct me here if I'm
misinterpreting.
I want to ask: If a bunch of fascists came after your work, and you
appealed to fellow writers for help, how would you feel if you got
left alone? I guess I'm sounding like the moral yardstick here, but
really, this issue strikes me as a matter of principle, honor
and plain tactical necessity for all of us on this list. I say there's
five hundred letters that need to be written to Rep. Hoekstra from
this list. And we should be sharing ideas about how to contact
others through this incredibly useful medium that brings us together!

Let me ask a hypothetical specific: If this gang
can get away with this one, will it make it *less or more likely* that
they will go after someone like, say, the publisher of Aaron Shurin's
latest beautiful work?

I've got a call in to FC2 and left a message requesting that they
post more detailed info here.

Bob & fellow listmembers, its early in my day & I have to dash out, or I'd
do this research myself. But: I'd take a look at Robert Duncan, his preface
to one of his 60s collections, either _Bending the Bow_ or _Boots &
Ranches_ .I think he discusses his gappings and the time values assigned to
them, and he may declare precursory users. Rachel & Henry (was it?) are
correct of course to direct us to A-S verse, and also to the Latin.
"Caesura" is the break but doesnt necessarily involve visual gapping. How
about Old _Usura? any info there?  db.

I love lacuna too.  In OED it is:

1. In a manuscript, an inscription, the text of an author: A hiatus,
blank, missing portion...

2. Chiefly in physical science: A gap, an empty space, spot, or cavity.

ANYTHING that gives NATIONAL attention the the art of poetry is fine with
me. The proto-Maraxist crit. of a "National Poetry Month" is fine for
academic concerns, and in a perfect world it would always be POETRY any
month any day. Since all that IS is Poetry... it is nice to be acknowledged
once in a blue fucking moon. Don't you think? Sort'a like Father's
Day/Mother's Day/Valentine's Day, Poetry Month should be a celebration of
whatever prole-sense forgot to mention to the kiddies...

For example:
I'm setting up this festival at the end of April. When I started working on
this Poetics festival I DIDN'T know it was "Nationalized" as the month set
aside for poetry by our gov't. Granted I really wouldn't have cared fucking
less, 'cause poetry is my national pastime, but it made things easier in
getting people that normally wouldn't have thought twice about a poetry
festival (even bookstores, and record stores) to be interested in the
festival. In this imperfect world there are egoistic reasons for the
attraction to anything nationally publicized (someone can get a little PR
for helpng out a grassroots poetry event, a little of that 15 seconds). But
hell I don't care if someone strokes their ego a little , as long as it's
not at the expense of my integrity, or the integrity of my event.

National Poetry Month would assume that there is ONE national poetry, but
it gives us the opportunity to prove otherwise.

My last example:
When Barnes & Noble helps to fund a festival that features Anne Waldman...
that makes me happy. Fuck being an ideological prude, we DO NOT live in a
perfect world.

duncan's preface to _ground work: before the war_ figures caesurae as
articulated silences, which is arguably a more varied measure of the
_time_ of the poem than standard grammatical indicators (comma, period,
etc.) provide: not the metronome's uniformity, but the body's "flexible
durations."

Rachel, these are all occasionally-employed printer's or calligrapher's
conventions, like the more common capitalization of first letter in a line
or bracketing a triplet in an Augustan poem. In Old and Middle English, if
memory serves, they usually divide the first two alliterative stresses from
the last two (sometimes a bullet [dot] is used instead). In Augustan verse
the caesura is supposed to be a natural pause and as such is usually
unmarked. It usually falls after either the second or third iamb. The
breath-group usage, with its appearance of typographic randomness, is quite
different. I wonder if it has a name at all. When I'm typesetting I usually
ask my poets how many they want--none of them seem to have a term.
To broaden the field, there are things that don't have any commonly accepted
names. My favorite is the little crusty things that form in the corner of
the eye while we sleep. In my family they're called sleep seeds. I've also
heard "sleeps" and "what the sand man left."  But these are all baby talk.
Other languages have normative adult terms, but English apparently doesn't.
If there's an answer to Perelman's question it would be handy to know. I'm
also cuious to find other examples of the unnamed in general.

>>ANYTHING that gives NATIONAL attention the the art of poetry is fine with me.
>>The proto-Maraxist crit. of a "National Poetry Month" is fine for academic
concerns, and in a perfect world it would always be POETRY any month any day.


Bill Moyers is fine with you? The catatonic verses of Jimmy Stewart, Jimmy
Carter and Kahil Gibran are fine with you? Anything that keeps the Language
Poets off of Nightline is fine with me. Anything that meaninglessly
institutionalizes the belly-scratching Beats is fine with me (Kerouac stamps
from Lowell coming soon). Anything that keeps the bugs out of the kitchen is
fine with me.

Someone asked earlier what an Apex of the M#5 was.  It sounds like what I
picked up a case of on the bus home from NYC Sunday. It comes on like
gangbusters. A couple of years ago I had severe Apex of the M#1 but I shook it
off easier than I expected.  Anyway--my point was--someone was speaking in
proto-maraxist-crit loudly on the bus, right into my brain as it were. Anything
that kills the pain of NATIONAL attention is fine with me.

Since all that is Poetry is Poetry why confuse it with holiday artifice? That
is, unless your poetry  sounds like a [Father's
Day/Mother's Day/Valentine's Day, Poetry Month] greeting card.

If your festival was "nationalized" Bil, YOU wouldn't be running it.
As it is, the fesitival is PRIVATIZED.

For example:

"Granted I really wouldn't have cared fucking less,"

 In proto-maraxist chat, this is NIHILISM.

"'cause poetry is my national pastime,"

 In proto-maraxist chat, this is a deviant NATIONALISM blended with
SENTIMENTALISM and strong  overtones of
 ULTRA-BOURGEOIS all rolled in one.

"but it made things easier in getting people that normally wouldn't have
thought twice about a poetry
festival "

 In proto-maraxist chat, this is OPPORTUNISM.


"In this imperfect world there are egoistic reasons for the attraction to
anything nationally publicized"

 No need to apologize to US. We like poetry too.

"hell I don't care if someone strokes their ego a little , as long as it's
not at the expense of my integrity, or the integrity of my event."

 Never sacrifice these my boy. Never never never.

I wonder.  According to _Princeton_ again, caesura is "a rhetorical and
extrametrical pause or phrasal break within the poetic line...The
caesura, which is frequently marked by punctuation, corresponds to a
breath-pause between musical phrases...in modern Eng. the caesura is
often used as a device of variety, a device whose purpose it is to help
mitigate metrical rigors by shifting from position to position in
various lines..."

Yeah but I still recommend this essay by David Matlin.  It's not proto-marxist.
it's the good friday reading for the crucifixion of America by inbred ancient
racism, militarism, and prisons as Big Business.  I KNOW HOW DUMB THIS SOUNDS!!
I wish I could improve on it.  It's not a rant, it's a personal essay by
a guy who taught in prisons for ten years.  there's some interesting
thought about teaching Creative Writing too.  Did you know that the Clinton
Crime Bill did away with federal funding of Prison Education?  I didn't.
If there is such a thing as the zeitgeist (I think I proved this definitively
in a penetrating dialogue on this list several moons ago), in America this
time is the epiphany of the Prison.

the term, _loses its place_, ceases occupation, precisely, and is thus the
very opening of space, neither the transparency nor the emptiness of which

 on the question of     gaps

following up on mark weiss & rachel loden's posts, perhaps this
has some extra (as well as shared) information, esp. on the
metrics of alliterative verse.  the midline gap or sometimes dot
is a modern typographical convention to mark the metrical pause
or caesura that separates the two halves of an alliterative line.
it doesn't usually appear in medieval mss, where the caesura is
sometimes marked by an oblique stroke or punctus elevatus (kind of
inverted semi-colon) but more often left unmarked.  caesura is
the name of the metrical phenomenon (also found of course in other
kinds of verse with long lines, e.g. hexameters and alexandrines,
but of less structural significance there), not of the gap that
represents it; as others have noted, i don't think the gap has a
name of its own.

 another nameless phenomenon: that space or moment in which the
constituent parts of a painting (blots of paint, lines) resolve
into the 'represented' depiction -- eg, the space btw the brush
strokes and, moving back, the image of ophelia's face in
millais's painting would be tighter than the space between the
same two things in, say, warhol -- when one moves from looking
closely at the surface of a painting to a position further
away.  or perhaps there is a name for this? --

Mai-Mai Sze, in The Way of Chinese Painting (Vintage, 1959), writes that
"the painter has to be able to experience the rhythm of life to be able
to express it in his work by means of the rhythm of the brush. And it may
be deduced that 'to clarify understanding and increase wisdom' means a
contemplative attention to all things and to all of nature's changes in
order gradually to gain a sense of the permanent and significant. The
brush will then be swift and sure, setting down only the essential
strokes, in some places expressing by 'absence of brush and ink.'
Painters summed up this power in the phrase  i tao pi pu tao  (idea
present, brush may be spared performance). In the style called freehand
or free-sketch painting (hsieh i, write idea), this kind of brushwork is
often carried out by sweeping strokes of a fairly dry brush that leaves
the paper or silk showing within the strokes or by deliberate breaks in
the stroke that yet do not interrupt the continuity of the idea. Such
results are possible only after the painter has reached an advanced stage
of cultivation and technical skill, the stage at which rules and methods
are no longer consciously applied but are implicit in the results. It is
the stage when the  ch'i  of the painteris effortlessly trqansmitted
through the painting" (119).
        This kind of thinking also seems apropos for the form/content
discussion.

Hi, Everybody.  I just joined your group a few days ago, shortly after
going broke getting a new computer system that would let me use the
Internet.  I'd intended to sit back and watch your exchanges for at
least a month before venturing any comments of my own.  This discussion
of what to name the gaps in

          she knew the name    a big black winged
          bird on the end of a line    Clothes.

is too insanely just my kind of thing, though, so here I am already.

Such interesting and informative comments have already been made I hate
to end the fun by being unarguably definitive, but . . .  Well, here's
what I think: "caesura" isn't quite the right term because, as at least
one of you pointed out, it can, and most often *does*, refer to pauses
marked not with spaces but with punctuation, or not marked at all.
"Lacuna" has to do with missing material, which isn't the case, it
doesn't seem to me, in the passage above.

For a moment or two I thought maybe my term, "nulletter," might take
care of the problem.  But a nulletter is not a kind of punctuation but
a space that's used where a letter is expected (mostly in visual
poetry).  My solution, then?  Call the gaps "caes     urae."

Okay, okay, I'll give you the proper term: "interior indentation."
Since when?  Since now.  (Note, it can be measured in letter-widths.)

Thank you for your attention.    --Bob G.

Since we're being lexical, the usefulness of a technical term declines in
proportion to its inclusivity. The medial caesura in a line by Dryden (who,
like all critics of the period, talks about it a lot) is very different from
what Duncan or Olson or I do with multiple n-spaces, regardless of the fact
that on occasion the former is indicated by a comma. To illustrate, if, as
was common, there were no comma in the Dryden line, it would make no
difference to the way the line was read or understood--the caesura, tho
typographically invisible, would still be there, because it was part of the
rules of the heroic couplet game. Leave out my extra spacing and you destroy
the rhythm, and sometimes the intent, of the line.

> on the question of     gaps

Somehow this excerpt, from an essay of mine on Chagall's paintings, seems
relevant to the this thread. You decide.

"'To me, a painting is a large surface with objects represented in a
certain order...for example, the headless woman with a pail of milk who
appears in one of my canvases executed in 1910-11; if I had the idea of
separating her head from her body, it is because I needed an empty space
right at that spot.' Chagall said that about his painting _To Russia,
Asses, and Others_. But he might just as well have said it about other
paintings of his, including _The Poet, or Half-Past Three_. What interests
me in Chagall's explanation is his phrase 'an empty space' and his need for
it.

"Apollinaire--'that gentle Zeus,' Chagall, liking poets, called
him--viewing Chagall's paintings at the same timne, 1910-11, in Paris,
uttered the magic word _surnaturel_ which, translated, meant Chagall had a
'vision of the world,' his own peculiar way of seeing it. But Chagall
himself admitted only to solving a compositional problem when he separated
that woman's head from her body. _He needed an empty space._

"So do I...."  Et cetera.

Perhaps what really matters is the fact of the empty space and not what we
call it. I, for one, am inclined to mind the gap, not name it.

Bill

Well, moving away from the search for classical terminology, i've heard
the term "gap syntax" applied to the (very important) internal spacings
in Oppen's lines.  Think i heard it first from Ted Enslin, but i don't
know who might have coined it--whether it was Ted or someone else.  I like
the way that term emphasizes that the gap is part of the articulation of
the line, but i guess there are gaps and then there are gaps.  I've
just been teaching Mallarme's A Throw of the Dice, and the gaps there
wld seem to work on a more purely *spatial* rather than "syntactic"
level.  As also in Apollinaire's calligrams: "...for the bond between
these fragments is no longer the logic of grammar but an ideographic logic
culminating in an order of spatial disposition totally opposed to
discursive juxtaposition..."*

But i think the original example was more "linear"...

May we have a break from the Binoche thing on this line--ii.e. is "getting"
here referring to her as a posession? a dog?  a piece of meat?  There are
other forum for male fantasies of this sort.

Dear Lisa & Dan,
  always hoping to stay modestly in the background (sure Henry)... & yet
tonight I was so struck by your two posts - since just a couple days ago
I "went through" everything you've described in the process of making a
poem... it happened like this:  I was sitting on a couch one afternoon,
about 40 feet - quite a long distance - from a print hanging on a wall
in the next room.  Afternoon sunlight (which I'm not usually there to see)
gave the picture an extra radiance.  I don't know what the technical name
for that kind of printing is - but the artist had covered the plate with
ink entirely, then lightly brush-stroked some of it off to make a kind of
negative image, then laid the paper directly on the wet plate - so that the
strokes were actually the GAPS in the ink, & the image was white on black.
Anyway - from a distance of 40 feet, suddenly this print I had looked at
for years COHERED.  The entirety of its design organized itself & I saw
things in it (a landscape) which had been somewhat loose, inchoate, from
a more usual viewing distance.  I don't even know if the coherence was
planned by the artist, but it was there.  Anyway, in the resulting poem
(the Portuguese form of a "glose") dealt with this coherence-in-distance
on a different, symbolic level - the order or meaning that life takes
on when seen through the distance-perspective (often tragic) of long time
(forty YEARS, say).  (aside from the peanut gallery: "i.e. youth is wasted
on youth").  I don't know what the NAME for this coherence-via-gaps is,
either (hasn't stopped me from writing 1,000 words about it...). Proustville.

the poem's too long to send here (4-line text followed by 4 10-line stanzas
with each line of the text as a consecutive refrain to each stanza = glose).
so here's a shorter poem illustrating the specific form of the gap known
as the Renaissance knee-hole gap (incidentally today is a very traditional
gap day - between death & resurrection - Holy Saturday).

51

The struggle of the mind to bring to bear
a pattern in the mystery     the quiet
balance     imaged in these wet
streams     circling the old town everywhere.

Here once came    the young barbarian,
who fell in love     with this integrity of
land     & gently curving waterway;
found kingdom come     a petrine origin,
where dikes     domesticate the ocean -
Atlantis,     very human now     & Dutch.

& here     within this village radius
the labors of a Mondrian     circuitous
uplifted principle     serene     would reach
a dreamy apogee -     & build a world to match.

                        --Amersfoort, 12.7.96

(Amersfoort, Netherlands, is the birthplace of Mondrian.  the "young
barbarian" is Peter the Great, who traveled to Holland disguised as
an ordinary sailor, in order to learn shipbuilding.)

Henry,
        Sounds like a monoprint. Did the image hold up when you
approached the print to examine it more closely? If so, I'd say it didn't
result as an artifact of distance, but inhered in the work itself [like
bones before an x-ray].
        Beautiful piece on Peter the Great--the gaps work like patches of
landscape too deep to wade through, but mirroring the bright Dutch sky.
[Now THAT may qualify as an artifact of distance!].
        Keep those cards & letters coming!

Caesura strikes me as more of a sonic than visual term.  I like lacuna
(sounds like a new car, the Ford Lacuna) although it seems a bit fancy.  I
tend to use the term "white space" when describing those blanks.

if Bob's student questioner means the pause, then caesura is right, but I=
=20
think the question has to do with the typographical feature, which is not=
=20
caesura (though the space may be used to indicate a caesura).  maybe it=20
has no name, being characteristic of projective verse and after.  we=20
could name it the "charles" if we like.

Poeticos & Poeticas,

have enjoyed the chat     abt. the space
lacuna (no) caesura (perhaps)     whatever
you name it however     it's used one
must goatlike jump across     many rives


On a ussage (rather than nominclative) note, said gap (or a species
of same -- personally I've long considered 'em caesurae), at various
time in his long writing, W.S. Merwin has favored this convention or
device or     whaterer.  Most noteably in the volume *Opening the
Hand* (1983) -- but also sometimes earlier & sometimes later.

To illustrate how it appears in Merwin (or one way it does), here's a
4-line poem from said volume.  But first, another tangent:

Incidentally, there's a correlative sense of caesura in classical
Chinese poetics -- in a 5-word (5-word) line, it's almost always
between the 3rd & 4th words.  In a 7-word line, there's -- I'd say --
a minor caesura after the 2nd word, and major caesura after the 4th
-- or at least this is rather common.  Those are for the classical
[shih or shi] lines most prevalent.  In the more lyrical ci [tzu]
that came into vogue after the Tang dynasty, there was wider metrical
variation -- using, still, strictures of words-per-line (of course),
but the strictures now based on lyrics which might allow (say) both
5-word & 6-word lines in the same poem (unthinkable in shi).

Anyway, in all of these practices, the audible (& grammatically
anchored) sense of the caesura is very strong in that tradition.

In terms of how the poems appeared in print?  Not only were these
caesurae not noted, even the breaks from "line" to "line" were not
noted!  An entire poem (e.g., an "8-line poem" of 5 charaters each)
was most commonly printed (from top of page to bottom) with no gaps
visible at all: 20 characters, zip zip zip.  It's the job of the
*reader* to recognize what sort of poem he/she's reading (though
typically publishers/editors helped by putting all the
5-word-per-line poems in one section, follwed by the 7-word-per-line
pomes -- or sometimes that's done).  But in classical reaading
practice, it's also common for the reader to physically mark the book
(with, say, a vermillion pen, making a little circle) wherever the
line breaks occur -- and sometimes also, the same mark is used
indiscriminantly for the gap of the innerlinear break (caesura).

End of Chinese tangent, back to Merwin (poem follows).

best,
d.i.

A little erratum-note --

I wrote:

> between the 3rd & 4th words.

but *meant* to write:  in a 5-word (5-syllable) line . . .

well now that I'm here, I shd. also illustrate same from renderings
of Chinese.  These two lines appear as the conclusion to a rather
bitter eight-line poem by an empoverished medieval, a certain Huang
Jingren [or, in the older system:  Hunag Ching-Jen] (1749-83).

A few of this chap's poems appear in the anthology *Sunflower
Splendor* (but this is my own rendering).  These are 7-word lines
(which break into 2 / 2 / 3 lines; -- in English, each Chinese word
tends to generate a metrical foot).  The poet was (one might
interpret it) complaining abt. the vagaries of fate, stupidities of
humankind, and his own extreme poverty.  The poem finds this
memorable conclusion:


 perhaps it is     for poetry-books    that grief turns into sight
 birds in spring    bugs in autumn    naturally make their sound

re caesura -- more than a metrical or breath device, in H�lderlin, the
caesura becomes the breathless aporia, the suspension around which the
line, the poem organizes itself. Paul Celan, a close reader of
H�lderlin, talks of this in a late poem:

I DRINK WINE from two glasses
and harrow
the King's caesura
like that other
does Pindar,

God turns in the tuning fork
as one of the small
just ones,

from the lottery drum falls
our doit.



A number of essays in the Celan-Sekundarliteratur deal with this, but I
haven't got the time right now to dig'em out.  May your eggs be boiled
hard & painted brightly! -- Pierre

Perhaps, too, gaps call attention to the lost moments in which
connections and disconnections mysteriously occur: not necessarily the
X-Files abductees' stopped wristwatches, but what Paul Virilio explores
in The Aesthetics of Disappearance:

        THE LAPSE OCCURS FREQUENTLY AT BREAK-
        fast and the cup dropped and overturned on the table
        is its well-known consequence. The absence lasts a
        few seconds; its beginnings and its end are sudden.
        The senses function, but are nevertheless closed to
        external impressions. The return being just as sud-
        den as the departure, the arrested word and action
        are picked up again where they have been interrupted.
        Conscious time comes together again automatically,
        forming a continuous time without apparent breaks.
        For these absences, which can be quite numerous--
        hundreds every day most often pass completely un-
        noticed by others around--we'll be using the word
        "picnolepsy" (from the Greek, picnos: frequent).
        However, for the picnoleptic, nothing really has hap-
        pened, the missing time never existed. At each crisis,
        without realizing it, a little of his or her life simply
        escaped. (9-10)

--not that the gaps induce these petit-petits mal, but that they propose
what Blake calls "a moment in each day which Satan cannot find," a moment
brief as the "pulsation of an artery." I suppose critics might say such
gaps "problemmatize" the connections assumed to exist between adjacent
elements by separating them, though I'd rather think of it as
"potentiating" those connections, much as the asymmetry integral to
Japanese flower arrangement or traced upon the faces of Levi-Strauss'
Caduveo woman [in Structural Anthropology]. As someone said earlier in
this thread, Gestalt. Or a way to achieve ostranenie, the
"defamiliarization" of the world which the Russian formalists saw as a
central function of art [here, as an 'opening of the center'].
        And thanks for the H�lderlin!

On reflection, I've concluded that "caesura" is right for any kind of
pause occurring in a line of poetry, except at its end, including one
that consists of two or more spaces.  But "caesura" is too general, so
here is my taxonomy:

                              CAESURAE

      Implicit Caesurae              Explicit Caesurae

                         Punctuation-Breaks    Internal Indentation

I put no categories under "Implicit Caesurae" since there seems to be
only one kind of unmarked caesura.  The two kinds of explicit caesurae
should be self-evident.  Note my change of terminology from "interior
indentation" to "internal indentation"--to parallel "internal rhyme."

Now back to the real excitement here: the discussions, with terrific
examples, of the VALUE rather than the NAME of these entities.  --Bob G

Kent Johnson wondered if  no one going to step up and say something decent
about bpNichol, given what appeared to be Louis Cabris's attack. First: he
needs no defense, & is a major figure in Canadian poetry only to some.
Others never knew, or still dont. I find it interesting than some yuonger
writers want to find fault with bp, but what the hell, that's what the
young do. I would want to argue that there are lots of 'politics' in _The
Martyrology_, but then what do we mean by 'politics' & dont we all tend to
agree that there can be no art without it/them? Anyway, I'm one of those
academics who has written on bp, so whatever I say cant really count.
Perhaps.
Let's just say that for those who cared, those who knew him, the loss
continues to hurt. And the poems remain to be read & reread. Happily.

Don't really want to single this out, but I wonder if there is any need
for what follows "centres on sound"?  Does not one abandon poetry in the
"absence of all inner need" - Beckett?

or the writer must stay away from the "Big Words...the aim of writing

        Many thanks to Bob Grumman for his precise and useful notes.

        Though expanding by quite a bit on Bob Grumman's noting
caesura" as occuring in a line of poetry--

        I've often thought of it in terms of film (the suturing of
editing in relation to the gaps of montage for example)--or of the use of
spaces in the work of Paul Metcalf--the space being used as visual, sound
and "thought" pause--that is--making room--"making space"--for the
reader/listener--to "fill in the gaps"--"make the leap"--from one mass of
materials to another--or among a constellation of these--

        the caesura then works dynamically--rather than marking an arrest--

        Paul Virilio has written quite interestingly of an  aspect of this
in his books Lost Dimenison and The Aesthetics of Disappearance--Virilio
notes what he calls the "picnoleptic interruption"--similar to an
epileptic seizure--or the moment just preceding it--a pause, a stillness
and intense awarenes--then a gap in consciousness--and no memory of what
moved one from one place to the next, or from one moment in time to the
next--

        for Virilio--it is in these moments--that what is unavailable to
memory--is introduced--

        (he makes note of Pascal:  "It is not the elements which are new,
but the order of their arrangement".  And Metcalf notes Poe, who
countered the Romantic concept of Originality with the idea of taking
elements and combining them to create an effect--)

        in a film or in Metcalf's works--it's in the spaces in
between--that the dynamism "takes place" which makes the movements among
materials--generate that which is previously unavailable to memory--

        this may be to extend the strict definition of Bob Grumman's
byond the line of poetry--
        yet the ways in which a line of poetry functions--in using
notation as marks, letters spaces in spatial and temporal arrangements--
do seem to indicate a movement outward--a form of triangulation as it
were--into spatial and temporarl arrangments going on--all
around--
        "caesura" as an opening in time & space through which rush . . .

in and out . . . that which is unavailable to memory--

        "caesura" then--the Achilles heel of Caesars . . . ?

Mayakovsky:

                Four words,
                heavy as a blow:
                " . . . unto Caesar . . . unto God . . . "


a lot of pauses there--
to feel those blows raining down  . . .
and thinking about getting out from under . . .

Faulkner, when asked about his long sentences, said something to the
effect that he wanted to put all of history between a capital and a
period. Equally fascinating to me is what goes on between the period and
the capital. And things like the space between being asleep and being
awake, between day and twilight, twilight and night, night and morning,
between liquid and gas, solid and liquid and so on....

                                                and so on...

Her new book Loose Sugar just out from Weslyan makes more extensive "use"
of such breaks dissjunctures, etc.  She's reading here in Iowa City next
week; if anyone's interested in how she reads from this, i can make some
notes on line to wit .

Greetings All:

There seem to be plenty of terms already assembled, but for what it's
worth, Denise Levertov used to call those intra-linear spaces
"articulations,"  or more broadly "articulated lines" (a term implicit in
the Duncan quote already offered); as with the line-break, she had a very
precise measure for them (1/2 the pause given to a comma, or something
like that).

        "Our mission has always been to put the world's newest media at the service
of the world's oldest artform," says Mouth Almighty honcho Bob Holman.  "I'm
very proud of our website.  It's got the juice and immediacy of poetry itself
and I think it'll help us reach poetry lovers everywhere -- as well as all
the people who don't know yet that they love poetry."
        The site, which will be updated weekly, includes bios of the Mouth
Almighty's artists (including Wammo, Allen Ginsberg, Michele Serros, and
Sekou Sundiata), audio and video downloads of the CDs themselves (including
the soundtrack to "The United States of Poetry" and "Flippin' the Script:
 Rap Meets Poetry"), a "secret poem" contest, and links around the globe to
simpatico websites, defined by Holman as the sites of "performance poets who
make you think while you dance and dance while you think."  Pages will be
added shortly for the Last Poets and Maggie Estep, both of whom have albums
coming shortly.  (The Last Poets on April 15, Maggie on July 1.)
        The Mouth Almighty web site was produced by Bob and Amy Trachtenberg of
Naked Ear Productions and designed by Deck Reeks and Lisa Daniels for
Clickstream, Inc.

I just want to say that Kevin Killian's piece "Faggot Vomit: Jack Spicer
vs. 'the Maidens'" in the most recent issue of the Poetry Project
newsletter is great.

When will the Spicer bio be available?

St      even,

In her introduction to the City Lights edition of Kerouac's /Scripture of
the Golden Sutra/, Anne Waldman sez,

        Sanskrit poetics speaks of /Sandhyabasha/ or
        twilight speech, which is an "upside-down"
        language harboring contradictions and
        paradoxes.

I'd love to find out her source on this--it reminds me of the Sioux
(please correct me if I've misattributed this) /heyoka/, thunder-clown,
who lived, spoke, and acted backwards--
Gwyn

No no. I was using "Binoche" as an adjective. "Getting Binoche" means
acting like the lead in "Bleu". That is. walking around with no expression
on one's face, but rtelying on the music and lighting to convey one's inner
turmoil.

If this is legit, it reminds a bit of our honorable List-meister's
contribution to the 17-poets-marathon (assoc. w/ the MLA conference
in DC, few months ago) at the 4 Seasons Hotel --

Mr. Bernstein recited (well, sang) a work the memorable lyric refrain
whereof was:

>Don't Sokohl me! . . .
or
>So don't Sokohl me!

Sorry I can't recite chapter & verse anent the literary antecedents
-- I think he mentioned the work of Danny Kaye.  At the time, I
didn't get it -- the name Sokohl didn't happen to ring a bell.  But
then somehow or other, it dawned on me (poss. when browsing thru the
New York Rev. of Books or something) that Sokohl was the chap who'd
pulled that lit-crit caper (submitting a pseudo-postmod piece to a
journal that was published as if serious . . . )

So now we have

>getting Binoche
and
>don't Sokohl

is this just the beginning?

Poetas,

so happens I've lately joined an Indology listproc [similar to
listserv].  This is mainly comprised of non-nonsense specialists, so
one must mind one's Ps & Qs a bit, but anyway so far they've been
nice to amateur-me -- so I presumed to forward to that list Gwyn's
interesting question.  I also provided -- in said forwarding -- what
amounts to a bit of annotation anent the Sandhyabasha question --
though I suspect some more detailed & particular stuff'll surface
pretty soon.  But I thought even this bit might interest you'all a
bit, ergo attaching same.  I'll not deluge Poetics w/ everything that
might appear on Indology re: Sandhyabasha, but will perhaps forward
one or two things if they look to be of interest here.  Will see.

yours truly,
d.i.

In her introduction to the City Lights edition of Kerouac's /Scripture
of the Golden Sutra/, Anne Waldman sez,

        Sanskrit poetics speaks of /Sandhyabasha/ or
        twilight speech, which is an "upside-down"
        language harboring contradictions and
        paradoxes.

I'd love to find out her source on this--it reminds me of the Sioux
(please correct me if I've misattributed this) /heyoka/,
thunder-clown, who lived, spoke, and acted backwards-- Gwyn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perhaps the mentioned device in Sanskrit poetics is too familiar to
merit special Indology discussion -- but I wonder if someone might
care to present a few useful references abt. this?

[I myself recall reading (maybe 15-20 years ago) an essay on the topic
by an Indologist (somehow I think the essay-book was published in
USSR, oddly) -- but I forget the bloke's name or other particulars.
I'd picked up the vol., so happens, at Shambhala Books in Berkeley;
the subject was indeed an interesting one, in terms of poetics.  As I
recall, the sort of backwards-speech in question (a form of irony) was
traced back quite far -- I think to the Ramayana -- though naturally
was more prevalent in far-subsequent court poetry & such.  But I' m
speaking here from a too-vague recollection of that essay.]

ALSO, while on this Sanskrit poetics topic:  is there, by chance, any
manner of critical consensus regarding the lovely-looking translation
of Sanskrit poetry verses, in which American poet W.S. Merwin was
involved, entitled *The Peacock's Egg* (published by the erstwhile
North Point Press), I wonder?  Merwin collaborated w/ that
psycholigist chap Massoud (who managed, later, to get into some fine
controversies, I've noted -- w/ the Freud Archives, et seq.)

I've never heard of this term. I remember learning about secret societies
such as the "contraries" who would say good-bye when you met them and
hello when they left you. (Or the Native American equivalents.) There's a
scene in _Little Big Man_ where the man whose life was saved by Dustin
Hoffman's character demonstrates this behavior. As I remember from a
college class on N. Am. Indians, these societies were composed of the
bravest of the brave. It certainly must have been difficult to remember
to do everything backward.

P.S. alan jen sondheim: I get the mathematical engine (add the odd numbers
to the preceding term beginning with 11) but not the one for the letters.
Looks like maybe we should be reading some groups of letters forward and
some backwards.

P.P.S. Nico V. -- enjoyed your evolving palindrome.

1st:  thanks, St even, for interest in twilight speech (which, for
starters, has been corrected to sandhya bhasa (from "sandhyabasha"
cited by Gwyn from Ann W.'s preface to Jack K.) --

my impression of the term is that it was a rather broad Sanskrit
poetics techno-term for "irony" or "ironic utterance" -- not
necessarily backwards in the literal ways you mention.  (Have gotten
one reply so far, referencing unorthodox Sakta traditions of Tamil
Nadu . . . will see what'all else turns up.)

Meanwhile, on another topic, there's a job out there for one who's
(a) an expert in women's studies / humanities, and (b) interested in
living in Manitoba.  That info follows.

List Members:
There is a job opportunity here at the University of Manitoba, but it
is not specifically for South Asianists. It is for people in women's
studies and the humanities. Therefore, South Asianists who have
expertise in those areas would probably be able to apply. A copy of
the advertisement is at this web site:
  http://www.umanitoba.ca/programs/womans_studies/job.html

The application deadline is 30 April.

This is a tenure-track, full-time position.

I know nothing more about this position than I have already described
above. Questions about it should be directed to the Women's Studies
Program at the University of Manitoba.

Bruce --

thanks much for the corrective note.  I do recall reading (as
mentioned) an interesting essay from an Indologist dealing with
certain (and various) specific types of poetical irony in Sanskrit.
One early citation, I think, may have involved the well-known verse
from Ramayana, wherein Valmiki ponders with wonderment how out of
soka [sorrow] came sloka [verse] (though if this was in fact cited in
the context of the development of irony in Skt. poetics, I'm afraid I
lose the particulars of exactly why it was felt to be relevant)
Many other later references included not only primary sources (esp.
from court poetry or dramatic works), but also what seemed to be a
rather sophisticated theory-context from the medieval grammarians &
suchlike.  In any event, seeing the quotation with reference to
"twilight language" from Waldman, I mistakenly conflated the latter
term with this other (quite different) Skt. subject-matter.

The post from Ganesan with references to Tamil Siddha tradition did
put me on the alert that I had likely confused these disperate ideas;
-- and now you've quite clarified the matter.  When thus conversing
w/ experts, perhaps I shd. make a greater modicum of effort to check
my initial notions; -- anyway, again thanks for setting this right.

best,
d.i.

Tom,

I was trying to point out that Steve McCaffery's *theorization* of sound
poetry explicitly considers the social.  In the 1978 catalogue for the
11th international sound peotry festival, he wrote that sound poetry is
opposed to all social pre-conditioning.  Then in the mid 80s he criticized
some sound poetry for privileging lexical meaning by exempting it
altogeher...this shift might owe something to his intrest in Bataille,
because a complete exemption of lexical meaning would be restrictive, and
so contrary to Steve's desire for simultaneous production and loss...a
desire that foregrounds the social production of meaning

no, not to suggest he invented the grammatical principle; but he did
apply it (as did, we read, Mr. Bowering).  My post was by way of
pointing to another (i.e., Bernstein's) instance of the principle
(and, for that matter, wondering abt. what'all further cases might be
floating around the universe).  Didn't know about Mr. [?] Boycott,
but even this late in the game, always good to get up to speed.

no food at all.
how anything can used to sow disruption.
fighting over the scraps of a continually shrinking pie.

the main censorship we're fighting is economic, the mass markets,

what can be done, typing away in isolation, or writing against the flow.
like something i recently read, not like david vs goliath but more like
shirley temple vs king kong. can get hopeless.

sandhyaa "twilight"  bhaashaa "language"
is a cover label for the highly codified set of interrelated
metaphors used in texts where surface meaning differs substantially
from functional meaning.
sandhyaa bhaashaa both obscures the functional and, for those
for whom such texts are practical outlines or guides, provides
the key words or catalysts for specific (mental or physical) actions.

ah yes -- to take this toward another tangent: "sandhyaa" was thus
the morning prayer that Ramakrishna suggested (to his Hindu devotees)
should be practiced as prescribed -- until such time as the need for
all that falls away . . .  (recited while bathing in Ganges . . . )

but back to McVay's original interest: there are indeed some precise
Sanskrit poetics terms for various of forms of irony in poetry

(it simply turns out that SB isn't one of 'em  . . . )

        Kent, your firsthand info on McCord is very useful--
thanks. And no, "Christmas light" does not generous
reading make. I take back comet, too. I don't know if they
were poet-suicides in San Diego, or what....
        Fiona, I had in mind the archival method of the
_Cantos_, a method which seems down the line to be given
coherence--that it might not otherwise have for a reader--by
Howard McCord post-Olson in his programmatic assertion
for the _lyric_ as epistemic form. --Doesn't knowledge
require an archive of some kind, even for/of the present
moment?
        A lyrical persona unifies by constructing/reading an
"archive." So I was recognizing McCord's individualism
(not a _communitas_ in him) as being one with such
unifying lyricism, expressed by many New American Poets.
But what about, more significantly, the archival effort itself,
which might not require the lyrical? Does constructing an
"archive" not equal the necessary construction of a reading-
horizon which is itself necessary for the construction of a
community of readers/writers?
        These community reading-horizons--"archives"--are
differently constituted for specific audiences.
        For Nichol at various points the archive is language
itself--Language: the letters of its alphabet is the world and
his world. (He's not the first to posit Language, of course.)
What specifically Nichol does, at times, however, is legitimize, with the
connective glue of his poetry (puns, homonyms, etc.),
various already written, if you like, semantic chains in the
language. These semantic chains are the social products of
existing property relations. It seems that the semantic chains
whose links he particularizes and polishes are often
stereotypically affirmative of the way the land already lies--
the myth of the ruler. It's as if social meanings were
politically neutral, and a part of the substance of Language--
they only need to be disclosed for truth to be revealed by,
for instance, the pun. I think of Riffaterre's hypograms,
which posits at the core of a cultural corpus meaning as
already meant. So, very different from McCaffery's
paragram--in fact, McCaffery's reading of Nichol reflects
more directly on McCaffery's own work. There is a huge
heave of politics in _The Martyrology_, Douglas, that hasn't
been written about, I think. Instead, its politics is overlooked due to
what might be called a conceptual enthusiasm and need--
professional and otherwise--to find poetical demonstrations
of newfound learning from abroad. A poem may only seem to have a
fundamental indeterminacy if one's initial premise about the
nature of language, and especially poetic language, is, for
example, that pronouns are referential. That premise isn't
sufficently accurate enough, however, to notice
indeterminacy in differeent kinds of poetry--as anything other than a
shared theme. So I think the pronouns in The Mart are actually very
stable, or as stable as most linguistic phenomena--because pronouns are
not referential, or importantly so. But getting back
to the poetry, in Nichol there are always exceptions. "Inchoate" is
captured in a semantically rich pun
in the lines "ink eau / ate world" (from--book taken and
page opened at random--Book 6 of _The Martyrology_).
But there again, the pun must because of what it is fall back
on already-constituted meanings which, back to the bible,
are reincarnated once again as is. It's quite funny to think that
playing on a semantic rift in the letters "bp" is most
exemplary of Nichol's poetic practice.
        Peter, I don't hear a narrative of closure and
normative repair a-la-Therafields in his or their sound
poetry. Is that just me?
        Much thanks to Aaron Shurin and Rachel Loden and Gwyn McVay for
their Weiners's tips (I will check see again if I've left anyone out!),
and to everyone else who has responded backchannel. Don't forget, it's
April 11th!
        Ron Silliman says: "It is only through the signifier
that the cultural limits of the self, the subject, become
visible" (_New Sentence_ 146). Why wasn't Wieners'
_Behind The State Capitol_ considered as much an
influence on Language Writing as the writings of Hannah
Weiner? Charles Shively suggests in a special issue of
_Mirage_ (ed. Kevin Killian) on John Wieners that an aura
of mythologizing around John Wieners, to do with his
schyzophrenia, has prevented closer attention to the wriitng
in his writing--much as Ron pointed out that notions of
clairvoyancy prevented a reading of the "pre thinking
thought" of Hannah Weiner's work.
        I thought the panel presentations themselves were great.
        Gotta go!

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

David Israel points to W S Merwin's use of the 'gap,' & that's fine, but it
seems to me that the 'space' (the term I've usually used) in the Merwin
poem he quotes is fairly standard from line to line. It isn't in many other
writers' work (I would again point to various moments in the ten volumes of
_The Martyrology_ for example). It's not just a caesura, especially when
there are more than one per line, I would think. I also know, at least from
my own experience, but also having seen it in others' work, that Mark Weiss
is right to ask writers how many 'm' of space are required, because the
length of the pause that the space signs changes with the length of the
space (& it seems to em that Duncan wrote quite carefully about this in
regards to his own work).
This is a fascinating thread, although I had never before been bothered by
the need for a name for this act. And 'space' or 'gap' seem the most useful
still, because the most 'open' in terms of indexicality...

*************************************************************
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

     The Figures proudly announces the publication of Kenneth Goldsmith's
_No. lll 2.7.93-10.20.96_, the long awaited 606 page book of conceptually
uncategorizable brilliance by one of New York's most unpredictable young
artists.

     Made up of literally thousands of short phrases and hundreds of long
phrases, carefully crafted full sentences of great eloquence as well as
typographic rant of total gibberish, Goldsmith's book is a trove of found
and formally fudged language.  Ordered by syllable count and alphabetic
rigor, as well as by sound, the material in _No. lll_ invites the reader to
browse, scan, read aloud, howl, goof and wonder at the impossible
juxtapositions of diction, reference, and attitude.

     In the words of Marjorie Perloff, "Goldsmith's eye and ear for
contemporary argot is near perfect," and Charles Bernstein adds, "In this
useless collection of perishable information, this wily catalog of everyday
life, Goldsmith has written what could be the longest, and maybe the last,
list poem of the 20th Century."

     Known primarily as a fine artist (he shows at Bravin Post Lee Gallery
in Soho), Goldsmith has been using words and writing in his art production
for a decade.  Now, in trade book form, with a spare white cover that
echoes the look of How To Write, by Gertrude Stein, the reader can have
this largest sampling of his work to date.

     Kenneth Goldsmith has been active in the art, literature, and music
worlds for several years. He received a B.F.A. from the Rhode Island School
of Design in 1984. He has shown his text-based artworks in museums and
galleries around the world. In 1993, he completed _73 Poems_ (Permanent
Press, CD release Lovely Music, Ltd.), a collaboration with avant-garde
vocalist Joan La Barbara. He is a DJ at Freeform Radio 91.1 WFMU in the New
York City area and lives in lower Manhattan with his wife, the video artist
and painter Cheryl Donegan.

I realize the meaning shd. be apparent, but for the dim-witted, care
to lexicate?

I'm pretty sure that the source of Waldman's remarks is Eliade's
"Yoga: Immortality and Freedom", since it refers briefly to
sandhyA-bhASA [in the Kyoto-Harvard transcription system], and since
all of the Beats were reading Eliade [besides the book on yoga, there
was a lot of interest in his book on Shamanism].

You might check out the now classic study of S. Das Gupta [upon which
Eliade depended greatly], "Obscure Religious Cults" [3rd edit., 1969],
who by the way suggests that the alternation between sandhA- [i.e.,
"intentional" language] and sandhyA- [i.e., "twilight" language; cf.
"sandhi"] is not due to scribal error but to intentional double-sense.

There is a lot of more recent literature on this, which specialists
might want to recommend, but these two books seem to me to have the
best chance of being the ones that Waldman, Kerouac, et al., were
familiar with.

Best wishes

Gwendolyn Albert wrote an essay on the lack of local or national politics
in American poetry, even the poetry of progressives, and mentioned the
work and appearances of Carolyn Forche, an award winning and quite prominent
American progressive writer.  Carolyn Forche, a subscriber to RealPoetik,
fired off a response, and Ms. Albert has been kind enough to respond to
the response.

Gwendolyn Albert, Editrix of JEJUNE:  america eats its young, is a native
of Oakland, California.  She holds a BA in Linguistics from the University
of California at Berkeley and was a Fulbright Scholar at the Charles
University in Prague, Czechoslovakia for the 1989/90 academic year.  This
was the year of the "Velvet Revolution," an event which she was fortunate
enough to witness firsthand and participate in as a translator for Civic
Forum, the interim governmental entity formed by Vaclav Havel and other
Charter 77 members.  Following her return to Oakland in 1990 she published
two chapbooks of poetry with Norton Coker Press in San Francisco, started a
local poetry reading series, and began to edit JEJUNE magazine in 1993.
Since returning to the Czech Republic in 1994, she has lived in Tabor and
Prague.  She can be reached at PO Box 85, 110 01 Praha 1, Czech Republic.



An Open Letter to RealPoetik


Dear Sal and RealPoetik readers,

So.  Since I sent you my musings on the supposed US poetry renaissance of
the '90's, I have received quite a response.  Unfortunately, my description
of the experiences which led me to the question I was trying to ask -- why
do American poets, by and large, tend to shy away from wearing the hat of
"citizen" in their work? -- seems to have interfered significantly with
that question being heard.  However, the essay seems to have struck a chord
despite its flaws, so I will try to clarify.

The various responses I received described the essay as "combative," as a
"demand" for a "mandate" of  "political content" in poetry, and as
"accusatory".  Unfortunately, the mistaken conclusion people are jumping to
seems to be that I am advocating some sort of neo-Stalinist thought
policing of America's poets.  I am not.

I did not use the very general word "political" in my essay to describe
what I sense is missing from the US poetry most widely on offer to the
world, (to judge from the sample available to me).  I did use the word
"civic" -- in the sense of relating to citizenship or civil affairs, "of or
relating to the general population," according to my Merriam-Webster.  I am
noticing that with a few exceptions (such as Adrienne Rich) the poets of
this alleged renaissance do not address our common lives as citizens.  I
find this reflects a lack of that sense in the larger culture.  It is an
essay about what is missing:  plain speech about the underlying premises of
our civic or civil culture.  Maybe it is the sense of civil culture that
has gone missing.  I don't know.

What I was taught in America is that politics are supposed to serve the
citizenry.  In a democracy, it is the responsibility of the citizen to
determine the extent to which politics deviate from that aim and to use the
means available to try and keep on course.  I precisely do not advocate
poets turning into lobbyists or propagandists.  I'm talking about poets
standing as citizens, looking at how the politics which is supposed to
serve US ALL functions and then commenting on that function.  My
impression, which is all I am qualified to discuss, is that this is
something very few of them choose to do. Why is that?  Does it have to do
with the nature of poetry itself? Of the American experience? I don't know.

My great fear is that if poetry ceases to be written from the stance of the
citizen, there becomes yet one more area of human endeavour in which the
idea of the "civic" or the "civil" -- that general population separate from
politics and to which politics should be subservient -- dies a quiet death.

Now I would like to specifically address some of Carolyn Forche's concerns:

I am disappointed that Ms. Forche did not answer my question about her
evaluation of US politics more directly in our interview, and that she told
the anecdote she told in the way she told it at the Prague Summer Writing
Conference.  I will transcribe the interview and forward it to RealPoetik
so it can speak for itself.  I would only say here that I was not
interested in "sound bites" and that it is precisely the "subtlety" of
Forche's response that I find objectionable.  I understood what was being
said (and I am familiar with Chomsky's political writings), but I don't
understand where all this pussyfooting around is supposed to get us.

At the time of the interview I considered it an honor to meet Forche.  I
have read all of her works, and I have attended her readings and talks
whenever possible in the hopes of hearing her shed some light on what
concerns and troubles me about life in our times.  It is perhaps for this
reason that, as a member of her audience, I found her behavior
disappointing.  I find it disappointing that the "after-reading question
period is not, in [her] view, the place for sustained and serious
discussion...."  My essay discusses what  I observe American poets saying
and not saying when they have opportunities to address the public.  It does
not constitute a lament for my personal opportunities for "conversation" --
and my living in Prague, Oakland or Outer Mongolia is beside the point.
Where I reside has no bearing on what Carolyn Forche said and how she said
it.

I live in the Czech Republic because I prefer it to the US.  But that's
another story -- as is the "expat" "community" Ms. Forche assumes I belong
to, and with which I have virtually no contact.  I can assure her that the
thousands of Americans here in this post-89 feeding frenzy do not
constitute a community, but a collection of business owners and clientele.
My "community" consists of the writers, musicians, artists and other people
with whom I live and correspond, whether they are from the US or Ukraine.
Due to the constant daily reminders that I am a foreigner, however fluently
I go about my business, I am perhaps more aware of myself as an "American"
here than when I lived in America.  To see Czechs walking down the streets
in "Desert Storm" tshirts is to experience that complex of myth and
horrible reality that America has exported to the world -- on the receiving
end.  However, lately I'm beginning to realize that Americans buy their own
advertising most of all.  But I digress...

I did not wish to imply that Amnesty International is guilty of anything --
and I was horrified that Forche should feel she had to apologize for the
stridency of the volunteers in Berkeley (as if anyone could take
responsibility for the stridency in Berkeley -- heaven help us!!)  My point
was that non-governmental organizations are the institutions that many
concerned, um, citizens hope can address these issues of social justice.
But common sense alone should tell us they cannot be infallible -- and that
they can only do so much.  I would like to know more about the "rather
unblemished" history of AI -- especially since I recently came across an
article in an underground publication here which was critical of Czech
Amnesty's response to the Romany situation.  I would be very interested to
learn from whomever makes the decisions within Amnesty about how AI goes
about verifying human rights abuses, how AI decides when to release
information to the public -- in short, how does such an organization deal
with its increasingly powerful role in global politics?  How does it
approach the reality that it is often up against the work of the very most
secret, best-funded and highly organized defenders of the "carceral
corporate state[s]"?

Unfortunately, Forche's response goes far afield.  Once again the question
-- why do American poets, by and large, tend to shy away from wearing the
hat of "citizen" in their work? -- is being AVOIDED.  Forche closes in a
near-litigious fury by accusing Salasin of publishing potentially libelous
material.  Let's leave him out of it: I stand by my feeling of revulsion
and the right to describe it, however inadequately I may have done so --
and however unclear the connection of that experience to the others
mentioned may have been.

Forche's parting shot is a "subtle" dismantling of my having been inspired
to address civic matters by the example of the writers of Central and
Eastern Europe.  She implies that they would be opposed to what she
perceives as my "demands" -- perhaps as they were opposed to the demands of
socialist realism?  I know an "equals sign" when I see one, subtle or not.
I can only think that Forche's sense of the need to defend herself has
caused her to willfully misinterpret what I was saying.  So I'll say it
again in a different way:  in my country  -- and it is my country, even if
I live elsewhere -- Oliver North is free to run for the Senate.  In the
Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel is President.

And you wonder why I don't want to come "home"?

With great respect,

Gwendolyn Albert

Douglas -- you are right, of course, Celan does not -- or only very
rarely & in rather hidden ways -- use caesuras directly. The reason I
posted that poem was that in it Celan addresses the concept of the
caesura via Holderlin who worked on that question in his Pindar
translation. The whole of the Celan poem queries the fact that one (the
poetic line) can / has to be two, i.e. that the caesura both breaks &
makes the "line" -- "I drink wine from two glasses" says the first line
& on to the last one with its "doit" -- a translation of "Deut" an old
coin (the coin drops, the penny drops -- but always double, deut is
tuppence, in the old brit coin(age), or "my two pennies worth." & in the
middle there's the "tuning fork" -- has 2 branches to set up the
resonance, create the sound. -- Pierre

Oh, please.  Years have passed since I've been on this list and we've
never *before* talked about caesuras and lacunae, or really any of the
bolts and wrenches of poesy.  How terrible, how truly decadent that we
should do so now.  Give me a break.  Speaking as somebody with intimate
knowledge of what it's like to be on the receiving end of heavy state
power, I pick my own battles and I pick them carefully.  So I'm sure do
others here.  I don't feel the need to be harangued from some heroic
ramparts.

Tell us about what's going on, Kent, but please don't imagine you can
stand in judgment of our "silence."

Thanks, Tom Bell, for the letter from Gwendolyn Albert.  This question -
why American poetry seems to lack or avoid the "civic" - worth talking
about.  Will quickly draw forth answers from people based on their political
rationale or work credentials (community organizer, radical activist, etc.).
& can quickly descend into cacaphony.  Maybe it has, paradoxically, only
a personal meaning or answer, based on the individual writer's understanding
of and real commitment to political participation.

The simple answer (to why...) is that American poetry reflects a basic
situation of: suburbanization/balkanization/institutionalization/
privatization and other 'zations like that.  People (including some poets)
are involved with civic life through: 1)work, 2)voluntary service groups,
3)political parties [a distant 3rd, maybe].

But the answer is made more complicated by the present historical situation
(political non-involvement; domination by professional pseudo-parties;
balkanization) - AND by the whole issue of how poetry & art respond to
political reality (if one can even say anything useful about that anyway).

Probably the real answer is that most of us have no concept of how to make
democracy a reality in our own lives.  Political action is disconnected
from dormant ideals or visions of life.  This is the true   gap   today.
Has anyone seen Pasolini's film "Gospel According to St.Matthew"?
Now there's a work of art about a poet-organizer if there ever was one.
And in a sense, there has always been a dormant 3rd party of the
kingdom of heaven (from the lunatic fringe to the Catholic Church...)

One of the problems with finding a term, for the visual embodiment of a
caesura, and similar typo-graphic instances, has to do with the involved
nature of the medium and its techniques.  I mean, placement of verse
across physical space is both painterly and a vibrant form of mucial
notation in U.S. originary attempts (from Whitman on)...Lisa's mention of
a parallel ambiguity in the apprehension of painterly space is suggestive.
And of course someone's already mentioned Duncan's intensity about how
to understand lineation as a musical notation...As someone with a
background of intensive musical training and performance experience, I've
always believed the poem's surface had a strong element of performatory
adumbration.  I'm most comfortable with not dictating interpretive timing
quite so rigorously, as Duncan; but the principle makes sense to me.
Still, the one area of prosody lacking an intricate terminology, is the
area involving visual placement as an involvement with sound and movement
thru space.   (--which may be a good thing..But there is still a lot of
interesting theory to be done on this dimension of post-Cantos verse)

The poetix of car model names, what could be more amerikan?? The reason
Lacuna sounds like one, is the long-established pattern that Latin (and
sometimes hispanoid)-sounding words, with those distinctive vowel endings,
are considered classy in the right kind of way by U.S. auto
marketers...Which is kind of interesting given that Hispanic and other
Latin-derived cultures are not exactly looked on as classy and positive by
most of contemporary U.S. captialist culture!!

Favorite car names for poets: the Stanza, and the Prelude.

Well, there's nothing at all wrong with talking about lacunae! It's
just the silence the lacuna seems to mark in this instance that
I find fascinating.

Still, for those who might choose this as a "battle" worth adding a
voice to, I'll be posting info from FC2 as soon as I get it from
Normal.

I'm supposed to finish it by June 15th then send it in to Wesleyan.  Lew
Ellingham and I are racing against time as usual.  The death in 1996 of the
Canadian modernist Dorothy Livesay underlines this vividly (Livesay was
very helpful to me and Lew at the very end of her extraordinary life.)
Now, as so often in the past, I need the help of poetics list members.  I'm
writing now about the San Francisco events of November and December 1958
when Spicer, along with other San Francisco and Berkeley intellectuals and
bohemians, joined the fight against the administration of San Francisco
State to protest its refusal to let Langston Hughes read at the SF State
Poetry Center, where he had been invited by its founder (Ruth
Witt-Diamant), because of his "Communist" past.  I'm sure I can't be the
only one to have covered this episode, which has so many resonances (Cold
War politics, black/white relations in avant-garde poetry, homosexuality
and the left, San Francisco as nexus for radical/conservative politics,
etc., etc.) but I've looked in all the likely places and can't find much
coverage of it at all.  Even the Hughes biographies I've looked at don't
mention his visit to San Francisco.  [To cut to the chase, Hughes was not
allowed to read on campus by Dumke, president of State, but eventually
wound up reading on a houseboat--oh the irony!--provided by sympathetic
admirers and anti-anti-Communists]  Can anyone suggest any material on this
outside of contemporary newspaper coverage?  If so thanks very much.

I'm always thanking you all and you always come through.

re Mark W's point about boycott...

The most interesting noun yanked into being a verb, for me is: Barbados.
This was the practice of sending "criminals" (in fact a large number
political prisoners) to what were then rather harsh living conditions, in
permenent exile on Barbados.  Most infamous for this was that Lenin avant
la lettre, Oliver Cromwell, who barbadosed thousands of rebelling Irish
and militants of the factions to his left in the English revolution
(levellers, diggers etc.)  I love this word for its demonstration of the
encoding of historical violence into language, the violative way the
contingent facts of cultural history show us poets how to do poetry.  (I
wrote a fairly long poem which attempts to consist entirely of verbs,
though there's lots of pitching on the black--a poem I still rather like;
and of course barbados gets slipped in).

Revised definition of "bowering":

(1) Whether by Mr.Bowering or others, the scouring in a bowering-like
manner of
    the mind, in the hope that something like Bowering at his best (pithy,
amusing, unforgettable), will form in words;

(2) The attempt, failed, to do this.

I forgot to add at the end of that post...
the credit for info. on barbados as a verb, is to my favorite historian,
Christopher Hill; an English socialist who has published about 12 or 14
brilliant books on the English revolution and civil war.  His work is
groundbreaking about the intersections of utopian consciousness and
revolutionary fervor in that period, among the radical protestant
sectaries, and others; and in general about the structure of social
revolution in history.  (Right-wing historians publish much these days
about having "proven" him wrong, re his marxian interpretation of the
Egnlish revolution as having to do with class and economics in addition to
ideology and consciousness; they are dead dead wrong but that's another
issue..)  EP Thompson's great last book, Witness Against the Beast, about
Blake, is a kind of homage to Hill's influence. All the above strongly
recommended to anyone interested in politics, who doesn't know it..

the bower-bird is an exotic species habitationed somewhere in the South
Pacific.  The male builds an enormous cathedral-like "bower" out of
trash, sea-drift, etc. & then does a little dance in front of it
(long before this method was "invented" by modernists, collagists,
etc.) in order to attract mates.  The female often turns him down, &
the immense bower of babel is abandoned.

Equally interesting too is how our minds process whole strings of sentences, or
paragraphs, and so on, with these discontinuities between them. Is this a
process of integration with differentiability defined term-by-term? The whole
being a piecewise linear approximation of something. No doubt something
incomplete. There is an infinity of possiblities in each continuum between
sentences, gaps, etc. The lines/sentences themselves being nothing more than
truncated series of finite number of terms. Serial poems born in the gaps
between lines/sentences, so that rather than a seriality of poems end-to-end
(cascades), there exists any number of multiplicatively propagating trees of
possibilities.

Subject:      BP's Question / gaps caesurae lacunae

As a veteran user of the device, I vote for Robert Duncan's "articulated
silence" quoted in Dan Featherston's post of 28 March:

"duncan's preface to _ground work: before the war_ figures caesurae as
articulated silences, which is arguably a more varied measure of the _time_
of the poem than standard grammatical indicators (comma, period, etc.)
provide: not the metronome's uniformity, but the body's 'flexible
durations'."

"Non-metrical caesurae" _could_ be another (but even clumsier) term.   Lacuna
and gap do sound too negative, indentation too aggressively mechanical.

"Articulated silence(s)" may also cover the distinction Christopher Middleton
makes in his _Ideas about Voice in Poetry_ (in _Pursuit of the Kingfisher,
Manchester: Carcanet, 1983):

"[Yet] the inner ear is capable of an auditory complexity which exceeds
almost any audible vocalizing: the latter tends to be reductive, if not
falsifying, also it may straighten out shocks and distortions which, to the
inner ear, are part of the real thing that is the voice in the text and the
delight of the text.  ...  In performance, which should be the best instance,
there occurs the falling away of mental entity from linguistic entity, or
vice versa.  The rift appears, gunfire and screams.  ...  The subtle
differential harmonies of the text as voice, are these picked up by the ear
alone?  Possibly not.   *The reader's eyes do part of the listaning, do their
part in identifying and selecting sound-patterns, in the presence or audition
of which a delight is experienced* ... "  (asterisks supplied)

Just a note to let you all know that Small Press Traffic now has
e-mail--and that those of you who have Small Press Traffic business can now
e-mail Small Press Traffic directly at this address (rather than my home
address).

The one BIG exception:  if you're doing a review for the next Traffic
newsletter, please continue to write to my home address since Kevin is
helping me on that project.

SPT also now has a website where Traffic reviews and info on upcoming
events will be available.  I'll notify you all about that once we upload
some information to that site.

Thanks.

white caesurae -- This gets my vote. Indicates both the visual and the
breath gap in a term that seems to suggest a mythological creature.

Beware the white caesurae,
its whooshing nay, its wonky eye.

Thanks much for the vote, Steven--but for some reason your bringing the
mythological creature into it made me decide that the proper term really
is "caesurae albae."  (Just kidding--I think.)

I think   Moby    might   give it the
flukes   down.  How about
"suspension"?

a sonnet with     suspensions
(somewhere between lacunae    caesurae    &    suspirae)

i.e.   flying     mattresses     maitresses
iron
lava

or
ore   (the Name
for this     Fib     relation)

Rib     rire

(Sarah     laughed)   about    J

Just     harmonica Joe
just a     suspension (Je est un    jest uh     )
:)  = suspended +     )     +

- Hale-Bopp (what's    in a name?)
