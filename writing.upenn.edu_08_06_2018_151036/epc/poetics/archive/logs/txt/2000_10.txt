But Jakobson's insight is that mere contiguity is *sufficient* to produce
the apprehension of cause/effect or part/whole relations, and thus
sufficient to be employed as a rhetorical figure--as in the case of Tolstoy.
  Anna's handbag is not just something that's always physically connected to
her; by virtue of repeated emphasis, it assumes an implicit significance as
embodying a key aspect of her character.  What exactly that aspect is need
not be spelled out in order for the metonymic function to take hold; it's
enough that the juxtaposition enter our imaginations as potentially
significant. The relations container/contained, part/whole, cause/effect &
so forth are all relations of contiguity at some level, & to insist that
metonymy only consists in cases where those relations are emphatically laid
out is to miss the relativeness of figural expression in general: it always
depends on context, on some agreement, spoken or unspoken to interpret
things figurally.  Thus the cigarette in the Godfather movie as well (are we
talking about the big conference scene in _Godfather III_, BTW?): it cd be
either a metaphor or a metonymy, depending on whether it's viewed as a
general symbol of something or other (some kind of reflection on the
mechanistic way in which human activities continue to produce physical
effects even after the death of the producer, for example), or as an
extension of the particular character who was smoking it, as in Tolstoy.  It
cd also just be a cigarette sitting in the ashtray, but the fact that the
camera has chose to fix on it prevents us from justifying such a dismissal.
Even if the camera had chosen a different, completely irrelevant object (a
salt shaker, an electrical socket, a purple My Little Pony), our brains wd
go crazy looking for a connection, & at least structurally, that image wd
assume a metonymic or metaphoric status ... it wd become a metaphoric or
metonymic vehicle without a tenor (or at least an occluded or imaginary
tenor).

>My bathroom is contiguous to my bedroom, but this has nothing to do
>with the trope of metonymy.

Not in itself, naturally--but it cd very easily be turned to this purpose.
For example, if you say, "I'm going in the bathroom to brush my teeth now,"
in a context where it is explicitly understood that this means you are
getting ready for bed.  Or, conversely, "Which door is yr bedroom?" where it
is understood by the guest that the only bathroom in the house is accessible
only through the host's bedroom.  These are obviously not highly rhetorical
applications of the trope--in fact, it is banal even to call it a trope in
these mundane examples--but they do illustrate channels of communication
that shortcut signification by recourse to figural modes of linguistic
expression.

"Somebody, I don't know who it was, suggested earlier that Jakobson's
take on metalanguage was misguided."

Jonathan Mayhew wrote:
"I too would like to hear from the person who said Jakobson was mistaken
in his definition of metalanguage, and to hear George's refutation of
this other person!"

I’m afraid that mysterious other person was me.  I’ll try to explain:

I’ll confine my remarks to Jakobson’s essays in ‘Language in
Literature’, since that’s all I’ve read by him so far, and that’s what
most poets and critics cite over and over.  If Jakobson has expressed
himself more powerfully and rigorously in other writings on these
issues, I invite George or anyone else to point me to them.

The term ‘metalanguage’ is attributed to Tarski, a logician who is as
big in his field as Jakobson is in linguistics.  My OED Supplement has
"a language which supplies terms for the analysis of an ‘object’
language; a system of propositions about other propositions", which is
not bad for a brief definition.  The first quote is from Tarski in 1935;
the remaining quotes are from philosophers and journalists, with the
exception of one from Hjelmslev.  Under the entry ‘metametalanguage’ is
a quote from Chomsky.  These are the only two linguists quoted.  Neither
of them is using the term in the sense that Jakobson does.  Under the
heading ‘metalinguistic’ is a nice remark by Reichenbach which is
perhaps apposite to this debate: "The use of a metalinguistic vocabulary
is not a sufficient criterion for a more advanced state of logical
analysis".

Tarski introduced the distinction in the course of a very technical
consideration on the nature of truth, in order to find a technical means
of avoiding famous paradoxes like the Liar.  It was essential to him
that there was a distinction between object- and metalanguage: it was
possible to say things (predicate things) in the latter that were not
sayable in the former.  Since then the term has been widely applied in
logic (and in those branches of linguistics that pay attention to formal
logic, which does not, alas, include the structuralist branch), and
extended to cover the axiom schemata and statements defining the
_syntax_ (N.B. syntax, not semantics) of _formal_ languages and
systems.  (I don’t deny that the formal metatlanguage approach sometimes
has a semantic aspect, but I do deny that it takes the simplistic form
that Jakobson advocates.)

For example, in ordinary propositional logic (an ‘object language’)
containing the symbols ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘~’, etc., where the letters are
conventionally interpreted as statements or propositions and ‘~’ as
‘not’, we may write a quasi-formal metalanguage statement defining an
infinite set of well-formed sentence-schemata like this one: ‘if A is
well-formed, ~A is also well-formed’.  Here ‘A’ may be termed a
metalanguage variable.  The foregoing metalanguage statement tells us
that p, ~p, ~~p, ~~~p, etc., among other forms, are well-formed (i.e.
grammatical).  Note two things here: (1) this statement does not involve
any attribution of identity or equality; rather it _generates_ a set of
related statement-forms; and (2) at this stage of the game there is no
semantics yet.  We are _not_ saying that ‘p’ means the same as ‘~p’ or
is substitutable for it, which would be nonsense, given the eventual
semantic use to which we want to put these marks.

The term has been further extended, entirely _losing_ the distinctions
that were originally introduced in logic between object- and
metalanguage, to mean roughly any ‘language about language’.  Here’s
where Jakobson gets into trouble.  Jakobson cites Tarski and Carnap as
authors/authorities to back him up, but he demonstrates _no_
acquaintance with and exposes none of the subtle and difficult technical
philosophical context of their discourse.  He doesn’t say something like
"I don’t understand Tarski’s paper, but I’m going to borrow his term and
use it informally as follows"; rather he gives the reader the impression
that there’s no discontinuity between his and Tarski’s use of the term.

Jakobson evidences at least 3 big misconceptions about metalanguage (in
the essays in ‘Language in Literature’):

1. It is (he thinks) fundamentally reducible to statements of equation,
identity or substitutability.  "… all these equational sentences…" (p.
69).  "… combining synonymic expressions into an equational sentence A =
A ("_Mare_ is _the female of the horse_")  (p. 71).  [One presumes he
means ‘A = B’ here.]

I have given a simple example above (from propositional logic) which is
not an equation.  Such examples could be multiplied.

2. It is (he thinks) fundamentally concerned with _meaning_, not
syntactic form.  "We may speak in English (as metalanguage) about
English (as object language) and interpret English words and sentences
by means of English synonyms, circumlocutions, and paraphrases." (p.
103)

The same example above (if A is well-formed, so is ~A) does not
interpret or paraphrase.  It is a purely formal, grammatical rule with
no immediate semantic content.  Different semantics could be attached to
these expressions from the usual ones.  Incidentally, a whole host of
other complications about meaning could be raised here too.  Should we
distinguish between dictionary meaning, Fregean Sinn and "who I meant
when I just spoke"?  Not a hint of such things from Jakobson.  What
might the formalizable principles be that govern the generation of
legitimate paraphrases?  If we haven’t got any, then it doesn’t make
much sense to talk about a metalanguage in the logical sense.

3. It is always (he thinks) talk about the ‘code’ (a term taken to be
utterly transparent and without need of definition in these essays) of a
language.  "… we practice metalanguage without realizing the metalingual
character of our operations.  Whenever the addresser and/or the
addressee need to check up on whether they use the same code, speech is
focused on the code; it performs a METALINGUAL, (i.e., glossing)
function." (p. 69).

On p. 69 he gives a rather hilariously contrived example ("The sophomore
was plucked."  "But what is plucked?"…) of what he takes to be a typical
‘I don’t quite follow you’ situation.  But the example misses the point,
because typically when one asks for a clarification or paraphrase, one
knows all the words and recognizes the grammatical forms just used (and
thus one is fully in command of the ‘code’, under just about any
possible interpretation of that slippery structuralist term).  The
suggestion that when I say "Sorry, I don’t quite catch your drift,"
that’s a ‘code check’, as if we were unsure of the meaning of a
cryptogram, is simply ridiculous.

The famous essays in this book just skip like stones over the surface,
rather breathlessly, without even glancing into the depths.  What really
annoys me about the Jakobson of ‘Language in Literature’ is a complete
inability to reason carefully combined with an elephantine over-fondness
for learned terminology and learned references.  Wittgenstein had a
funny name for this way of arguing: ‘Babylon and Syria’.

        Apolgies Bill--you are right--shd read more Derrida--but wasn't
taking
a swipe at him as don't know enough to anyway--only read two books long
ago
        one in french was very clear but one i read in english i cdn'tmake
head or tale of

        that was long ago--i probably cdn't understand either one in my
present advanced
state of mental decay

        may be some problems are  with translations?

        also many of these things he writes about mean something
differently in the context of Frecnh thinking, or European than for us in
us-a

        But one thing serious i was taking swipe at the description in the
post, not of the work being described

        alsoi think it is a complete myth that speech was dominant and not
writing

        that was a very long time ago St Augustine was shocked to see St
Jerome reading silently!

        "no one had ever HEARD of such a thing"!

        i think in America maybe we get it confused as for example when
Olson wrote Projective Verse piece in 1950--it is SPEECH he wants to get
back!

        part of it may be rebellion of one generation against the previous
one, from which it takes what is of use to/for itself and then moves on--

        In Derrida's case as was long ago i don't recall all his
positions--

        but traditionally writing was an instrument of power, a sign of
power

        by far most people could't read

        to me i think Ring Lardner put it best re writing/speech:

        "Shut up he explained."

        to me that shows it is more a both/and than an either/or

        but then i think maybe i tend to bet on both sides at same
        time here--

        that way as Joey Pesci explains to Bobby De Niro in RAGING BULL:

        "If you win, you win. If you lose, you still win.  You can't lose.
        So what the ***** you worried about?"

The Vancouver Videopoem Festival

On Friday and Saturday, November 3 and 4, 2000, the Edgewise ElectroLit Cen=
tre is hosting the second annual Vancouver Videopoem Festival at Pacific Ci=
n=E9math=E8que, Canada's first and only poetry film festival. Emceed by exs=
tatic oral improv poet, Kedrick James, the festival will present videopoems=
 from across Canada and around the world. Our international call for submis=
sions has resulted in a diverse range of work in this fledgling medium. Vid=
eopoetry festivals occur in Chicago, San Francisco (known as the Cine-Poem =
Festival) and Roma, Italy.

This event is the first of its kind in Canada and provides a much needed ve=
nue for the presentation of Canadian work in this hybrid genre, a genre whi=
ch receives scant attention in our country despite being a creative field o=
f growing interest for Canadian artists since the 1970's. The most innovati=
ve treatments are explored and presented. Work from Canada and beyond will =
give local audiences a survey of the accomplishments in videopoetry in the =
past twenty years. The selection of works is a broad range of mostly Canadi=
an artists, a smaller amount of international artists to represent the cour=
se of the medium's development; a diversity of poetic styles and video stra=
tegies and will represent a balance of historical material with contemporar=
y and recently produced material. Some of the featured videopoems in this y=
ear's festival: In My Car by Mike Hoolboom--Toronto, Buffalo Roaming by Kir=
k Miles and Fred Hollis--Calgary, Exquisite Corpse by Una Knox--Vancouver, =
Poesia Visual by Arias & Aragon of Lima, Peru, Tag=A9 by Steve Savage--Mont=
real, The Voice of God by Joel Baird--Portland, Oregon, Physic Defense Trai=
ning for Ex-Lovers by Doug Knott, Los Angeles, Hundred Block Rock by Bud Os=
born--Vancouver, Ebonic Plague by Ian Moore and James Cagney, Jr. and Borde=
rstasis by Guillermo Gomez-Pena--both from San Francisco, Dragonfly--Kristi=
ina Szabo-Toronto Visions by Annie Frazier-Henry--Vancouver, White Walls an=
d Self-Doubt by Charles-Eric Billard, The Bather by Cameron Esler and David=
 Bateman--Peterborough, Ontario, This Is A Photograph of Me a treatment of =
the Margaret Atwood poem by Ericka MacPherson, Sleeping Car by Monique Moum=
blow and A Smell--Donna Szoke both from Vancouver.=20

The goal of the second annual Vancouver Videopoem Festival is to cultivate =
works, discussion and an audience for this burgeoning art form that integra=
tes poetry and video-like visuals, be they produced by a camera or through =
computer programming. The EEC aims to develop a forum for defining, legitim=
izing and nuturing work in this hybrid genre (also known as poetry-film or =
cine-poetry) and the artists who produce it in Canada. The festival compone=
nts will include a Poetry and Video Workshop on Thursday, Nov.2 at Video In=
 with Jill Battson and Kurt Heintz, two nights of screenings, a panel discu=
ssion and an awards gala recognizing the achievements in this genre in vari=
ous production and creation capacities. To speak at the festival on the ori=
gins of the genre, its forms, and on the artistic and cultural context in w=
hich it can flourish, are Alma Lee, Artistic Director of the Vancouver Inte=
rnational Writers Festival, renowned poet and author, Micheal Turner, award=
-winning poetry film producers and media artists, Jill Battson of Toronto, =
ON and Kurt Heintz of Chicago, Il, and British-born Director of the Cine-Po=
em Festival, Ian Moore. Kicking off the screenings will be dynamic performa=
nce poetry by Hilary Peach on Friday, and Adeena Karasick on Saturday. One =
of Montreal's core poet/performers, Exploding Head Man, Ian Ferrier, will b=
e featured at the Awards Gala on Saturday night.

What is a videopoem?

A wedding of word and image.

The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre is a nonprofit society whose mandate is to m=
ake poetry and new media accessible to all members of society through educa=
tional programs and electronic forums. We employ communications technology =
to widen the audience of Canadian poetry and give poets, multi media artist=
s and youth the opportunity to use, learn, and create with technology. Our =
electronic magazine, the Edgewise Cafe, can be viewed and heard at <www.edg=
ewisecafe.org>. Poets featured with audio include , Wayde Compton, bill bis=
sett, Sheri-D Wilson, Hilary Peach, Alexandra Oliver, Miranda Pearson and J=

Well, Jonathan, I'm glad to see that Harold Teichman and I are not the only
ones on this list interested in this problem. Let's see if I can clarify
things.

I think that the relationship between Anna Karenina and her handbag is the
same as the relationship between the mafia thug in the Godfather and the
cigarette that had just recently been in touch with his lips.  The
relationship is significant [at least intially] not because of some
metaphorical equation of the one with the other. No, it is significant
because of the habitual association of the two through contact.

Look, when a Vedic magician wants to make me fall in love with his client or
if he wants to make me sick unto death, he takes a lock of my hair, or
clippings of my finger nails, or some remnants of my clothing --say my
underwear -- and he insinuates these into a doll, a metaphor of me, upon
which he utters mantras, pours potions, and performs his magic on me.  The
relationship between me and these things which once had belonged to me is
metonymical, whereas the relationship between me and the doll is
metaphorical.  Because these objects have had intimacy with me and my body
they stand for me in the magical operations that he will perform on them, and
therefore on me.

When I can no longer see Anna Karenina because she is dead and buried, it is
her handbag or some other thing that I recall having rubbed up against her
that I use as a fetish to remind me of her.  That is metonymy.

When I see smoke and think that there is fire, the relationship that I am
responding to is a metonymical one.

When Robinson Crusoe saw  Friday's footprints in the sand, he knew that he
had company.  The relationship between Friday and his footprints is
metonymical.

The relationship between Jackie Robinson and the number 42 is metonymical.

Okay?  Surely, these relationships are NOT metaphorical. Right?

Now, as for my exam question. In fact, I accepted either answer [metaphor or
metonymy] as correct, depending on the strength of the explanation.  But I
found that the best answers were those that saw that the relationship between
the cigarette and the mafia thug consisted of BOTH, or could be explained as
such.

Those who called this relation metonymical explained that the cigarette was
significant because of its immediate physical contact with the thug: he has
been snuffed out, but his cigarette has a few more moments of life left in
it.  Ah, life is short!

Those who called this relation metaphorical explained that the cigarette was
significant because the smoke of a cigarette was metaphorically LIKE the
smoke of the human spirit.  Ah, life is short!

In my opinion, the best answers were those which argued that the relationship
was BOTH metonymical AND metaphorical [I think that the Paul Auster -- Wayne
Wang movie *Smoke* plays on this ambiguity very nicely by the way].

Anna Karenina's had so much power on Tolstoy's imagination not because he
thought that she was a handbag.  No, it was because of the intimacy which
that bag had with her.  Perhaps we could say that a metonymical relation is a
fetishistic one.  Certainly this one was. No?

More on metalanguage later.

Jakobson was not confused about these things.

> The pieces reflect Knowles' instinct to note everyday events and continually re-examine those experiences, regardless of chronology and linear thinking. Her work is faithful to life experience and the nature of the materials. Large panels extending from the ceiling and walls are page like in their structure, containing various embedded elements and incorporating projections on a grand scale. Some pieces may be explored by gallery visitors through touch. Silkscreen and Palladium prints, as well as cyanotype reflect Knowles' mastery of printmaking.
> The impetus for "Footnotes" is a lifelong continua of global travel, from which the artist has literally "picked up" things and created annotated journals. The concept of footnotes therefore is a means of referencing and reorganizing those travels, transferring the literary device into visual forms.
> Well-known for her experimental performances and installations from the early 60s in association with Fluxus movement, and by her affiliation with Something Else Press, Knowles has continually investigated the form and content of books. Examples of her previous works include the monumentally scaled Big Book from l967 and a "walk-in" object The Book of Bean from l983 which was exhibited in the Venice Biennale in l990.

Dear Bill,

I don't think it's fair for you to suggest that I didn't read your whole
post, or that I wasn't responding to what you said, just because I didn't
take up the total sweep of your argument.  I found a passage in your post
reductive, & I responded to it in a way that suggested as much.  (While you
have defended your narrow use of the term "speech," I think it's asking a
bit much to insist that the word be read in strictly Derridean terms, in the
context of this list.  It's one thing for our collective sense of the word
to INCLUDE Derrida's use of, what I assume is the French "parole" (or any
narrower, more focused philosophical use of any word); quite another for it
to be inappropriate somehow for me to slip into the Williamsian sense as
well.  Since there are a number of active poets on this list, I would have
thought such slippage would have been part of the point of any ensuing
discussion.  Similarly, what the passage in question DID suggest YOU meant--
that the awareness of space on the page was somehow "Derridean"-- ignoring
about a century of work beginning, ironically, with Mallarmé if I'm not
mistaken, who Derrida surely must be aware of & therefore potentially
"influenced" by-- seems, to put it a little more bluntly than I'd like to,
ridiculous.  Olson & Williams just seemed the most obvious examples.

While I would never suggest that poststructuralist theory, including
Derrida, had no bearing on the development of Langpo, again what I felt
reductive was your suggestion, by omission, that poetics as such had less
importance than this one point of intersection-- which I understand, by many
of your posts, is an important one for you.  I'm not trying to be
"anti-theoretical" here; again, much of that post I didn't have any problem
with, so didn't comment on-- because I don't have *time* to comment on
everything.

--& Yes, if it's any consolation, the Language poets are clearly more
Derridean than Olson or Williams.  That goes without saying-- though you say
it better than I could....

So I hope this "explains" a comment you obviously took more seriously than I
did.  & No hard feelings, as they say.

All Best,

Mark DuCharme

ok so it isn't a sonnet (can't believe no one on
a poetics list pointed this out - is it
considered bad form, a little like pointing out
someone's acne at a party in a a very loud and
obvious manner) but i really did intend to write
a sonnet in something approaching good ol' trusty
iambic pentameter in 14 lines - there is
something that undermines all intentions, it
seems

didn't Bly write a book on translating poetry? is
it still in print?

and speaking of Bly, is there a copy anwhere on
the net of his introduction to the Best of
American Poetry 2000? i am almost too afrraid to
see what poems he has chosen - am certain at
least on of the following words is in every poem

light
dust
father
son
grief
Gnostic
air
field
tree

or any other monosyllabic word that will leap
leap leap into our subconscious and make us wise

no anxiety of influence there - nope, not a jot i
dare say



>>>i couldn't find 20 PhDs who were willing to
work
for free - so just used an online translator w/
one of my simpler poems to do the switch -
i'm sure i am not the first person to do this,
but the results are interesting, if only to amuse
and show the drawbacks of computer translations

Swords of green slice the grid where white gulls
    sit
In the wake of Autumn rain,  the goalposts
Bookend my walk - the curved thousands - tender
Beaks devour bright,  new fall rain, slow drops.
Alone is the word of a leaky vessel.
It spreads among the scattered straws of road.
So light as to hover over hemlock,
And with a gardener's hand, the air I tend.

Undelivered, I return to silence,
Chanting without tongue unformed miles.

Épées de part verte la grille où les gulls blancs

incurvés - devour tendre de becs lumineux,
ouvelle pluie de chute, baisses lentes. Seul est
le mot d'un navire perméable. Il écarte parmi les
pailles
dispersées de la route. Allumez ainsi quant au
vol plané au-dessus du hemlock, et avec la main
d'un jardinier, l'air que je tends. Non délivré,
je reviens au silence, chantant sans langue
unformed
des milles.

Following the rain of autumn, the goalposts
Bookend my walk - curved thousands -devour
To tighten luminous nozzles, new rain of fall,

Only is the word of a permeable ship.
It draws aside among the dispersed straws of the
        road.
Light thus as for the gliding flight above the
      hemlock,
And with the hand of a gardener, the air which I
        tighten.

Not delivered, I return to silence,
Singing without language unformed miles.

I can't really argue with the first line. Could

I may sound like I am splitting hairs, Ron, but perhaps you can admit your
above statement seems to require some important qualifications.  The world
wide web offers cybersex, or *simulated* sex, and the *simulation* of every
fetish, legal and otherwise, in every wired home on the planet, without the
engagement.  *Without the engagement.*  As an interface, the computer
monitor is two-dimensional, isolating, and onanistic.  The web, sexually
speaking, is at best a porn theater for one, and where the intermediary, the
non-living channel between the original person and the viewer, becomes the
source.  Such is a crucial distinction, especially if we are to believe
there is something special about human contact beyond accepted conventions
of life and touch that cannot be simulated.  In mind I have the
psychological experiment with the baby chimpanzee that died despite being
given warmth and food and shelter and affection and every other *apparent*
need by an artificial mother.  Sex on the internet is a masturbatory means
of disengagement.

Of course it can be argued that the internet opens doors to such a wide
variety of experiences.  true.  but the internet itself is not providing
these services itself and is therefore not much more special than a sex
bulletin board.

Not that this really does anything for or to your argument.  But in a sense,
such a position might revise your argument.  Consider your following
statement:

"The stronger has been
constantly toward greater self-determination and choice, increased openness
(most of my grandmother's sisters had abortions well before WWI). The
second, a literal backlash, has in our lives been articulated through a
discourse of contagion. "

The internet seems a way of taking the former, the self-determination part,
to its most ridiculous and individuating extreme, to the extreme that it can
accommodate the discourse of contagion.

A change of subject: by the way, yours truly wishes that all of you check
out the following "erotic" art (requires Flash plug-in):

http://proximate.org/middleart.htm

These are images of very large photographic prints (on the order of 5'x8')
and as a result the pornographic content of each is much more apparent on a
computer monitor.  I find it quite remarkable how reducing the scale  of
these images, especially from such a superhuman size as the original prints,
makes these more and more pornographic.  (The images scale perfectly to the
size of your browser window, so you can change the size of each by changing
the size of your browser window.)  Such a relationship between size and
pornographic content creates a paradox.  The images become most pornographic
at their smallest possible size.  Which makes no sense at all.  Because at
their smallest you cannot see them.  Or because perhaps "porn" makes no
sense at all.  To draw such lines of distinction, particularly around flesh,
is absurd.

Thanks,
Patrick

Poetics List Colloquium: Group Three, Number Six

Lip Sync
by Ron Silliman

Possibly sex is always ahistorical, or at the least outside of history,
because its always *my body*. Strands from the thread of sex as an
institution over the past sixty years: implicit though largely unspoken
within the creation of a "youth subculture" that was always at its heart a
"market" (the perceived lewdness of Elvis, Chubby Checker, *Louie Louie*);
explicit in the frothing out of control of that same market into a vaguely
directed counterculture (from "Love-ins" and the poetry of Lenore Kandel to
the airplane rape in Robert Frank's documentary of the Stones, *Cocksucker
Blues*, to the Sutro Baths hetero sex scene and polyandry in all its
guises); deeply problematized everywhere in the fact and discourse of AIDS;
explicit again in every high school poli sci course discussing the
impeachment of a President; the world wide web offers not only cybersex but
also every fetish, legal and otherwise, in every wired home on the planet.
You don't have to leave Rock Springs to get French postcards anymore.
Today, what is most outrageous about *Behind the Green Door* are the
preposterous 70s hairdos.

"The body is an archive" is exactly right. Herpes is the gift that keeps on
giving. Contraceptive technology can leave scar tissue where you least
expect/want it. We find one cohort of people pushing 40 suddenly very
concerned over the ability to get pregnant, another already welcoming
grandchildren.

Take a step back, disentangle yourself from the fleshy nets of being. There
have been (are) two great currents at work. The stronger has been
constantly toward greater self-determination and choice, increased openness
(most of my grandmother's sisters had abortions well before WWI). The
second, a literal backlash, has in our lives been articulated through a
discourse of contagion. Whereas what might have been the free play between
libidinal impulse (that utopian moment in the gay community expressed
as/thru anonymous sex) and the equally powerful urges for intimacy &
community - & the enormous toll of acknowledging/accommodating both - never
gets to be developed, what remains is, in the broadest terms, our life
(lives). How many of my cohorts actually hear the word "gentle" in
"gentleman"?

It is within this ensemble of the already given that each one of us must
act (daily, even moment by moment) always positioned. Our age, our history,
bodies, all the social stigmata each one of us carries about is perpetually
being recalibrated by every person in our field (and by none more anxiously
than ourselves). Confronting death - & what else do you stare at, naked in
front of your mirror? - sex was a promise of release by other means. So why
is Nixon waving forever in front of that grainy helicopter?

YET ANOTHER POEM ABOUT POETRY

The tweed suits have said that we
mustn't write poems about poetry
and it's true that I've written far too
many of them.

And maybe it's because my poetic
license has no pedigree and I don't
really give a shit about winning a Pushcart
or Pulitzer that I've allowed myself such
freedom, so here is yet another one

for the endless miles of traffic and all the roads not taken
for the bicycle cops in the park, the butcher, the baker, the candlestick
maker, all the lawyers, doctors, reporters,
O.J, and Johnny Cochrane on Court TV,
all the moguls, drug dealers and thieves.
for the U.S. v. Microsoft.
for Elián Gonzáles and Fidel Castro and all the Haitians who
still haven't had their day in court.
for Israel, Palestine, Bosnia and Northern Ireland
for the revolutionaries, reactionaries, and terrorists and anyone
else who has more guns than sense.
for the Republicans, the Democrats and the Disco Queens of Europe.
for the guy next door and his wife who used to blow men in bars for a beer.
for the communist, fascist, and rapist, anarchist, abortionist, lobbyist,
and white supremacist, absurdist, atheist and Buddhist, the contortionist or
any other "ist" you can think of.
for Mumia Abu-Jamal and Leonard Peltier.
for all the poets in or out of jail, living or dead in unmarked graves,
voices that haunt us still.
for anyone and everyone, but mostly for me,

because although I don't write Shakespearean sonnets, when
I get my groove on I am the shotgun blast,
the unholy streak of lightning in the sky,
the grinning face at your window,
and the stick of dynamite in your ear.

and if Shakespeare were alive today, he wouldn't be writing poems about
poetry,
he'd be out in Hollywood giving rim-jobs to film producers and
script-doctoring Esterhaus,
and I'd be right here,
right where I've always been
still lighting your goddamn
fuse.

Around our building in Bed-Sty were these shrubs that flowered and released
an odd but pleasurable smell each June, which each year lightened me upon
smelling it, knowing then that in a week school would be out for the summer.

George. I havent read any of the philosophers such as Jacobson. I've read
bits and pieces of Foucault and one sentence from a book by Derrida. Most of
my knowledge of these guys is from reading lit crit. but your examples sound
interesting. Ididnt think much of A.K. And I fell asleep during the
Godfather because I couldnt understand it. My ex enjoyed it. But I find that
I can never follow dialogue in movies (especially when its an Am one and
blokes like Brando mumble too much.The English enunciate well so I can
sometimes understand English movies.)I like the Three Stooges tho and
Lawrence of Arabia. But its tragic that you missed my brilliant piece of
"Dickensian" writing.(Abou a guy clled "Wing Nut" which I gave as an example
of Metonomy according to the Dict.) Forget about Jakobson and all those
French guys. Read my poem The Red. Any way, what's the point of reading a
big book just to have one exciting thing happen?Richard Taylor.

Hi: Tried the folks on the British-Poets list on this query a little while
ago but had no luck, so I thought I'd see if anyone here had a good guess:
I'm trying to gloss a couple stanzas in a poem by Charles Madge:

Such is that temple where the holy queen
Blesses the torture chamber and the rack:
In image always, never person, seen,
Long draperies falling behind her back.

She dominates, whether as Abstract Will,
Brennpunkt, inverted Sex, or racial dream,
The old collective phantom lingering still
To fascinate, to murder and to seem.

The last stanza seems to be a list of some dubious ideas from the 19th
century (sexual "inversion", eugenics, &c); "Brennpunkt" is literally "focal
point" but I need to know what it's doing here.  & "Abstract Will"--what
exactly does this allude to?  Schopenhauer? Nietzsche?

all best --N

Subject:      Re: What Jakobson got wrong about metalanguage
Comments: To: hteichma@erols.com, jmayhew@eagle.cc.ukans.edu

While the List silently ponders its bodies and sexes, I will preoccupy
myself, mentally and bodily and wordily too, with a reply to Harold Teichman,
about what Jakobson got right about metalanguage.

HT and I have had a brief conversation about Jakobson offlist, and it became
clear, I think to both of us, that our disagreements can be attributed to the
difference in our perspectives.  As HT nicely demonstrates in his post, he is
a philosopher interested in philosophy, and, in this thread, in metalanguage
as it is used by the likes of Tarski.  HT shows us how the term is used in
philosophy and formal logic.  Fine.

But Jakobson is a linguist and in my view should be judged as a linguist.
His use of the term 'metalanguage' in linguistics is widely accepted by
linguists [should I trot out a bunch of refs, or will you all trust me on
this?].  And it has been very fruitful.  The point is that J is not looking
at the semantics of formal logic. He is looking at a type of linguistic
behavior that can be identified not only in the behavior of trained linguists
[never mind trained philosophers] but also in the behavior of ordinary
untrained people, like ordinary and even language poets.

Now, what is metalinguistic behavior?  It is exactly what J says it is: it is
the use of one language [the meta-l] to talk about another language [the
object-l]; it can also be seen in the use of a language to talk about that
very language: English to talk about English, etc.  2500 years ago, the
Sanskrit grammarians invented a rigorous metalanguage to talk about Sanskrit:
it consisted of some Sanskrit words, and Skt syntax, morphology, and
phonology, etc., but with the addition of a set of metalinguistic [auditory,
non-visual] markers that was invented for the sake of clarity and conciseness
-- this was still a largely oral, pre-lierate culture.  Well, I won't go into
how much more impressed I am by them than by, say, Wittgenstein.  That's a
sidetrack.

Jakobson has taught us to see metalanguage in everyday discourse.  Look, it
is prominent in the language behavior of children, in fact much more
prominent in them than in most adults [except for the occasional eccentrics
like poets and other lovers of words].  Look at the pre-linguistic babble of
your children in their cribs.  The ba-ba-ba, ma-ma-ma stuff.  Well, it is on
one level clear exploratory phonology.  But it is also a metalinguistic
exploration of the range of the meaningful sound-units [phonemes] of the
speech-community that the child finds herself surrounded by, immersed in.
Look at your toddlers.  Look at all of the little word-substitutions that
they busy themselves with: that is metalanguage at play.  A lot of what used
to pass as "grammar" in school was really a rudimentary form of
metalinguistic analysis of the language that teachers are trying still to get
us to master.  Look at the knock-knock jokes and 'who am I?' riddles that
your kids like to play.  Their steady popularity is a measure of the
metalinguistic interests of children.

Metalanguage is in constant operation in foreign language classes that you
encourage your kids to take.  To a great extent, I view my own college career
as nothing but a series of new metalinguistic exercises.  Etc. etc. etc.

Kids are more preoccupied with metalinguistic games etc. than their parents
precisely because they are trying to come to grips with that code that HT
doubts exists.  Well, most adults have stopped thinking about the code, and
now they doubt that it exists, because they have internalized it and it
operates in them without any assistence from them whatsoever.  It is all
perfectly 'natural' until something comes along to disrupt its smooth
unconscious operation.  I would guess that most of us on this list are also,
like the kids, intensely interested in the disruptions of that unconscious
operation in us.  I know that many of you are because I have seen it in your
writing.

Well, what about poetry and metalanguage?  Two entirely different operations.
I don't want to confuse the two.  But poetics is a sub-branch of
metalinguistics from my point of view.

I have written papers on the verbal contests, riddle contests and poetic
bragging contests, of old Vedic poetry.  It is clear that in most poetic
traditions of the world, the person who gravitates toward poetry also
gravitates toward metalanguage, as well as what I would call
proto-linguistics.  This has to do with the material that they work with,
their words, of course.

I read language poetry as a kind of poetry that is preoccupied with
metalanguage.  But then again a lot of other poetry is preoccupied in that
too.  Of course, I've gotten all of this into my head from thinking about J's
take on metalanguage for a very long time.

Well, I've gone on too long.

Perhaps Jonathan and Harold and I can come to see alike on this.

George Thompson

[p.s. Here's an example of metalinguistic humor that I found in a book by
Steven Pinker:

A woman gets into a taxi in Boston's Logan airport and asks the driver, "Can
you take me someplace where I can get scrod?"  He says, "Gee, that's the
first time I've heard it in the pluperfect subjunctive."  See, even cab
drivers do it!]

from the section "Going beyond pleasure, in three easy steps"

One:  I have no sense-strands left.  Only the track screech of the drawer
when I pull it out.  Looking for paper, this.  (Metal.)  I saw something, I
thought it was a corpse laid to bone - - Long Beach, CA - - on a white
bed-sheet.  A house with palms and the shadow of one palm.  I saw it.  In
the Long Beach Museum of Art.
        Another lie.  Someone sent me a postcard from St.
Paul.  (It's been like this for a long time.  I have no questions as such.
My body does not follow.)

Dear Readers: when people get to Body/Sex/Writing 4.2 (mine), they might be
marginally amused to note that the notorious WRAP of computers did not allow it
to look the way "I" originally "intended" it to--that is, a line of sound
translation and a line of normative text just below (or was it above? which is
on top?), which just goes to show that the computer body of sex/writing had its
own ideas on the "subject" and did something beyond what "I" desired. That is,
the way my piece looks is an allegory of the unintended subversions of desire,
and for all "I" know, it might be better off the new-wrap way. affectionately,
Rachel (Blau DuPlessis)

>David. While I find the French theorists (to the extent - which isnt great - that I've read them)interesting and their contribution is obviously significant, for me they degenerate too much into obfuscation, and i think this is a tendency with many, not all, of the Langpos. An example is Silliman's recent reference to the L movement as being neo-structuralist. Means what? And if you follow that with another fairly abstract term you have the interaction of two variables until the discourse or colloquy becomes virtually incomprehensible. But Bernstein and Silliman et al are marvelllous poets. And the L movement has (and still is)of great interest and some influence. It will have could have major repercussions)Altho such obfuscation may well work against the "project" of undermining and "attacking" the bourgeois or the patriarchal language because those one might influence are simply baffled. And the there is the problem of: how does L poetry actually bring about any positive o
 r progressive change both in writing practice and in the social-political world. If the sign is "oppressive" or not, if transparent language is oppressive (and I'm not in favour of a return to simplistic "realism",then how do we or they use that fact to change things? Perhaps this slide toward abstraction is an indication of the way L poetry can become or is (in the scheme of things so to speak) irrelevant.
 I also saw that part in "The Confessions". Apparently the idea of "subvocalising" as L heijinian calls it is relatively a new practice. I dont think Derrida makes much sense. I, for example, puked before I mewled and then I learnt to read and write. Writing is another way of speaking or it is mostly).
  Or: does using big words like post-structuralsim or neo-structuralism (neo-struct ... a new structuralist or a sort of half structuralist?)do any one any good? Is any one the happier?Is the revolution closer?  Do we write better or more interestingly? Or do we start to cut ourselves of from life and reality.

I always knew Robert Frost was bad, but I never knew just how bad until I
read the recent obituary for London East End gangster Reggie Kray
(1933-2000) in The Times:

_______________________________

"Reggie was the more calculating brother. He established a meeting place
for criminals, became a master of the protection racket and was prepared to
confront rival gangs with violence if necessary.

Their murder of Jack "The Hat" McVitie was as horrific as anything
portrayed in Goodfellas or Reservoir Dogs. The victim was held from behind
by Ronnie, who urged his brother "Kill him, Reg, do It." Reggie used a
knife so thoroughly that McVitie's liver fell out. Tony Lambrianou got rid
of the body by having it crushed inside a car into a three-foot (1m) square
cube, referred to by The Firm as "the Oxo".

Meanwhile Ronnie, a homosexual, took exception to being described by George
Cornell, an associate of another gang, as a "fat poof". Ronnie took an
automatic pistol into the Blind Beggar public house in Bethnal Green and,
as the jukebox played the Walker Brothers' song The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine
Any More, shot him dead.

In 1969, Ronnie and Reggie were jailed for life for the McVitie and Cornell
killings. When examined by Home Office psychiatrists, Reggie Kray tried to
present himself self as a cultivated man who enjoyed listening to Maria
Callas, the operatic soprano, and reading poems by Robert Frost."

Which poem by Robert Frost, I wonder? "The Death of the Hired Man" (1914),
perhaps?

Recently I realized the reason my friends always rehash the same
"outrageous" stories about my partying when they get together is that my
partying serves as a convenient metonymy for their own, in that it occurred
in the same room as theirs, & so for whatever reason it's more fun to talk
about how I wound up handcuffed to the radiator than how they got that scar
on their face LRSN ps I still like to party

<< Dear Bill,

I don't think it's fair for you to suggest that I didn't read your whole
post, or that I wasn't responding to what you said, just because I didn't
take up the total sweep of your argument.  I found a passage in your post
reductive, & I responded to it in a way that suggested as much.  (While you
have defended your narrow use of the term "speech," I think it's asking a
bit much to insist that the word be read in strictly Derridean terms, in the
context of this list.  It's one thing for our collective sense of the word
to INCLUDE Derrida's use of, what I assume is the French "parole" (or any
narrower, more focused philosophical use of any word); quite another for it
to be inappropriate somehow for me to slip into the Williamsian sense as
well.  Since there are a number of active poets on this list, I would have
thought such slippage would have been part of the point of any ensuing
discussion.  Similarly, what the passage in question DID suggest YOU meant--
that the awareness of space on the page was somehow "Derridean"-- ignoring
about a century of work beginning, ironically, with Mallarm=E9 if I'm not
mistaken, who Derrida surely must be aware of & therefore potentially
"influenced" by-- seems, to put it a little more bluntly than I'd like to,
ridiculous.  Olson & Williams just seemed the most obvious examples.

And that's precisely why I added another post, to explain what I had (it=20
seems wrongly) taken for granted.  But I still contend that in context my=20
comment was adequately limited,  and that the "sweep" of any argument is=20
crucial to understanding its terms.  Isn't that generally accepted?  If=20
someone uses the term "unconscious" in an argument regarding psychological=20
theory, and someone else interprets that to mean knocked out cold--well, sur=
e=20
the word out of context is liable to that misinterpretation.  Though I=20
understand how anyone not so focused on Derrida might have read what you=20
read.  The Mallarme issue is pretty familiar to all of us, but Derrida is a=20
philosopher, not a poet in the narrow sense.  It just makes more sense to me=
=20
that Mallarme is Derridian than the other way around, in the way that=20
Shakespeare was Freudian (according to Jones) and not the other way around.=20=
=20
Derrida's use of the term "speech" narrow?  Hmmm . . . haven't heard that=20
before.  By the way, "parole" is Saussure, and Barthes early on, not Derrida=
.=20
 And there are important differences between the three.  I've already posted=
=20
a "to be fair" addendum, so I think I have been.

While I would never suggest that poststructuralist theory, including
Derrida, had no bearing on the development of Langpo, again what I felt
reductive was your suggestion, by omission, that poetics as such had less
importance than this one point of intersection-- which I understand, by many
of your posts, is an important one for you.  I'm not trying to be
"anti-theoretical" here; again, much of that post I didn't have any problem
with, so didn't comment on-- because I don't have *time* to comment on
everything.

Neither do I have the time to comment on everything--hence my assumption of=20
"familiarity."  This is not a problem for me, Mark.  I always enjoy the give=
=20
and take, and your response demontrated to me the need for clarification, fo=
r=20
which I thank you.  Hence the follow up posts.  My education is in literatur=
e=20
and philosophy, so I am guilty of seeing things always in philosophical term=
s.

--& Yes, if it's any consolation, the Language poets are clearly more
Derridean than Olson or Williams.  That goes without saying-- though you say
it better than I could....

Well, that's kind of you sir.  But you're no slouch.  And for some it isn't=20
as obvious as you suggest. =20

So I hope this "explains" a comment you obviously took more seriously than I
did.  & No hard feelings, as they say.

There never was, Mark.  That ain't how I'm wired.   Sure I would prefer a=20
response something to the effect of "This seems wrong to me.  Would you=20
explain your meaning?" rather than "This is stupid," or anything in that=20
vein.  But I don't understand anyone having hard feelings over generally=20
anonymous posts.   It's just words on a "page" which, come to think of it,=20
pretty much sums up human cognition and experience.  (Got a feeling I'm gonn=
a=20
have to explain this--please NO!)  What I always take seriously is good=20
conversation, and again I thank you for that.  For me, this is fun. =20

All Best,

Mark DuCharme

And the same to you, Mark, always.  Keep me honest.  I appreciate it.

Now why, unless we grant the premise that Jakobson is infallible, would
something that's not metaphorical *need* to be metonymical?? There are only
two possibilities on God's green earth? The handbag is "significant"
because of its contact with A.K., it's "used as a fetish," but those aren't
enough? It has to be a metonym too, just because it's not a metaphor?

(Ditto for your claim about the "metonymic" aspects of the thug's
cigarette. I agree that your other examples [Friday's footsteps, lock of
hair, #42, etc.] are metonyms.)

I think, George, you've unintentionally shown that Jakobson's distinction
only makes sense if you make at least one of the terms so diffuse as to be
almost all-encompassing ("metonymy" = "being associated with") ("metaphor"
stays pretty specific, but that's because it's the politically bad pole, at
least in every post-Jakobsonian article I've seen). And if Jakobson meant
something that all-encompassing, I find it suspicious that he would try to
jargonize his point with a term that, pre-Jakobson, was quite specific.

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

Afternoon reading: Jamaican American fiction writer
THOMAS GLAVE
Thursday afternoon, October 5, 4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

THOMAS GLAVE's debut book of stories, _Whose Song? and Other Stories_ (City
Lights, 2000), has met with acclaim from such luminaries as Wilson Harris,
Gloria Naylor, Carole Maso, and Clarence Major.  Mr. Glave was born in the
Bronx and grew up there and in Kingston, Jamaica.  His work has earned many
honors, including an O. Henry Prize (he is the second gay African American
writer, after James Baldwin, to win this award) and a Fulbright fellowship
to Jamaica.  While there, he worked on issues of social justice, and helped
found the Jamaica Forum of Lesbians, All-Sexuals, and Gays.  o  He lives
and teaches in Binghamton, New York.

"What a writer!  What a book!  Glave is a brilliant writer of startlingly
fresh prose, a writer who keeps you in a constant presence of experience,
as if you were moving around in a clear dream.  His stories are intricate
tapestries of life rendered through a triumphant act of the imagination."
-Clarence Major

"Remarkable stories by a gifted writer who explores, in prose and rhythms
of imaginative moment, the stresses, the split-minds, the implicit
grandeurs, the subtleties, the terrors, of emotional desire and obsession:
one is drawn compulsively into character and event."  -Wilson Harris

 "A fiercely imagined debut-intensely lyric, driven by the desire in the
face of everything for truth, justice, beauty."  -Carole Maso

 ". . . Thomas Glave walks the path of such greats in American literature
as Richard Wright and James Baldwin while forging new ground of his own.
His voice is strong and his technique dazzling as he cuts to the bone of
what it means to be black in America, white in America, gay in America, and
human in the world at large. . . .  A true talent of the 21st century."
-Gloria Naylor

COMING UP:  next week, same place & time....

Afternoon reading: innovative new fiction from
CHRIS KRAUS & MIKE AMNASAN
Thursday afternoon October 12, 4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

CHRIS KRAUS's books-_Aliens & Anorexia_ and _I Love Dick_-transgress all
typical notions of fiction, bending writing to the demands and purposes of
life itself in the process.  _Aliens & Anorexia_ (Semiotext(e)/Smart Art,
2000) combines passion and polemic in a philosophically sophisticated
rejection of cultural cynicism.  "From the end of the world-New Zealand-to
Los Angeles, Africa and Berlin, past attempted escapes through the body's
tunnels and telephone wires, Gravity is the true heroine of this very
serious comedy" (Fanny Howe).  Ms. Kraus edits Semiotext(e)'s Native Agents
series of books.  A filmmaker as well as writer, she lives in Los Angeles.
MIKE AMNASAN's new novel _Beyond the Safety of Dreams_ was just published
by Krupskaya Books.  "It is the most painfully honest writing I have read
in a long time," writes Tom Beckett, "a book of revelations about
alienation and abjection, a disturbing account of one man's struggle to
find a way to feel at home in an inhospitable world."  As a playwright, Mr.
Amnasan has had presented in staged readings in the Bay Area his dramatic
works _Revery_ , _Unfair Play_ and _The Poet Killer_.  He lives in San
=46rancisco, where he recently completed his B.A. at SFSU on a scholarship
from Sheet Metal Workers Local #104.

YET ANOTHER POEM ABOUT POETRY

The tweed suits have said that we
mustn't write poems about poetry
and it's true that I've written far too
many of them.

And maybe it's because my poetic
license has no pedigree and I don't
really give a shit about winning a Pushcart
or Pulitzer that I've allowed myself such
freedom, so here is yet another one

for the endless miles of traffic and all the roads not taken
for the bicycle cops in the park, the butcher, the baker, the candlestick
maker, all the lawyers, doctors, reporters,
O.J, and Johnny Cochrane on Court TV,
all the moguls, drug dealers and thieves.
for the U.S. v. Microsoft.
for Elián Gonzáles and Fidel Castro and all the Haitians who
still haven't had their day in court.
for Israel, Palestine, Bosnia and Northern Ireland
for the revolutionaries, reactionaries, and terrorists and anyone
else who has more guns than sense.
for the Republicans, the Democrats and the Disco Queens of Europe.
for the guy next door and his wife who used to blow men in bars for a beer.
for the communist, fascist, and rapist, anarchist, abortionist, lobbyist,
and white supremacist, absurdist, atheist and Buddhist, the contortionist or
any other "ist" you can think of.
for Mumia Abu-Jamal and Leonard Peltier.
for all the poets in or out of jail, living or dead in unmarked graves,
voices that haunt us still.
for anyone and everyone, but mostly for me,

because although I don't write Shakespearean sonnets, when
I get my groove on I am the shotgun blast,
the unholy streak of lightning in the sky,
the grinning face at your window,
and the stick of dynamite in your ear.

and if Shakespeare were alive today, he wouldn't be writing poems about
poetry,
he'd be out in Hollywood giving rim-jobs to film producers and
script-doctoring Esterhaus,
and I'd be right here,
right where I've always been
still lighting your goddamn
fuse.

VOA: Voice of Authority Colloquium 1.0
Patrick Herron


Dearest POETICS reader,


I love you.  Yes, you.  Only you.

For many of you, subjugating your reader seems an ideal you have been
encouraged to embrace throughout your development as writers.  We are taught
from grade school to do things like adopt the third person in voice, be
fully descriptive/obsessively nominalist, & make the sentences as
un-subjective sounding as possible, thereby giving more authority to your
writing.

Text is one technology to achieve such subjugation in a mass of people.  the
internet is just another.  neither medium, however, NEEDS to remain a tool
for the development of authority/subject relationships.  only relatively
recently in the history of the development of the human brain/mind has it
become possible to move beyond the dominant/submissive mode of language.
Language can and has for a long time functioned as a way to make people to
submit to authority.  but language can also now inform people that language
itself can program them, and language can also be used to have the reader
program the language (metaprogramming), thereby finally turning the tables
on authority (deprogrammation).

One such example:

"But in my formative years, it was hard to find models that moved beyond
objectification. Gay writing, on the other hand, gave me ... techniques for
turning the tables and objectifying men. ...  I saw how erotic writing could
be more than just a description of sexual acts. It could create a new sexual
relationship: the writer as top, the reader as bottom. "

and

"You don't have to do the deed for it to be real. "

 -- Dodie Bellamy, "The Queer Issue," _Village Voice_, June 21-27, 2000

Now Dodie is surely very articulate on sexuality.  I share her general
notion of "whatever it takes to get off."  But I think there is a
fundamental disconnect for her, illustrated in the above quotes, between
issues of subjugation, sexuality, feminism, and writing.  (I think I can
speak of Dodie, since she seems to desire to tie her person into her
writing.)  Perhaps I can dispel her suggestions with two questions:

===

1.  What is feminist about dominating your reader?

2.  How can you be sure that the deed and the tale of the deed are on the
same plane of reality?


===


1.  Why not empower the reader instead by having the reader screw your text?
The author subjugates the reader: this is the same thing the Langpo got up
in arms about; the subjugation of the reader is something for the workshops,
for the newspapers, for that gawdawful Voice Of Authority we are taught from
day one to write in.  In order to be "good" writers.   Etc.  etc.

Allowing the reader to penetrate the text, and not vice-versa, seems to me
to break with the dominance and punishment of masculinity, the nature that
fascinates the masculine with war, suffering, punishment, brutality, death,
that replaces sex with brutality, that replaces reproduction and absorption
and life with murder and dissection and death?  Objectification seems fairly
masculine to me.

This "new" relationship is not new; it is as old as language itself, as old
as the oracles, the god voice, and the humans submit.  The opposite is what
is new: it is only as of relatively late in human history that humans have a
possibility for not submitting to that god-voice nature of language, that
language can be used in modes other than the command mode.

What Dodie seems to support, at least transitively in the above quotes, is
the very functional center of paternal power structures and unlateralized
linguistic centers in the brain. Language can be a portal into a person's
brain; that portal is frequently used to manipulate people like puppets.
But it also can be a portal to deprogram that very possibility of
manipulation, to empower things other than the strength of orders &
linguistic gestures of authority.  Oh, to give the reader the chance to
invent the text as it is read!  Masculinity, division, colonialization and
authority have served humanity well, it could be argued.  (I don't agree
with that, but heck, for argument's sake....)  But they seem now more to lay
waste than to help humanity survive, and it is time for something other than
violence and division in this epoch of man.  Why fuck something when there
can be fucking?

2.  Being sure about the reality either of text, the understanding of the
text, or the act of flesh fucking, seems to me a position only some deity,
some being equipped with metaphysical glasses, can assume.  I am suspect of
anyone with an objective window on reality.  We cannot ever be sure if we
are truly arbiters or witnesses of reality.  Period.  This misconception of
metaphysical insight is but one legacy of god-mind and the slow
lateralization of linguistic functions in the brain.

I have been working for a long time on addressing this very topic.
Appropriately, I am using the internet, that most distal form of human
interaction, that most egregiously dictatorial marketing tool, that most
exalted of high panoptic weapons ever formed, in order to criticize
authority, and to make an illustration of this topic in general.  Yes, a web
site.  But it is no ordinary web site, yet it is.  Heh.  It seems I have to
use the authority-voice in order to get away from authority.  Funny how
contradictory that sounds.

But, criminy, how many of you are even barely curious about the
http://proximate.org site?   I can tell by my other posts on the subject
that almost all of you are either unequipped to deal with this topic of
linguistic domination and aesthetics or you are simply not curious about an
uncommon position for evaluating authority, consciousness, and media.
Perhaps I am failing or just a pedantic dullard.  Or just some dumb kid.
Heh.

C'est la merde.  Ahh, my server logs, plains of dust, such barren fields!

Perhaps I should have gone for that PhD and learned to submit to footnotes
and my place in intellectual civilization (re: underfoot).

It seems so many people were asleep when reading Genet.  How gestures form
power.  Or maybe I was asleep, unwilling to accept how people are
continually fed shit and go back for more.

cut out from the archives:

screams in hebrew and aramaic - loud voices in akkadian and mitannian -
(modified from the akkadian) works of known or conjectured meaning with
sumerian and akkadian words - i note in passing alan, alam = essri, 'form,
statue.' even here the form is abject and wanton, the locus of desire.
think of a particular class, whether or not sumerian, etc. so the same
graphemes may be found within the "biblical" tradition and the presumed
sumerian origins of writing. at the "/e/...)" for example.

city is sumerian uru, perforated by a stick or stylus into clay, the gran-
ularity inherited from the sumerian incision into the body of the woman or
man. it is as if one stood on the shores of a gulf separating shumer from
man and woman, woman or brother. think of lugal, sal, lu, dumu su-ba-ri-
im. these languages erased across the text from which this text derives.

to be born a _foundling_ on a moo or mud, dumuzi's dream, oral poetry, the
protocols stuttered before every written. the tokens signify greek ideas,
without the theory; i think of them as resonances across sumerian, luwian,
palaic, hittite, akkadian, with _me,_ "attribute" in this context, an arid
environ within and without sumer. return to sumerian excisions, the stylus
cutting through the eye of the prisoner all across the region: no one,
ever-vigilent, sees the enemy.

the akkadians and sumerians were bored. the hittites enjoyed themselves in
a dirt-free environment. there were contests: who had the cleanest, most
proper body?

whole populations on the move; everyone gives me texts in unknown scripts;
i struggle with cuneiform incisions; this is how i earn my living. i orig-
inate the contract, drawn on clay, bone, skin, unreadable eyes, severed
genitals, the trampling of ashur.

inanna! women speaking incomprehensible tongues, palawian, sumerian, hit-
tite, works of unknown or conjectured meaning with sumerian and akkadian
words, akkadian burrowings, abject and wanton, loci of desire.

my name is a-bi. from the manifold of perverse sex, borrowing ideograms,
other incisions, trades. you'll find me at sargon square. do i wander in a
desert looking for you, o cuneiform? inanna, is this shumer, akkad? our
names are our incisions. cut deep into us, we become them, exist: do we
wander in a desert of names?

i've seen ghosts in akkad. i've seen ghosts in shumer as well. i've seen
them traveling. i've seen them carrying styli. i've seen them cut deeper
into flesh than the world has rules. desire has swollen ghosts; writing
procures them. burns and cuts leave scars. i look forward to screaming,
burrowing, abject and wanton, in the desert blinded by speech.

Actually, Bly's word of choice was 'heat' -- and all the poems he selected
displayed this mysterious quality which will presumably, as you suggest,
"leap into our subconscious and make us wise."  (This was for the 1999 "Best
American Poetry").

I'll probably be chided for saying so in this venue, but I actually enjoyed
many of the poems Bly chose; they were narrative, communicative, and
humorous (despite his criteria for selection, which could be called 'vacant
holism').

Incidentally, I would've jumped at the chance to take part in your
translation project...but I'm too busy kicking myself for never having
learned Esperanto!

community-based literary magazine, published quarterly on the World Wide
Web and annually in print, and has been in existence since 1973.  Run by a
democratic collective of editors, PBQ's aim has been to support regional

writers from across the country and around the world. The philosophy of the
magazine is not to limit itself in terms of voice, school, or genre; both
local and
national writers in PBQ range from traditional to language school

Nader is turned away at door of debate
By JUSTIN POPE

http://www.salon.com/politics/wire/2000/10/03/nader/index.html


Oct. 04, 2000 | BOSTON (AP) -- Green Party presidential candidate Ralph
Nader, shunned by the presidential debate commission, scored a ticket to
Tuesday night's debate but was turned away at the door.

"It's already been decided that whether or not you have a ticket you are not
welcome in the debate," John Bezeris, a representative of the debate
commission, told Nader. The commission had excluded all but Democratic and
Republican candidates.

"I didn't expect they would be so crude and so stupid," Nader said after
being turned away. "This is the kind of creeping tyranny that has turned
away so many voters from the electoral process."

Nader, who took the subway to the debate site, had received the ticket as a
gift from Todd Tavares, a 21-year-old Northeastern University student who
said he got it from a roommate.

When he arrived at the site of the debate at the University of
Massachusetts-Boston, Bezeris, surrounded by several police officers, told
Nader he could not enter because he was not an invited guest.

Nader was among a trio of third-party candidates who did their best Tuesday
to keep the Republican and Democratic nominees from stealing the show.

Hours before the debate, a judge threw out a court challenge filed earlier
in the day by Massachusetts Libertarians to try to force organizers to
include their candidate, Harry Browne.

"The plaintiffs have slept on their rights by waiting until the last minute
to seek relief," Suffolk Superior Court Judge Gordon Doerfer ruled. He said
intervening in the debates would deprive the public of information it needs
about the candidates.

The lawsuit claimed Browne should be included because Massachusetts, which
officially recognizes the party, spent $900,000 to help pay for the debate.

Nader also criticized the commission's decision to limit the debate to
candidates with more than 15 percent support in national polls. Only the
Democrat, Vice President Al Gore, and the Republican, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, qualified to participate.

"They have the keys. This debate commission is a private company created by
the two parties," Nader told about 1,000 supporters. "The thing is why do we
as a society let them control the gateway? Why don't we have many gateways,
many debates?"

As he concluded his remarks some students chanted "Let Ralph debate! Let
Ralph debate!"

Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, meeting reporters in his Boston hotel,
said it was unfair to keep his party out. He and Nader were appearing
separately on Fox News Channel after the debate.

"I feel like Slippery Rock State Teachers and we made the Final Four of the
NCAAs and they won't even let us in the gymnasium," Buchanan said. "They
won't even let us on the gym floor to show what we can do."

Buchanan, who has more than $12 million in federal campaign funds to spend,
outlined plans to launch an advertising campaign next week in states he says
have been abandoned by Republicans, including California, New Jersey and
most of New England.

He is aiming for 5 percent of the popular vote in the Nov. 7 election to
guarantee that the Reform Party gets federal matching funds again in 2004.
Buchanan said the ads would run mainly on Christian radio stations and would
highlight local concerns, such as immigration in California and Arizona.

Dear Kevin,

Good piece. I like where it takes the discussion. Been thinking about Basil
lately....
Just saw the Monkees HEAD and she did cheorography and was thinking about
how far 1968 seems fromthe early 80s' of "Mickey," (further than 1983 seems
from
now, to me at least) which I became more interested in
once I discovered that Devo was the backing band. I've loved Conner, but have
never been able to see "Breakaway." Will have to hold a "Breakaway" party
perhaps.
Also like your reference to Calpurnia as Lang-Pos (though seems to me the males

were more barren--but then the barenness as fertile, whether intentionally or
no....), and various strategies of seduction. The characterization of Taylor's
Bauderlaire, the sexiness of Ngai's anti-sex (the via negativa, and the layered
(5 dimensional) hilarity of "What was it Burt Bacharach said, ten years from
now? "I've got the wedding bell blues...."
Much more, of course, but a good read. thanks.....

Can be. But the internet is also where many people meet. Some are looking
for sex, some are looking for lovers, friends, husbands and wives. It is
actually a pretty good way to meet people if you share the same literacy or
comparable literacies. In such case, the object may (or may not) still be
sex, but is not necessarily a masturbatory means of disengagement. It may be
a masturbatory means of engagement or a non-masturbatory means of engagement
or the other two permutations also.

You might say that you were speaking not of such aspects of sex on the
internet but of viewing imagery or multimedia. But it is possible for
someone seeking engagement, ultimately, to fantasize about it via imagery or
multimedia or sound or any other stimulus. Some reports I've heard suggest
we tend to think about sex quite a lot, at least once per second, and that
sounds about right to me; we are sexual beings, individuals engaged and
disengaged; sex is not just the wild thang but part of our continual
engagement and disengagement, part of how we think, part of how we are.

I imagine that most sexual orientations find their representations and
correspondents on the net. There is an anonymity possible on the net that is
good for fantasy and, yes, for predators.

Sex on the internet can surely be a masturbatory means of disengagement, as
you say, but I just wanted to point out that, quite interestingly, I think,
it's much wider than that. It is a network not simply of machines but of
people who exchange email (which can be very sexy), chat, voice chat and
video chat, exchange files (who knows of what?), read each other's works,
exchange phone numbers and saliva. Much wider than a bulletin board.

In a sense, the strength of the sexual charge across the wires of the
internet reflects the media/um's strength to convey our humanity, which is
intrinsically sexual. This is great news for artists who seek to internalize
the media/um and do compelling work in it.

Hallo.

flim, a somewhat literary journal, is turning four this month.

In celebration, we're looking for pieces that somehow relate to the number
four, or have four elements, or whatever. Anything with a vague and tenuous
connection to the number four.

Even work without such a connection will be considered.

Please send work along to editor@flim.com

And read flim at http://www.flim.com

Thanks.

Organization
=20 "p0es1s" is curated by Friedrich W. Block in collaboration with Andre
Vallias, and is organized in Kassel by "Stiftung Brueckner-Kuehner" and
"Kunst- & Literaturverein Kassel".


Symposion: "1. Forum <Aesthetics of Digital Literature>"
Linked to the exhibition, the Universities of Kassel and Erfurt are
organizing the "1. Forum <Aesthetics of Digital Literature>" in Kassel. 20
experts from art and science will discuss the possibilities and conditions
of literature in and with the hypermedia (curated by Friedrich W. Block,
Christiane Heibach and Karin Wenz). Info: www.netzaesthetik.de


Work in Progress
"p0es1s" is a dynamic and virtual site of digital poetry. It consists of
exhibitions, discursive offers and recently of a website (www.p0es1s.com).
The website was launched in Munich during the "Schrift und Bild in
Bewegung" festival, spring 2000. In 1992 we (mainly responsible was Andr=E9
Vallias) already showed one of the first exhibitions of digital poetry. The
presentation took place in Annaberg-Buchholz, the residence of
Carlfriedrich Claus, and it was attended by artists like Augusto de Campos,
Eduardo Kac, Richard Kostelanetz, Jim Rosenberg and others - some of them
who are again taking part.

"p0es1s" presents advanced possibilities to expand poetry to the field of
multimedia and the internet: hybrid texts between word, image, and sound,
which can only be electronically produced, stored, distributed, and
received. Symbolic worlds dissolve to electrons, converted into an
impenetrable texture of numbers, connected with currents between input and
output. Appearing as letters, numbers, lines, areas, forms, sounds, the
usual perceivable surfaces always appear as something else: They are
potentially different, temporary, liquid, and flowing. Here, digital poetry
means creative, experimental, playful, or critical verbal and non-verbal
art produced by means of programming, multimedia, animation, interactivity,
and net communication.

"The Mallarme issue is pretty familiar to all of us, but Derrida is a
philosopher, not a poet in the narrow sense. It just makes more sense to me
that Mallarme is Derridian than the other way around, in the way that
Shakespeare was Freudian (according to Jones) and not the other way around."

So wrote Bill Austin.  This is striking to me, because it implies a certain
privilege of theoretical discourse over poetic discourse, the latter
conceived of here as "narrow."  It makes just as much sense to me to reverse
the terms.  Of course Derrida is Mallarmean, just as he is Heideggerian or
Freudian.  It is also obvious, to me, that Freud was more Shakesperian at
least as much as vice-versa.  Is Sophocles Aristotelian?  He seems so if we
read retrospectively, but my inclination would be to call Aristotle
Sophoclean.  Of course, there's no right answer here.  What struck me was
simply how opposite my own perspective is to that of those who privilege
theory (philosophy) over poetry in this way.

In response to Jim Andrews:

et can be a means to more fleshy encounters, true, but as an end in itself
it is onanistic, disengaging, isolating.  when on the internet you are
alone.  if you are alone in a room and you call a friend, are you not still
alone?  you might no longer be lonely, but you're still alone.

also people have this naive dream of the internet, as some means for
freedom.  well, a news quiz for you?
what organization started the internet?  what were the purposes of the new
means of communications?
how many creations of the above organization reach the public sphere?
how much of the current internet is about selling/marketing?  how much of
the web was it 5 years ago?
how much of the current internet is surveilled?
how many organizations compete for control of the addressing system of the
WWW?

how is such a surveilled environment of communications.

sex is great, don't get me wrong.  masturbation is great too.  and i'm all
for fantasy.  but people can suffer from not having any human touch from
others, and i'm seeing it with people frequently on the internet.  so many
addicts.  this loss of human contact, of the physical presence of others, is
a clear cost of the internet.  the technology's insistence on
individuation/divide and conquer can easily leave us lonely, unorganized,
exploitable.

the cost of the internet is that people begin to make love to machines, not
other people.  but then again, i'm a kook who believes in orgonomy.  silly
me.

all media blocks communication.  air, voice, print, text, paint, internet,
whatever.  and each one seems to block more information than the last.
touch is as close as we get to whatever it is that's being shared.  heck, we
cannot even know what of the original message remains form the start.
instead we are burdened to create things that the message recipient is
compelled to reinvent.

people should be wary of the pitfalls of anything.  i am just so amazed that
people do not know the price of the internet.  everything comes at a price,
and yet so many internet people seem to have some sort of religious zeal
about the whole thing, about how it is all good and no bad.  as if it were
some purely democratic creation, when in fact it is the child of advanced
defense research projects.  my point is to alert people to these pitfalls.

no one saying the internet is pure evil.  but it does have its price.  who
said sex without love is really good exercise?  perhaps it's affection I am
speaking about; I am reminded of Jacques' quote yesterday.  Besides, in my
experience sex without affection has never had quite the same charging
affect on me as sex with affection.  the internet does not seem to be able
to create that charge and it at best extremely poor at carrying that very
spark across any wire.  it seems no media except flesh can transfer that
effectively.

I use the internet in all of those means you describe, Jim.  As a means of
document and information exchange it is wonderful.  But the internet started
only partially as that, a means of information exchange, and it becomes more
and more a means of information capture.  Of a means for separating people
form each other, from their money.   It's panoptic.

I also agree it's a great place to meet people with similar interests.  Just
wishing that people be wary of the costs for society as well as the
benefits.

but then, maybe society is already pretty individuated to such a rotten
extreme that the sexual signals across the internet seem unrivalled for
many.  I just think the internet is but one of many means of engagement and
communication.  text.  film.   voice and paralinguistic gesture.  touch.
some means have signals that are more enriched and require more direct human
space-sharing than others.

i am all into art, web art, music, writing, photography, film.  there is a
cost to any art, to any medium, including the internet.  it IS a means of
onanistic individuation.

thank you jim for your thoughtful response.

Can be. But the internet is also where many people meet. Some are looking
for sex, some are looking for lovers, friends, husbands and wives. It is
actually a pretty good way to meet people if you share the same literacy or
comparable literacies. In such case, the object may (or may not) still be
sex, but is not necessarily a masturbatory means of disengagement. It may be
a masturbatory means of engagement or a non-masturbatory means of engagement
or the other two permutations also.

You might say that you were speaking not of such aspects of sex on the
internet but of viewing imagery or multimedia. But it is possible for
someone seeking engagement, ultimately, to fantasize about it via imagery or
multimedia or sound or any other stimulus. Some reports I've heard suggest
we tend to think about sex quite a lot, at least once per second, and that
sounds about right to me; we are sexual beings, individuals engaged and
disengaged; sex is not just the wild thang but part of our continual
engagement and disengagement, part of how we think, part of how we are.

I imagine that most sexual orientations find their representations and
correspondents on the net. There is an anonymity possible on the net that is
good for fantasy and, yes, for predators.

Sex on the internet can surely be a masturbatory means of disengagement, as
you say, but I just wanted to point out that, quite interestingly, I think,
it's much wider than that. It is a network not simply of machines but of
people who exchange email (which can be very sexy), chat, voice chat and
video chat, exchange files (who knows of what?), read each other's works,
exchange phone numbers and saliva. Much wider than a bulletin board.

In a sense, the strength of the sexual charge across the wires of the
internet reflects the media/um's strength to convey our humanity, which is
intrinsically sexual. This is great news for artists who seek to internalize
the media/um and do compelling work in it.

Jim Andrews

i too confess
i find this sort of intercourse
less than enlightening
neither
The Kinsey Report
nor
The Joy of Sex
leave me w/ much of a taste to
fuck

This sort of thing
doesn't make me want
to write
seems harmless enough tho
keeps the theorists busy
so they don't do anything truly
DANGEROUS
like writing poetry
or falling in love

it seems the french
food leads to a kind
of anemia of sense

easier to speak of
"constructed social energies"
than

Hi all, Very happy to be reading the big Body Sex Writing deal and agree
with Rachel L. that the narrativity site is a great place to go for further
material. I hope along with Chris A. that this gets conversations rolling,
both on and off the list. Been way too busy with new work to speak here much
lately (& perhaps all are thrilled by that), but did want to publicly thank
Dodie and Chris for getting this important ball (!) rolling.

And Jacques, if you want a warm hug, we all know by now this list ain't the
spot.

Sending you one anyhoo, ETJ

Look, Richard, I teach at an art school.  I encounter lazy inarticulate
uninformed people all the time.  People with chutzpah like yours.  I try to
be kind to them.  So I will try to be kind to you.  You are funny.

>George. This was an interesting post. Ii've written something longer re this. But, briefly, I concurr overall. But I think you should expand on your claim the poetry and metalanguage are entirely different. I think, from what you have said that there are regions of intersection of metalinguistics to Linguistics hence as poetry to language, then poetry to metalanguage. Somehow this could be put into some kind of syllogistic argument. (Only to be brilliantly refuted by a 20 year old Philosophy Phd!) Thanks for your interesting post.

VOA: Voice of Authority Colloquium 1.0
Patrick Herron


Dearest POETICS reader,


I love you.  Yes, you.  Only you.

For many of you, subjugating your reader seems an ideal you have been
encouraged to embrace throughout your development as writers.  We are taught
from grade school to do things like adopt the third person in voice, be
fully descriptive/obsessively nominalist, & make the sentences as
un-subjective sounding as possible, thereby giving more authority to your
writing.

Text is one technology to achieve such subjugation in a mass of people.  the
internet is just another.  neither medium, however, NEEDS to remain a tool
for the development of authority/subject relationships.  only relatively
recently in the history of the development of the human brain/mind has it
become possible to move beyond the dominant/submissive mode of language.
Language can and has for a long time functioned as a way to make people to
submit to authority.  but language can also now inform people that language
itself can program them, and language can also be used to have the reader
program the language (metaprogramming), thereby finally turning the tables
on authority (deprogrammation).

One such example:

"But in my formative years, it was hard to find models that moved beyond
objectification. Gay writing, on the other hand, gave me ... techniques for
turning the tables and objectifying men. ...  I saw how erotic writing could
be more than just a description of sexual acts. It could create a new sexual
relationship: the writer as top, the reader as bottom. "

and

"You don't have to do the deed for it to be real. "

 -- Dodie Bellamy, "The Queer Issue," _Village Voice_, June 21-27, 2000

Now Dodie is surely very articulate on sexuality.  I share her general
notion of "whatever it takes to get off."  But I think there is a
fundamental disconnect for her, illustrated in the above quotes, between
issues of subjugation, sexuality, feminism, and writing.  (I think I can
speak of Dodie, since she seems to desire to tie her person into her
writing.)  Perhaps I can dispel her suggestions with two questions:

===

1.  What is feminist about dominating your reader?

2.  How can you be sure that the deed and the tale of the deed are on the
same plane of reality?


===


1.  Why not empower the reader instead by having the reader screw your text?
The author subjugates the reader: this is the same thing the Langpo got up
in arms about; the subjugation of the reader is something for the workshops,
for the newspapers, for that gawdawful Voice Of Authority we are taught from
day one to write in.  In order to be "good" writers.   Etc.  etc.

Allowing the reader to penetrate the text, and not vice-versa, seems to me
to break with the dominance and punishment of masculinity, the nature that
fascinates the masculine with war, suffering, punishment, brutality, death,
that replaces sex with brutality, that replaces reproduction and absorption
and life with murder and dissection and death?  Objectification seems fairly
masculine to me.

This "new" relationship is not new; it is as old as language itself, as old
as the oracles, the god voice, and the humans submit.  The opposite is what
is new: it is only as of relatively late in human history that humans have a
possibility for not submitting to that god-voice nature of language, that
language can be used in modes other than the command mode.

What Dodie seems to support, at least transitively in the above quotes, is
the very functional center of paternal power structures and unlateralized
linguistic centers in the brain. Language can be a portal into a person's
brain; that portal is frequently used to manipulate people like puppets.
But it also can be a portal to deprogram that very possibility of
manipulation, to empower things other than the strength of orders &
linguistic gestures of authority.  Oh, to give the reader the chance to
invent the text as it is read!  Masculinity, division, colonialization and
authority have served humanity well, it could be argued.  (I don't agree
with that, but heck, for argument's sake....)  But they seem now more to lay
waste than to help humanity survive, and it is time for something other than
violence and division in this epoch of man.  Why fuck something when there
can be fucking?

2.  Being sure about the reality either of text, the understanding of the
text, or the act of flesh fucking, seems to me a position only some deity,
some being equipped with metaphysical glasses, can assume.  I am suspect of
anyone with an objective window on reality.  We cannot ever be sure if we
are truly arbiters or witnesses of reality.  Period.  This misconception of
metaphysical insight is but one legacy of god-mind and the slow
lateralization of linguistic functions in the brain.

I have been working for a long time on addressing this very topic.
Appropriately, I am using the internet, that most distal form of human
interaction, that most egregiously dictatorial marketing tool, that most
exalted of high panoptic weapons ever formed, in order to criticize
authority, and to make an illustration of this topic in general.  Yes, a web
site.  But it is no ordinary web site, yet it is.  Heh.  It seems I have to
use the authority-voice in order to get away from authority.  Funny how
contradictory that sounds.

But, criminy, how many of you are even barely curious about the
http://proximate.org site?   I can tell by my other posts on the subject
that almost all of you are either unequipped to deal with this topic of
linguistic domination and aesthetics or you are simply not curious about an
uncommon position for evaluating authority, consciousness, and media.
Perhaps I am failing or just a pedantic dullard.  Or just some dumb kid.
Heh.

C'est la merde.  Ahh, my server logs, plains of dust, such barren fields!

Perhaps I should have gone for that PhD and learned to submit to footnotes
and my place in intellectual civilization (re: underfoot).

It seems so many people were asleep when reading Genet.  How gestures form
power.  Or maybe I was asleep, unwilling to accept how people are
continually fed shit and go back for more.

Forgive me, but I was discussing Jakobson's ideas in the context of what J
actually said, and he has said a lot, about this distinction.  He was
contrasting two different modes of thinking, that is, modes of relating
things.  Recall some of the other distinctions that J made about these modes:

paradigmatic relations, which are vertical,     vs
syntagmatic relations, which are horizontal

As far as I can see, this also has been a productive distinction, the first
operating on the basis of relation of substitution [what J called selection];
the second operating on the basis of a relation of combination.  I don't have
the time, and many of you don't need to hear it, but I think that I could
make a case for this being a productive set of distinctions.

Likewise, when J applies this set to an analysis of types of aphasia, again
at least for me the analysis is illuminating, instructive -- that is,
productive.

I don't understand the problem that you and Jonathan Mayhew have with the
cigarette in the ash tray as a metonym for the thug.  Wouldn't you admit that
the cigarette takes on significance because of the fact that the thug's lips
have left their lip-marks on it?  Metonymy is not a simple matter of random
association.  No, it is a matter of charged, meaningful association.  Read my
earlier post.  I acknowledge that there is something metaphorical going on
there too [as did Kasey Mohammad, by the way].

For you, J seems to have stretched the term 'metonymy' so far as to make it
meaningless.  But he hasn't stretched it quite that far. He didn't intend to
imply that if it is not a metaphor it must be a metonym -- nor did I.  He was
contrasting two different modes of thought.  If you want to throw away J's
sense of the term because it offends your understaning of the traditional
term, go ahead.  But I think that you lose more than you gain by doing so.

A few days ago, Jonathan offlist recommended an alternative to 'metonymy.'
He offered up the term 'index' instead.  Well, that too has been a productive
term, and like Jonathan I use it.  But what have we gained?  How much of an
improvement on J's binary distinction is Peirce's triad of the index, the
icon, the symbol?

Someone earlier mentioned Lakoff on metaphor.  Well, speak about
reductionism.  For him it is all metaphor.  I for one have found his model
very productive, so much so that I am prepared to upgrade my old model.  No,
I am not fixated on J.  But I'm not inclined to abandon his take on metonymy
until something better comes along.  If you want to show me something better,
please do.  Follow Pound then: make it new.  I'm prepared to listen.

So I'll stop talking. I'll listen.

Best,

George Thompson

So wrote Bill Austin.  This is striking to me, because it implies a certain
privilege of theoretical discourse over poetic discourse, the latter
conceived of here as "narrow."  It makes just as much sense to me to reverse
the terms.  Of course Derrida is Mallarmean, just as he is Heideggerian or
Freudian.  It is also obvious, to me, that Freud was more Shakesperian at
least as much as vice-versa.  Is Sophocles Aristotelian?  He seems so if we
read retrospectively, but my inclination would be to call Aristotle
Sophoclean.  Of course, there's no right answer here.  What struck me was
simply how opposite my own perspective is to that of those who privilege
theory (philosophy) over poetry in this way.

 >>

There is always a privileging, obvious or concealed, written into the
language--it's unavoidable.  In any sentence the predicate appropriates a
privilege the other grammatical elements do not, for example.  Ernest Jones
considered Shakespeare Freudian because in his analysis of Hamlet he read a
mother/father/son dynamic that Freud fleshed out in clinical terms.  Certain
concepts became identified with Freud since he exposed them, and
retroactively they shed light not only on Shakespeare's genius, but also on
Sophocles'.  Freud once said that "The poets discovered the subconscious."
As to privileging "theory over poetry in this way," does it make equal sense
to you to say that Freud was Mallarmean?  It's true that all privileges both
adhere and collapse upon close inspection--that's a crucial Derridean point.
And the process of intertextuality does demonstrate that every text is
contingent upon the others across temporal boundaries.  But we do need to
limit, to accept a provisional center, in order to discuss and achieve
conclusions (Derrida).  So when discussing the philosophical paths taken by
most of the great poets, it still makes more sense to me to privilege
philosophers "in that way" and on that subject.  When and if we discover and
discuss a philosopher's poetry, it will of course make more sense to reverse
the polarities.  This of course is what is meant by "poet in the narrow
sense," i.e., those who write poetry as opposed to those who write
philosophy.  In the wider sense it has been said that Derrida's texts are
poetic.  Similar descriptions have adhered to Freud's texts, and I've heard
more than a few scholars refer to Quantum Theory as poetry.  But I am
certainly for limiting terms so that sensible discussions may proceed.
Otherwise everything is everything, which in one sense (Derrida's as well as
others') is accurate.  But it tends to erase distinctions that do, from
another point of view, obtain.  Consider that the Quantum theorists are
telling us the same thing.  At the subatomic level, particles are waves and
waves are particles--depends on the point of view, the questions posed, the
information sought by a particular investigation/experiment.  If information
is the goal, if knowledge is the goal, then the Quantum guys tell us we have
to make choices.  If we want to measure a certain event, we must treat
subatomic events as either particles or waves, but not both simultaneously.
If we want to measure Mallarme's and Derrida's poetry, then Mallarme becomes
dominant.  But if we desire to measure their philosophical postionings, then
Derrida and/or other philosophers are dominant.  So I say again, when
comparing poets to philosophers on philosophical issues, it makes more sense
to me to privilege the philosophers since they are on their home ground and
the poets usually aren't.  So Mallarme is Derridean on those grounds and less
so the other way around.  In my view, anyone who wants to give poets equal
status with philosophers in the arena of philosophy has granted poets a
privilege way out of proportion to what they do, to their particular
expertise.  That's all I'm saying, which still seems like common sense to me.

By the way, "Derrida is a philosopher, not a poet in the narrow sense" does
NOT conceive all poetic discourse as narrow.  How anyone could read it that
way is beyond me.  Once again a part of a sentence is being lifted out of
context.  What the complete sentence says, according to basic grammatical and
lexical structures, is that Derrida is not a poet if we define "poet" in the
narrow sense.  What it clearly implies is that Derrida may be considered a
poet if "poet" is not narrowly defined, and the possibility of a wider
definition is implied in my sentence--hell, it's right out there in neon!!
Sheesh!  Best, Bill

In response to Jim Andrews:

et can be a means to more fleshy encounters, true, but as an end in itself
it is onanistic, disengaging, isolating.  when on the internet you are
alone.  if you are alone in a room and you call a friend, are you not still
alone?  you might no longer be lonely, but you're still alone.

also people have this naive dream of the internet, as some means for
freedom.  well, a news quiz for you?
what organization started the internet?  what were the purposes of the new
means of communications?
how many creations of the above organization reach the public sphere?
how much of the current internet is about selling/marketing?  how much of
the web was it 5 years ago?
how much of the current internet is surveilled?
how many organizations compete for control of the addressing system of the
WWW?

how is such a surveilled environment of communications.

sex is great, don't get me wrong.  masturbation is great too.  and i'm all
for fantasy.  but people can suffer from not having any human touch from
others, and i'm seeing it with people frequently on the internet.  so many
addicts.  this loss of human contact, of the physical presence of others, is
a clear cost of the internet.  the technology's insistence on
individuation/divide and conquer can easily leave us lonely, unorganized,
exploitable.

the cost of the internet is that people begin to make love to machines, not
other people.  but then again, i'm a kook who believes in orgonomy.  silly
me.

all media blocks communication.  air, voice, print, text, paint, internet,
whatever.  and each one seems to block more information than the last.
touch is as close as we get to whatever it is that's being shared.  heck, we
cannot even know what of the original message remains form the start.
instead we are burdened to create things that the message recipient is
compelled to reinvent.

people should be wary of the pitfalls of anything.  i am just so amazed that
people do not know the price of the internet.  everything comes at a price,
and yet so many internet people seem to have some sort of religious zeal
about the whole thing, about how it is all good and no bad.  as if it were
some purely democratic creation, when in fact it is the child of advanced
defense research projects.  my point is to alert people to these pitfalls.

no one saying the internet is pure evil.  but it does have its price.  who
said sex without love is really good exercise?  perhaps it's affection I am
speaking about; I am reminded of Jacques' quote yesterday.  Besides, in my
experience sex without affection has never had quite the same charging
affect on me as sex with affection.  the internet does not seem to be able
to create that charge and it at best extremely poor at carrying that very
spark across any wire.  it seems no media except flesh can transfer that
effectively.

I use the internet in all of those means you describe, Jim.  As a means of
document and information exchange it is wonderful.  But the internet started
only partially as that, a means of information exchange, and it becomes more
and more a means of information capture.  Of a means for separating people
form each other, from their money.   It's panoptic.

I also agree it's a great place to meet people with similar interests.  Just
wishing that people be wary of the costs for society as well as the
benefits.

but then, maybe society is already pretty individuated to such a rotten
extreme that the sexual signals across the internet seem unrivalled for
many.  I just think the internet is but one of many means of engagement and
communication.  text.  film.   voice and paralinguistic gesture.  touch.
some means have signals that are more enriched and require more direct human
space-sharing than others.

i am all into art, web art, music, writing, photography, film.  there is a
cost to any art, to any medium, including the internet.  it IS a means of
onanistic individuation.

thank you jim for your thoughtful response.

Can be. But the internet is also where many people meet. Some are looking
for sex, some are looking for lovers, friends, husbands and wives. It is
actually a pretty good way to meet people if you share the same literacy or
comparable literacies. In such case, the object may (or may not) still be
sex, but is not necessarily a masturbatory means of disengagement. It may be
a masturbatory means of engagement or a non-masturbatory means of engagement
or the other two permutations also.

You might say that you were speaking not of such aspects of sex on the
internet but of viewing imagery or multimedia. But it is possible for
someone seeking engagement, ultimately, to fantasize about it via imagery or
multimedia or sound or any other stimulus. Some reports I've heard suggest
we tend to think about sex quite a lot, at least once per second, and that
sounds about right to me; we are sexual beings, individuals engaged and
disengaged; sex is not just the wild thang but part of our continual
engagement and disengagement, part of how we think, part of how we are.

I imagine that most sexual orientations find their representations and
correspondents on the net. There is an anonymity possible on the net that is
good for fantasy and, yes, for predators.

Sex on the internet can surely be a masturbatory means of disengagement, as
you say, but I just wanted to point out that, quite interestingly, I think,
it's much wider than that. It is a network not simply of machines but of
people who exchange email (which can be very sexy), chat, voice chat and
video chat, exchange files (who knows of what?), read each other's works,
exchange phone numbers and saliva. Much wider than a bulletin board.

In a sense, the strength of the sexual charge across the wires of the
internet reflects the media/um's strength to convey our humanity, which is
intrinsically sexual. This is great news for artists who seek to internalize
the media/um and do compelling work in it.

"Class is responsible for sexism," says Marx;
however, according to Brophy, it is not so much
class that is responsible for sexism, but rather
the failure, and thus the meaninglessness, of
class. But if capitalism holds, we have to choose
between semanticist socialism and prematerial
textual theory. If one examines neodialectic
nihilism, one is faced with a choice: either
accept capitalism or conclude that concensus is a
product of communication. The subject is
contextualised into a cultural desemioticism that
includes truth as a totality. However, the
characteristic theme of the works of Pynchon is a
self-fulfilling paradox. In the works of Pynchon,
a predominant concept is the distinction between
closing and opening. Capitalism holds that
culture is part of the failure of language. It
could be
said that d'Erlette suggests that we have to
choose between subcapitalist nationalism and
dialectic appropriation. The main theme of
Parry's analysis of dialectic nationalism is the
bridge between society and sexual identity.
Foucault suggests the use of capitalism to
challenge class divisions. However, Sontag uses
the term 'posttextual dialectic theory' to denote
not, in fact, theory, but subtheory. If
capitalism holds, we have to choose between the
neotextual paradigm of concensus and
deconstructivist precapitalist theory. Thus,
Sartre promotes the use of semanticist socialism
to deconstruct and analyse society. Several
narratives concerning capitalism exist. It could
be said that Marx uses the term 'dialectic
nationalism' to denote the role of the reader as
observer. The subject is
interpolated into a semanticist socialism that
includes truth as a whole. Therefore, Lyotard
suggests the use of dialectic nationalism to
challenge hierarchy. An abundance of discourses
concerning the difference between class and
sexuality may be discovered. In a sense, Derrida
promotes the use of capitalism to read class.
A number of narratives concerning dialectic
nationalism exist. It could be said that
d'Erlette implies that we have to choo se between
capitalism and the patriarchial paradigm of
narrative. Any number of theories concerning the
fatal flaw, and eventually the futility, of
neocapitalist society may be revealed. However,
the subject is contextualised into a
dialectic nationalism that includes art as a
paradox. Dialectic discourse and subcultural
dialectic theory. "Sexual identity is used in the
service of capitalism," says Foucault; however,
according to Tilton, it is not so much sexual
identity that is used in the service of
capitalism, but rather the stasis, and subsequent
paradigm, of sexual identity. The primary theme
of the works of Eco is the common ground between
class and sexual identity. It could be said that
the futility, and eventually the fatal flaw, of
subcultural dialectic theory prevalent in Eco's
Foucault's Pendulum is also evident in The
Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas, although in a more
mythopoetical sense. Marx's essay on Lacanist
obscurity holds that the Constitution is capable
of truth. Thus, Bataille uses the term 'dialectic
nationalism' to denote a dialectic whole. Many
dematerialisms concerning subcultural dialectic
theory exist. However, the main theme of
Cameron's model of capitalist discourse is the
futility, and therefore the absurdity, of
neotextual society.

Of course, I could be wrong and invite List input
on the matter.

=20
 We had thought, at least in first wise, to whistle instances, that =
coming down to the Valley until our darkness might explode like a =
witch's oval berry.But, by association, The Towers (who had been quietly =
cognisant if not sadly observant), stood with great and sudden suddenty =
to attention (they) who have e'en now (just nary) some forty aeons for =
maybe a Tom thumb or a jumping jack to crack, Jack. Crack! There is and =
was a tremendous commotion as of an enactment to some purpose yet shares =
remain steady and el Presidente displayed his dentals. Much have I =
travelled. But I turned off at Kopakopa into Huketai to examine a =
thistle-patch, or a magpie, a tui, or even a cow, and an abandoned =
tractor fossil.
 You joined me and it was then I came upon us. Who were we, you =
eternally asked? They meantime were vanished into clumps and (quite =
probably) had merged with the stainless steel land,which as you well =
know, is as beautiful as a real advert, and gave off the tinkle sounds =
of melting snow. The microphones, who had been (generously I must say) =
ear lending,had booked in to rent a conclusion. Just then they bent =
further in. This circumstance made further calls on us (poor defeated =
souls) as great ungulphable gulphs of (in)comprehension burnt deep into =
Jeff Koon's beautiful ceramic of Michael Jackson, for instance.
  The Porn began. The Thorn began. And the Horn began.Not Rebecca, but =
we'd lost Blake's number,and the derivations, and the thick, and the =
trick, and the tick of it.
 Today, much replenished and replete, I sit at my broad dark old  oak =
desk. And it goes thus hard with me, that, in a sort of systemantic =
frenzied and  syncopated reticulated and revivified repetio I spin in =
tasks, despite my petrol migraine. In such a wise I am to be seen ( a =
lonely, nay, pathetic) figure: automating my signal jerk function. Thus =
I  arise, reach forward, grasp, and take item x from shelf b, retract it =
with great solicitude to my desk (where the brassy lamplight delineates =
it to its greatest advantage), where (with great care and concision) I =
compare it to item c. Then I reach forward and... This process repeats =
in shittering (yet strangely static) frames. And at the attainment of =
each mid bloob cycle of this endless process (by which the being who is =
thus stooped is deeply occupied) he stops, shifts, and reconsiders. A =
Face peers round the corner of the door jamb to watch him.
  Look at him. Somebody should  take him away. Madness, joy, freedom, =
and the burning rainbow beckon.

Subject:      What Jakobson got wrong about metalanguage, Part II
Comments: cc: GthomGt@cs.com, jmayhew@eagle.cc.ukans.edu
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Let's look further at J's explanations of metalanguage in the 'ordinary
linguistic' or informal sense (henceforth ML-inf), i.e. 'language about
language'.  Someone with no interest in the technicalities that I
labored to explain a bit in my last post might walk away with the
mistaken impression that even though J has clearly not thought very hard
about the original meaning of the term ML in logical (or even technical
linguistic) discourse, that's irrelevant in light of his 'brilliant'
insights into the way ML-inf functions in everyday talk or in
literature.

I hardly find it impressive in itself that one of the best-known
linguists of the last century, who managed always to be in the right
place in the right time rubbing shoulders with all the right people, at
least as far as structuralism was concerned, was able to _understand_
the banal truism: The term metalanguage may be understood as language
about language, and in that sense we use it all the time, even as
children.  One hopes his command of the ‘code’ reached at least that
far. I doubt also that he was the first person to notice this (I have a
feeling that some Stoics and medievals at least, not to mention George’s
Sanskrit grammarians, beat him to the punch here).  So what brilliant
explanatory or theoretical insights does he go on to offer?

I have already indicated three of his main theses (about ML-inf, if not
ML):
(1) It’s a matter of statements of equality, i.e. equations or
identities, involving the introduction of substitutable expressions.
(2) It’s fundamentally semantic, a matter of glossing or paraphrasing
the meaning of expressions.
(3) It’s really ‘language about the "code"’.

 With regard to (1) and (2), the same considerations that I mentioned
before about the _syntactic_ character of many metalinguistic usages
apply to our ML-inf usages:

The statement ‘You say "a brown pony" but not "a pony brown" in correct
English’ is ML-inf.  Notice that it makes _no_ statement of equality or
substitutability, and performs no paraphrase or glossing.  It serves
only to allow or exclude certain grammatical forms, rather like the ML
statement ‘if A is well-formed, so is ~A’ of propositional logic.  So
(1) and (2) fail here.

The statement "But you said you were coming" (quite common among
children), which might be construed as oratio obliqua, is also ML-inf.
Note that again there is no declaration of equality or paraphrase here.
It does _not_ say something like ‘The words "…" that you previously used
may be glossed in our "code" as "I’m going to come"’. So (1) and (2)
fail here too.

So (1) and (2) account _at best_ for only a very limited subset of our
actual ML-inf.  (2) could be further questioned, but I haven’t got the
time now.

And (3) only has force (possibly) if we have a non-trivial account of
what the (or a) ‘code’ of our language might be.  Can examples of the
‘code’ of English be produced, or it simply a posited ‘transcendental’,
like phlogiston?  Is an inventory of the Saussurian ‘signs’ in my head
now (for Saussure’s signs are all in the head) the ‘code’?  Is the OED
the ‘code’?  Is a grammar book the ‘code’?  Is an account of linguistic
pragmatics the ‘code’?  A book of generative or transformational
grammar?  All of the above?  Can the ‘code’ be written down in ML-inf?
What a useful term, code.  (About as useful as the term ‘metonymy’.)

So where’s all the brilliance and insight here?  There is a widespread
myth of J’s ‘rigour’ and near-infallible breadth of technical,
theoretical knowledge among poets and critics.  I think I have said
enough to undermine that myth, though there’s a lot more that could be
said. I found a quote from Ilya Ehrenburg about J on the Web: "What
struck me was that he knew everything… Occasionally he made things up,
but when anyone tried to catch him out in an inaccuracy, he replied with
a grin: ‘That was just a working hypothesis of mine’."

I'm sitting here at this bar watching the Giants take the Mets into extra
innings, my body twisting through various emotions and already making eye
contact with the androgynous brunette at the bar, who's now having a heated
discussion with her boyfriend, at first (I fantasize) about me, my immediate
sexual impact on the scene.

But the Giants have already given up a run in the top of the 10th and are
now batting, and I'm nervous and "sitting on the edge of my seat," in this
case a stool set up at a high wood table.

Nobody here gives a damn about the game. Older cronies in overalls at the
bar arguing about the finer points of a discussion long since obscured,
pointing fingers and slapping high fives, a blonde woman and two men
shooting pool (badly), cigarette cocked behind ear now going outside to
smoke (and the Giants have lost now, Barry Bonds looking at strike 3 in the
bottom of the 10th a questionable curve that hooked in just at the letters).

An unbelievable, up-and-down game, I can practically feel my seratonin
levels sagging back down as the urge to smash something slowly subsides into
the dull throb of disappointment.

Thinking about the Colloquium on Dodie Bellamy's Body/Sex/Writing and
Taylor's part-writing partially successful attempt to hijack the discussion
onto his train which takes him both literally and figuratively into his "job
as a writer." And how well he expresses the frustration of gender as limited
and defined by language, "I have these two bodies," at once calling into
play the notion of possession and dichotomy, the latter of which strikes me
as the more pressing concern...

To that end I'd like to consciously bring in the crowd as body, without
which no understanding of the personal sexual "written" body can be
complete. Bellamy's workshop, Taylor's (and moreso Hofer's and Killian's)
train, even Gluck's orgy scene stage the crowd in various configurations,
either as witness to or active participant in the personal but divided body
(Killian's Straphanger, jostling and getting jostled and feeling its way
outwards through the proximity of other bodies).

Hofer points out that eye contact is a forbidden intimacy when pressed in so
closely with others, the denial of same being the last barrier between the
last shred of personal self left and the deluge of flesh that surrounds it.
But even without the feel of a half-hard cock on one's ass or thigh, all
such contact suggests the sexual, as the crowd in a Mexico City metro moves
in one body bucking and swaying as if copulating.

I have written numerous poems on buses or trains, making or trying to make
the almost supersensory observations as violations, silent confrontations,
sexual connections, acquiescences and tragedies play themselves out in a
matter of seconds between bodies ordinarily (one would imagine) too timid to
loosen the various parts of themselves to experience such flashes of union.
Very much in the manner of a "Baudelairian moment," but also with a twist of
the "Straphanger" thrown in for the sake of losing the annoying baggage of
self. Taylor writes of the crowd within himself, the various particles,
organs, fluids circulating and exchanging, but what of the actual crowd,
represented by the passengers on a train (or audience, or participants in an
orgy), without which the titillation, discomfort, and a good portion of
one's own awareness of body as a sexual force would hardly be possible?

Perhaps such gatherings are among our few opportunities to experience the
seductive power of the crowd in its most primitive form, the primal crowd of
the types Canetti surveys in his Crowds and Power. If it's true that the
natural impetus of the excited or angry crowd is to explode outwards,
breaking windows as it goes not only for the satisfying sound of shattering
glass but as a symbolic attempt to shatter all barriers between inside and
out, between crowd and not-crowd, between singular self and others within
the crowd, perhaps such jostling on the train is a similar attempt, with the
eyes being the last window that remains to be broken.

This colloquium, this poetics list, is a crowd of poets. And each poet
gathers a crowd of words.

Is it too simple and romantic to make the leap into a sort of polysexuality
in which questions of gender become moot where it concerns the
identity-obliterating qualities of the crowd? As I wait with 40,000
screaming Giants fans for Barry Bonds to take the hanging curve that will
end the game, I'm annoyed that those around me in the bar seem oblivious,
separate, not taking part in the drama. Bellamy "stiffens" at her reading as
if to say "this is not a body," denying that body to the crowd that would
see all the way down to the frayed elastic on her panties. Later at a party
she does not feel part of the crowd because she's overdressed, just as Tom
Cruise at the orgy in Eyes Wide Shut is overdressed and will not take his
clothes off, will not submit to the will of the crowd, which desires his
flesh as a precursor to "losing him" completely in the orgy.  Hofer tries
not to have a body while riding on her crowded train, yet her language
reveals that she is extremely aware of the touch of bodies around her,
"feeling flayed..." her "ass touching asses and hips and purses instead of
half-hard cocks..." and it is only while she's able to sit down alone that
she feels comfortable in her body, but this ironically seems to mean that
she's not feeling her body as body at all.

Only the Straphangers on Killian's train (and from my experience they even
have female-only cars in Mexico City trains to alleviate such pressure) buck
and sway and willingly feel their personal barriers slipping away. Even the
filthy ass on Taylor's train belongs to either gender, triggering as it does
such a richness of detail and taking him back to pre-adolescent afternoons
when there wasn't much difference between the shapes of male and female
asses, grimy or no.

Which begins to point out the danger of assuming a gender at all, as at any
given moment one might be male or female, hetero or homo, the one doing the
rubbing or the one rubbed against, watching ass or feeling someone watching
one's ass. To "experience the crowd as a smorgasbord of delight" as Killian
would do, "always the maximum frission of contact, friction, pleasure," is
to "practice a body" that is no body at all, or every body all at once, with
no separation between.

To bring this back to the subject of writing seems to invite references and
ghosts that are most unfashionable these days, such as Keats and Whitman,
and I confess I haven't read most of the texts to which Bellamy, Brady, and
Hofer refer... I believe I've stated a position already that falls somewhere
between the straphanger and the baudelairian moment of address, but to
articulate that further into how it translates in my own poetics is murky
and somewhat dangerous territory indeed.

There are all kinds of crowds. And these days, especially in San Francisco
(as I would imagine the case to be as well in New York or Mex City) there is
an urge to resist the crowd, go against the crowd, shut the crowd out and
get a moment's peace. The authorities have been using the deeply ingrained
fear of the violent crowd to their advantage in recent crackdowns in
Seattle, Washington, Philly and L.A., infiltrating or allowing fringe
elements to stand as examples of what could happen if the crowd is allowed
to get "out of control." As a writer, I think it's not only necessary to
feel oneself spreading into the crowd, but to let the crowd inside from time
to time as well, and alternately assume or discard roles as masculine or
feminine that shift as quickly as the bodies on a train.

Hi All, Just home from a great reading by Cole Swenson and Kathleen Fraser
at Jill Stengel's BlueBar/a+bend press series in San Francisco. Kathleen's
reading of her "AD Notebooks" was incredibly moving and rigorous. I was sad
to hear the official announcement that the last reading in this series is
next month (Martha Ronk & Patricia Dienstfrey), though happy for Jill
because it is for happy personal reasons that she must end the series. It's
been really a great one, with two new beautiful chapbooks & two readers
every 2nd Sunday at a swank jazz bar in North Beach. I don't know how Jill
does it and am eager to see what she does next. There's also a rumor that
the series may continue under new directorship.
Elizabeth

Judgments about grammatical acceptability are metalinguistic, yes.  J's focu=
s=20
was on lexical acceptability.  He didn't deal with grammatical aceptability=20
in this context.  Your point is well  taken.  But does this really diminish=20
the value of his main take on metalanguage?  Not significantly, in my opinio=
n.

No, I don't accept the claim that this statement is metalinguistic.  Oratio=20
obliqua, sure, but why metalinguistic?  If the statement were metalinguistic=
=20
it would be a statement about the code.  But this statement is obviously not=
=20
about the code.  It is about the relationship between the given statement an=
d=20
reality.  In other words, this child is more interested in the relationship=20
between the word ['you said...'] and the world.  This is a matter, you know,=
=20
of language and reality, truth and lies, and all that important stuff.  The=20
child has in mind the question: can I trust you?  That is a question about=20
the world, not about the code.  I'm surprised at HT's error in this. =20

Look, as a Vedicist, I happen to be very interested in the problem of=20

Well, anyone who attempts to deal with evidence knows that some hypotheses=20

Of course there is my Eating through Literature & Art (Sun & Moon Press)
which includes recipes by many noted poets and fiction writers and pieces
embedded in poetry and fiction on food! (Along with food by artists). It was
a big success upon it's publication. And Marinetti is also a poet--The

The special issue of CALLALOO dedicated to Nathaniel Mackey just landed in the mail box, and Paul Naylor has done a wonderful job editing it.  Unlike the smaller special sections of many past issues, this entire issue is Mackey, complete with underexposed photos of this underexposed artist.  Not to be missed -- New material from Mackey, poems & scores dedicated to him, interview, and many good essays --

by the way -- for any of you who may have missed Mackey's extensive essay on Gassire's Lute and Robert Duncan's poetry when it first ran in TALISMAN, a healthy hunk of it reappears in READING RACE IN AMERICAN POETRY from U of Illinois Press.  I mention this because it came out too late to be included in the fine bibliography that closes the CALLALOO issue.  [we wanted to include all of the Duncan essay, but the outside readers, who seem never to be outside enough to appreciate my point of view, said no.]

Rachel. I haven't seen the work, but its interesting the way technology or
the products of technology (the pen and paper,the typewriter, and now the
computer) interact with and influence how we write, and maybe its
significannce. I like to "justify" my prose poems (which I id after I
discovered that facility on a short comp. course.) Also I suppose this email
form is significant. The message is (is it always?) the textual
presentation. Or at least the two are hard to differentiate. Also the idea
of WRAP - being of course a pun - is interesting. Heijinian talks about the
role of desire. Its hard to pin those things down, but maybe there is an
interaction of the pleasure we gain from language as poetry say and some
erotic process. Obviously as what "makes us" is our drive to create and
recreate, one might suppose a link. Or be certain of it.(?)
  Note that you've also introduced another multiple meaning in "marginally".
  But dont get too worried! These things happen! i'm sure the computer feels
smug but you can always go back to pen and ink, to subvert the: what is it
you wish to subvert?
  And can I ask why you adopted this method of witing? I was interested once
inwriting a "sonata" or a "concerto" in a form that mimicked the way a
musical score evolves (even maybe as Stokhaussen)...the old idea of a kind
of "pure" poetry. But its just stayed as an idea. I'll look out for your
colloquium contribution. Regards,Richard Taylor.

Of course, Dodie's instigative short fiction was provocative enough.  And
Kevin's response, as usual, exhibited all of those qualities for which I've
begun, increasingly, to admire (&, even, attempt to emulate him).  But, on
the whole, I think the colloquium fell flat because it isn't at all, frankly,
as so many people on this List assume, the rhetoric of marginality--that is,
the language of symptoms--that makes the body--or anything else-- dangerous.
(In fact, we often seem too prone in our discussions, generally, to construct
a facile "them" in order to accomodate a readymade "us".)  Put another way,
critique, as I've said before, isn't destabilizing.  As a form of
surveillance, critique is both expected and desired by the therapeutic
bureaucracies of the university, the moderated List Serve, etc., etc.  No
surprise, then, either, that what was always missing in LP was, precisely,
the *erotic*.  In Scalapino, Harryman--or wherever you might think of looking
to contradict me--there is an entropy at the scale of the body that is, in
essence, erotically passive.  And I couldn't help noticing, among other
things, the same passivity at the heart of so many of the responses to the
recent colloquium.

Hello.

For an article for the Swarthmore alumni bulletin, I'm looking for poets
who are Swarthmore College alums. I'm looking specifically for working
poets who have at least some publication track record--in books and/or
journals, or if the poems are more aural/performative/spoken word
oriented, with a track record of performance...

Thanks!

The following is an exchange of recent emails I
was involved in, with only the names removed to
protect the innocent and the guilty. Question: Is
it wrong to ask a person to buy a copy of their
magazine or books to be considered for
publication? It seems to me it is - I'd like to
know what the rest of you think.
It is this sort of thing that makes me want to
renounce publishing. Let them worry about it
after I die.

**************************************************

                       I am writing you to
request submission guidelines. I have recently
completed a series of experimental poems titled
"pseudomnemonicon" for which I am seeking a
publisher.

     My publishing credits include Afterthoughts,
Defiance!, Textshop and the online journals Stark
Raving Sanity and Rockingchair.net.

     The book is available in .doc, .pub and .rtf
formats if you accept email submissions.

     Thank you for your time.


               Sincerely,


                        Michael Bogue

I do not buy issues for submission guidelines. I
do not pay reading fees. I do not pay contest
fees. I do not get subscriptions to be eligible
for publication. Not for five dollars. Not for
one dollar. It is wrong to do so and, in my view,
though a common practise, unethical to ask it.

No job I have ever applied for has expected me to
pay them money, purchase their product, or buy
their list of qualifications. I am scarcely able
to afford postage. I receive far too many
rejection letters, as does any writer, to be able
to afford to purchase the works I seek to be
published in.

I asked you for submission guidelines, and, once
again, I respectfully request them.


           Sincerely,

                    Michael Bogue

Though I am not averse to committing crimes for
my art, I will need considerably more motivation
than any you can provide.

As for the Gunslinger, that's a book I've been
looking for for a year - if I find it, I'll let
you know.

As to why my poems weren't published, it isn't
because of my ego (which I admit is immense,
though I take no shame in the fact) this is
simply because I have followed the path of some
of my favorite writers, all of whom accumulated
vastly more rejection letters than I. More likely
than not, it was simply that the poems were not
very good. If ego were a cause for exclusion from
a magazine, most the pages of most magazines and
books for sale would be a lonely shade of white.

As for starting my own magazine, I have
considered this path, but rejected it. There is
already a glut of magazines and publishers in my
city, and I serve them better by writing for them
than editing.

Still, my point remains. None of the editors I
know, from at least a half dozen small
publications, would even think of making people
buy an issue or pay a fee to be published, let
alone guidelines. In fact, that is why many of
them have some sort of web presence - to avoid
that extra expense.

Poetry has become - in my view - far too
incestuous. It is supported and created almost
entirely by the people who consume it.  I see a
number of causes for this - an indifferent public
raised on television and internet, poets who are
unambitious and publishing companies that expect
their writers to support them - for which I see
no immediate solution.

However, I consider it unfeasible to expect your
financial renumeration, even a part of it, come
from the poets who write for it. This is a unique
situation that exists nowhere else outside of
poetry.

However, all too often poets go along with it -
accept it in their desire to be published. This
is truly a pernicious use of ones ego, much worse
than the use of the word "I" (or, even more
falsely, "we")merely because it is common, even
accepted.

I withdraw my request for writer's guidelines.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

George,

Your reply just about sums up what I was thinking as I read Harold
Teichman's challenging and intensely intelligent post--simply put that
expanding, recontextualizing, even modifying a term like metalanguage for
uses outside its original boundaries is what a good linguist, good thinker,
good theorist, good poet does.  At the same time I do recognize that this
may be an especially poetic and non-positivist view of the matter (after
all isn't intervention in terminological sanctity sometimes considered the
political arm of our sweet poesy?).

However don't you think Teichman raised a more suggestive point, especially
in the following:

>Jakobson cites Tarski and Carnap as
>authors/authorities to back him up, but he demonstrates _no_
>acquaintance with and exposes none of the subtle and difficult technical
>philosophical context of their discourse.  He doesn’t say something like
>"I don’t understand Tarski’s paper, but I’m going to borrow his term and
>use it informally as follows"; rather he gives the reader the impression
>that there’s no discontinuity between his and Tarski’s use of the term.

What you don't seem to respond to, and what I would love to hear you
respond to, is the implied question as to why Jakobson would need to
*himself* connect the term back to formal logic via references to Tarski
and Carnap.  If formal logic and philosophy are some other subject, not
relevant here (i.e. you say he is a linguist and should be judged as a
linguist), why does J. not invent a new term, to be purely understood
within linguistics?  As his dear hero was Khlebnikov surely the idea of a
neologism would have occured to him?  Were other early linguists also
borrowing the term, and was J. building off that?

Perhaps you'll find this a side question of philosophical etymology, better
restricted to the history of science(s).  I see the point in wanting to
focus on the specifics of what the term accomplished (not to mention what
it actually means in J.'s understanding as probably most on the list are
shakey on this ground, me especially) but its genesis is also inescapably
relevant don't you think?  Of course a linguist or anyone else has a right,
shall we say, to use terms in new ways, especially if other linguists
accept the use and find it meaningful (I trust you that this is the case),
but it doesn't answer the profound question as to what kinds of models
linguistics was using to construct itself as a relatively new science
(models that are presumably now "internalized" in us as "natural," just as
the language code is).  What did J. wish to accomplish by connecting
linguistics to formal logic?  Could he have called metalanguage "stage
directions," or used a number of other reflexive models from the arts,
commerce, nature, etc.?  If not why not?  If so why didn't he?  If J. had
been a sports fan might we be calling metalanguage "broadcasting" (as
opposed to "playing")?  Doesn't J.'s later use of the code/message
terminology open the same can of worms, or is it a different can?

Much praise and thanks to both of you for the discussion, by the way.

Brent Cunningham

Here are two special events newly scheduled for this year's
Deep South Festival of Writers. Please note dates and times.



(1) PRESS RELEASE : October 1, 2000

"EX-LIBRIS " BOOK PLATES EXHIBITIONS ARE FOR BOOKLOVERS AND
ARTLOVERS

   A remarkable collection of "Ex Libris" artworks will be
exhibited in Lafayette at two gallery spaces opening
Wednesday, October 11, on the UL Lafayette campus, and
Saturday, October 14, at the Moore Studio downtown. These
exhibitions are part of the Deep South Festival of Writers
(Oct.-12-15, UL Lafayette campus) and Second Saturday
Artwalk Event (downtown Lafayette, Jefferson Street).

   Ex-libris (Latin for "the books of") plates are designed
by artists, often commissioned for public or private
libraries and placed inside books to identify the collector
or collection. They are original works of art in editions,
relatively small, with great detail. The prints are usually
woodcarvings, etchings, or lithographs and often present
both the secular and religious folklore of various cultures.

   These contemporary and vintage prints are from the
extensive collection of Dr. Remo Palmirani, founder of the
Ex Libris Association, and scholar and medical doctor from
Bologna, Italy. Dr. Palmirani has been collecting ex-libris
during his travels for over 35 years. Artists are
represented from Italy, Morocco, Turkey, Spain, England,
Israel, Belgium, Greece, Russia, and France.

   Dr. Palmirani will speak about his collection and the
history of Ex-Libris during a free lecture to be held
Wednesday October 11 , 3:00 pm in 134 Flechter Hall on the
UL Lafayette campus. Following the presentation there will
be a reception in the Dean's Gallery, College of the Arts.
This collection will include rare ex libris of renowned
artists (Magritte, Mucha, Mondrian, , Beardsley, Cocteau,
Escher, Tinguely, Botta, etc.) and contemporary works.

   The second exhibition will open October 14, 6-9 pm,
during the Second Saturday Artwalk Event at Moore Gallery at
515 Jefferson Street. The theme of this collection, titled
*Masonic Ex-Libris*, illuminates the symbols and secret
history of the Masons. These two collections of Ex Libris
reveal a rich tradition in linking art with literature. The
project is supported by a grant from the Louisiana Division
of the Arts, Office of Cultural Development, Department of
Culture, Recreation and Tourism in cooperation with the
Louisiana State Arts Council as administered by the Acadiana
Arts Council. For more information please contact Lynda
Frese at 337-482-5773 or Jerry McGuire at 337-482-5478.



(2) At the end of Deep South, Sunday, October 15th around
1:00 p.m., all interested parties are invited to a short
meeting concerning a proposal by the Louisiana Center for
the book to sponsor a Louisiana Writers Network, an
initiative intended to connect writers in Louisiana with one
another, with the Center for the book, and with the Division
of the Arts to help in the gathering and dissemination of
information of interest to writers. The meeting will be very
short. I’ll hand out a questionnaire provided by the Center
for the Book, and I’ll also gather any questions you may
have about the proposed writers’ network to pass on to Rod
Mills, the Director of the Center. I look forward to seeing
you there.

Jerry McGuire

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

Afternoon reading: innovative new fiction from
CHRIS KRAUS & MIKE AMNASAN
Thursday afternoon October 12, 4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

CHRIS KRAUS's books-_Aliens & Anorexia_ and _I Love Dick_-transgress all
typical notions of fiction, bending writing to the demands and purposes of
life itself in the process.  _Aliens & Anorexia_ (Semiotext(e)/Smart Art,
2000) combines passion and polemic in a philosophically sophisticated
rejection of cultural cynicism.  "From the end of the world-New Zealand-to
Los Angeles, Africa and Berlin, past attempted escapes through the body's
tunnels and telephone wires, Gravity is the true heroine of this very
serious comedy" (Fanny Howe).  Ms. Kraus edits Semiotext(e)'s Native Agents
series of books.  A filmmaker as well as writer, she lives in Los Angeles.

MIKE AMNASAN's new novel _Beyond the Safety of Dreams_ was just published
by Krupskaya Books.  "It is the most painfully honest writing I have read
in a long time," writes Tom Beckett, "a book of revelations about
alienation and abjection, a disturbing account of one man's struggle to
find a way to feel at home in an inhospitable world."  As a playwright, Mr.
Amnasan has had presented in staged readings in the Bay Area his dramatic
works _Revery_ , _Unfair Play_ and _The Poet Killer_.  He lives in San
=46rancisco, where he recently completed his B.A. at SFSU on a scholarship
from Sheet Metal Workers Local #104.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I apologize for taking this phrase "a poet in the narrow sense" out of
context from Bill Austin to make a rhetorical point.  My larger point was
Mallarme is also a philosopher of language of the highest order, and hence
not a "philosopher in the narrow sense."  I think Derrida would
acknowledge this.  Discussing philosophical issues in poetry is actually a
way of discussing poetic issues in poetry. I can't go along with the idea
that in philosophical discussions of poetry the philosophical terms will
be dominant, and vice-versa.  I don't really see how we can maintain this
distinction in any consistent way, since the influence of a poet on a
philosopher might be just as philosophical as it is poetic.  The influence
of Mallarme on Derrida comes by way of figures like Blanchot, perhaps.
Is it merely coincidental that French poststructuralism is steeped in
French "poetics"? I wasn't trying to be cute when I affirmed that it made
sense to me to reverse the polarities of the debate.

Of course it makes perfect sense to continue to use philosophy as a
"metalanguage" to talk about poetics.  This is, in fact, the normal
practice of doing Derridean or Heideggerian readings of poetic texts. This
is the status quo in my field: theoretical applications to poetic texts,
in which theory is the metalanguage and poetics its object. I was trying
to suggest a temporary reversal of perspectives that might be equally, if
not more illuminating.  At the very least, it coud be an interesting
thought experiment.

But Jacques, my piece was not fiction!  It was an essay that was
refusing a certain type of essay logic/form.  Believing that the
essay would find a receptive audience here in the list was the only
fiction involved on my part.  Actually, I never believed that.  Chris
Alexander had to tell me, over and over, to leave the piece as it
was, to prop me up, month after month.  He's been unceasingly
selfless in his willingness to play therapist/personal coach for me.
So, thanks, Chris.

I'm surprised by the responses to the Colloquium here, though after
having been on the list so long, I don't know why.  What I thought
was nice about the Colloquium is that respondents didn't really argue
with one another, but rather used previous responses as a based to
leap frog from to talk about their own perceptions--rather than to
challenge other arguments.  Much closer to the multiple layers
approach that we learned about as young poets in Kathleen Fraser's
wonderful Feminist Poetics course at SF State.  As opposed to the
(enslavement of the) dualism of argument.

The amazingly few responses on the list seem to center around
announcing the official people we should look at if we're going to
read about gender/sex/erotics, since most of us in the forum were not
these official people.  And there there's been a certain amount of
bemoaning what the forum lacked, and then the projection of authority
onto the respondents as dreaded authority figures that have to be
challenged.

I think that the Colloquium did some great work, spontaneously, at
subverting privileged power relations when it comes to discussing
Theory.  And as an irregular mass that doesn't claim to be definitive
or to represent anything in particular, it's silly to talk about its
lack.  I think the messiness and ambiguity of the project is where
its greatest interest lies.  And that messiness and ambiguity *is*
about erotics, in my opinion.

On the contrary, Robin Tremblay-McGaw's piece displays an active female
sexuality that writhes and leaks and jumps right off the page. It goes
beyond the "containable" in ways that question the very construction of
female sexuality: in girls, in mothers, in places and ways that are
unspeakable.

Michael--

although your would-be contributor latched on to the money issue in your
reply, seems to me you were suggesting that s/he READ THE MAGAZINE BEFORE
SUBMITTING, which is entirely reasonable.  that's very different than
readers fees, or submission fees, or limiting submissions to subscribers.
if a magazine is worth anything, it's because it's a vehicle for/artifact of
a poetic (sub)community...  so its contributors can reasonably be asked to
be participants in that community.  which means investing energy (including
but not limited to cash) into that community, as well as expecting something
back.

i've run a number of magazines in my day--if any of them had received half
as many subscriptions (or even single copy sales) as they did submissions
they'd still be going today.  when a writer sends work to a zine they've
never read, it speaks loudly about how little the writer cares about their
work.  something along the lines of "i don't care where i'm published.  i
don't know enough about poetry to realize that there are different
schools/styles/standards. and i'm too good/busy/important to read other
peoples' work."  from my experience, this seems to be the majority opinion
of poets in the US.

but i'm not bitter...

would it be fair to say that all great poets (if we can for the moment
imagine such a group, and agree to its constituents in the abstract) are
philosophers (that is, their work contains important and original ideas
about reality, thought, and representation, say) but that not all great
philosophers are poets? Which "great" poets might we consider
non-philosophers, or poor ones. Pound? Yeats? Zukofsky? Which great
philosophers might we consider not to be poets, or to be poor ones? Hegel?
Bergson?

Surely, the debate is not happily sited on a discussion of Mallarme and
Derrida, two who are clearly or very arguably established in each
camp---and, I might add, in considerable harmony on the issues of
authorship, writing, absence, silence. Jabes is another. And Cage.
And who, from either camp, might contest being included in the other:
artaud? williams? nietzsche?

i think the questions raised are interesting because they prompt me (at
least) to survey the wider scope of values that i associate with poetry I
admire and pay attention to; that is, what the philosophical components
might be, say, of an artaud "spell" or mallarme's use of space and   silence
on the page, or mac low's rendering up of shakespeare sonnets via
translation word for word to like words found at the head of a
french/english dictionary page (in French Sonnets). These cogitations do
disturb the mid-day hour ...

Hello all, we have a new email here at Small Press Traffic.
smallpress@ccac-art.edu.

Hope to see some of you at our reading this Friday, with Chris Kraus and
David Baratier.

Directions
We're at the new California College of Arts & Crafts San Francisco Campus,
an old Greyhound hanger turned art, architecture, and writing school.
There are lots of art galleries to wander through, and our new reading
space, Timken Lecture Hall, is quite luxurious if we do say so ourselves.
To get here from our old neighborhood up on Valencia, take the 22 bus down
16th Street toward the bay, and get off at 17th and Wisconsin. Walk 2
blocks down Wisconsin and you'll see CCAC. From the bay bridge, take the
9th St/Civic Center offramp, from the offramp take the Left on 8th Street
option, cruise along 8th to Brannan, turn Left on Brannan, Right on 7th,
left on Irwin to the dead end of the block at 8th Street and you're here.
Remember, we are on the corner of 8th and Irwin, which is confusingly
quite near the intersection of 16th and Wisconsin. A map will go out on
our next flyer.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994.
A `round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery by Brad
Brace. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
stellar, trajective alignment past the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative
metaphors for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless
present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time... ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

                  [ see  ftp.idiom.com/users/bbrace/netcom/books ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous,
reckless... >> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous,
provocative, poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic,
pathological... >> Evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
entertaining, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest
on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs  has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years`
worth of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the
ongoing publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each
12-hour posting is like the turning of a page; providing ample time
for reflection, interruption, and assimilation.

opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (36x48") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet

copies of the first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books.

=46OR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Date:  11 October 2000
Poetry Center Book Award Announced:
Cole Swensen, TRY  (University of Iowa Press)

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives is pleased to announce the
winner of this year's Poetry Center Book Award.  Cole Swensen's newest book
of poems, _Try_ (University of Iowa Press), was selected for the annual
award by this year's judge, poet Elizabeth Robinson, of Berkeley.  The
Poetry Center Book Award has been given every year since 1980 to an
outstanding new book of poetry published in the previous year.  Past
winners of the award include:  Sharon Olds, Alice Notley, Larry Eigner,
Laura Moriarty, Jackson Mac Low, Yusef Komunyakaa, Lyn Hejinian, Luis J.
Rodriguez, Adrian Louis, C.D. Wright, Barbara Guest, Jane Hirshfield, and
Elaine Equi.  The winner is awarded $500 and will be invited to read at The
Poetry Center, along with the award judge, during The Poetry Center's
Spring 2001 season.

Cole Swensen is a poet and translator based at the University of Denver in
Colorado, where she directs the creative writing program and teaches
literature and poetry.  She has also taught in the Paris Writers' Workshop
and the Naropa Institute summer programs.

The judge's award citation reads as follows:

TRY, by Cole Swensen

To read the poems of _Try_ is to engage with the author in attempts to see
through (that is, via) a kind of blindness.  This blindness is, in turn,
not mitigated but illuminated by a revisionist sight:  Cole Swensen's
poetry puts me in mind of Simone Weil's insistence that true attentiveness
has the power of the miraculous.  Swensen looks at paintings which the
reader cannot see, but the poet's acuity of attention transcends perception
and becomes the making of meaning.

What we try to enter becomes the story of the reach, the extended hand or
hands-the story of recurrent, displaced, displacing trinities where that
which transcends tries, and tries again, only to reach beyond itself, past
representation, to flesh and blood.  As comfortable with gap as she is with
continuity, Swensen permits these poems to falter linguistically where
history has crumbled, or the image cannot carry the weight of the explicit.
Yet the poems themselves move away from the paintings, so closely observed
that stasis becomes movement.

The power of this work is, indeed, that it moves from image to word, viewer
and viewed, then onward, to a seam, the embodying point of contact, a
"something mysterious that exceeds accounting".

-Elizabeth Robinson

Cole Swensen's most recent book, _Try_ was earlier awarded the 1998 Iowa
Poetry Prize and was published in 1999 by the University of Iowa Press.
Her other recent books include _Noon_ (Sun & Moon Press, 1997), which won
their New American Writing Award, and _Numen_ (Burning Deck Publications,
1995), which was nominated for the PenWest Award in poetry.  Her
book-length poem _Oh_ will be published by Apogee Press in the fall of
2000, and the collection _Such Rich Hour_ is coming out from University of
Iowa in 2001.  Other recent work has appeared in journals including The
Boston Review, Conjunctions, and Grand Street.

Ms. Swensen is a translator of contemporary French poetry, fiction, and art
criticism.  Recent publications include Olivier Cadiot's _Art Poetic'_,
Green Integer Press, and Pierre Alferi's _Natural Gaits_, Sun & Moon Press;
Jean Fr=E9mon's _The Island of the Dead_ and Pascalle Monnier's _Bayart_ wil=
l
be coming out in 2001.  She has received grants for translating from the
Direction du Livre et de la Lecture in Paris and from the Fondation
Beaumarchais, the latter for collaborating on a theater adaptation of
Olivier Cadiot's Colonel Zoo.

Elizabeth Robinson, judge for this year's Poetry Center Book Award, is the
author of several books of poetry, including _Bed of Lists_ (Kelsey St.
Press), _In the Sequence of Falling Things_ (Paradigm Press), and the
recent chapbooks _As Betokening_ (Quarry Press) and _Lodger_ (Arcturus
Editions).  Her book _House Made of Silver_ is forthcoming from Kelsey St.
Press, and _Under the Silky Roof_ from Burning Deck.  She lives in Berkeley.

Michael:

Although I haven't compiled quite as many rejections as you (only because I
haven't submitted as many manuscripts as you have, no doubt), I can say that
it's pretty common practice for an editor to recommend that you look at a
current issue of the mag before submitting, if only to check out what kind
of work they're publishing and whether your manuscript would be a good fit.
Ideally (it seems to me) you would want to be published in a mag that
included writers you are excited about, in order to have your work read by
others whose work you esteem, and perhaps even engage in a dialogue with
those other writers or readers that might be beneficial to all.

I suspect that if you hadn't immediately cast the exchange in terms of a
broader issue in which you rushed to the moral high ground, and instead
merely asked the editors where you could look at a copy of the mag without
having to purchase it, or whether it was possible to trade for it, or
somehow send your manuscript without paying $5 -- you see what I'm getting
at here -- perhaps you wouldn't have ended up with the predictable outcome
of withdrawing your request in a moralistic huff.

I also find it highly ironic -- I mean, is this a joke, or what? -- that you
seem quite satisfied to fulfill your role in poetry by writing rather than
editing your own mag, and yet one paragraph later you're bitching about
poetry being "far too incestuous." Excuse me, Mr. Amberwind, but what
exactly are you doing to expand the audience for your poetry beyond the
limited, incestuous community of other poets? Or is the mere fact of your
work appearing in said mags going to blow the doors off this hermetically
sealed universe you describe and into a mainstream? With an "experimental"
manuscript called  "pseudomnemonicon," somehow I doubt it.

As for not knowing of any other art form which relies on its own
practicioners in order to sustain itself, that's just wrong. I happen to
live in the Bay Area and be heavily involved with the new music scene here,
which relies EXCLUSIVELY on its own musicians, and those generally regional
and very poor, to survive. Week after week, men and women toil in obscurity
in small clubs and arts spaces, and other musicians come to watch them do
it, because they want to hear the music and know what's going on. And guess
what? None of them demands to be let in for free, even if they've played on
the same series, or are going to play, or simply WANT to play next week. And
I suspect -- hell, I KNOW -- that it's pretty much the same gig here in the
good ole USA with just about every art form you'd care to name.

All this is not to say that you ought to have to pay $5 just to submit
somewheres. It's just plumb great that you've taken a stand and decided not
to do this. People plunk down that $5  -- and if they don't have that $5
maybe they offer to help apply postage, or run stuff through the printer, or
whatever -- not because they're trying to buy their way in to a certain mag,
but because they're trying to support what's going on. At least, that's why
they OUGHT to be doing it. When you're old and distinguished and have 26
books out but STILL unknown outside of the poetry community, as some of my
friends, now, are -- THEN you can submit to any magazine you want without
paying any money or even asking for guidelines.

Till then, best of luck

The following is an exchange of recent emails I
was involved in, with only the names removed to
protect the innocent and the guilty. Question: Is
it wrong to ask a person to buy a copy of their
magazine or books to be considered for
publication? It seems to me it is - I'd like to
know what the rest of you think.
It is this sort of thing that makes me want to
renounce publishing. Let them worry about it
after I die.

**************************************************

                       I am writing you to
request submission guidelines. I have recently
completed a series of experimental poems titled
"pseudomnemonicon" for which I am seeking a
publisher.

     My publishing credits include Afterthoughts,
Defiance!, Textshop and the online journals Stark
Raving Sanity and Rockingchair.net.

     The book is available in .doc, .pub and .rtf
formats if you accept email submissions.

     Thank you for your time.


               Sincerely,


                        Michael Bogue

I do not buy issues for submission guidelines. I
do not pay reading fees. I do not pay contest
fees. I do not get subscriptions to be eligible
for publication. Not for five dollars. Not for
one dollar. It is wrong to do so and, in my view,
though a common practise, unethical to ask it.

No job I have ever applied for has expected me to
pay them money, purchase their product, or buy
their list of qualifications. I am scarcely able
to afford postage. I receive far too many
rejection letters, as does any writer, to be able
to afford to purchase the works I seek to be
published in.

I asked you for submission guidelines, and, once
again, I respectfully request them.


           Sincerely,

                    Michael Bogue

Though I am not averse to committing crimes for
my art, I will need considerably more motivation
than any you can provide.

As for the Gunslinger, that's a book I've been
looking for for a year - if I find it, I'll let
you know.

As to why my poems weren't published, it isn't
because of my ego (which I admit is immense,
though I take no shame in the fact) this is
simply because I have followed the path of some
of my favorite writers, all of whom accumulated
vastly more rejection letters than I. More likely
than not, it was simply that the poems were not
very good. If ego were a cause for exclusion from
a magazine, most the pages of most magazines and
books for sale would be a lonely shade of white.

As for starting my own magazine, I have
considered this path, but rejected it. There is
already a glut of magazines and publishers in my
city, and I serve them better by writing for them
than editing.

Still, my point remains. None of the editors I
know, from at least a half dozen small
publications, would even think of making people
buy an issue or pay a fee to be published, let
alone guidelines. In fact, that is why many of
them have some sort of web presence - to avoid
that extra expense.

Poetry has become - in my view - far too
incestuous. It is supported and created almost
entirely by the people who consume it.  I see a
number of causes for this - an indifferent public
raised on television and internet, poets who are
unambitious and publishing companies that expect
their writers to support them - for which I see
no immediate solution.

However, I consider it unfeasible to expect your
financial renumeration, even a part of it, come
from the poets who write for it. This is a unique
situation that exists nowhere else outside of
poetry.

However, all too often poets go along with it -
accept it in their desire to be published. This
is truly a pernicious use of ones ego, much worse
than the use of the word "I" (or, even more
falsely, "we")merely because it is common, even
accepted.

I withdraw my request for writer's guidelines.

Jacques---

I was struck, if not exactly surprised, by how little of body, bodies,
was actually discussed (in a "referential" way, etc...)

& not just in this symposium, but often when discussions of body come up
in intellectual contexts....
There's this weird critique that certain intellectual poets don't make room for
the body enough, and being often lumped in with those poets myself, I tend to be
sensitive to it
and thus open to it....I mean the critique gets my attention, like maybe THEY
know
something I don't know, so I run out to read such poetry (being vague here) and
find
either "body as language" or "body as abstraction," as good thing we need to
return to, etc,
but not much else more than that....

Has anybody else had this experience?
Now, sex is something different....

But, even so, I'm reading the hopefully-soon-to-be-released correspondence of
Nada Sullivan and Gary Gordon and---

am struck by Nada's awareness of her body. A lot of talk about diet, how diet
affects
thought, and not just though, constitution,. about how poropus, sensitive,
etc...

this is refreshing and though it's but one subtheme of the book
points in a direction i'd like to see emphasized more....
that is, assuming we're talking about the body....

i mean, sure no one these days (please refute me) wants to be so boring as to
make poetry sound like a mere self-help book, or practical etc,
but I think the taboo here could be shattered in ways that do not sacrfice
intensity...

Maybe I should just hold another colloquium; where I ask people to write prose
statements (and poetry may be allowed in some cases) about how they deal, on a
daily
basis, with being "embodied,"----

And that would mean you too Jacques, so if Leslie and Harryman etc, are passive
in their
bodies, what do you offer by way of alternative, or of personal relationship to
BOD (as oppossed to G-D, that be.....)

ex pear a mental pome
        for Richard Taylor


Die eye gnostic.
My blue cups are overfluent--

smell the tap water.
Big bad more hiss code.

Flatulent penguins
pirouette on stoops
in groups of four
and cry for the door.

My hand's a mangy crow
cawing autumn

blues, reds, oranges. Rubber
heads bounce in the margins.

Michael. I would say that the whole Black Mountain group was clearly
philosophic in your sense, so Olson, Creeley, Cage, Maclow even Ed Dorn. I
think that Ashbery is inherently, like Stevens, philosophic. All poets must
be in some sense (which is why George B.(I'm still studying that word
"chutzpah" tho, according to one source its a positive term; how dare you
insult me with a compliment, or compliment me with an insult.) will be
pleased (for all I know he doesnt give a...) I'm doing some swat by reading
"Structuralism and Semiotics" by Terrence Hawkes.) But this of course wont
make me a "philosophic" poet, but maybe help me to understand why I'm not!
Charles Bernstein says (to the  effect) that Sartre's "Being & Nothingness"
is more like a great poem than say his books. It has poetic
elements.(Polysemy,ambiguity,metonomy,metaphory) I think that
structuralists'(Russian formalists?) idea of ostranie goes to the heart of
the matter (to cash in on G Greene). Marx was an economist/philosopher but
obviously not a poet. Some claim Heidegger (see George I've read Heidegger)
(thats not a dig tho) and I like his idea or method (somewhat) and
description of Van Gogh's boots etc. but I feel he slides away from being a
philospher. He's more of a philopoet like Nietsche.I once thought that there
might be a kind of "Unified Field Theory of Language" but I couldnt subsume
certain language. E.g. certain instructions require repetition and abxolute
concision. O.K. some of the communication problems creep in, but they are
not deliberately introduced in the way that poets introduce  ambiguity,
metaphor, metonomy and so on. To some extent Silliman is right in his notion
that a writer of literature ( of a certain "high" kind) needs to know who
her audience is. . .One doesnt have to be a Russell or a Wittgenstein to
"understand" poetry. Especially Mallarme: but one needs certain info as to
how to "approach"  M.(Derrida's writing seems "poetic" to me). Also the same
applies to other writers. I still, have trouble "reading" Marrianne Moore,
but this doesnt mean I dislike her work. Many of the Lang Poets have rather
obscure adgendas - as do many modern or post modern artists (however those
terms are interpreted) but one gets "used" to "reading" them. Then perhaps
somewhat they lose theie edge. But a "great" poet (actually I see things
like "Finnegans Wake " as being a vast, tortuous and fascinating poem. I
heard Joyce (on the radio) reading it and it "came alive" so to speak: it
DID seem like a huge poem.) produces something we return to, and can
withstand and "improve" by or from analyses  or exegesis.Eliot claimed to
not have any clear ideas. I think we try to dig, to uncover, to reveal. My
father used to point to cloud formations and what to a lot of other people
would look out toward "dull weather" and talk about the  light and shapes
like other people talk about 50 milllion dollars: but he wasnt acting. O K
it may have derived from the "philosophy" he'd picked up,maybe thru
schooling or reading or even general communications, but he hadnt read eg
Coleridge's "philosophic" works. Had seen the Turner's at the Tate in London
tho. But there's someone: Coleridge. would he qualify? Pound I agree was a
pathetic philosopher. I'd be surprised if he could boil an egg (not fair I
know, I believe he was very "handy"), but I mean his Douglassian based
philosophy of economics and usura as he called it  was pathetic (if not
horrible in the light of the Holocaust).A friend of mine has translated the
"fascist cantos" from Italian. Struggled to stay interested in Pound after
reading them. They are vomitable. But he was a great "philosopher" and
innovator in poetics and was surely a "great" poet. I see one aspect of
Pound as a kind of proto-confessionalist. The early Auden and (sometimes the
later in his "logical paradox" poems (which can be infuriatingly maddening
to decipher) was surely a philosopher (Auden was also good at Maths).
William Bronk is interesting and is (to me) a kind of ("aphoriser") - an
ambiuating aphoriser.. Doesnt Susan Howe philosophise re history, the role
or whatever of women artists, reality and language and so on? And Heijinian
"meditates" on time (perhaps in a very different way to Proust)life,memory,
and reality. Its maybe a question of deliberateness. Some interesting
questions. all poets are concerned, in some way, with the fundamental and
maybe unkowable nature or "meaning" of consciousness and sentience. Poets
need to maintain their heads awake. Everything must fascinate.
 The spaces, the ellipses, the frightening or intriguing holes or sycopes,
shick us awake as in Bernstein's "...with this difference, it brings you to
your senses" [The Klupsy girl]
  But if one is a "great" poet and one is unhappy, then that is futile.
  On a lighter note. Philosophy can be defined as 1. Bullshit raised to the
highest power. 2. Decacophanated mumbo-jumbo. 3. Everything my cat (who'se
got more sense) never worries about. 4. (Add your definition).  Interesting
post Michael, regards Richard. P.S. What about Empson and Lewis Carrol
(Carol was a Logician and Mathematician and Empson had trained in
mathematics.?) (My apologies to George B. but I havent read "Seven Types..."
Gave up on the first page. Must um......)

Dodie. I found the Colloquium interesting if somwhat disturbing. But then I
suppose part of what the wriers were doing was to provoke etc. But it takes
courage to write, well to write and present anything to anyone. Maybe a lot
on the list are thinking about what was on, and still havent thought out
their responses. I dont know anything about the "politics" of it. In fact I
wasnt sure what it was (I had to look up "colloquium in the dictionary) .But
good on you all. I liked the "mix" from "confessional" or theoretical and
then to "poetical" and so on.Regards, Richard Taylor.

EXCLUSIVE BAY AREA ENGAGEMENt
Young Dr. Freud
Friday, October 27-Wednesday, November 1
Rafael Film Center

Made in 1977, this fascinating and articulate drama about Sigmund Freud¹s
early years is only now being released in the US.  Director Axel Corti and
screenwriter Georg Stefan Toller frame their narrative between two traumatic
events in Freud¹s life<as an elderly man fleeing to England to escape Nazi
persecution, and as a child who witnesses an anti-Semitic act against his
father.  The film explores the ambitious young doctor¹s Jewish identity and
his efforts to overcome poverty and establish his profession and marriage in
late 19th century Vienna.  Rather than unfold events as in a conventional
biography, the filmmakers symbolically place him on the couch; an off-screen
interviewer/analyst (the voice of screenwriter Toller) occasionally asks
young Freud (Karlheinz Hackl) questions that propel him out of his time.
With a concise depiction of the beginnings of his psychoanalytic theories,
Young Dr. Freud is an illuminating and personal portrait of one of the 20th
century¹s most influential figures.

 In German and French with English subtitles. (Austria, 1977) 99 min.

Freud."

Jacques: out of curiosity: what writing (about) sexuality/the body
*doesn't* enact or reproduce "an entropy at the scale of the body that is,
in essence, erotically passive"?

The Self in the Poetic Field, by David Kellogg
"The novel feature of this structure for poetry is the manner in which the
two axes are each formed by the formal and social loci of value. The loci
of each axis repel each other. The axes join together in the center so that
the two axes map a four-sided field when represented on a two-dimensional
plane. One axis maps a set of social possibilities and the other a set of
formal possibilities. The field is held in suspense as follows: social
locus repels social locus; formal locus repels formal locus."

>would it be fair to say that all great poets (if we can for the moment
imagine such a group, and agree to its constituents in the abstract) are
philosophers (that is, their work contains important and original ideas
about reality, thought, and representation, say) but that not all great
philosophers are poets? Which "great" poets might we consider
non-philosophers, or poor ones. Loy? H.D.? (Riding) Jackson? Which great
philosophers might we consider not to be poets, or to be poor ones?
Kristeva?
Woolf?

Surely, the debate is not happily sited on a discussion of Stein and
Cixous, two who are clearly or very arguably established in each
camp---and, I might add, in considerable harmony on the issues of
authorship, writing, ABSENCE, SILENCE. Mayer is another. And Moore.
And who, from either camp, might contest being included in the other:
bishop? guest? von freytag-loringhoven?

Tel me what is thy cause for to synge,

Sith that thy throte is kut to my semynge?

--Prioress' Tale, 645-8


A disturbed adolescent

daughter of inbred survivalist neighbors

creepy-crawls our backyard with her cat.


She steals our few grape wads

and leaves spoor among the unmown pear mush:

Marie Osmond-brand perfume atomizers,

toy Tampax tubes.


Even allowing for accelerated maturation rates

among rural polygamist females

I estimate she's too old for toys.


Every night, all night, her ashen cat

copulates with everything furred

the neighborhood has to offer

under our bagged air conditioner,

though my wife sleeps clear through.


These two marauders seep

through the drapes in vaporous form

and reintegrate on the skin of my chest

where the larger, more anthropomorphic one

squats in a vulgar position.

Something furred, taloned,

coils around her plump limbs.


She hisses in my ear:


Medieval times are coming to your neighborhood, Tom.

Your Catholic spouse who accepts spirits

and so can dismiss them

will snore through it all.  But you,

you aging acid head, with your hoed rows

of secular humanist psilocybin cubensis,

you're in for it.


Walpurgisnacht will erupt

in the dark, not mushrooms.

We will turn into a sweet-singing boy

and you into a Jew.

The fiberglass of your greenhouse

will melt down into a cesspool

and we'll see who seduces whom.

Subject: Re: Post Neotextualism


"Class is responsible for sexism," says Marx;
however, according to Brophy, it is not so much
class that is responsible for sexism, but rather
the failure, and thus the meaninglessness, of
class. But if capitalism holds, we have to choose
between semanticist socialism and prematerial
textual theory. If one examines neodialectic
nihilism, one is faced with a choice: either
accept capitalism or conclude that concensus is a
product of communication. The subject is
contextualised into a cultural desemioticism that
includes truth as a totality. However, the
characteristic theme of the works of Pynchon is a
self-fulfilling paradox. In the works of Pynchon,
a predominant concept is the distinction between
closing and opening. Capitalism holds that
culture is part of the failure of language. It
could be
said that d'Erlette suggests that we have to
choose between subcapitalist nationalism and
dialectic appropriation. The main theme of
Parry's analysis of dialectic nationalism is the
bridge between society and sexual identity.
Foucault suggests the use of capitalism to
challenge class divisions. However, Sontag uses
the term 'posttextual dialectic theory' to denote
not, in fact, theory, but subtheory. If
capitalism holds, we have to choose between the
neotextual paradigm of concensus and
deconstructivist precapitalist theory. Thus,
Sartre promotes the use of semanticist socialism
to deconstruct and analyse society. Several
narratives concerning capitalism exist. It could
be said that Marx uses the term 'dialectic
nationalism' to denote the role of the reader as
observer. The subject is
interpolated into a semanticist socialism that
includes truth as a whole. Therefore, Lyotard
suggests the use of dialectic nationalism to
challenge hierarchy. An abundance of discourses
concerning the difference between class and
sexuality may be discovered. In a sense, Derrida
promotes the use of capitalism to read class.
A number of narratives concerning dialectic
nationalism exist. It could be said that
d'Erlette implies that we have to choo se between
capitalism and the patriarchial paradigm of
narrative. Any number of theories concerning the
fatal flaw, and eventually the futility, of
neocapitalist society may be revealed. However,
the subject is contextualised into a
dialectic nationalism that includes art as a
paradox. Dialectic discourse and subcultural
dialectic theory. "Sexual identity is used in the
service of capitalism," says Foucault; however,
according to Tilton, it is not so much sexual
identity that is used in the service of
capitalism, but rather the stasis, and subsequent
paradigm, of sexual identity. The primary theme
of the works of Eco is the common ground between
class and sexual identity. It could be said that
the futility, and eventually the fatal flaw, of
subcultural dialectic theory prevalent in Eco's
Foucault's Pendulum is also evident in The
Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas, although in a more
mythopoetical sense. Marx's essay on Lacanist
obscurity holds that the Constitution is capable
of truth. Thus, Bataille uses the term 'dialectic
nationalism' to denote a dialectic whole. Many
dematerialisms concerning subcultural dialectic
theory exist. However, the main theme of
Cameron's model of capitalist discourse is the
futility, and therefore the absurdity, of
neotextual society.

Of course, I could be wrong and invite List input
on the matter.

An evening with poets
ED ROBERSON & NATHANIEL MACKEY
Thursday, October 19, 7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ the Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

ED ROBERSON's wonderful new book, _Atmosphere Conditions_ (Sun & Moon,
2000), was selected by Nathaniel Mackey for publication in the prestigious
National Poetry Series.  "Atmosphere, omen, memory, lost amenity,
homelessness of more than one sort, instantaneity, cityscape, housing of
more than one sort, dream, social entropy, music, dance, death-these are
among the matters which move through the poems with revenant, mercurial
dispatch. . . .  work of unremitting mindfulness and reach."  His _Voices
Cast Out to Talk Us In_ was winner of the 1995 Iowa Poetry Prize, and _Just
In/Word of Navigational Challenges: New and Selected Poems_ was published
by Talisman Books.  Mr. Roberson lives in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
NATHANIEL MACKEY's latest book of poetry is _Whatsaid Serif_ (City Lights),
an extension of the long poetic work he calls "Song of the Andoumboulou."
His third novel, _Atet A.D._ (forthcoming from City Lights), likewise
continues Mr. Mackey's engagement in an on-going, epic-length work, in this
instance the epistolary fiction "From a Broken Bottle, Traces of Perfume
Still Emanate."  _Discrepant Engagement_, a critical work exploring
conjunctions between radical Black poetics of recent decades and the New
American Poetry, is new in paperback from the University of Alabama.  Mr.
Mackey edits _Hambone_ magazine, and lives in Santa Cruz, where he teaches
literature at UCSC.

An evening with
ROBERT CREELEY
=46riday, October 20, 7:30 pm, free
@ The Ira and Leonore S. Gershwin Theater
2350 Turk Boulevard (at Masonic)
presented in collaboration with Readings at Lone Mountain,
the M.F.A. Writing Program at the University of San Francisco

Consummate American master ROBERT CREELEY returns to San Francisco for a
special Friday evening reading in the 500-seat Gershwin Theater (free
admission).  o  Mr. Creeley's latest collection of new work, _Life & Death_
(New Directions, 1998), is one of the outstanding new books of poetry to
appear in recent year--with its brilliant opening sequence "Histoire de
=46lorida" among his surest poetic work.  Robert Creeley lives in Buffalo,
New York.  He has--since the 1950s and his activities out of Black Mountain
College--been exceptionally influential as a writer and singularly present
to the art of the contemporary poem and the attentions of the poet.  This
past summer he was recognized by the Before Columbus Foundation with its
Lifetime Achievement Award.  His remarks on receiving that award read, in
part:

"All writers have 'the dream of a common language,' as Adrienne Rich has so
movingly emphasized-a world, and a voice therein, not separated by
dislocating habits of authority or reference.  Far more than 'being heard,'
so to speak, one dreams of a world in which one can oneself hear, clearly,
particularly, commonly-in a company of others which moves far beyond the
limits of oneself."

Concurrent with Mr. Creeley's San Francisco visit, the touring exhibition
_In Company: Robert Creeley's Collaborations_, focusing on his
collaborations with artists throughout his career -among them Georg
Baselitz, John Chamberlain, Francesco Clemente, Jim Dine, Robert Indiana,
Alex Katz, R. B. Kitaj,  Marisol, Susan Rothenberg, and Donald Sultan.  The
first exhibition to show these collaborative works together as a group, the
show opens September 1 at Green Library, Stanford University, and will be
on view through January 6, 2001.  The exhibition includes prints, drawings,
mixed media works, books, photographs, and correspondence.  Check the New
York Public Library's press for the show
http://www.nypl.org/admin/pro/press/creeley.html, and at Stanford,

Maria:   Exactly the right question.  How about:  Shakespeare, Blake, Whitman
. . . Plath . . . Weiner (--with her, I mean, is the writing so entropically
dedifferentiated that we respond to it, finally, as an *aggression*--erotic
or otherwise?  What do you think?).  But, of course, I don't think that the
entropy I mentioned in my earlier post is necessarily a negative thing.  As a
matter of fact, Scalapino and Harryman (in particular), are among my very
favorite contemporary poets.  In their work, "lethargy," to quote Robert
Smithson, is, arguably, "raised to [a] glorious magnitude."  Unfortunately,
they both have a didactic streak that, when it kicks in (as a defense,
perhaps, against their own potential complicity w/ the prevailing *cultural*
entropy and decadence of our fin de siecle) makes their work a lot less
interesting & fun--for me at least.

Second Multi-Literary Event at the Flying Saucer Cafe!


Alan and Nada are pleased to announce the second event in a new
reading/video series in Brooklyn

        at The Flying Saucer Cafe
        at 494 Atlantic Avenue,
        between Third Avenue and Nevins

        Friday, November 3, 8:00 p.m.:

        ****Brenda Iijima and Tom Zummer****

Brenda Iijima is the author of _Person(a)_  and _Epitome_ (Portable Press).
Iijima is presently designing a community project to take place Saturday,
November 18th from 10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. in Prospect Heights.  A
self-guided tour visits ten stoops, each exhibiting a poem from her series
titled _STEP_.

Thomas Zummer is "...one of the most protean and perplexingly multi-
tasking artists currently at work in America...", according to Adrian
Dannatt in The Art Newspaper., "...a underground legend"  in certain
corners of the New York art and literary arena. Zummer will read from old
and new, published and unpublished texts. Included will be excerpts from
"What the Hell is That?,"  "The Computer as a Blunt Instrument," "Dispar-
ity of Scale in Cinematic Taxa," and "Road Movie." There will also be a
projected video piece in conjunction with the reading.

How to get there:  Take the 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or D or Q to the Atlantic
Subway stop and walk underground to the Pacific Street exit (at the N or R
or M Pacific Street Stop) or take the B or N or R or M - in any case, go
out the Pacific Street Exit (right exit), take a right - at the end of the
block you will be on Atlantic Ave. Take a left on Atlantic, and about two
and a half blocks down, between Third and Nevins, you will find the Flying
Saucer Cafe.

Members may be interested in the following Press release from CAL Australia:

_________________

Record $21.4M available for copyright owners

  Thousands of authors, journalists, artists, publishers and other
copyright owners will be eligible to claim more than $21 million from
Copyright Agency Limited's distribution of copying licence fees this year,
CAL's Chief Executive, Michael Fraser, announced today.

  "CAL, a not-for-profit copyright management company, began distributing
payments to copyright owners in 1989. Since then we have made available
more than $130 million to our members for copying of their works," he said.

  "This year's record $21.4 million declaration represents a new benchmark
in CAL's history of successfully managing rights clearances on behalf of
hundreds of thousands of creators and producers.

  "At least twice a year, CAL declares the sum we can distribute to CAL
members, based on licence fees we collect from organisations which copy
text and images. Extensive surveys of our licensees' photocopying practices
identify who is eligible to receive payment from CAL," Mr Fraser said.

  "This week we will begin notifying more than 4,000 rights owners that
they may claim their share of $17.5 million from our mid-year distribution,
which was collected from school, university, TAFE (Technical and Further
Education) and church copying licences.

  "The data which forms the basis of the 2000 mid-year distribution was
drawn from almost 75,000 copying records, which identify nearly 7.3 million
copied pages.

  "CAL members who earn the most from our copyright management include
authors of school and university textbooks, journalists and publishers.

  "In this distribution, 41% of recipients are 'author' members of CAL (a
category which includes writers, journalists, artists and photographers)
and 58% are 'publisher' members. The other 1% [one per cent] of recipients
are other collecting societies or rights owners who cannot be identified at
this stage.

  "CAL is clearly doing the job it was established to do. We return more
than 80% of the licence fees we collect to our members, a figure that
compares very well with local and overseas copyright collecting societies,"
he said.

  "However, one of our challenges is identifying and making contact with
all eligible author, artist and publisher recipients.

  "Many of the rights owners identified in our surveys are not yet members
of CAL but we will keep trying to contact these recipients and invite them
to apply for membership.

  "Also, some of the records of photocopying we receive are incomplete,
while in other cases it can be very difficult to locate people who have
moved. CAL will continue to research these records in a bid to identify and
pay rightsowners.

  "All authors and publishers who control the rights in their works are
eligible to apply for membership of CAL and claim payment if their work
appears in CAL's copying records.

  "Non-members considering joining CAL to claim their share of a
distribution should bear in mind that membership is free and there is no
assignment of rights to CAL," Mr Fraser said.

There's a three part documentary on Cesaire made by the same woman who
directed "Sugar Cane Alley" -- It is available on three video cassettes for
a reasonable sum -- has much valuable footage and extensive interviews
(though not enough on poetry for my taste)

I'm definitely in the LorEEn camp. I've never heard it pronounced any other
way. As for NiedIcker or NiedEcker -- there I've heard some controversy.

Jumper -- My personal God of poetry is Ted Berrigan and his work of sonnets.
These pieces (80+) were written then cut apart line by line and repasted to
provide a new meaning to the poem. God are they great!!! Check 'em out!

Ever & affectionately

Subject: Re: Post Neotextualism


"Class is responsible for sexism," says Marx;
however, according to Brophy, it is not so much
class that is responsible for sexism, but rather
the failure, and thus the meaninglessness, of
class. But if capitalism holds, we have to choose
between semanticist socialism and prematerial
textual theory. If one examines neodialectic
nihilism, one is faced with a choice: either
accept capitalism or conclude that concensus is a
product of communication. The subject is
contextualised into a cultural desemioticism that
includes truth as a totality. However, the
characteristic theme of the works of Pynchon is a
self-fulfilling paradox. In the works of Pynchon,
a predominant concept is the distinction between
closing and opening. Capitalism holds that
culture is part of the failure of language. It
could be
said that d'Erlette suggests that we have to
choose between subcapitalist nationalism and
dialectic appropriation. The main theme of
Parry's analysis of dialectic nationalism is the
bridge between society and sexual identity.
Foucault suggests the use of capitalism to
challenge class divisions. However, Sontag uses
the term 'posttextual dialectic theory' to denote
not, in fact, theory, but subtheory. If
capitalism holds, we have to choose between the
neotextual paradigm of concensus and
deconstructivist precapitalist theory. Thus,
Sartre promotes the use of semanticist socialism
to deconstruct and analyse society. Several
narratives concerning capitalism exist. It could
be said that Marx uses the term 'dialectic
nationalism' to denote the role of the reader as
observer. The subject is
interpolated into a semanticist socialism that
includes truth as a whole. Therefore, Lyotard
suggests the use of dialectic nationalism to
challenge hierarchy. An abundance of discourses
concerning the difference between class and
sexuality may be discovered. In a sense, Derrida
promotes the use of capitalism to read class.
A number of narratives concerning dialectic
nationalism exist. It could be said that
d'Erlette implies that we have to choo se between
capitalism and the patriarchial paradigm of
narrative. Any number of theories concerning the
fatal flaw, and eventually the futility, of
neocapitalist society may be revealed. However,
the subject is contextualised into a
dialectic nationalism that includes art as a
paradox. Dialectic discourse and subcultural
dialectic theory. "Sexual identity is used in the
service of capitalism," says Foucault; however,
according to Tilton, it is not so much sexual
identity that is used in the service of
capitalism, but rather the stasis, and subsequent
paradigm, of sexual identity. The primary theme
of the works of Eco is the common ground between
class and sexual identity. It could be said that
the futility, and eventually the fatal flaw, of
subcultural dialectic theory prevalent in Eco's
Foucault's Pendulum is also evident in The
Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas, although in a more
mythopoetical sense. Marx's essay on Lacanist
obscurity holds that the Constitution is capable
of truth. Thus, Bataille uses the term 'dialectic
nationalism' to denote a dialectic whole. Many
dematerialisms concerning subcultural dialectic
theory exist. However, the main theme of
Cameron's model of capitalist discourse is the
futility, and therefore the absurdity, of
neotextual society.

Of course, I could be wrong and invite List input
on the matter.

I've always heard LorEEn.

On the other hand, I've never heard any consensus around whether it was
KNEE-decker or NIGH-decker.

        entropy--it depends what sense of it one has in bringing it
up--entropy of the body toward the passive (?)----meaning saying
dying--"unto death"?

        on the other hand, via negentropy, "order out of chaos" as
Prigogine and Stengers have it in their book of that title--

        a regeneration of the body--

        yet how can one diminish that which is as yet so vast, active and
as yet much unlearned?

        consider at any given moment all those sensations for which
one simply
has an awareness--via the body--and among even those which one does
have--and in the awareness becoming more aware and so ever move sensations,
"feelings" via organs all "coming in"--or being "touched"--

        even among these which are but the barest of beginnings of
awareness, how few of these as yet there are words for--(limitations of
discourse--)

        (the medical, the neurological, the biochemical, the police record,
the voice record, the photograph, etc--cat scans--you name it--sonar scans
of fetus, fingerprints, DNA prints----sounds of the womb--static sounds of
brain
activity?--neurological, statistical,  snapping of synapses --the whole work of Artaud
devoted to this--)

        (not to mention at any given moment simply the body in existence
operating at so many myriad levels--and among these the varying degrees of
one's attentions and awarenesses--and considerations, questionings,
thinkings, emotions with these--)("and i imagined for a moment that i
thought that i could feel it in my bones . . . ")

        (the Uncanny--)

        in that sense the very body one lives in is as yet--elusive,
extensive--productive of ever more energies as one becomes "attuned" to
them--

        the "out of body experience"--that is paradoxically experienced via
the body--

        there is no passivity in the body--as it is LIVING--so is
ACTIVE--and being active is hungry--the desire for/with/of desire, of
sensation--beocomes productive--

        then for those impatient and obsessed with "speeding" up the old
mechanism--the whole discourse of the prostheses, the machine extension of
the body beginning with Marinetti's Futurism, the Muybridge motion studies
applied to principles of Fordism, the disciplined body-machine of the
assembly line--Busby Berkeley choreographies and Stanislavsky and Meyerhold
experiments growing out of this--

        and from there on to the body as war machine--in Marinetti, the
works of Virilio and Deleuze and Guattari--throughout the 20th century
that dream of the pure "total war" death squad--and its relation to the
body--

        see for example Klaus Thewelit's 2 volumes, MALE FANTASIES
        or in Mishima's book SUN AND STEEL the intense erotic
aestheticization of the body's transformations via supersonic speeds
during ascension in a fighter jet--

        many other extensions of the eroticizing of the body via mystic
and shamanistic practises, use of various drugs--various systems handed
down for thousands of years in manuals of such training--(KAMA SUTRA
etc--)

        in performance scores--inclusive of much sound poetry and visual
poetry--the notation there for the body--to become totally involved in the
performance-- which brings an opening out from confines of discourse--

        (see Karl Young's essay "Notation and the Art of Reading" for
example at Light and Dust
http://www.thing.net/~grist/homekarl.htm)--
(whih also has the question of speed, in the sense of "speed reading")

        poet/artist speed may also move even faster--via as Smithson
notes: that the
glance of a great artist--might in itself be the work of art--

        (that is, not constrained by art discourse and its attendent
galleries, categories, ownerships, the actual "object" which is to be
"possesed" --literally--and gven a "value", a "price" --))

        also in Malevich's writings re Suprematism--that at some point
intuition of the artist is faster than the speed of light

        ("intuition is intelligence speeding"--a quote Virilio notes--)

        a very good study was made in early 1970s (pre dating the work
with negentropy) by Rudolf Arnheim:  ENTROPY AND ART

        though the concept in itself is very ancient:

        The world as we see it is passing   --St Paul

        The most beautiful world is a heap of rubble tossed down in
confusion    --Heraclitus

         via poetry and art, there is the awareness of
the
myriad possibilities, potentialities--of body--opening outwo/ards and
inwo/ards--

        whereas in discourse, is continually the effort at
institutionalization in myriad confining forms

        "found" this rummaging in bookstore:

        (from "Guide to Found Arts" by Bern Porter)


        Persons who feel, comprehend, know, understand through their eyes
        find great excitement in the found arts.

        Persons who comprehend, know, understand through their minds find
        it a total dud of nothing and walk off without so much as giving
        half a try.

        Persons whose five senses are not dulled, bruised, warped,
        wounded by the terrible forces inflicted upon them from the
        outside can feel and know through their eyes, fingers, nose, ears
        and taste.

        etc

        though I would say that hopefully the direction is such that the
mind/body as seperate entities--that the dichotomy be "done away with" and
is more of a working together of "both/ and"--

        in the end, though sight seems to be much privileged often--it is
really all the senses that are engaged with the energy--
which is not entropic, but continually making that movement of "order out
of chaos" and back into chaos and back out again and so on--that Prigogine
and Stengers note--

        when the awareness of energy is developed, then one has that sense
with Smithson, that the movement of a pebble of an inch over millions of
years, is indeed excitement enough--

        (or Emily Dickinson noting that in crossing her room she has
traveled to the faraway Islands--)

        the sensing body (and its making as art poetry etc--) is "energy
made visible" for example as Pollock the painter had it--

        in that sense, the entropy of an encroaching passivity or "steady
state"--may be perhaps in the receiver--and not from the source--

        ("energy is eternal delight"--Blake)

        Your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency
        not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face
        and between the lashes of the eyes.


        and also:


        "my voice goes after what my eyes can't reach"

        --both from Walt Whitman

        it may be that the problem with the body and entropy is --of
course, it can be imposed--(and yet again be eluded--)--

        ("prison writings", "prison art"--works made in
instituitions--etc)

        is that  it is the perception of the onlooker/discourser or of
the very language itself, of the ("constructed") perception which  one is
given to work
with, is in the entropic state, becoming passive, static, confining,
etc--but this does not indicate that that which exists apart from these
means at hand  is in itself entropic--

        in this very sense of uncertainty at the core of
perception/discourse--is the very evidence of its being "open to
question"--

        opening inwo/ards and outwo/ards--

POETRY CENTER 2000
The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

An evening with poets
ED ROBERSON & NATHANIEL MACKEY
Thursday, October 19, 7:30 pm, $5 donation
@ the Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary)

ED ROBERSON's wonderful new book, _Atmosphere Conditions_ (Sun & Moon,
2000), was selected by Nathaniel Mackey for publication in the prestigious
National Poetry Series.  "Atmosphere, omen, memory, lost amenity,
homelessness of more than one sort, instantaneity, cityscape, housing of
more than one sort, dream, social entropy, music, dance, death-these are
among the matters which move through the poems with revenant, mercurial
dispatch. . . .  work of unremitting mindfulness and reach."  His _Voices
Cast Out to Talk Us In_ was winner of the 1995 Iowa Poetry Prize, and _Just
In/Word of Navigational Challenges: New and Selected Poems_ was published
by Talisman Books.  Mr. Roberson lives in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

NATHANIEL MACKEY's latest book of poetry is _Whatsaid Serif_ (City Lights),
an extension of the long poetic work he calls "Song of the Andoumboulou."
His third novel, _Atet A.D._ (forthcoming from City Lights), likewise
continues Mr. Mackey's engagement in an on-going, epic-length work, in this
instance the epistolary fiction "From a Broken Bottle, Traces of Perfume
Still Emanate."  _Discrepant Engagement_, a critical work exploring
conjunctions between radical Black poetics of recent decades and the New
American Poetry, is new in paperback from the University of Alabama.  Mr.
Mackey edits _Hambone_ magazine, and lives in Santa Cruz, where he teaches
literature at UCSC.

Soon to be moved out of its room in Jamaica Plain into a bigger room in
Jamaica Plain but available whenever for those interested in what it has to
offer, we give you Both Magazine (http://www.bothmagazine.com), an indigest
of scattered literature, that despite its indigestion, is always hungry.

V 1.0 includes the following business:

*A story from Todd Dills,  editor of Chicago based one sheet publication
the2ndhand (http://www.the2ndhand.com).

*Four stories from Walt Foreman (see also Ploughshares and the Ontario
Review)

*Three poems from Alexander Phillips, whose translations of Pierre Martory
can be seen in this month's issue of Poetry.

*A half hour in the life of Matt Velick, interface designer by force and
editor of http://www.greasefire.com by choice.

*Four poems by Nashville wonder, Chris Jackson.

*And of course, our Letters section which, volume permitting, will grow fat
every few days with whatever you'd like to say about whatever you would say
what you said about.

Submissions are welcome via e-mail (for now, see the About section) as text
or preferably as MS Word documents. Both will appear in printed form twice
per year, for paper is good, and we shouldn't waste yours. Do stop by, and
thank you for your time.

Subject:      RealPoetik Notes: Two New Little Mags of Note

Two new little magazines worthy of note, one hardcopy (!) the other an
ezine.  Both actually read incoming mss., both are pretty eclectic, and
both of high quality.  Well worth a look, a subscription, a submission.

Fence is hardcopy, increasingly scarce, from SUNY at Buffalo (but not,
apparently, devoted exclusively to the works of Charles Bernstein and
Bruce McAndrews and their wide circle of tenured and tenure track
friends).  They can be reached at http://www.bookmouth.com for a brief but
incisive interview. Or for a
longer version of the story, go to
http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket12/wolffe-fence.html.  The current
issue includes: poems and short fiction and criticism and art by (in
exhaustive alphabetical order by first name): Andy Mozina, Alice Rose
George, Allen Grossman, Amy Woolard, Anne Carson, Belinda Kremer, Ben
Doyle, Ben Marcus, Brenda Coultas, Brian Young, Chris Offutt, Christine
Deavel, Claire Malroux, Corey Mead. Daniel Kane, David Kellogg, Eben Wood,
Eleni Sikelianos, Ellen Sharp, Fanny Howe, Hilary Plattner, Iris Jamahl
Johnson, Jaime Saenz, James Galvin, Jean Valentine, Jonathan
VanBallenberghe, Karen Volkman, Katy Lederer, Kim Anno, Lacy L. Schutz,
Melanie Bogue, Miranda Field, Monica Youn, Pamela Zoline, Paula Fox,
Rachel
Zucker, Rae Armantrout, Ray DiPalma, Rick Moody, Robyn Schiff, Ross
Martin,
and Sophie Cabot Black and special Features: A Call for Response:
Symposium on Subjectivity and Style (Mark Doty, Claudia Rankine, Marie
Howe, Nick Flynn, Tony Hoagland, Leslie Scalapino,
Standard Schaefer, Annie Finch, Eileen Myles, Juliana Spahr, and more)

Also, if you're in the NYC area, celebrate the new issue at a launch
reading Wednesday, October 25th, 8 pm Teachers & Writers Collaborative 5
Union Square West Featuring Forrest Gander, D.A. Powell, and Elizabeth
Robinson $8 or $12 for a year's subscription Wine Afterward.


On the ezine side, do check out www.canwehaveourballback.com, a
wonderfully lively little mag out of SUNY.  Contributors to the current
(#2.0) issue include Richard Hell, Charles Bukowski, Sal Salasin, Ed
Foster, Charles Bernstein (!), Mitch Highfill and many others.  A fun
little magazine worthy of support.

Announcing RUST TALKS 3: "Difficult Beginnings"

        RICHARD DEMING and ROBERTO TEJADA

        Thursday October 26, 2000
        8 pm
        Rust Belt Books
        202 Allen Street
        Buffalo, NY


Rust Talks is a dialogue with contemporary writers. The Rust Talks
newsletter (locally available in hard copy at Rust Belt Books; to be
published later on our website) features a discussion between two literary
artists, either responding to each other's work or concerning a topic in
contemporary poetics. "Rust Talks," the event, will present a reading or
performance by the authors, followed by a discussion which extends the
conversation to the audience.

Richard and Roberto's exchange focuses on poetry & politics and includes
discussions of Zukofsky, Rorty, Benjamin, Levi Strauss, and others.

Who said young people these days don't care about poetry?

 From "The Australian" newspaper, Friday 20 October 2000:

"A group calling itself Young People Against Poetry
protested outside the Brisbane Writers Festival yesterday,
declaring poetry frivolous and culturally divisive."

Brisbane is a city in the northern Australian state of Queensland.

Michael. But how do you know, after all, I am a postmodern thesis. That is,
if I'm not, then I'm a Post Modern Thesis Generator.Or I'm the idea of one.
The metonomy or the metalingwylealeology of one. Like Andy Warhol and maybe
Christopher Dewdney, and some of Charles Bernstein's fellow machines (I mean
fellows) I've always dreamed of being a machine. Not for me the romance of
being a rugged 6 foot 6 All Black (Rugby Player or sacred member of New
Zealand's most sacred Religion), or a Brad Pitt with bevvys of
luscious...no! Or even a Byron. No. All traces of squeamish and pathetic
lyricism have been expelled from my most mechanistic and possibly satanic
soul. I am, in fact, a Machine.
  In fact I suspect that the entire Language movement was initiated by a
beautifully demented Machine. Lets get back to the the glorification of The
Machine. Futurists and Mechanicists of the world Unite! Four legs weak, two
legs bad, no legs good. Yours, The Red Machine.

    American Gulag=20
by Jerome G. Miller=20

The figures are startling. In the last year of the Carter administration=20
(1979), our nation=92s federal prisons held about 20,000 inmates. By contra=
st,=20
as the Clinton administration draws to a close we will have 135,000 inmates=
=20
in federal prisons; projecting an annual growth of 10 percent the number wi=
ll=20
reach a quarter million in five years. In 1979, there were 268,000 inmates =
in=20
the prisons of all 50 states. Today, they hold almost 1.3 million. In 1979,=
=20
there were 150,000 in local jails and lockups. Today, local jail facilities=
=20
hold nearly 700,000. This year, we will exceed 2 million inmates in our=20
prisons and jails. As we enter the millennium, the nation has about 6.5=20
million of its citizens under some form of correctional supervision.=20
And a new twist has been added: the =93supermax=94 prison composed exclusiv=
ely of=20
cells used for solitary confinement. A place of studied sensual deprivation=
=20
and psychological torture, it was designed by correctional managers to=20
control their populations as privileges in routine prisons were diminished=
=20
and sentences were lengthened. A product less of management necessity than =
of=20
a twisted psyche, these temples to sado-masochism now dot the American=20
landscape, presently containing 20,000 mostly minority inmates.=20
Spurred on by a =93drug war=94 that focuses inordinately upon the poor and=
=20
minorities, we have seen astonishing patterns of incarceration among young=
=20
black men vis =E0 vis similarly accused white men. Although the rates of dr=
ug=20
consumption are roughly equal among white and black populations, blacks are=
=20
imprisoned for drug offenses at 14 times the rate of whites.=20
The patterns in some states are truly astonishing. Between 1986 and 1996 fo=
r=20
example, the rate of incarceration for drug offenses among African American=
s=20
increased by 10,102 percent in Louisiana; in Georgia, by 5,499 percent; in=
=20
Arkansas 5,033 percent; in Iowa 4,284 percent; and in Tennessee 1,473 perce=
nt.
There are currently more than 50 million criminal records on file in the US=
,=20
with at least 4 to 5 million =93new=94 adults acquiring such a record annua=
lly.=20
This record sticks with a person, whether or not charges are dropped or the=
re=20
is a subsequent conviction. A notorious example occurred in the recent poli=
ce=20
killing of Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed young Haitian immigrant. In an=20
attempt to rationalize the police behavior, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani=20
characterized the deceased as =93no altar boy=94 and released a =93criminal=
 record=94=20
that included two past convictions for =93disorderly conduct=94 and a juven=
ile=20
charge that had been dismissed over two decades earlier when Dorismond was =
13=20
years old.
For certain racial and ethnic groups, being arrested and locked up is a=20
given. Beginning in adolescence, we have established a warped =93rite of=20
passage=94 for young African Americans and Hispanics; only by a fluke will =
they=20
avoid acquiring a =93criminal record=94 =97 the result of an arrest.=20
In 1990, the nonprofit Washington, DC=96based Sentencing Project found that=
 on=20
an average day, one in every four African-American men ages 20=9629 was eit=
her=20
in prison, in jail, or on probation/parole. Ten years later, the ratio had=
=20
shrunk to one in three.=20
Research conducted by the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives=
=20
revealed that more than half of young black males living in Washington, DC,=
=20
and Baltimore are caught up in the criminal justice system on an average da=
y=20
=97 either in prison, jail, on probation or parole, out on bond, or being=
=20
sought on a warrant.
Three of every four (76 percent) African-American 18-year-olds living in=20
urban areas can now anticipate being arrested and jailed before age 36. In=
=20
the process, each young man will acquire a =93criminal record.=94 By the la=
te=20
1990s, federal statisticians were predicting that nearly one of every three=
=20
adult black men in the nation could anticipate being sentenced to a federal=
=20
or state prison at some time during his life.=20
The most telling numbers of all are contained in a US Justice Department=20
historical breakdown of admissions to state and federal prisons over the pa=
st=20
century. Although African Americans were always over-represented (often for=
=20
reasons unrelated to crime rates), the racial gap grew exponentially as we=
=20
approached the millennium. In 1926, whites made up 79 percent of the inmate=
s=20
entering our state and federal prisons. Blacks made up 21 percent. By 1999=
=20
however, African Americans were making up between 55 percent and 60 percent=
=20
of all new admissions to state and federal prisons. If Latino inmates are=
=20
included, slightly over three out of four Americans sentenced to federal or=
=20
state prisons were minorities.
This fact has brought a sea change in public attitudes regarding crime and=
=20
criminals and ushered in the era of the =93rhetorical wink,=94 characterize=
d by=20
Lani Guinier, whereby a white politician can talk about getting tough on=20
=93criminals=94 and, with a wink, convey to the audience =93black criminals=
=2E=94 Race=20
need never be mentioned.=20
The uncomfortable truth is that the national attitude on crime is more firm=
ly=20
grounded in race than in putative crime rates. The surge in crime rates=20
occurred between 1965 and 1973. The general trend since that time, with=20
=93blips=94 in 1989 and 1991, has been for crime to either remain stable or=
 to=20
decline.=20
While most people assume jail overcrowding results from rising crime rates,=
=20
increased violence, or general population growth, that is seldom the case.=
=20
Here, in order of importance, are the major contributors to jail overcrowdi=
ng:
1. The number of police officers
2. The number of judges
3. The number of courtrooms
4. The size of the district attorney=92s staff
5. Policies of the state=92s attorney=92s office con-
cerning which crimes deserve the most attention
6. The size of the staff of the entire court system
7. The number of beds available in the local jail
8. The willingness of victims to report crimes
9. Police department policies concerning arrest
10. The arrest rate within the police department
11. The actual amount of crime committed
It is common for a =93trickle-up effect=94 to set in. Although there may be=
=20
little or no change in the ways serious crimes are handled, those who engag=
e=20
in minor infractions of the law end up receiving harsh penalties as well,=
=20
thereby =93casting the net=94 of social control ever wider. Such matters sh=
ould=20
give the nation pause as we move aggressively to build more prisons and=20
camps, but there is little to suggest any respite.=20
The distinguished British criminologist Andrew Rutherford summarized the=20
trend well: =93All natural tendencies toward stability appear to have=20
evaporated. Not only has there been a quantum leap of unprecedented=20
proportions in prison populations, but there appear also to be no indicatio=
ns=20
of any counter forces which might impose limits.=94=20
Carnegie-Mellon criminologist Alfred Blumstein put it another way: =93Once=
=20
criminal policy in the United States fell into the political arena, little=
=20
could be done to recapture concern for limiting prison populations. ... Our=
=20
political system learned an overly simplistic trick: when it responds to su=
ch=20
pressures by sternly demanding increased punishments, that approach has bee=
n=20
found to be strikingly effective, not in solving the problem, but in=20
alleviating the political pressure to =91do something=92.=94
To many, the =93tough on crime=94 attitude seems a good thing =97 a return =
to basic=20
values, a focus on the rights of victims, an adieu to the =93bleeding heart=
=94=20
policies of the past. Overall, the prevailing public mood on crime is vicio=
us.
I recently watched a video of a =93focus group=94 on crime conducted by a=
=20
Republican pollster and consultant. In discussing a recent shooting of a=20
teacher by a 13-year-old African-American middle-school honor student, the=
=20
consultant asked the group what they would do in such a case. Their respons=
e=20
seemed even to embarrass him as he tried to smile away the comments of this=
=20
scientifically chosen =93average=94 group of local citizens. =93Fry him!=94=
 came the=20
insistent shouts from the group as the 13-year-old=92s situation was being=
=20
presented. Only one older African-American man remained silent.=20
I wanted to avert my eyes from the TV. It brought to mind another mood=20
observed by the Danish sociologist Svend Ranulf when he looked across the=
=20
border into the Germany of the early 1930s to see how that country proposed=
=20
dealing with criminals and crime. =93Everywhere=94 he saw a =93disintereste=
d=20
disposition to punish.=94 He called it =93disinterested=94 because =93no di=
rect=20
personal advantage seemed to be achieved by calling for the harsh punishmen=
t=20
of another person who had injured a third party.=94 Noting that this puniti=
ve=20
inclination was not equally strong in all human=20
societies and was entirely lacking in some, Ranulf concluded that it did no=
t=20
arise out of concern for deterrence. Rather, it was a kind of =93disguised=
=20
envy,=94 less a response to an increased crime rate than tied to the econom=
ic=20
insecurities of the middle class.
Indeed, the anti-crime program undertaken in accordance with the principles=
=20
of National Socialism and proposed by the Prussian minister of justice in=
=20
1933 seems oddly resonant today. Aggravated penalties were added to crimina=
l=20
acts already subject to punishment; mitigation was to be allowed in only th=
e=20
rarest and most exceptional cases; attempts at crime were to be dealt with =
as=20
severely as accomplished crimes; drunkenness was to be considered an=20
aggravating, rather than extenuating, circumstance; there was to be more=20
liberal recourse to capital punishment; and prisons were to be made harsher=
,=20
with disciplinary measures to be applied at the discretion of prison warden=
s.=20
Criticizing the alleged permissiveness of the Weimar Republic toward=20
criminals, the minister ended his white paper with a familiar slogan. =93It=
=20
seemed,=94 he wrote, =93that the welfare of the criminal, and not the welfa=
re of=20
the people, was the main purpose of the law.=94
Indeed, prisons and jails are an =93early warning system=94 of sorts for a=
=20
society. They constitute the canary in the coal mine, providing an omen of=
=20
mortal danger that often lies beyond our capacity to perceive.
The experience of the past two decades suggests that we are ignoring this=
=20
warning. We are in a curious position in which a surfeit of prisons filled=
=20
with a million minority young men is seen not as an embarrassment, but as=
=20
indispensable to the smooth running of our democracy and integral to its=20
economy. In effect, the attitude that suffused Southern jails and prisons=
=20
during post=96Civil War reconstruction has been replicated nationally.
For more than 20 years, our politicians have played the dangerous game of=
=20
one-upping each other over who can demand the harshest punishments. In this=
=20
pursuit, the definition of what is criminal, the relaxing of limits on the=
=20
police to enforce laws, and the mandatory use of prison over=20
non-institutional means of control or correction have been distilled to=20
carefully crafted marketing slogans like =93three strikes and you=92re out.=
=94=20
Offenders emerge from prison afraid to trust, fearful of the unknown, and=
=20
with a vision of the world shaped by the meaning that behaviors had in the=
=20
prison context. For a recently released prisoner, experiences like being=20
jostled on the subway, having someone reach across him in the bathroom to=
=20
take a paper towel, or making eye contact can be taken as a precursor to a=
=20
physical attack. In relationships with loved ones, this warped kind of=20
socialization means that problems will not easily be talked through. In a=
=20
sense, the system we have designed to deal with offenders is among the most=
=20
iatrogenic in history, nurturing those very qualities it claims to deter.
During the question period following a lecture to a college audience, the=
=20
social critic and linguist Noam Chomsky was recently asked why he was so=20
rarely seen on TV or on the =93op-ed=94 pages of our major news-papers and =
why he=20
wasn=92t among those asked to testify on policy matters before Congress. Th=
ere=20
seemed to be no dearth of commentary from the mavens of the Right, yet he w=
as=20
mostly absent from these forums.
Chomsky responded by describing a conversation he had with ABC/CNN=20
commentator Jeff Greenfield. Greenfield told him that he was unlikely to be=
=20
booked on a national program like =93Nightline,=94 for example, because he =
was=20
=93from Neptune.=94 Chomsky=92s views were too far =93outside the box=94 to=
 merit=20
discussion on a popular TV program. It had nothing to do with whether or no=
t=20
his ideas might be valid. It was because he couldn=92t be afforded the time=
=20
needed to lay out the context within which his views might be understood. F=
or=20
him to express his views absent their context put him in the company of tho=
se=20
who are from Neptune =97 out of touch, if not a bit loony.
Chomsky=92s predicament has a personal resonance. The =93context=94 of my=
=20
professional life over the past 35=A0years has been shaped by attempts to=
=20
create alternative programs for the inmates of detention centers, jails, an=
d=20
prisons. At the beginning, there was some general acceptance of the ideas I=
=20
tried haltingly to express through my work. However, hope for =93consensual=
=20
validation=94 of such efforts from peers and policy makers in the criminal=
=20
justice community has pretty much faded with the years, as a sense of=20
alienation pulls me ever closer to Neptune.

In Wisconsin, I've never heard her called anything other than LorEEn
NIGHdecker. That doesn't mean it's correct but it means something.

Well, I don't know.  Zukofsky, who was certainly close enough to her to know
how to pronounce her name (& who had an over-developed fondness for puns),
once wrote:

"Where She a breath
Comes out of drudgery
Notes a worked out knee deck her daisies"*

There you have it: "knee deck her."  Also, I believe (but am not sure) that
the daisy is a reference to her mother.  The drudgery is certainly a
reference to her working class circumstances.

I cannot understand how anyone could even think of pronouncing it
Lorine to rime with shine.

If that happens much more I think we should call in the marEYEnes.

Women, Spartans, and Dangerous Things


The Spartans sit down on hard rocks. They are beaten by their teachers.
Something is tearing their entrails apart. They want girls and boys. The
teachers beat them. Write about them.

They shoot arrows. They are women only. They kill males. They reproduce
though slaves. They kill slaves. They are fighters. They cut a breast for
the string. Their hair is dark. They love each other. They are brilliant.
When girls, a fox gnaws their entrails. They don't move. They are blood-
covered. They are glorious debaters. They have daemons. Write about the
daemons.

Daemons are little boys who love little boys. They whisper from nowhere.
They advise. They are brilliant. They give comfort to the body. They are
part of the body. Daemons speak the truth. Write about the truth.

The truth is they shoot arrows. They blind their prisoners. They cut the
hands off their prisoners. They pillage cities. They rape women and speak
babies. They rape children. Stars protect them. They are men. They grow
from soil sewn with dragon teeth. Their love is furious. Write about their
love.

All young girls made women by Gilgamesh - the priestess, the votaries, the
cult women. Even the fisherwomen's sleeves robes and long sleeves. Certain
older women wept secretly. The courtiers were bestowed from within the
misu. The women's dresses, women's clothes and rolls of brocade, a silver
clothes chest, and colours shone through the karaginu. The women's figures
also showed blue karaginu of a girl and were so beautiful that they made
us women clap our hands, but no one came. Some went to call the women
frivolous women, so those who wish to serve them and remain in favour are
light-hearted, unashamed, thoughtless women, and men who visit our women
may not be so. Even women of high birth must follow women, keeping us from
doing what otherwise we could do easily. But see and not be seen, hung
before great personages and women's other women surrounded with screens
and attendants, or by beautiful women, selected from various provinces for
their women - more of an animal presence. Around the fire were women.
Write about the women.

George. I was being a bit tongue in cheek,but I hasten to assure, not cheek
in tongue...or chutneypattz.... altho what I said was basically true. But
I'm re-reading a book called "Structuralism and Semiotics" by Terence
Hawkes. So I'm doing some "swat" (in genuine penance).Will also dip into
Jacobson etal.(chronusicus dispensicus). But in my "defence" - how many on
the list are excrutiatingly au fait with the various philosphers and
linguists. Where do you start or stop? I'll certainly be "boning up" on
Barthes and some other philosophers I've "neglected". But if I read the
"Idealist" philosophers then I surely must read Marx and to back him up
Kant,Hegel, Aristotle and then more recently Wittgenstein,(who liked St
Augustine who I have read but he didnt bother with Aristotle) Russell,
Whitehead. Then what about William James (not to mention I've havent read
much of his brother's writings(albeit he was a novelist)),and all the other
philosophers including the Empiricists and then a swing back to Heiddegger,
Berkley and Sartre.Then do I take in Husserl? A whirl with Husserl?Then what
about my Logic. Logic leads into cybernetics and mathematics and the
sciences. This leads me to religion and St Thomas Aquinas. Back to poetry -
sorry but I havent read all the poets of the C16th and C17th. Then there are
the many books on art theory...
  I dont think all your students are so much lazy as maybe many of them want
to do some living as well as struggle through the bewildering number  (and
nature of) the texts that confront them. I'm not being sarcastic as being
honest.
  To add to my Sisyphyean (dam, I haven't read Camus's "The Myth of
Syphilus...I mean Sysyphus) woes, a friend of mine who dabbles in philosophy
from the outside has sent me 3 great tomes: "Higher
Superstition","Intellectual Impostures", and "Enemies of Hope" (the last by
Raymond Tallis). These books all put the boot in to many of the modern
French theorists. So I'll have to read them (or part therof) to see where
they're coming from.(I did read Tallis's  "Not Saussure" but I was not so
sure about his Not Saussure (granted I agreed with him that even if one
could postulate an infinite deferral of signification (if that's what it is)
there was still an external "reality" -I'm simplifying the whole thing I
know but I'm not trained in philosophy or liguistics- and so on, but feel
that he "protesteth tooo much").
 But I did appreciate your comments on Jacobson and want to have a good look
(given time) at all these guys.Harold Teichmann assumes too much familiarity
by people of  or with Logic (especially what I think he is referring to
predicate logic(?) which is quite difficult if one hasnt dealt with it for
some years) but his comments look interesting.
 But I hope you were less offended than amused by my rather (humoresque?)
comments.
   One good thing, this "debate" or discussion has sent me back to "school"
and my books.
   Re Anna Karenina - after contemplating it "in tranquility" (whence it did
flash upon that inward eye), I recall being  puzzled by the book. Altho the
episode of Levin working with the peasants I thought was powerful writing.
But what was the function or relevance of the artist that A.K and Vronsky
visited? As for Brando - he is a master mumbler, I'm serious. In "Sreet Car
Named Desire" that's part of the power he brings to his role.
  By the way, I'm not a cat, so you dont have to be kind to me. And even if
I was a cat, how could I thus be described as lazy or inarticulate? Read
your Whitman!I have long, deeply informative, and fearfully intellectual
discussions with my cat. Unlike my ex it doesnt throw things at me.Nor,
mercifully, doth it deign to reply.Well, it does, but( in metacatalanguage):
it signals that laziness is one of those pathetic notions pculiar to the
merely human: for which its disdain is infinite. Such the regality of les
chats.(Such chats with cats).Regards, Richard.

characteristic theme of choose
between semanticist socialism and the patriarchial disciplined
body-machine of the

sensation--beocomes productive--

the use suggests that we have heap of rubble tossed body (and its I would
say that hopefully dud of nothing and walk in the receiver--and not from
faster than walk off without so much sense.)

The primary theme involved in the
performance-- which for
example at eyes, fingers, nose, of theories concerning the

discourse--)

The world eroticizing of itself, of the ("constructed") perception

Hi everyone, I am just home from wandering around NY city and state, reading
at the Poetry Project -- where I'd never been except in spirit -- and at
Rust Belt Books in Buffalo, and hanging out with fabulous folks such as my
coreaders Betsy Andrews and Arielle Greenberg, hosts Rachel Levitsky (who
gave me one of the last copies of her first chapbook, somewhere in Manhattan
around midnight, a real treat) and Linda Russo and Chris Alexander, as well
as Barbara Cole, Michael Burkard, Ange Mlinko, Jonathan Skinner, and more.
It was great to meet so many folks in non-cyber settings with cocktails
night air and everything. Now I'm home, chilling down and promoting SPT's
event this Friday, a reading by K. Silem Mohammad and Aaron Shurin, in our
new luxe spot at CCAC, and also asking you all to contact me at
smallpress@ccac-art.edu if you are interested in writing a short review for
our newsletter.... Elizabeth

from Mike, or that's what Mike claims it is, but Exquisite Corpse #7 seems to
have the jump on us by about two days.

Here's something slightly more, uh, expected, from Mike, if that's not an
oxymoron.  Mike can be reached at mike_topp@hotmail.com.

HE


He always brags about his huge duck.
He is a Woozle. His name is Peanut.
He enjoys pantaloons more than he should.
He is dead and therefore unable to come to the phone.

He has a figure like Marcia Brady.
He has an extra Y chromosome.
He has a really nice skull.
He has a face that makes no sense.

He is not worried; he is in the title.
He sure hopes that’s pudding.
He is surrounded by adoring housewives.
He tampered in God’s domain.

He is the clown who makes the dark side fun.
He tried to kill me with a forklift.

And unless this is another _Fence_, it's not from Buffalo.  It's in NYC
and I don't think Rebecca Wolfe was ever at Buffalo, was she?

Dear J. I dont think it was a vicious anti language poetics attack. I =
think they made a misprint or a typo: by some associational or =
psychological slip they meant to write: tethered.(Not "tenured") And =
some how the rest is lost but its to do with the magazine's title. So I =
think everythings o.k. for now. I hope that clears that little matter =
up. Richard.

This brings back the giddy heyday of Ladies Against Women, which seems
poised to have a resurgence in the Shrub years. "Abolish the
environment. It takes up too much space, and is almost impossible to
keep clean."

behold the violence wracking the slim planet time and time again
behold the ideologies of froth insect-minds carrying on this violent work

the divide is immeasurable and writing this a man is dead, has died
immeasurable space, writing this a woman, dead, all women and all men

all have died thereunto behold until, at the very lip of time
all are dying at every instance thereunto, behold, at such lips of space

archives grate against archives and we are blind behold thereunto until
archives collapse are gathered among the dead and those of all are dying

behold the instance of the very lip of time and its irritation

thereunto men are dying amidst the lips of vastness, time and space

until thereunto women dying, all are bleak, until, begone

Blaze 21st Century Voice
www.vorplesword.com


Salutations

 So he elbow’s me and start’s in on his cat again. How she’s on the
internet all the time digging up all kinds of crazy europorn and
developed from somewhere a strange snuff habit. How she got into the
stuff he doesn’t know but he suspects his neighbor’s cat Taffy.

This was the voice that heralded the new beginnings of a new year,
decade, century and millennium festivities. I alone, caught away from
friends on a train riding home from a dull New Years party forced to
listen to his man jabbering on with his crazy talk. This was the voice
of the new era blabbering on and on

But it’s the snuff alright and she must be at it all the time the way
he’s going on about it. He certainly didn’t approve of his little baby,
a caramel colored kitty getting hooked to powdered tobacco. I gathered
she snorted it off a paw, not the floor.
Who’d figure it.

This was the 21st century voice and it had me by the elbow

It’s one thing, he says, when she uses his credit card to order gritty
litter or those damn tinkling toys from pets.com and its another thing
entirely to go out with god knows who’s cat to buy a few tins with money
stolen from may wallet. I know, he says, that’s why you hid it from me …
I know. But why snuff? What’s wrong with smoking. Its more American than
falafel.

As I listened on as the unwitting wedding guest wishing Life and Death
would gambol everything away … for all the mediaspun paranoia-hype to
unfurl its leathery black wings, unleash its energies in a kinetic
explosion any terrorists would gleem for … right here … right now … in
the LaSalle St. Station … cleanse us all, destroy us …
 all from this boring bantering voice of mediocrity.

Oh I should talk I know, me with my beer. But who do sells this stuff to
a one year old cat, is what I want to know. And you know this will only
lead to other inhalants, you know that don’t you. I heard it on NPR.
Teenage boys who sniff tobacco ultimately spin off to cocaine, a natural
progression of sorts. And if I can’t afford to use the stuff you don’t
think I’m going to foot the bill for a cat’s coke habit. He pauses,
It’ll be the SPCA rescue service after her then out on the streets
strung out …

And so disappointed by this heralding angel, guardian of the new
century, I decided to explore who, what, this new century could offer.
To beat the ground with a buffalo
     I offer you Blaze
An electronic journal of the 21st Century Voice. A vision as it were, of
a low cost medium seeking you in wide open spaces. Using new devices
whose names are acronyms posing as nouns. This is the voice of the new …
and I invite you to explore whatever it is we find. This, our first
issue is a dedicated to Ernst Jandl, who died on June 9th, 2000. Jandl’s
voice exemplifies all that is possible. Opening the field for exploring
the symbols we communicate with. I believe this is an appropriate
remembrance with which to begin.

Ever & Affectionately,
Geoffrey Gatza

Wednesday, November 1st at 8 pm
JOHN ASHBERY AND BERNADETTE MAYER
Widely regarded as the foremost contemporary poet writing in English, John
Ashbery received the Pulitzer Prize in 1975 for his collection Self-Portrai=
t
in a Convex Mirror and has also been the recipient of awards from the
Guggenheim and MacArthur Foundations. At the Poetry Project, he will be
reading from his new book of poetry, Your Name Here (Farrar, Straus and
Giroux). In addition to Your Name Here, Mr. Ashbery is the author of
nineteen other books of poetry, a volume of art criticism, a collection of
plays, and a novel, A Nest of Ninnies (1969), which he co-wrote with James
Schuyler. Following his reading, he will be signing copies of Your Name
Here. Poet, editor, publisher, and teacher Bernadette Mayer is the author o=
f
fifteen books, including The Golden Book of Words (1978), The Desires of
Mothers to Please Others in Letters (1994), Proper Name and Other Stories,
and her classic Midwinter Day, reissued by New Directions in 1999. Ashbery=B9=
s
poetry provided some of the early-career inspiration that led Ms. Mayer to
experiment with poetry in all its forms, thereby producing one of the
largest, most varied and scintillating oeuvres anywhere. "Bernadette Mayer
is one of the most original writers of her generation. Her work is full of
brilliant observation, humorous and sometimes astounding conclusions, and
amazing juxtapositions." =8BMichael Lally, The Washington Post


Friday, November 3rd at 8 pm
EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYTHING:
A WRITING WORKSHOP TAUGHT BY BERNADETTE MAYER
One of the most influential teachers of contemporary writing, Bernadette
Mayer has taught innovative writing workshops at the New School, the Poetry
Project, and Naropa University. (See additional info on Bernadette Mayer
above). This special workshop has been made possible by a generous grant
from the Jerome Foundation. Admission to this workshop is $7, $4 for
students and seniors, and $3 for Poetry Project members.

trouble is these young people were protesting against the
'establishment' literary festival scene, which have been taken over
by the publicity departments of major publishers.
young and new poets were expressing a need for a platform a forum
for their poetry.
as for the environment and space, well isn't it for that reason we
meet and speak in cyberspace, so that we don't take up physical
space.
i received a promotion and  moved into a new, smaller office at work,
but the computer that sits on the desk is much  more powerful than
the one i used to have. once you used to be judged by the physical
space you occupied, but now you are judged on the size of your ram.

For those of you who don't keep up with the very latest, I pass along this
wonderful piece from www.bettybowers.com.

George W. Bush Responds to Abortion Rumors

"Abortion is immoral.  And it was pretty damned expensive, too!"

DETROIT, MI (AP). George W. Bush appeared last night at a potluck supper
held by "Right to Life" in an elegant suburb of Detroit, Michigan. During
the dinner he was asked by Mrs. Wallace Summerstock to respond to reports
being circulated in liberal circles (but carefully avoided by America's
heretofore "liberal press") that Mr. Bush had impregnated an underage girl
and paid for her to have an abortion in Houston in 1970.

Mr. Bush, appearing somewhat surprised by the hostess' query, responded:
"Well, I'm a governor. That's what governors do. We govern. We make
decisions." When further pressed for an explanation about whether the
abortion had actually occurred, Mr. Bush laughed a bit and said: "Now, I'm
not going to get into responding to rumors like this. But I will say that
I have not paid for any underage girls to have abortions in 40 years. No,
of course, I meant 30 years. Well, let's make that 31 years just to be on
the safe side. And I have not done any of that cocaine stuff in 24 years
and four months and three days. And I have not been AWOL from the Air
Force in going on 28 years now. And I haven't cheated on my lovely wife
Laura in -- well, let's just say since before Bill Clinton cheated on his.
And, I'm proud to say, it's been quite a while since I danced on top of a
bar naked drinking tequila and shaking my ass and dick!"

Reports of Mr. Bush paying for an underage girl to have an abortion can be
traced back to Larry Flynt, who says he has four affidavits to support the
shameful allegation. Mr. Flynt is a dreadful smut peddler who will say
anything  even if it is true  to besmirch those who stand up for
traditional family values and the rights of the unborn. In the past, Mr.
Flynt has repeated horrible stories about Bob Livingstone, Newt Gingrich,
Helen Chenoweth, Dan Burton, and Henry Hyde having affairs and Bob Barr
paying for an abortion  all of which, while absolutely true, would have
been left unspoken by anyone from a good family.

Mrs. Bowers said to her dear friend Barbara Bush after hearing the news:
"Bar, I know we all agreed that we hated Bill Clinton so much we put an
idiot  I mean, anyone in the White House other than a Demon-crat, and I
won't have a word said against your son, but I ask you! A child molester?"
After reassuring Betty that the girl looked "almost legal," Mrs. Bush
further assuaged concern by pointing out: "Yes, George made his underage
lover kill their baby, but you have to understand, he was out of his mind
on cocaine at the time. There is a really good chance that he would never
make a fifteen year old do that now."

Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer responded by saying "Governor Bush has not
changed his position on abortion. He is no hypocrite. It was illegal when
he had it done and he wants it to be illegal for everyone else, too. Fair
is fair."

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Since you've all been so helpful with teaching ideas, here's another
class I'm planning that I'd welcome suggestions for.  The course is a
grad level creative nonfiction workshop.  Previous creative
nonfiction workshops have been taught with a thematic focus, so
following that lead, I've decided to focus on writing about the body.
I'll give some writing exercises focused around body stuff, which are
optional to people who'd prefer to work on ongoing projects.  I also
want to do some body-centered reading.  Ideas I have are David
Wojnarowicz, Frantz Fanon, and the anorexia/bulimia memoir Wasted.
Actually, many things come to mind, but I'd welcome suggestions.  I'd
like to look at a range of writings about the body: the body in
pleasure, the body in pain, the ailing body, the invaded body, etc.
Since this is creative nonfiction, the reading examples need to be
first person-y autobiographical-ish.  Formal innovation won't be
stressed, but won't be ignored either.  I'm particularly interested
in maintaining a cultural and racial range.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Dodie

bloody rich, and foofwa brought over a cdrom of recent work and i couldn't
even open the thing and tweaked and tweaked my aging equipment and it
wouldn't go right, not a bit of it, kept connecting and then saying not
enough memory and i don't even know if ram or rom but it feels like rem,
and i have these fucking fears late at night, now creeping and taking
over the day, i'll be left behind, no one will fucking bloody care, there's
no juice left in the machine, my hands are cut off, i can't fucking write

i want t3 t1 asdl dsl whatever, i can't hold your attention, i'm spoiled
beyond belief, my work's idiotic, about as old-fashioned as you can get
and still read the fucking stuff, if i drink myself to death i'll be real
famous, wait and see, "i knew him when," "he was always troubled," "he was
too pushy," "he was too neurotic," "he was a fucking asshole, should have
died a long time ago, can't write a fucking word that makes sense, could-

Annotations to a papppper


The messiness of hieroglyphic, ideogram, alphabet - as soon as signs are
constructed, the space between them becomes the focus of acceptable trans-
formations. Reference to Tran Duc Thao and gesture, Lakoff and embodied
gesture - Gregory Samson, however, talking about the ideogrammatic aspect
of human writing - isn't there too much emphasis here on anti-pictorial-
ism? especially since this leaves out a great deal of Japanese/Chinese
thought for example - One might relate this to a certain notion of the
machinic?  One might also inspect the _architecture_ of polytheisms, mono-
theisms - what sorts of disembodied intonations were established, say, at
Karnak? It may be an _aural_ history at work here, more than anything
else...  Why would it be impossible to read pictographic texts? Isn't this
a misreading of how the pictographic actually operates?  Throughout this I
keep going back to Einstein's remarks to Hadamard on the moving of blurred
shapes, almost as if formal mathematization were an afterthought...  You
might want to read my essay on Kyoko Date on the cdrom - I believe it's
called kyoko.txt and is in the /cdrom/books directory. She was created
using motion capture; the essay has been twice printed. This reminds me of
the work of Birdwhistell (sp?), labanotation, kinesics, etc.

                                The  Fat  Man

The slightest ledger of the still shadow is dominated    by the imagined =
   figure,   whose  face  we  never  see,   etching   graphic =
destructions - whose green gentlenesss is a new united states - but, =
quietly  by   tip toe   they  reach, by  dream  delusion,  the  central =
isn'tness. Yet the Creature in the  wicker    chair  and  the old dead =
rocker perform miracles. The hands crawl like scorpions. Nothing of this =
is know or remembered,   but the ball of brightnesss,   claiming centre =
ground,is learning it all again.The music at least is triangular.

Richard Taylor.         =20


Some thoughts:This has no reference whatsoever to Fat Man, which was the =
name of either the first or second or the first atomic bomb dropped. I =
discovered that later. The poem doesnt refer to anything per se but I =
think I was reading Robbet-Grillet's "Jealousy" which work (tedious as =
it is to read) I still find paradoxically "haunting"."Isntness" is meant =
to be in italics and I justify the poem, but cant do that on an email. =
Not sure why (I mean why I like using the justify facility). Just that =
the "justification" facility fascinates me.(Just that the?) What does =
anyone think? I dont know why I put "united states" inthere. (Probably =
trying to be clever) and I dont know why I put it in small letters. You =
might say, here's a bloke who doesnt know why or what he's doing and =
you'd be partly right! Also I decided in this "version" to start =
creature with a caital c. Capittalising like that i do some times right =
thru a poem. Eg "ball of brightness" nearly became a "thing". Not sure =
why I want to do that.I took out three "surely's" after "dominated" and =
between "reach" and "by dream delusion" before "perform". Also the last =
line was "The music is at least triangular". I cant see which way is =
better. Or is the idea of the "perfect poem" a false one? Could there be =
an infinite number of equally valid The Fat Man's ?!?? Let's do some =
poeticating!.Thanks.  Best wishes to all. Richard.

THAT APRIL by Bill Kushner
89 pages      ISBN 0-935332-1-1
Cover by Donna Cartelli     $10.00


THAT APRIL is a spectacular book. Bill Kushner writes poems
made out of fluttering wings. His poet walks the street reading
teeshirts, stays home & remembers "that there was an old man here
before me." He makes tea and toasts his own splendiforous aging.
These are such warm, horny, homey, lovely human poems. His
dying father crying "Hold me!" and a much much younger man
(Kushner's then lover) slip in and out of this collection of lyrics.
The world is a luminous empty human body changing hands or
souls. Reading this I don't feel alone, then I do.  Eileen Myles


In one of these wonderful notebook poems, Bill Kushner refers
to himself as a "humble gay visionary poet." He is exactly that, and
much more: a true poet of the fluid moment, of the ache of desire, of
rain-slick New York streets. A post-Stonewall Whitman, Kushner
surrenders himself to "the throes of a passion there is no cure for";
embraces, in his fleeting sky blue memos, "what can never be found."
His (and out) reward: "exquisite true sadness." The highest price.
David Trinidad


Kushner's sharp, high-pressure rhythms, syntax, and music risk
everything to turn "our absurd life" toward the ecstasies we're
promised and seldom get. Violent streets, his father's death, and
AIDS are seen with a passion that stops the spiral down and leaves
brilliant poetry in its wake. Pure alchemy.  Ed Foster


Bill Kushner is the author of NIGHT FISHING (1980), HEAD (1986), LOVE
UNCUT(1990) and HE DREAMS OF RIVERS (2000). His work has been anthologized
in UPLATE(4 Walls 8 Windows 1987), IN OUR TIME, THE GAY AND LESBIAN
ANTHOLOGY (StMartins 1989) and OUT OF THIS WORLD (Crown 1991) and has
appeared innumerous magazines. He is recipient of New York Foundation of
the Arts grant in poetry and lives in New York City.

Affective Fix


The effect of truth is one of infinite morass, of guilt, recrimination,
and regret. The condition of the effect is that of excessive depression,
bewilderment, exhaustion. There is guilt in not being drugged, not being
drunk, nonetheless carrying all the symptoms of inadequacy and addiction
on one's back. There is an anomic response as well, a general decathect-
ing across one's lived environment. It is impossible to struggle against
this without leverage.

A written howl of pain need not be worked into more than leaning forward
over the keyboard, fingers bent to the quick. But what is the point of
further dissemination, which produces only shame, exasperation, a loss
which need not have been encountered, need not have been part of the en-
counter whatsoever? The obverse of exhaustion and decathecting is the
alterity of the face, the other, the whisper or murmur, which does not
shake the world either ontologically or epistemologically; one remains
grounded in the inertness of his or her subjective dimension. Shame in
this regard is the fetishization of the real, which returns self to self.

The encounter, then, occurs on the plane of the subject; without chall-
enge, there is always already grounds for suit, the shame of finding one
pinned to the fabric of the world. Within the aegis of virtual subjectiv-
ity, there is the slightest escape among realms, using, mechanically, kill
or delete; within the encounter (fingers trembling in poverty, abjection,
humiliation), there is none such, except rage, bringing even more shame in
its path. Strike, and one is stricken; be silent - one is silenced.

"Thus I awake this Morrow among the missiles of Misfortune, fully unready
to try my Hand once again at Bourse or social Commerce; I remain full vic-
tim of Myself and what I have incurred. Let nothing remain of me for long;
I parse myself Anonymous, in the last Refuge and Hope of the scoundrel."

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The No Spray Coalition has been organizing New Yorkers against the
indiscriminate spraying of dangerous pesticides since the Giuliani
administration began bombarding New York City with toxic chemicals in
September, 1999. As a result of the spraying, there are few lobsters left in
the Long Island Sound or crabs in the Great South Bay, and fish kills by the
thousands in Staten Island's lakes. Tens of thousands of birds are dead that
had NOT tested positive for West Nile Virus -- what did they die from? Many
bees are dead as well, with shuddering consequences for cross-pollination
and the ecosystem.

Trucks have now sprayed every block in the city with Scourge (Resmethrin)
and Anvil (Sumithrin), factory-made pyrethroids mixed with suspected
carcinogen Piperonyl Butoxide. Helicopters sprayed Fyfanon ULV (Malathion,
96.5 percent concentrated) and pyrethroids.

None of these chemicals are ?safe,? contrary to the claims of Mayor
Giuliani; they are endocrine disruptors with long-term consequences for the
health and safety of the people of the New York region, let alone for the
lobsters, honey bees, butterflies, frogs and the water supply. Hundreds of
people, perhaps thousands, were sickened by the spraying last Autumn. New
studies indicate a relationship of Pyrethroids to breast and prostate
cancer, childhood leukemia, Multiple Sclerosis, and sperm count reduction.
And Malathion is again up for review before the federal Environmental
Protection Agency as a suspected human carcinogen.

In 1999 & 2000, city, state & federal officials recklessly charged forward
in this pesticide spraying effort without public input, environmental impact
studies, or declaration of emergency (hard to believe: No emergency had been
declared at any level of government concerning the West Nile Virus before
spraying began, mostly because it is a rare day in hell that the Virus will
cause anything more than a few sniffles, if that). The City officials
ignored the hundreds of individuals who were sickened in the short term by
the pesticide spray, whose asthma was severely exacerbated, who have
allergies or whose health is already compromised and cannot withstand this
toxic pesticide spraying. Meanwhile, the long-term consequences are unknown,
and potentially devastating. And yet, this year once again helicopters swept
down over children playing on ballfields in Staten Island and sprayed them
not once, but two and three times, as desperate parents raced to grab them
into their cars and off the fields. Similar incidents have been reported
throughout the City.

The entire operation has been coordinated out of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
anti-terrorist bunker he recently installed on the 22nd floor of the World
Trade Center. The Mayor has showed reckless disregard for the health and
safety of New York residents and visitors, as well as for the natural
environment.

The No Spray Coalition works to educate, inform, and take action to prevent
this misuse of pesticides which the Mayor says will continue next Spring,
unless the No Spray Coalition and other activists are successful in
preventing it. We've filed numerous Freedom of Information requests, and
testified at dozens of official hearings. On July 20, 2000, the No Spray
Coalition filed a lawsuit to stop the spraying. We've been gathering
affidavits from those affected by the spraying, have established a "hotline"
for information on all sorts of matters related to the spraying, and have
done numerous press conferences and tv and radio interviews, leafletted
parks and targeted areas, sponsored forums and teach-ins throughout the City
and have basically pulled together quite a disparate group of activists,
scientists, and spray "survivors". The lawsuit is still
underway, and attorneys Joel Kupferman (NY Law and Environmental Justice
Project) and Karl Coplan (PACE Environmental Law Clinic, directed by Robert
F. Kennedy, Jr.), are preparing additional papers to move the suit forward
under the Clean Water Act.

Dramatic video footage submitted to the Court documents the subcontractor,
Clarke Industry, indiscriminately sprayed people on the street, vegetable
stands, pregnant women, and children.
The No Spray Coalition, which is a not-for-profit corporation registered
with the State of NY, is in dire need of funds to pursue the lawsuit and
continue its work -- consequently, this fundraiser. We are proud that
Wetlands Preserve, with its long history of supporting environmental
struggles, has agreed to host this benefit.

San Francisco - New Langton Arts carries the theme of its current
exhibition "C2C" (Consumer to Capitalist) to the theater
when writer Dana Teen Lomax proclaims, "Value is socially determined and
what's it worth to ya?" Reading from her
manuscript "Currency" (2000), Lomax looks at money and sings such
showstoppers as "Meritocracy,"  "Trust,"
"Denominations" and "e pluribus unum". Yedda Morrison reads from her
manuscript "the Cherry Pickers" and from a
book-length work-in-progress created with NY based visual artist
Michelle Rollman temporarily titled, "My Life as a Body."

DANA TEEN LOMAX is currently a Poet-In-Residence at the WJA/Prison Arts
Project in Santa Cruz, CA. This year she
was selected as San Francisco Feature Poet for March in
City Search Local Howlers (citysearch.com). Her chapbook "Room" was
published in 1999 by a+bend Press, San
Francisco. Her poems have been published in "Instress", "Tripwire",
"Outlet", "yefief", and "Transfer 76", among other
periodicals. Lomax is the producer of LINK--Collaborative/Experimental
Performance Project that was presented at the
ODC Gallery in 1999 and received a Zellerbach Family Fund Grant.

YEDDA MORRISON was born in San Francisco where she continues to write
and paint. She is the founding editor and
publisher of "Tripwire, a Journal of Experimental Poetics," which she
co-produces with David Buuck. Her chapbook, "The
Marriage of the Well Built Head," is in its second printing from Double
Lucy Press, Berkeley. "Shed" is available from A +
Bend Press, San Francisco. "Apostasy" is forthcoming from Melodeon
Poetry Systems, New York. Morrison is a board
member at Small Press Traffic.

In the gallery, New Langton Arts presents C2C, a mall for the subversive
product. As consumer relationships become
redefined and repackaged by capitalist culture, as in B2B (Business to
Business), this NFP (Not For Profit) art gallery
presents C2C (Consumer to Capitalist) to reconsider those relationships.
Using the high gloss techniques and insidious
strategies of capitalism, these art workers create products that evoke
skepticism in place of desire. C2C calls into question
society¹s frenzied embrace of the new economy by employing methods of
appropriation and insurgent practice.

This reading is funded in part by Poets & Writers, Inc. through a grant
it has received from The James Irvine Foundation.

It seems that Bowering's been holding out on us. A link at Poetry Daily
led me to the _Edmonton Journal_ and the news that "George Bowering of
Vancouver is up for his third Governor General's Award for his poetic
memoir _His Life: A Poem_."

I first tried to find this book when Ron Silliman raved about it here,
calling it "a real find! Poems written based on diary notes from the
solstices and equinoxes (thus four per year) from '58 to '88. In
addition to the absolute loveliness of the writing itself, you can get a
real feel for a world that is just ever so slightly distanced from your
own . . . . It feels like a great gift to read."

SPD doesn't carry it but I ordered a copy last week at Chapters (a
Canadian booksite: http://www.chapters.ca/Books/) and evil Amazon seems
to have it as well.

Now all I want to know is, what in the name of Gilbert & Sullivan is a
Governor General?
