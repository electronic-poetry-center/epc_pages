Just so you're aware, one of the best known and most respected poets to
emerge from the TISH group was Daphne Marlatt. The period in question is the
60s, not the 50s.

Subject: Subtext/Seattle - George Bowering & Marion Kimes - 8/6/08

Subtext continues its monthly reading series with readings by George
Bowering & Marion Kimes at our new home at
the Chapel Performance Space on the 6th of August 2008.  Donations for
admission will be taken at the door on the
evening of the performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm.

George Bowering is a prolific Canadian novelist, poet, historian, and
biographer. He was born in Penticton, British Columbia,
and raised in the nearby town of Oliver, where his father was a high-school
chemistry teacher. His most recent books include
Baseball Love (Talonbooks, 2006), and Vermeer's Light: Poems 1996-2006.

Bowering is the best-known of a group of young poets including Frank Davey,
Fred Wah, Jamie Reid, and David Dawson who
were together at the UBC in the 1950s. There they founded the journal Tish.
Bowering lives in Vancouver, BC and is Emeritus
at Simon Fraser, where he has worked for more than 25 years. He describes
himself as a Protestant agnostic. In 2002, Bowering
was appointed the first ever Canadian Poet Laureate.

Marion Kimes brought her love of the live reading here in 1981.  Over the
years a fine pile of small-press books & broadsides
has accumulated beside a long list of readings, fests & projects.  Her books
include CROW'S EYES, of multiplication & light (Nine Muses),
Whirled, and NAMORATUNG'A (Woodworks).   She has been a driving force in Red
Sky Theatre for many years.

Dear Friends,

Today, August 1, is Chax Press's 24th birthday! We have also just =20
moved again.

Perhaps the best thing about moving is that we have moved into a =20
studio with room to pursue the work we were meant to do. Chax Press =20
is back to printing handmade works. We have two projects before us. =20
One is the first letterpress book we have made in two years, and it =20
will be the first widely affordable letterpress book we have made =20
since the mid-1990s. I sincerely hope it will mark a return to making =20=

the kind of book that is a fine art work that is also accessible to a =20=

good number of literary readers.

The letterpress book is Salt, My Love: A Ballad, by Patrick =20
Pritchett. Patrick is the author of our earlier trade paperback book, =20=

Burn: A Doxology for Joan of Arc. After years in Boulder, where he =20
was an active member of local and national/international poetry =20
communities, he is currently an adjunct faculty member at Harvard.

The other work we are printing coincides with a conference we are =20
sponsoring in early October titled Charles Olson: Language as =20
Physical Fact. As a part of the conference we are printing, framing, =20
and displaying handprinted broadsides of ten of the most visual of =20
Olson=92s famed Maximus Poems, with permission of the University of =20
California Press and the estate of Charles Olson. This display, along =20=

with other events of October 10-11, will constitute the most =20
ambitious public programming Chax Press has yet undertaken. The =20
conference will feature local and visiting poets, including Myung Mi =20
Kim, Anne Waldman, Cole Swensen, Steve McCaffery, Barbara Henning, =20
and Tenney Nathanson.

To accomplish the return to letterpress printing and to realize the =20
conference, we need your help. Letterpress papers, including handmade =20=

papers, are expensive. The letterpress book is not funded by any =20
grants or major gifts. The Olson conference has obtained support from =20=

the Arizona Commission on the Arts and the Tucson Pima Arts Council. =20
However, those grants require us to raise our own matching funds to =20
fulfill the amounts needed to support the conference.

In the past several years we have asked donors for special support on =20=

occasion, and for regular annual contributions once per year. In =20
doing so, we have concentrated on donors who could give $50, $100, =20
and more. We still will mount an annual campaign in the fall of 2008. =20=

But right now, for current purposes, we want to give more people the =20
opportunity to support these important, community-minded literary and =20=

artistic programs. We are seeking 200 donors who will each give us =20
just $20. Please be one of these donors, one of those who make fine =20
literature and book arts work available to the public in creative =20
ways. Chax Press is an IRS-approved 501(c)(3) charitable =20
organization, and your contribution is tax deductible.

Today, please, write a check for $20 and send it to us at our new =20
address:
411 N 7th Ave, Tucson, Arizona 85705-8332. If you can=92t afford $20, =20=

send $10 or $5. If you have the funds and want to give more (to take =20
the place of those who can=92t give), then by all means give a larger =20=

amount of your choice.

You may also choose to securely donate the amount of your choice =20
online through paypal by visiting the donations page on our new web =20
site donations page.

$20 spent in another way might mean one third of a tank of gas, or =20
five or six coffee drinks. If spent as a contribution to Chax Press =20
it means the chance to support some of the finest literature and book =20=

arts being presented anywhere, and to contribute to the cultural and =20
intellectual life of Tucson and the nation.

Please help us now.

New Critical Documents

Do crease fake a road map to bead this thin portent of a mass itch, but
first choose a humour to spit back or sap out. Critical Documents has been
waiting for this coordinated levitation, this very single moment, to
announce to you its recent publications. They are as to the Quadrant and th=
e
1 hovering thru't.

So be now exposed to four new books by England-based poets: Sara Crangle,
Francis Crot, Frances Kruk, and Tom Raworth. And be too now exposed to the
fourth issue of Plantarchy -- which features almost everyone, but especiall=
y
not a particular person. Some of this constellation has been convecting for
months =96 even years =96 while some of it like suddenly shined through the
scabbard in an alpha channel blitz crag. All the books are hand-made. Here
they are listed:

- -

wild ascending lisp
by Sara Crangle
--> http://plantarchy.us/wal.html

+ Sara Crangle's new book is a distorted mirror, poem-by-poem, of Song of
Myself. It reboots that landmark with the shock of advance, while it
moonlights a hyper-diachronic evacuation of Whitman's soundscape, engendere=
d
by his ear and dated by his tongue. Each copy be smeared with cold March
grass on some over-the-counter blotter paper that floated in on these
beards' foam. Get it while it's brought.

- -

The Seven Curses: Xena Warrior Princess
by Francis Crot
--> http://plantarchy.us/seven-curses.html

+ As the bubble clicks, Stephen Rodefer writes that he hasn't seen "the pos=
t
mediaeval allegory of love, deception, battle and fair victory ... so
spectacularly disclosed and written", as in Francis Crot's The Seven Curses=
,
a Xena fan-fiction with annotations by Nrou Mrobaak and illustrations by
various hands. Scan the world wide web for a dikey detourned infomercial,
coming intensely soon.

- -

A Discourse on Vegetation & Motion
by Frances Kruk
--> http://plantarchy.us/a-discourse.html

+ The Discourse is a tiny book holding an anaphoric long poem. With three
different color spines like rinds on a long aphid's finger, today, in a
spray throttle, everyone buys this. Today.

- -

Let Baby Fall
by Tom Raworth
--> http://plantarchy.us/let-baby-fall.html

+ This pamphlet of new poems by Tom Raworth bounced out of a freshly stalle=
d
rune at the Poetry of the 70s Conference in Orono Maine. If you like
blinking less boulders out of a flaming channel oven, consider reserving
your copy of the second edition before the shivering dogs eat the gloo, k?

- -

Plantarchy 4
various contributors
--> http://plantarchy.us/Plantarchy_4.html

+ The fourth issue of the journal Plantarchy is half poetry and half
criticism, with poetry by Tim Atkins, Caroline Bergvall (in CMYK), Sean
Bonney, Frances Kruk, Kirsten Lavers, Peter Manson, Camille PB, Linda Russo=
,
Rachel Smith, Jefferson Toal, Keith Tuma (with Abby Trenaman and cris
cheek), and Catherine Wagner. Keston Sutherland on Vizpo. Hank Sotto
interviews Helen Bridwell. Allen Fisher's essay iDamage. Susan M. Schultz o=
n
Donald Rumsfeld. Piers Hugill on cris cheek. John Bradley interviews Kent

solidarity in the global market? Are hypermarkets the new cathedrals of
our times? + all what could refer to goods, prices, crisis, development of
the global market, to the image of man and woman in the commercial
communication, and whatever you could imagine on the topic of thousands of
goods that daily cross our lives.

The topic market/goods should be focalized in an ironic / surreal / game
way. Possible mixing digital images/text.

I think that Page duBois' book on Sappho called Sappho is
Burning is an incredible look at both poetry and the
archive.  The methodology she proposes is very
interesting...

and of course susan's work (melville's marginalia!) and
marta werner's work with dickinson, too.

 Nothing can quite compare here with Brandon Brown - who leaves the gourmet underloins of San Francisco to go, literally, eat up New York City for an entire weekend -  O'Hara's "personism" turned into "eatism', a 'hedonism' on the run.   It's really a non-stop practically sleepless literary tour de force performed/lived among poets - indeed they are perhaps talking about 'lit' or music -  but it's really all liquid and bites. An amazing blast of consumptual, consumptious energy. Maybe it's a poem, or anti-poem in disguise! (I know Brandon is a tall, wide guy - but that must have some plane ride going home!)

REPUGNO SELECTS Issue No.

WELCOME

Author Links, &
Issue No.2's CALL FOR WORK

EXCERPTED FROM THE ON SITE DESCRIPTION:

IMPORTANT: This magazine is for documenting poetic work in the public sphere
or work given away/left in public. I do not wish to see page-based work for
the most part - exceptions are possible - but not that easy to imagine
* VISUAL POETRY for me has to connect to text, readability is not necessary,
but language is required (no matter how degraded).
* ARTFULNESS I appreciate careful technique, a painterly eye, work that
doesn't sacrifice some kind of discipline, but, I also thrive on accidents.
* THE HAND IN THE WORK. So much work is computer-based now that I find
myself liking the handmade or hand-assisted works, they're consistently more
real for me.
* B/W-ish i tend in the direction of black and white and appreciate those
who can use just enough color or who let the colors of the materials carry
the weight. Monochromes. Sepia. A starkness that has impact.

This is a very welcome & exciting & refreshingly  unusual Visual Poetry
Journal, as it is interested in work *made by hand* and also work AS IT
EXISTS IN THE WORLD.

One of the paradoxes of the Internet is that is an excellent means by which
to "bring to light" works which point one back to the WORLD, that Time & War
Torn & Worn site/sight/cite which all too often vanishes in Word, Page &
Screen.

The disintegrating order of things, "the world as we see it is passing,"
calls out for not simply "being in touch," but actual touch, the real
meaning of Haptic.

Works exist in the public sphere  in disintegrations from the conformities
of "signage," and the forms of tourism & consumerism it engenders. Yet,
rather than seeing and working with the teeming dilapidation of languages
which are actively generating emerging colors, lines, sounds,  the eyes
trained by signages remain within their "sphere of influence."
 Aestheticized, these "signages" become "seen as art," because they are
"already framed as art" and so one "discovers" one's immediate environment
as having the same "art" qualities as "photos  in magazines," ads
themsemselves modeled on "art" in "art photos" and paintings. Making the
circuit of one's neighborhood, one makes a circuit of "art images," happily
noticing how much like other "art" which one has seen they indeed are.
To discover one lives in a a magazine/gallery world makes one feel one is
indeed leading an aethetic existence.
Who knows, perhaps instead of being an "artist," one is actaully becoming an
"art object" one's self, and so is begining to accrue value by the moment.
Does it not seem at times that one is indeed moving along among various
monuments, statues, plaques which have come to occupy the place of good old
so-and-so?
Meanwhile, the dirty old world which is falling apart all around one, and in
that falling apart is emerging each instant as a part of something other
than it just was--that dirty ceaselessly teeming old world is going unseen,
even though its particles begin to dirty the surfaces of the monuments and
statues.
To me, what makes Repugno so exciting and challenging to go ever farther
into these particles that are a part of and not apart from one's existence,
continually touching one with a call to touch back and with it in response,
in collaboartion--
is that it is aware of and interested in the continually generative
emergence of distintegrations, the disintegrations into emergences, of
negentropy and working with negentropy in collaboration.

To me, a very happy event!  And my deep Thanks!--db Chirot

POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT:
Executive Director for Small Press Traffic


Small Press Traffic announces a call for applications
for the position of Executive Director, to begin employment
on January 1, 2009.


Since 1974, Small Press Traffic has been at the heart of the
San Francisco Bay Area's innovative writing communities,
bringing together a diverse constituency of independent readers,
writers, and independent presses through our influential reading
series, poets theater festivals, conferences, and publications.
Graciously housed at the California College of the Arts, we remain
autonomous, and thus depend upon outside funding for our operating
expenses.  Currently, we are looking for a highly skilled and creative
Executive Director to provide both artistic vision and financial leadership.


The Executive Director at Small Press Traffic serves as both the Artistic
and Financial Manager for the organization. S/he ensures that (a) the
overall quality and diversity of programming is consistent with Small
Press Traffic's history and mission and (b) that the organization conducts
its community and financial affairs in a professional and timely manner.
Areas of responsibility include, but are not limited to: event programming,
budget and finance, fundraising, and public relations. Above all, the
Executive
Director serves as the public face of the organization, and is responsible
for
helping shape the vision and direction of Small Press Traffic, as well as
being open and responsive to our dynamic and diverse communities of
writers, readers, and audience members.


Programming: The Executive Director, in consultation with the Board of
Directors, oversees the planning and development of Small Press Traffic's
artistic program, which includes live literary events, fundraisers, the
website,
archives, publications, and any other forms of literary presentation and
preservation.


Fundraising: The Executive Director initiates and coordinates Small Press
Traffic's fundraising efforts. These efforts include submitting grant
applications
to government and private funding agencies, meeting and corresponding with
potential funders, cultivating individual members and donors, planning and
hosting benefit events, assisting the Board of Directors with its
fundraising
initiatives, submitting reports and payment requests to individuals and
agencies,
and pursuing new fundraising opportunities.


Public Relations: Small Press Traffic is a 34-year old organization with a
reputation for offering high-quality programming that represents its
commitment
to a culturally diverse avant-garde. It is important that Small Press
Traffic
maintains good working relationships with writers, artists, arts and
literary
organizations, funding and government agencies, the press, and other groups
and organizations connected with the Bay Area arts and literary communities.

It is also crucial for the Executive Director to be able to maintain a
balance
between her/his curatorial visions and the desires of our audiences, and to
be
able to work constructively with the Board and the wider Small Press Traffic

constituency to continue to uphold and extend our mission.


Budget and Finance: The Executive Director, in consultation with the Board,
plans and manages Small Press Traffic's annual operating budget. S/he is
responsible for ensuring vendors are paid in a timely manner, that accurate
financial and fiduciary records are kept, and that actual expenses do not
exceed those proposed in the annual operating budget. The Executive Director

is also responsible for oversight of interns and volunteers, as well as
outside
contractors (such as designers, accountants, etc.).


Compensation: $27,000 annual salary. While the workload can vary widely,
depending on fundraising cycles and event schedules, the position typically
requires an average of twenty-five (25) hours per week. The position comes
with an initial 18-month contract, followed by one-year renewable
contract(s),
with annual evaluation process. Benefits are contingent on available
funding.


Position begins January 1, 2009. To apply, please send CV, cover letter, and

three letters of recommendation to:


Small Press Traffic
California College of the Arts
1111 8th Street
San Francisco, CA 94107


Applications must be postmarked no later than September 15, 2008. Electronic

applications are discouraged, though applicants are welcome to email to
confirm
receipt of mailed applications.


Small Press Traffic is an equal opportunity employer. Women, people of
color, disabled,
and LGBTQ persons are encouraged to apply.

Hello All,

Julie Doxsee's debut book, Undersleep, is available from Octopus Books:
www.octopusbooks.net She currently lives in Istanbul but will be in America
for a week, giving readings along the east coast: New York, DC,
Philadelphia, Providence, Chapel Hill, Richmond, Amherst & Boston. Hope to
see you at one of the readings!

Praise for Undersleep:

Spare, bright, and sharp these poems spark, tossing up unexpected words,
making strange connections, inventing vocabulary, and in general, cracking
open the natural world and letting us watch it tick. Intimate and worldly a=
t
the same time, Julie Doxsee is a surprising and deeply gifted poet, and
this, her first book, glows in the dark.
=97Cole Swensen

These are the secret nighttime children's tales that parents aren't allowed
to read, the winking sparks sent up from the bonfire. They flicker into a
vast vaulted space where all is black around. Here, the body of language is
stripped of its flesh. And the poem-bones begin to dance=97the joints of hu=
man
language and its articulations. It's a little bit scary.
=97Eleni Sikelianos

The debut full-length poetry collection by author Julie Doxsee, Undersleep
features a fluidly brief economy of words that nonetheless evoke ripples
from the reader's unconsciousness. Touched with the emotional longing,
Undersleep shines with the brilliant promise of a half-formed dream.
"Peripheral": Paradise is not a thing to keep. / Shadows are little
nighttimes / for pronouncing / night's hymn. // Night's hymn / cannot
contain / doses of / Paradise. Sleep / is a movement through not. //
Undersleep thickens want as it prods. / Make the proper substitutions above=
.
=97Midwest Book Review

Sara Phillips,

Two additional suggestions ...

1.)  Dr. Richard Price, a poet, archivist and librarian, is the Head
of Modern British Collections [including Artists' Books and literary
chapbooks] at the British Library in London.  He is the author of
several books of poetry, including books of visual-poetry.  Also, in
2006, he co-authored an archival book about British Poetry magazines
from 1914 to 2000.

http://www.bl.uk/collections/britirish/britishandirish.html

2.  Dr. Michael Basinski, a poet, archivist and librarian, is the
Curator of the Poetry Collection at the University of Buffalo.  I do
think his poetry reflects the sense of "archives" in more ways than
one.

THE BEAT GENERATION SYMPOSIUM
***********************************************

DISCOUNT DEADLINE EXTENDED!
Register before September 1 for a discounted fee (see below for
details).

Please join us for a conference devoted to the literary and cultural
legacy of the Beat Generation:  "The Beat Generation Symposium,"
co-sponsored by the Beat Studies Association, the Columbia College
Chicago English Department and Provost's Office, Columbia College's
Ellen Stone Belic Institute for the Study of Women and Gender in the
Arts and Media, and the Illinois State University Department of
English and College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Friday, October 10, and Saturday, October 11, 2008.

Location:  Columbia College Chicago, Film Row Theater (1104 South
Wabash Avenue, 8th floor).

This is an academic Beat Studies conference to be held in conjunction
with the Columbia College's Center for the Book and Paper Arts's Fall
2008 display of the Jack Kerouac ON THE ROAD manuscript scroll.

The Beat Generation Symposium features panel discussions each day,
with poetry readings by Joanne Kyger (October 10) and Diane di Prima
(October 11).  The readings are free and open to the public. Joanne
Kyger, a native California writer, is the author of over 20 books of
poetry.  She is known for her ties to the poets of Black Mountain
College, the San Francisco Renaissance, and the Beat Generation.  Her
most recent books are About Now: Collected Poems, 1957-2004 (National
Poetry Foundation, 2007) and Not Veracruz (Libellum Press, 2007).  She
taught for many years at Naropa University's poetics program, and The
New College of San Francisco.  She lives on the coast north of San
Francisco. Diane di Prima lives and works in San Francisco. She is the
author of 43 books of poetry and prose, and her work has been
translated into more than 20 languages. Recent publications include
Recollections of My Life as a Woman (Penguin, 2002) and an expanded
edition of Revolutionary Letters (Last Gasp Press, 2007). In 2006 di
Prima received the Fred Cody Award for Lifetime Achievement and
community service from the Northern California Book Critics
Association.

Panelists include John Bryant, Peter Cook, Terrance Diggory, Jane
Falk, Amy Friedman, Deborah R. Geis, Nancy M. Grace, Tim Hunt, Rob
Johnson, Ronna Johnson, Hassan Melehy, Timothy Murphy, Jennie Skerl,
Matt Theado, Tony Trigilio, and more.

The weekend of the symposium, there will be a related offsite reading
by Michael Rothenberg (Unhurried Vision) and David Meltzer (David's
Copy) sponsored by Myopic Books and the Poetry Center of Chicago.
Sunday, October 12, 7:00 p.m. Myopic Books, 1564 N Milwaukee Ave, in
Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood.

Conference fee for those who pre-register by September 1:  $50 ($25
for Graduate Students, Independent Scholars, and Retired Faculty).
After September 1, the fees are $100 and $50.

Checks should be made payable to Columbia College Chicago, and should
be sent to:

Columbia Ticket Center

To register by credit card,  call the Columbia Ticket Office at the
number above, or register online at:

www.colum.edu/tickets/index.php

A limited number of hotel rooms are available at the Homewood Suites
by Hilton Chicago-Downtown, 40 East Grand Avenue, Chicago.  This hotel
is a very short cab or subway ride from the Columbia campus.  The
Homewood Suites prepared a special link for us to book online.  Just
click below and you'll find directions for reserving a room:

http://homewoodsuites.hilton.com/en/hw/groups/personalized/CHIHWHW-CL-20081009/index.jhtml

It's important that you book your room as soon as possible, as the
Chicago Marathon is taking place October 12.  (We only discovered this
convergence recently, after we'd already booked the featured
readers.)

A Visitor's Guide for the Beat Symposium is pasted below, with a list
of nearby hotels.  Columbia College Chicago is located downtown, in
the heart of the city's South Loop neighborhood, and is easily
accessible from these hotels by foot or cab.  All major subway/El
trains come into the South Loop, too, so it's possible to book hotels
in other parts of the city and make it to the Symposium without
difficulty.

Mention that you're a Columbia College Chicago visitor to receive
discounted rates at some of these hotels.  It's crucial to book as
soon as possible because of the marathon.

For more information, contact Tony Trigilio at ttrigilio@colum.edu
(312-344-8138).


VISITOR'S GUIDE:  THE BEAT GENERATION SYMPOSIUM

Airports:
O'Hare Airport (western suburbs) and Midway Airport (southern suburbs)
are the two airports servicing the Chicgao area.  They are approximately
equidistant from Columbia College.

Transportation:
 >From Midway Airport, take the Orange Line elevated train to Adams
Street. From there, walk south on Wabash until you reach Congress
Parkway. From O'Hare Airport, take the Blue Line to La Salle. Walk East
on Congress (away from the Chicago Stock Exchange Building, which you'll
see upon emerging from the subway) until you reach Wabash (about 5 short
blocks).

Use www.transitchicago.com's free Trip Planner service to plan the rest
of your trips while you're here. Simply enter your starting point and
destination, and Trip Planner gives you detailed directions. As of 2008,
fares are $2.00 one-way with a $0.25 transfer. Each train station has
kiosks where you can buy transit cards and reload them (cash only). The
Blue Line and Red Line run 24/7; the other lines stop running for a few
hours late at night.

Taxis are available throughout the city. From Midway Airport to the
English Department, cab fare would be approximately $25 and from O'Hare
Airport cab fare would be approximately $50. If you need to call a cab,
call (773) or (312) TAXICAB.

Metra Trains service suburban areas.  Visit www.metrarail.com for an
updated schedule and fare list.

Can you send this aroud the poetry lists:


CALL FOR SHORT STEREOPHONIC SOUNDSCAPE & HOERSPIEL WORKS

>A DIAMOND IN THE MUD<
A Miniature Audio Exhibition of Stereophonic Soundscape & H=F6rspiel Works

Concept:
It is an Asian concept rooted in Buddhism that self-cultivation can be
developed at home as a householder and is not merely confined to a temple o=
r
monastery. Buddhist believe that enlightened beings are those who "grew" ou=
t
of the "mud" of the material world. So, like the lotus flower, which
penetrates through sullied mud and water, but emerges unspoiled, enlightene=
d
beings are beautiful and pure even though they grow up in the material
world. The phrase "a diamond in the mud" is an analogy for this and in
keeping with it the Digital Art Weeks would like to issue this call to
artists and to submit pre recorded works (Soundscape, H=F6rspiel, Poetry) i=
n
regard to the beautiful and the sullied. The works will be chosen on their
ability to transcend the listeners into a "moment of tranquilly" and out of
the confines of the everyday, or as expressed in the Diamond Sutra: "Dwell
upon nothing and produce the pure mind."

Playback System:
Constructed as a dock for Apple's famed iPod, the iCarta stereophonic audio
playback system will be used to play back all of the selected works. The
systems not only offers an interesting solution for public pod-casting, but
it also acts uniquely as a bathroom dispenser for the indispensable: Le
papier toilette.

- Art Clay, DAW, Artistic Director (c) 2008

Submission:
Please submit all works electronically in MP3 format and accompanied by a
completed application (The title of the work, a short description of no mor=
e
than 100 words, and a short biography of the author of the work of no more
than 50 words). Submission should be made available for downloading at a
link of the submitter's choice or can be sent per email or snail mail to th=
e
address below. Selected works will be presented at the Literaturhaus in
Basel, Switzerland over a period of three days from the 25th to the 27th of
September 2008. Information about the artist and the work will appear
electronically and all of the works will be made available to download for
pod-casting. A listening space will be provided that goes along with the
concept of the project and the needed hardware and audio library (iPod
shuffle) will be made available. Works should be no longer than 5 minutes i=
n
duration. Winning Prize: iCarta Audio Player

DEADLINE: Moday, 15th September 2008. Notification of acceptance of
proposals will be sent out on or before Monday, 22nd September 2008.

For more information regarding the call please write directly to:

and three shorter ones which are here  below--
eyewitness accounts by survivors of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Leonardo's The Disappearance of Majoranna & Trying to Prevent the Bombs
Olson's Projective Verse--& from Prevention to Pre-Emption

the following excerpts are from Nine Who Survived Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Personal Experiences of Nine Men Who Lived Through the Atomic Bombings
 Robert Trumball, E.P Dutton, 1957.

        Ten years after the bombings, it was learned that a search of all
Japanese records indicated that 18 people had survived both the Hiroshima
and the Nagasaki atomic blasts.  An extensive search throughout Japan
located eleven of the 18.  Nine agreed to speak of their experiences.
       The bombs dropped on the two Japanese cities are barely firecrackers
compared to the weapons that the USA and Israel are discussing dropping on
Iran.  Radioactive elements in weapons used in the First Gulf War and since
in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the as yet unknown, uniidentified
Israeli weapons used in Lebanon last summer, have been causing new forms of
illness, as yet inexplicable burns and wounds for which there are no cures
as yet. The effects of nuclear weaponry being dispersed, in smaller doses,
across populations and soldiers, using persons as "living laboratories" of
effects bringing slower or faster deaths, polluting gene pools, and, via
human waste, corpses, planting the poisons in water supplies and the soil.
      Populations and landscapes made radioactive, slowly burning alive,
without having to drop the bombs first.

Trumball:

    "Instantly the sky was blanked out by the incandescent white light of
the monstrous fireball.  Scientists estimated that the ball was 250 feet in
diameter and a hundred times as bright as the sun, with a heat of 1,000,000
degrees Centigrade. he same as the sun's interior There was a roar of sound
that is indescribale. for there is nothing with which it can be compared.
Then came a wave of concussion that instantly leveled 6,820 buildings, and
badly damaged 3, 750 more.  The earth for a mile around the blast center was
bombarded with deadly gamma rays and neutrons and showered with radioactive
fission products..  The fireball sucked up millions of tons of dust and
pulverized debris that quickly began to form the the great, ugly mushroom
cloud.  The city fell under a dark pall, and a muddy rain began to fall . .
.
      "In the city of approximately 255, 000, more than half the population
was instantly dead or incapicitated (dead above 64,000, injured 72,000).
Casualties who escaped death  in the blast were badly burned. or injured by
falling timbers, or flying glass.  No city was ever more prostrate.  All
means of comminication were gone.  Seventy per cent of the fire fighting
equipment was destroyed, and 80 per cent of the fire-fighting personnel were
killed, wounded or otherwise unable to respond to the emergency.  Concussion
had broken the water mians, and pipes were melted in the incredible heat.
Many burning buildings were inacessible anyway,blocked off as they were by
the debris of fallen structures . . .
     "Of forty-five hospitals, only three were left standing.  Only
twenty-eight out of 290 physicians in the city were unhurt, and 126 of the
1,780 nurses . . .
     "With all facilities virtually nonexistent, the city was at the mercy
of the flames, and by two o'clock in the afternoon the six islands (of the
city) were a sea of fire.  Terror was heightened by the flaming windstorm
caused by convection as the air was drawn at thirty to forty miles an hour
to the blazing center of the blast . . .

     "The door facing Yamaguchi opened, and five boys, fifteen or sixteen
years old, came running out.  They were unclothed except for torn
underpants, and Yamaguchi saw that theywere covered in blood . . .
     "'I had never seen such a horrifying sight as those five shivering
boys.  Blood was pouring in streams from deep cuts all over their bodies,
mingling with their perspiration, and their skin was burned deep red, like
the color of cokked lobsters.  At first it seemed, strangely, that their
burned and lacerated backs and chests were growing green grass! Then I saw
that hundreds of blades of sharp grass had been driven deep into their
flesh, evidently by the force of the blast." . . . . (these boys had been
inside a small factory building--not outdoors)


     "Hirata set out for home . . .
      "'There was not a house standing as far as I could see . . . Although
I knew the city well,  it was actually difficult to find my way, for al the
familiar landmarks were gone, and the streets I often walked were now buried
in debris and ashes' . . .
         "Hirata noticed, with a shock, that there wasn't a living being in
sight. "It was as if the people who had lived in this uncanny city had been
reduced to ashes with their houses,' he said . . .
        As he moved slowly through the ashes, he came to the first ghastly
dead.
       "'The first was a little boy,' he recalls. 'He was completely naked,
his skin was all peeled off as if he had been flayed, and the nails were
falling from the ends of his fingers.  His flesh was all deep red.  When I
first saw him I wasn't sure if I was looking at a human being


       Morimoto--
       "'There were numberless injured persons all around me, lying on the
ground, some held down by fallen timbers, all screaming and shouting for
help.  I saw that they were all still alive,m but horribly injured.  Many
looked like ghosts, with the skin peeled off their faces and hanging down
over their shoulders like thin silk pennants.  All those facing in the
direction of the blast had their exposed skin torn off in a thick layer
whgich had blown back.  The sight left me numb with horror.' . . . .


FORESEEING THE BOMB AND TRYING TO PREVENT IT


In Leonarado Sciascia's beautiful book The Disappearance of Majoranna, he
has a vision born of the startling synchornicity of information recieved
during a telephone call with his own researchs into the mysterious and never
solved vanishing of the great Italain physicist.

     It is Sciascia's growing conviction that Majoranna "faked" his own
death/disappearnce in order for him to retire completely from the world to
an obscure Monastery, there to finish his days in the Peace of the Spirit he
so desperately needed.  For it is also Sciascia's belief  that Majoranna,
very early in the 1930's, during the period of his stay with the German
physicist Werner Heisenberg, had foreseen the Atomic Bomb and all the dread
implications that its unleashing had in store for all life on Earth.
       Sciascia posits that Majoranna, and Heisenberg also, being possesed
of this knowledge, and loyal citizens, one of a Fascist country, the other
of a country about to become so, determined never to reveal what they knew
to anyone, in the desperate hope that this would prevent the A-bombs ever
coming into existence.
       Having reached nearly the final goal of his enquiries, the visit to
the Monastery where Majoranna may well have lived, the telephone call
informs Sciascia that there is also a rumor about this monastery that the
pilot of the Enola Gay, which dropped the Bomb on Hiroshima, had also been a
resident at the monastary for a time, and most likely seeking the same Peace
as the physicist.
             For Sciascia even the possibility, however remote, however
imaginary, of the two men encountering each other in the obscure monastary,
is a Vision of such powerful symmetry and "complete sense," that it's taking
place in such a manner outstrips any "factual proof" of it's having
"actually occurred."

     For Sciascia, this Vision presents the quantum leap of the fictional,
the imagainary, into a Truth which is, in fact, "irrefutable," given the
scantiness of "the evidence to go on."  For this Vision complements that
Vision in which he finds Majoranna and Heisenberg foreseeing an event which
they think they have a chance however small, to  prevent occuring.

 For the writer, this makes of these two physicists the truly great ones of
the Atomic Age,, the ones who knew , yet refused to share the knowledge, how
to make the Bomb and open a new age of unimaginable horrors.

      Their forseeing of the A-Bomb and efforts to prevent it,  has since
been turned into a different form of foresight in relation with Nuclear
wepaons.  This is the kind of accelearted, forged, creation of the threat of
a Future Bomb which has to be prevented by the pre-emptive strike made by a
bomb already in existence.

This "saving of lives in danger in the future" " by  killing a great great
many in the present, is related to  logic claimed for the dropping of the
two nuclear bombs on Japan, If the bombs could bring a stop to the war, this
would mean the saving of perhpas millions of lives, so that the killing of
some hundreds of thousands would be "worth it."  By this line of reasoning,
it is not the dead who "count," but the living.  Lying inert, the "body
count" of the dead do not represent Death in this vision, but instead New
Life, all that Life of the Present and soon to be Future Saved by the Light
Flash which "recorded" the "last living  instant" of the immediately about
to be dead in the form of shadows imprinted in walls.

  FORESEEING POST-HIROSHIMA TURNS PREVENTION INTO PRE-EMPTION

   Olson's "Projective Verse" Manifesto and Accelerations of American Speeds
into Annihilations of (Others') SPACE


Although he did not realize the fact until some time later, Charles Olson
completed Call Me Ishmael, his study of Herman Melville's Moby Dick, on the
day that the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.

 That clear morning in Hiroshima, the Nuclear Holocaust of the Gates of Hell
opened, unleashing the heat of a new sun in a flash of light, a heat
different in kind from the Hells of the Fire bombings of Tokyo, Hamburg,
Dresden,and so many others. This was a Heat which continued burning long
after, in the cells and tissues contaminated by radioactivity.  From the
first instant, the human organism began the processes of mutation which
themselves mutated further in the Nuclear Accidents of Three Mile Island and
in the huge area affected by Chernobyl.

For Olson, Melville's Pacific voyage in Moby Dick becomes the final stage in
the Westward movement which finds itself in rejoining the East.  The
horizontal  "BRIDGE" of vehicular modes of transportation, with their speeds
which  steadily abolish 'SPACE," the American "Fact," turn into the
vertical  trajectory of Time in the airplane. The planes in the Pacific take
off from the Carrier, itself a huge floating Bridge, from whose horizons are
launched the engines of flight, carrying in their ever increasing speeds the
annihilations of Space and the dawn of continuous global Real Time, in which
it becomes possible to create the global "Accident" of Nuclear Total
Destruction.

In the "Projective Verse" Manifesto (1950) Olson writes, (after Edward
Dahlberg) ONE PERCEPTION MUST IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER
PERCEPTION . . . get on with it, keep moving, keep in, speed, the nerves,
their speed, the perceptions, theirs, the acts, the split second acts, the
whole business, keep it moving as fast as you citizens . . . always one
perception must must must MOVE, INSTANTER, ON ANOTHER!

The acceleration of PERCEPTION--"split second acts, the whole business,"
--links the Poetic Projective avant-garde with that of the military, in
which perception has always meant death. To be the first to perceive the
enemy's movements, locations, encampments, strategies unfolding, is to be
instantly setting the lines of sight directly at the target.  To see at ever
greater speeds, to See First, is to be able to AIM DEATH. To perceive is to
annihilate.

As the world becomes ever more saturated by perception, the Open Field of a
Projective Verse becomes "completely exposed" to the perceiving eyes of a
myriad machines at a myriad angles and distances, continually "lining up"
the trajectories of high speed death.  Yet--what if the Perception finds no
target to be aimed at? No reason for an attack, "nothing to shoot for?"

Since the target is already "taking place, existing," as a concept, what
remains is to fill in the blank spaces where the unseen target "should be."
To "fill in the blanks" when Perception "comes up empty," the resort is to a
conceptual  language with which to "forge" the Seen into the Unseen, to
impose objects and "readings," "information" where there is none.  If Nature
abhors a vacuum, the conceptual Perception cannot stand to "see a blank
space" where the target it conceives of "should be."

To "forge" is to "forge" full speed ahead in Time, planting ahead of time
what one has set out to find, and, finding it, being able to claim a
complete "coherence" in one's methods and in one's "ability to not only See,
but FOReSEE" the "dangers that are now exposed as having been there all this
time."

To conceptually be filled with a "Vision" which is confronted with "a
blank," "necessitates" the construction in language of "evidences, proofs"
which "show" that "something is there," even if cleverly concealed or
camouflaged, since one KNOWS it must be there, it will be there, and what is
a blank shall be filled with the CERTAINTY of a target.

Emerson wrote in "Nature," that the "blank and ruin we perceive in Nature is
in our own eye."
In the rush to annihilate, such thinking in itself is an enemy. The "blank
and ruin" of a Perception which "comes up empty" needs to be replaced by the
blank and ruin of a Perception which is seeing the blank and ruins it has
created, by destroying what it has "planted" and "forged" as a target to
annihilate.

The work of Perception turns from "seeing what is there," to Projecting into
the blank spaces what is Not There, in order to see what it is one needs to
see to go about destroying it.

By these accelerations "hurried on" by forgeries of the required evidences,
it is possible to manufacture "the presence of Unseen, Unheard of,
previously non-existent and undreamed of Threats of the Utmost magnitude"
where in fact there is "nothing. "Nothing," that "blank and ruin" is no
longer THERE, nor is it any longer a "blank and ruin within my own eye" when
the Secret of the Forged Eviodences become "revealed"--not the Scret of
their forgery, to be sure!  But the Secret that where everyone has found
"nothing," one has inded ben proven to have such a superior acutiy of Vision
as to see what is THERE among the appearnces of the Not There.

This method seeing the There in the NOT There, also accelerates Time, for
what one is seeing is not the "blank and ruin" of the present at all, which
one has so stuffed and filled in.  It is instead the FUTURE one sees, the
blank and ruin ofone's own landscapes, unless the THERE of the NOT THERE,
aka the NOT YET THERE, is attacked pre-emptively.

By means of the pre-emptive attack, one "realizes" the concrete presence of
indeed "real" blanks and ruins, whcih "prove," indeed, that the "blank and
ruin one sees in one's own eye," is not a Nothing in the present, but indeed
a great Something in the Future whose presence one has produced as the Now.

Among the "reasons" given to "justify" the dropping of the bombs on
Hiroshima and Ngasaki was that they would stop the War, and so save an
immense number of lives.

Rather than contemplating the number of the dead, the wounded, the
radioctively sick, the traumatized and the sufferings of those suddenly
afflicted by mutations, one was to "overlook" these corpses and see instaed
all the vast returning American soldiers and the still living Japanese as
indeed the signs of Triumph of the A-Bomb.

By reversing the "body count" of the dead into that of the "countless
numbers" saved, the Peace the A-Bomb brought could be seen to be the Saving
of those living "who are not dead "

By envisioning the A-Bomb as a Saviour, "only called upon in the last
resort," the language has been formulated with which to begin the series of
forgeries and "alarms," which have already been in the building stages for
at least  over four years now, to pre-emptively attack yet again.  And this
time in Iran.

In the Light of the New Sun of the Nuclear Bombs, it is not Death which
Mushrooms and Clouds the Skies, but the Saviour, the Sign of a God to the
living.

"Let there be light"--

On January 28, 2008 I sent the following invitation:

"this is an invitation to participate in a collaborative / =
constraint-based writing & artwork portfolio. Lego was created 50 years =
ago this year, and has been an inspiration for generations of kids. =
Those kids are us. Lego was the toy-i know i spent endless full days =
creating cities, spaceships, creatures and more (and still have a box =
full of Lego)-it taught us to think. So many poets, writers and artists =
have since taken this modular thinking and applied it to their own =
oeuvre (how many of you have files, packages, piles and gatherings of =
inspiring things, tools for one day?) ..."=20

Fifteen writers and artists agreed to participate. Each received a PDF =
version of the original American patent application and were restricted =
to using some material from that patent. The responses were further =
restricted to a single sheet of 8 =BD" x 11" (or A4 if international) =
paper.

The Kojiki is arguably the earliest and most important collection of
stories concerning the founding of Japan and the beginnings of Japanese
culture.  Dating from the sixth century, the Kojiki introduces us to a
delightful host of gods and goddesses, heros and heroines, warriors and
soothsayers, beautiful princesses and hideous demons.  Yoko Danno's
graceful retelling of the Kojiki in modern English brings this ancient
classic to life for a new generation of readers.  Illustrations (by
Nihonga artist and master potter Horaku Nakamura), notes and
bibliography are included to enhance the reader's enjoyment.

Dear Listees,

I'm teaching a Film/Lit course in the fall and wonder if anyone can recomme=
nd a few good films that offer up poetic content, to put it vaguely, or a r=
epresentation of a poet that doesn't completely romanticize the poet, disin=
tegrating the person in the process.=A0 For instance, I wouldn't use that S=
ylvia Plath film that came out a few years ago, starring Gweneth Paltrow.=
=A0 Anything that incorporates the poet's writing would be wonderful ...

Did anyone see "Before Night Falls" who thinks it's worthwhile?

Thanks,

Amy

lots of comic books/graphic novels being turned into movies.

a possible (?) parallel:

shakespearean tragedy arose, in part, from morality plays and revenge
dramas. it feels like something more interesting than comic books is trying
to emerge from the comic book -> graphic novel -> movie of them.

the stylized, concise, one-liner language moving toward something more
flexibly poetical?

the black and white revenge morality moving toward something more complex?

the 'superhero' becoming less 'super' and less 'hero'.

probably not. just a thought.

maybe though. one for the shadow.

I like this question --
The Arenas film is good, but fiction, isn't it? Tho I guess there is
something in Arenas' historical distortions that verges poetic. In that
zone, Cronenberg's take of Naked Lunch is better. (Tho Gysin's The Cut-ups
of course trumps.) Ha, there's Quills, or Salo.

Narrative film: recently saw Mary Ellen Bute's Finnegan's
Wake<http://ubu.com/film/joyce_wake.html>,
wch is marvelous. Looking for the title of Tom & Viv (meh!) I stumbled on
this funny list <http://www.umich.edu/~mqr/poetryinmovies.htm> wch ought to
help -- (Another chance to class-screen Blade Runner!) Also The Basketball
Diaries are something.

But better, I think: the Hills films
(!<http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Hills.html>)
& Abigail Child's work. The flux or lettrist films or those by Hans Arp.
There are some to consider here <http://www.ubu.com/film/index.html>, I
guess

...

Best poetry film about a poet, featuring a poet? --
Sleep<http://www.warholstars.org/filmch/sleep.html> featuring

comics have been more complex since the early eighties. there are any
number of truly complex poetries going on in the world of comics. see
for example the work of neil gaiman, alan moore, dave sim, terry
moore, harvey pekar, and grant morrison

The Maya Angelou tv movie, *I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings*. And what about
* Looking for Langston* by Isaac Julien? Of course, I suppose it depends on
what you mean by "disentegrating the person". Peace to all, apologies to
Poetics for the lack of intro. I will when I can. Mendi

Graphic novels have long been complex and interesting. If you check out the
work of Shaun Tan (Australian graphic novelist whose book The Arrival, a
parable about immigration, is exquisite) or Marjane Satrapis's graphic novel
Persepolis, about her childhood in Iran under the revolution (soon to be a
movie) or indeed David Lloyd and Alan Moore's graphic novel collaborations
(including V for Vendetta), Art Spiegelman's Maus: A Survivor's Tale (about
the Holocaust) and many many others, you'll see a rich vein of stuff. Not to
mention the whole tradition of manga and anime...

PRESS RELEASE JULY 22 2008
After a delay of four months since the unanimous passage of the Los
Angeles City Council's Resolution of February 29, 2008 renewing
Beyond Baroque's lease to all its current space at 681 Venice Blvd.,
for the next 25 years, the lease remains unsigned.

We have learned from sources inside City Hall that, contrary to the
City Council Resolution, Beyond Baroque, a nationally recognized
cultural institution based in Venice, may lose the part of the lease
pertaining to its historic theater, the heart of its operations since
1979. Loss of the lease to its historic theater would cripple Beyond
Baroque's control over its future and severely impair its capacity to
represent and serve the community as it has for forty years.

We, representatives of the Friends of Beyond Baroque, call upon all
people who care about Beyond Baroque to contact Councilman Bill
Rosendahl at (213) 473-7011 or Councilman.Rosendahl@lacity.org to
urge him to uphold the Council Resolution awarding Beyond Baroque's
lease to all its historic space and protect this precious Venice
institution intact. Please cc: FriendsByndBaroq@aol.com on your e-
mails to Councilman Rosendahl.

Sincerely,
The Friends of Beyond Baroque
Representatives:
Jim Smith 310-399-8685
Grace Godlin 310-827-1326
Emily Winters (Venice Arts Council) 310-306-7372

Hi and welcome!
I found Looking for Langston beautiful but a bit unsubstantial and
speculative, but then i guess that was the point, since no one really
knows anything for sure abt Hughes's sexuality...
I was a sucker for Il Postino.

Fitting the Pattern
http://www.crissxross.net/elit/fitting_the_pattern.html
Christine Wilks

'Fitting the Pattern (or being a dressmaker's daughter)' is a hyperpoem or
hyperfiction. I read it. My mom was a dressmaker too. But presumably
Christine's piece is interesting even if your mom wasn't.

Christine calls it "an interactive story". Now, I enjoyed the piece, but the
interactivity is glorified page turning.

To be worthy of the term "interactive", I think the interactivity should be
more than that.

But I enjoyed the piece anyway. It's quite well-written and the interface
erm fits the pattern. Although the interactivity is glorified page turning,
it goes a bit further than that: one is reminded in the activity of page
turning not of page turning but of the making. dressmaking but other makings
also. a connection with the activity of the mother. a sympathetic
connection. so although the interactivity is weak in some ways, its affect
is strong.

The art of programming is not just about formal things but also about the
feel of it, and its affect. If a piece is strong formally but the affect is
disconnected, it's one less important human dimension to connect with. I
felt Christine's piece was pretty cool in its affect.

The feel of it, on the other hand, is clumsy Flash. I mean the actual
physical feel of the scissors and so on. Clumsy programming. The concept and
design is pretty good, but the actual feel is clumsy; she's not a good
enough programmer to do something interesting with the scissors and pins and
so on.

But the concept is good enough that it isn't necessary.

I'm being critical but, overall, as I said, I really enjoyed this piece.

How would this piece work solely as a text? Probably quite well.

Do the graphics and interface add to it? Ya they do. They situate you in the
activity of dressmaking, they put you more in mom's shoes than the
speaker's. Which is important to the affect and sympathies of the piece.

 CALL FOR SHORT STEREOPHONIC SOUNDSCAPE & HOERSPIEL WORKS

>A DIAMOND IN THE MUD<
A Miniature Audio Exhibition of Stereophonic Soundscape & H=F6rspiel Works

Concept:
It is an Asian concept rooted in Buddhism that self-cultivation can be
developed at home as a householder and is not merely confined to a temple o=
r
monastery. Buddhist believe that enlightened beings are those who "grew" ou=
t
of the "mud" of the material world. So, like the lotus flower, which
penetrates through sullied mud and water, but emerges unspoiled, enlightene=
d
beings are beautiful and pure even though they grow up in the material
world. The phrase "a diamond in the mud" is an analogy for this and in
keeping with it the Digital Art Weeks would like to issue this call to
artists and to submit pre recorded works (Soundscape, H=F6rspiel, Sonic
Poetry) in regard to the beautiful and the sullied. The works will be chose=
n
on their ability to transcend the listeners into a "moment of tranquilly"
and out of the confines of the everyday, or as expressed in the Diamond
Sutra: "Dwell upon nothing and produce the pure mind."

Playback System:
Constructed as a dock for Apple's famed iPod, the iCarta stereophonic audio
playback system will be used to play back all of the selected works. The
systems not only offers an interesting solution for public pod-casting, but
it also acts uniquely as a bathroom dispenser for the indispensable: Le
papier toilette.

- Art Clay, DAW, Artistic Director (c) 2008

Submission:
Please submit all works electronically in MP3 format and accompanied by a
completed application (The title of the work, a short description of no mor=
e
than 100 words, and a short biography of the author of the work of no more
than 50 words). Submission should be made available for downloading at a
link of the submitter's choice or can be sent per email or snail mail to th=
e
address below. Selected works will be presented at the Literaturhaus in
Basel, Switzerland over a period of three days from the 25th to the 27th of
September 2008. Information about the artist and the work will appear
electronically and all of the works will be made available to download for
pod-casting. A listening space will be provided that goes along with the
concept of the project and the needed hardware and audio library (iPod
shuffle) will be made available. Works should be no longer than 5 minutes i=
n
duration. Winning Prize: iCarta Audio Player

DEADLINE: Moday, 15th September 2008. Notification of acceptance of
proposals will be sent out on or before Monday, 22nd September 2008.

(A bit off topic since these are not being turned into movies.) If
there is any interest in a more vispo approach to the graphic novel
the work of Paul Zelevansky has always struck a chord with me.  I
especially like "The Book of Takes" & "The Case for the Burial of
Ancestors."

& of course there is the amazing & otherworldly Codex Seraphinianus
created by Luigi Seraphini

Dear Listees,

I'm teaching a Film/Lit course in the fall and wonder if anyone can recomme=
nd a few good films that offer up poetic content, to put it vaguely, or a r=
epresentation of a poet that doesn't completely romanticize the poet, disin=
tegrating the person in the process.=A0 For instance, I wouldn't use that S=
ylvia Plath film that came out a few years ago, starring Gweneth Paltrow.=
=A0 Anything that incorporates the poet's writing would be wonderful ...

Did anyone see "Before Night Falls" who thinks it's worthwhile?

Thanks,

Amy

Dear Lovely Friends,I've
organized a reading for one of my stellar Corollary authors, Summi
Kaipa, on Sunday August 10th in Brooklyn. It is a rare treat to have
her on the East Coast, and I'm thrilled at the opportunity to introduce
her work to new audiences as well as invite those already familiar with
her writing to have the pleasure of hearing her read. She'll be reading
with the equally talented Tisa Bryant, whose recent book Unexplained Presen=
ce=A0ought to be on everyone's reading list. Their bios are located below.=

Tisa Bryant is the author of Unexplained Presence
(Leon Works, 2007), a collection of original, hybrid essays that remix
narratives from eurocentric film, literature and visual arts and zoom
in on the black presences operating within them.=A0=A0 She is currently
working on [the curator], a fiction that meditates on identity,
visual culture and the lost films of auteur Justine Cable, co-editing
an anthology for AIDS Project Los Angeles, and is madly working to get
Vol. 2 F-K of the Encyclopedia Project in the hopper.=A0Summi
Kaipa has authored several chapbooks, including "The Epics" (Leroy
Press), "One:=A0 I Beg You Be Still" (Belladonna), and most recently "The
Language Parable" (Corollary Press).=A0 For eight years, she was the
editor of Interlope, a magazine publishing innovative writing
by Asian Americans, and in 2002, she received a Potrero Nuevo Fund
Prize to write and produce her first play.=A0 Once a resident of SF's
bustling Mission District, Kaipa now resides in a quiet neighborhood in

There is a wonderful film about a variety of responses to art, called Le=20
Gou^t des autres. Specifically it has a scene from Racine's play  Be're'nic=

If not for your class, it holds your attention throughout.

There are lots of movies about writers. The trick is finding the good ones.
Possibilities:

Knut Hamsun's *Hunger*.

*The Curse of the Spider Woman*. At first blush, this is not be about
writing or a writer at all. But one of the inmates in jail in that movie
spins a fascinating Nazi love story (a gay sado-masochistic fantasy) to pass
time. To me, *The Curse* is one of the best films about the process of
writing, how writing is associated with creating a style and how writing's
relationship with political and personal events is often tangential. It is a
great movie about the fusion of politics with art.

*Under the Volcano

*Ciao,

Murat*

just wanted to let folks know we are looking for work for issue 2 of

out in the next month and half or so-- the official call for work is below
thanks,

“How long is a poem? As long as it takes to perform it.” --Bob Cobbing

a s l o n g a s i t t a k e s, a sound poetry magazine published by the
Atlanta Poets Group, is seeking submissions. We are looking for sound
poetry, scores for sound poetry and essays on sound poetry. “What is
‘sound poetry’?” you ask. Good question. It’s one of those know it when
you see (hear) it kind of things. It’s probably not music (thanks Dick
Higgins). It might be noise. If you think about a spectrum of possible
noise made by the human body (or simulations thereof or substitutions
therefor), and at one end of the spectrum is a person reading her poem
and at the other end is abstract noise, we’re looking for works that
fall towards the latter end. We are looking for works in/of/against the
tradition(s) of Ball, Schwitters, Dûfrène, Henri Chopin, Jandl, Cobbing,
The Four Horsemen, Fylkingen Group, Öyvind Fahlström. . . hopefully by
now you get the idea. We’re looking for stuff that will push/redefine
the limits. The magazine is Web-based.

Please send submissions to aslongasittakes@comcast.net
<mailto:aslongasittakes@comcast.net> in one of the following formats:
.mp3, .wav, .wma, or flac. Please query before sending in other formats.
If you can’t get us the work via email, just send an email and let us
know, and we can find another way. We don’t know how long it will take
to get back to you on your submissions, just be cool. We can’t pay you
anything for your work. All work that appears in the magazine will be
available for download from the magazine’s site under the Creative
Commons’ /Attribution Non-commercial Share Alike/ license
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/); if you are not
comfortable with making your work available in that way, let us know and
we can probably work something out.

a s l o n g a s i t t a k e s, ein Webmagazin für Lautpoesie, das bei
der Atlanta Poets Group erscheint, akzeptiert noch Beiträge für die
Erstausgabe. Wir sind auf der Suche nach Lautpoesie, Scores und Essays
über Lautpoesie. "Was ist Lautpoesie?" fragt man. Gute Frage. Man
erkennt sie, wenn man sie sieht oder hört. Wahrscheinlich ist es keine
Musik (danke Dick Higgins). Es könnte Lärm sein, Geräusche. Man stelle
sich das gesamte Spektrum menschlicher Geräusche vor (oder auch
Simulationen und Nachahmungen dieser) und an einem Ende dieses Spektrums
ist jemand, der ein Gedicht liest und am anderen Ende ist ein abstrakter
Laut, dann suchen wir eher nach Beiträgen, die zu letzterem Ende
tendieren. Wir suchen nach Arbeiten in der-, beziehungsweise in
Anlehnung an-, oder auch gegen die Tradition Balls, Schwitters’,
Dûfrènes, Henri Chopins, Jandls, Cobbings, The Four Horsemens ...
Hoffentlich ist jetzt klar was gemeint ist. Wir suchen Arbeiten, die an
die Grenzen gehen und sie neu definieren. a s l o n g a s i t t a k e s
ist als Onlinemagazin konzipiert.

Bitte sendet uns (Geräusch-)Beiträge als mp3, wav, wma, oder flac files
an aslongasittakes@comcast.net <mailto:aslongasittakes@comcast.net>.
Scores und Essays gerne als Word oder pdf Dokumente. Falls ihr andere
Formate bevorzugt, fragt bitte vorher an. Wenn ihr eure Beiträge nicht
per E-Mail schicken könnt, sagt bescheid und wir finden eine andere
Lösung. Reicht ihr eine Arbeit ein, wissen wir nicht, wie lange es
dauert bis wir uns zurückmelden, habt Geduld. Wir können kein Honorar
zahlen. Alle Beiträge, die im Magazin erscheinen, werden zum download

chose que vous reconnaissez lorsque vous l'entendez. En toute

que ce soit des bruits. Si vous pensez à un Spectrum de bruit faits par
le corps humain(ou bien donc des simulations ou substitutions), et qu' à
un côté du Spectrum soit quelqu'un qui lit sa poésie, et qu'a l'autre

“Hur långt är ett poem? Så långt som det tar att framföra det.” –Bob
Cobbing

a s l o n g a s i t t a k e s, ett ljudpoesi magasin publicerat av
Atlanta Poets Group söker förslag till öppningsnumret. Vi söker efter
rader av ljudpoesi och essäer av ljudpoesi. ”Vad är ’ljudpoesi’?” Kanske
du undrar, bra fråga. Det är en sån där sak som man vet vad det är när
man ser (hör) det. Det är nog inte musik (tack Dick Higgins) det kan
vara oväsen. Om du tänker dig ett spektra av möjliga oväsen gjorda av
den mänskliga kroppen (eller simuleringar därav eller ersättningar
därför), i en ända av spektrat är en person som läser hennes dikt och i
den andra ändan är det abstrakt oväsen, vi letar efter verk som lutar
mot det sistnämnda. Vi letar efter verk i/av/i mot traditionen av Ball,
Schwitters ,Dûfrène, Henri Chopin, Jandl, Cobbing, The Four Horsemen,
Fylkingen Group, Öyvind Fahlström… Förhoppningsvis förstår du nu vad vi
menar. Vi letar efter saker som kommer att flytta/omdefiniera
gränserna.Magasinet kommer att vara webb-baserat.

<>Aslongasittakes, una rivista di poesia sonora pubblicata da Atlanta
Poets Group, sta cercando proposte per il suo numero inaugurale.
Cerchiamo sia poesie sonore che saggi sulla poesia sonora. Che cos’e’ la
“poesia sonora”? Bella domanda. E’ una di quelle cose che capisci quando
le vedi (senti). Probabilmente non e’ musica (grazie Dick Higgins).
Potrebbe essere rumore. Se si pensa a uno spettro di possibile rumore
creato dal corpo umano (oppure simulazioni o sostituzioni di esso), a un
capo dello spettro c’è una persona che legge una sua poesia e all’altro
capo dello spettro c’è del rumore astratto, noi cerchiamo lavori che
inclinino di più verso il secondo capo. Cerchiamo opere
nella/della/contro la tradizione di Ball, Schwitters, Dûfrène, Henri
Chopin, Jandl, Cobbing, The Four Horsemen… speriamo di aver reso l’idea.
Cerchiamo roba che spinga/ridefinisca i limiti. La rivista si pubblica
sul web. <>

Per favore spedite le vostre proposte a aslongasittakes@comcast.net
<mailto:aslongasittakes@comcast.net> in uno di questi formati: .mp3,
.wav, .wma, or .flac. Vi preghiamo di chiedere prima di spedirli in
altri formati. Se non potete spedire il lavoro tramite email, fatecelo
sapere via email e troveremo un altro sistema. Non sappiamo quanto tempo
ci vorrà per rispondervi, percio’ abbiate pazienza. Non potremo pagare
niente per i vostri lavori. Tutte le opere che appaiono nella rivista
potranno essere scaricate dal sito della rivista, secondo la licenza

tuo lavoro sia reso disponibile in questo modo faccelo sapere e
probabilmente riusciremo a trovare una soluzione. <>

The level of artistry, writing and production in comics has changed
continually and radically over the last forty years, with the inclusion of
ever more "forms of content" and "content of forms."  Changing technologies
greatly affected everything involved at every level of production, whether
it is a DIY project or one of the truly incredible Japanese graphic novels.
The UK also produces some extraordinary works, often far more interesting in
terms of ideas and visual art than American ones.

On the other hand,  especially since Punk DIY, you can find a continual
outpouring of really great low-fi, low-tech, low-budget comics and Zines
entirely hand made, hand drawn, painted, collaged, cheaply xeroxed or
printed off any old printer available.  Many aspects of the hand made works
are very exciting and stimulating.  Among them are the "dirtiness" which
vanishes from the more high tech productions, and especially in the use of
digital technologies.  The roughness brings texture in a rawer, more direct
way, and, done by a practised person, conveys shades of emotion and thought
that elude for the most part the digital.  There's also more inclusion of
the spontaneous aspect of the accident, as opposed to the mechanisms of
"chance operations." As many DIY comix and Zines show, it's an excellent
media for Anarchisms and Anarchists.

The Japanese have invented an incredible variety of genres, styles of
images, methods of "telling a story"in comics with often a great many frames
not using any language at all.  Comics in Japan are the most widely read
form of literature.

 (Japan's  bestseller lists now include also "cell phone novels" written
using text messaging. The huge international hit Girls of Riyadh by the
Saudi writer Rajaa Alsanea is constructed of emails from an anonymous member
of an Internet group about the life of her friends and herself.  This book,
though banned in Saudi Arabia, has generated an explosion of "chick lit" and
more serious writing by women in the Arabic speaking world.The Internet,
which does not involve physical meeting, and other constrictions of
strictly practised Islamic social and private lives. creates a contemporary
secular space in which otherwise forbidden forms of communication are
allowed to take place.  I wrote here before of the cell phone novels and of
being at a reading by Rajaa Alasanea.    )

The wave of films made from comics over the last thirty years has a lot to
do with the series of writers' strikes in Hollywood.  After the collapse of
the old model of the studio system in the 1950's, the pay and use of writers
began to change.  Increasingly, a writer could demand much more pay than
ever before,  At the same time, with many writers growing up with
television, the understandings of the uses of dialogue began to shift.
Dialogue grew more spare, with ever more emphasis on special effects and
action.
      Between 1950 and 1990 dialogue in mainstream American films declined
by 40 percent.
      (And after  Desert Storm,  International news on American TV declined
40 percent "almost overnight"and continues to decline.)

        The series of Writers Strikes since 1990 have helped fuel the heavy
dependence on remakes of American and foreign films, the film versions of
comics and the transfers of TV shows to film.  The already familiar
"concept" of a film via its previous versions and incarnations, becomes far
more important than the actual "content" within the film.  The necessity for
writers, or skilled writers, declines, except perhaps in the advertising and
marketing departments. The huge sums poured into promotion also means
there's less reason to pay for writers who will cost more than a sort of
"minimum wage."

   As so  many films became increasingly like comic books it was only
logical that there are more films made from comic books and tv cartoons.

A movie which made use of alterations of "straight" cinema  and rotoscope,
which has the look and feel of a comic, is A Scanner Darkly, from Philip K.
Dicks' novel. The switching back and forth from cinema to rotoscope images
emphasizes the the "slit vision" and "split identity" of the protagonist and
his simultaneously being a drug addict and the narcotics agent who is
assigned to spy on himself, with a complete surveillance system set up in
his shared residence that he observes on the screens at his place of
employment.

The films where one finds a real Visual Poetry of the image  in recent years
are primarily from Hong Kong and especially in the last decade, South Korea
and Thailand.  The best "experimental" oriented films I have seen in a long
time were from Malaysia, Thailand and Lebanon/Palestine.

Since the early years of the Cinema's mass popularity around the world,
there have been "Cine-Romans"--"Film-Novels," which are told through fotos
(also called "Foto-Roman")--of actors/models who "act out' the scenes.  The
camera angles used are often a hybrid of a comic and cinema "look,"
primarily using the close-up for "dramatic effect," to be sure.  There are
some genres of these that are made for persons who are illiterate or barely
literate.  Everything is told through the framing of the images, their
sequence and within the frames through the facial and gestural expressions
of the "actors."

These were supplemented  historically by the appearance of the "Tele-Romans"
which use a style modeled after television. The imagery is actually
different from the Cine-Romans in many ways, that is, the framing of it and
the difference in "definition" of the image, a matter of difference one
finds in drawing as done in various kinds of comics.   There are ones I have
seen that use the same actors posing and gesturing a kind of short hand
version of the soap operas they appear in on tv.

Interestingly, the Tele-Romans I have seen  followed closely the changes in
the Tele-Image on screen, with of course, additions in the gaudier ones of
color and an increased definition in the images.  Also a greater variety of
tele-angles and the appearance of more "background scenery" as well as more
detailed interiors. More trees, distant mountains outdoors; more furniture,
pots and pans, elaborate bedrooms in the interiors. This greatly aids the
"appearance of wealth," necessary to some of the major characters, who
before had only one or two objects by which it was indicated that they were,
indeed,fabulously rich.

Some of the really old Tele-Romans a friend in France had were on really
cheap paper and the images were almost fuzzy, as though the "Tele" the
artist used for inspiration had poor reception.  Or perhaps just a poor
eyesight! As was often charged to M. Cezanne by those who found his work so
abominable, including those writing his obituaries.

 (The obituaries for Cezanne are the most virulent I have ever seen for an
artist in any media.  "An abomination in the face of Nature!"  is a typical
of the phrases employed, and rather mild compared to many. While a few
acknowledge some young artists find Cezanne an inspiration and a "genius,"
this is usually attributed to being a "prank" on the part of the young
artists, to jerk the chain of their elders and the critics.)

The problem often is, as with these enraged critics still heaping dung on
Cezanne even as he enters at last a peaceful rest from their strident,
annoying noise, that it is not simply "new forms, technologies, materials"
which make a work "new, radical, innovative," it is the Art of Looking
itself which is different from that of the constraints of the contemporary
"scene."

Significantly, Cezanne's "problems" were often depicted--derivisively as
well as by scholars-- as being an undiagnosed form of astygmatism.  This
"bad eyesight," as well as his obviosuly "crude drawing" and "wrong
perspectives," and .in his later works, the "atrocity" of many being
appearing to be "'unfinished," "incomplete," "massive failures before the
work of the Creator, " al these things added up to "proofs" that the painter
from Aix was not only unable to see properly at all, he was also completely
crazy in persisting to fob off these atrocities as "paintings."

The paradox is that the "bad and crazy vision" of the dead artist was
perceived by Picasso and others, and much earlier by Pere Tanguy and
Vollard, as in actuality the work of a lifetime devoted to a new way of
seeing, and finding the language in painting with which to convey it.
The depth of this vision is so profound that it completely changed what was
possible to think of as painting, such as for example,  to conceive of  an
"abstract" painting which is at the same a "still life with chair caning "
or newspaper glued into it. To be able to see simulatensouly the abstract
and the concrete not as sepearte, but in fact, right before one's eyes, in
Nature.

Very soon after his death, Cezanne's seeing provided a great opening for the
first artists to be influenced by comics, the cinema, the automobile, the
ariplane, telegraph, radio, telephone and al the new machines of war.

It is not so much new machines, new objects, which change the "appearances
of things," but the ways in which they are seen, by what Robert Smitshon
called "the Art of Looking," or by
way of the "New Visions" which are produced in order to perpuate ownership
and control. These create their own "ways of seeing" according to specific
standards, which become the "accepted versions." Acceleartations of these
"versions" and "stanadrds' create a sense of the speed of the New. The
concept of "new ways of seeing" becomes a proliferating series of more or
less imposed and enforced illusions. The vaccum created in the eye of   what
had been  "an Art of Looking" becomes filled with the never ceasing, massive
production of "new objects of sight" and the entropy of the ability to see
outside a sphere of illusion, which does indeed begin in "the blank and ruin
within one's own eye."

Dear Lovely Friends,

=A0

I've organized a reading for one of my stellar Corollary
authors, Summi Kaipa, on Sunday August 10th in Brooklyn.
It is a rare treat to have her on the East Coast, and I'm thrilled at the
opportunity to introduce her work to new audiences as well as invite those
already familiar with her writing to have the pleasure of hearing her read.
She'll be reading with the equally talented Tisa Bryant, whose recent book
Unexplained Presence ought to be on everyone's reading list. Their bios are
located below.

Tisa Bryant is the author of Unexplained Presence (Leon
Works, 2007), a collection of original, hybrid essays that remix narratives
from eurocentric film, literature and visual arts and zoom in on the black
presences operating within them. She is currently working on [the curator],=
 a
fiction that meditates on identity, visual culture and the lost films of au=
teur
Justine Cable, co-editing an anthology for AIDS Project Los Angeles, and is
madly working to get Vol. 2 F-K of the Encyclopedia Project in the hopper.

Summi Kaipa has authored several chapbooks, including
"The Epics" (Leroy Press), "One: I Beg You Be Still"
(Belladonna), and most recently "The Language Parable" (Corollary
Press). For eight years, she was the editor of Interlope, a magazine publis=
hing
innovative writing by Asian Americans, and in 2002, she received a Potrero
Nuevo Fund Prize to write and produce her first play. Once a resident of SF=
's

Please note that Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel "Persepolis" will not attain cinematic adaptation in the *future*, as per Alison C.'s statement. The animated film version has been made, and was released in the US on December 25, 2007, in the UK in April, 2008. One can now get a DVD of it. I was delighted to read just now in the Wikipedia article about "Persepolis" that in Tehran there was *some* chance to see the film in February, though with excisions for sexual content.

Having been entranced by the film in early 2008, I had thought of writing something about it on the List at that time but I shied away. I was struck by the moment when Marjane is newly married (having returned to Iran after running into very hard times in Vienna, where her parents had sent her to be schooled because they were afraid of how outspoken she was and how much trouble she would thus encounter from the guardians of the Revolution). Her husband suggests that they leave the country and its morality police behind and go to the West. Marjane says oh no the West is where they don't care if you starve and die in the streets.

So there you have it, I thought. The film elaborates for the audience the specific issues of living in a country like Iran (the heavy presence of morality police scrutinizing women's clothing, scrutinizing everyone to try to stop ilicit partying from going on, and life-drawing class in Art School involves drawing a woman in a burqa, etc. etc. etc.) and the issues of living in the West (including sheer indifference to utterly unfortunate people right in front of one's eyes).

One sees in the film and the graphic novel upon which it is based vivid depictions of contrasting sorts of societies. But one is NOT in the realm of the sort of facile argumentation, not unknown on this List, that says, oh you think there is something wrong with the restrictions put on women in Iran, well all over the United States women are being forced, forced I tell you, to wear high heels.

Greetings,

Boog City=B9s looking for a small press to pinch-hit here in nyc during our
second annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music festival as part of
=B3d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press=B2 series in exile. The even=
t
is on Sun. Sept. 21, 2008 at 3:00 p.m.

Below this note is our invite letter, which spells everything out.

Please backchannel any inquiries or suggestions.

Thanks,

Hi,
=20
David Kirschenbaum here. I=B9m the editor and publisher of Boog City, a New
York City-based small press and community newspaper now in its 18th year.
I=B9d like to invite you to take part in year six of our =B3d.a. levy lives:
celebrating the renegade press=B2 series.
=20
Once a month I have a different non-NYC press host and feature three or mor=
e
of their authors to read (we=B9ve had as many as 10 for one press and usually
have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a musical act perform two 15-2=
0
minute sets. If the visiting press is able to book the musical act that=B9s
preferred, so it=B9s truly their night, if not I can book one that I think
will work well with the night. (Also, once a year we play host to our NYC
brethren.)
=20
Normally the series is held at Chelsea=B9s ACA Galleries
(http://acagalleries.com/), but for this bonus event it will be at
Unnameable Books (456 Bergen St., Brooklyn) on Sun. Sept. 21 at 3:00 p.m. a=
s
part of our our second annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music
festival.

We started the series in August 2003. In our first five seasons we=B9ve
hosted:

**June 2008: Refocussed List Policy
In line with our editorial focus, we do not automatically post
submissions but select those we think are most useful for sustaining
this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

**All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as
registered. If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it
appears in the "from" line of the message header, please sign your
post at the bottom.

**"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This, of course,
includes racist, sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem
arguments in which the person rather than their work is attacked; in
other words while critique of a person's work is welcome (critical
inquiry is one of the main functions of the list), this critique
cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

June 2008: Refocussed List Policy
In line with our editorial focus, we do not automatically post
submissions but select those we think are most useful for sustaining
this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

1. Posting to the List

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize that other
lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange, we request that
those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focused nature of this project and respect our decision to operate a
moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to doing what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Posts are limited to list
subscribers. All messages are reviewed by the editors in keeping with
the goals of the list as articulated in this Welcome Message. The
listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for discussion
and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow listserv
policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

Please note that this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics. We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links, relating to publications (print and
internet), reading series, and blogs that they have coordinated,
edited or published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Queres for contact info, messages intended
for just a few subscribers, "flame" messages, and free-standing
personal poems or journal entries will, in general, not be forwarded
to the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers. Personal queries and off-topic submissions will not be
posted.

Send messages directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


2. About the Poetics List

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1500 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation.

In addition to being archived through the EPC and at the UB Listerv
archive, some posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices,
announcements, etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject
areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also online at the
EPC.

3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email us at poetics.list --at -- gmail.com, subject-line
"registration," with your full name, street address, email address,
and telephone number. Failure to register at the time of subscription
will result in automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed frorm the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

In moderating this list, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

All posts not only go out to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

Note: Private correspondence via email and letters are always (c) the
author and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without the
written permission of the author. As a general rule, we will not
publish posts that include such material unless they indicate that
permission has been given.

We request that posters limit the number of posts they send to the
list on any given day. Given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 75
or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be changed at
the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

7. Flaming
"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This, of course, includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

Hello,

Just writing to let you all know that Santa Cruz is reopening its
search in poetry. Despite all my complaining about the handling of the
recent strike, it really is a pretty darn luxurious place to live &
work.

Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

dear folks, i've just found out that my dissertation (_too many deaths:
decolonizing western academic research on indigenous cultures_) has been
picked up by an on-demand publisher in england.  in case you're
interested, want to write a review at the site (which might interest a
paper publisher), want to support me by buying a copy (a pdf file), or
just go take a look (jenny james' atlantis books are also at this site),
go to

http://www.theguildofwriters.com/books/shop.php?action=full&id=317

the previous site that held the diss didn't allow you to buy a copy.  this
one does.  thanks for looking! (check out the other books there.)  :-)

One small error, for which I apologize.

The message I sent out about the Chax Press conference titled CHARLES
OLSON: LANGUAGE AS PHYSICAL FACT, mentions the showing of the film
POLIS IS THIS: CHARLES OLSON AND THE PERSISTENCE OF PLACE, which is a
film of course by Henry Ferrini, not Vincent Ferrini, as our earlier
announcement stated. That was an unfortunate slip on my part. It has
been changed on our web site.

Please visit http://chax.org/olson.htm for more information.

Thank you,

Dear Amy--

oddly no one seems to have noted Cocteau's ORPHEE, which inspired Jack
Spicer's receiving  poetry from the radio, nor Cocteau's Le Sang du poete
(Blood of a Poet) probably the first film to take place entirely  between an
opening of a buidling collapsing and a final "scene" of the conclusion of
the building's collapse----a play on  on the "film within a film" and also
an expression of the speed of poetic thought traveling faster than a
building collapsing, the "film of the imagination" NOT shown in the
"documentary"--yet existing simultaneously--"mental trajectories" within a
"jump cut"--

a lot of films made in France begining with Feuillades' serials (Les
Vampyrs, etc)-- France culminating in the work of Jean Vigo, L'atalante esp
and the Dali/Bunuel l'Age d'or & Chien Andalu--(one dould add Buneul's Los
Olvidados also)

Pier Paulo Pasolini -a great poet who made many  superb films--including
Chuacer's Canterbury Tales-

Robert Frank's Pull My Daisy with spontaneous bo prosody voice over
narration by Kerouac and "starring" Ginsberg, Corso & Larry Rivers-

The Howard Hawks western "El Dorado" which includes recitation of lines from
the Poe poem of that name--

Samuel Beckett films done with Buster Keaton

Antonin Artaud's astonishing screen appearances and film writing--

Eisenstein wrote essays detailing the influences of Chinese calligrpahic
poetry and influences of literature in his works

Dziga Vertov's films influenced by the art anbd poetry of Russian Futurism
and Constructivism and also Mayakovsky's starring roles in some films--

the poems and prose of Poe inspired lot of avant-garde French cinema of the
Twenties and of course the Roger Corman cult classics of early 1960's--

there's even a pretty silly Hollywood "bio-pic" of Villon--

Bertolucci's early film "The Spider Strategem" is from a great Borges
story--

Susan Howe in Writing 19 wrote a really intersting essay on Olson's "seeing
in a poem"  and cinema of Pudovkin and others--

Stan Brakhage influenced by many of the poets he encountered-for example,
-in Film Culture's Brakhage issue of Fall 1963 , Brakhage writes long letter
ot his wife Jane re his first encounter with Olson--

Amy/David

Yes, absolutely.....there is no film-poetry without Cocteau. Please consider
adding the one David mentions and to that let me append - La Sang d'un Poete
(The Blood of a Poet). These are probably two of the earliest made "poetry"
films. And how could we forget - Pull My Daisy where several Beat poets
star!

The Bunuel list, David, is unshrinkable...

and the Japanese films you forget probably come from the quartet - Kurosawa,
Mizoguchi, Ozu, Toru. Its worthwhile to check out the much forgotten Ritwik
Ghatak and Buddhadeb Dasgupta, an acclaimed poet himself.

Finally, Amy, a re-request to keep this wonderful web-resource alive for
good.

Dear Amy--

oddly no one seems to have noted Cocteau's ORPHEE, which inspired Jack
Spicer's receiving  poetry from the radio, nor Cocteau's Le Sang du poete
(Blood of a Poet) probably the first film to take place entirely  between an
opening of a buidling collapsing and a final "scene" of the conclusion of
the building's collapse----a play on  on the "film within a film" and also
an expression of the speed of poetic thought traveling faster than a
building collapsing, the "film of the imagination" NOT shown in the
"documentary"--yet existing simultaneously--"mental trajectories" within a
"jump cut"--

a lot of films made in France begining with Feuillades' serials (Les
Vampyrs, etc)-- France culminating in the work of Jean Vigo, L'atalante esp
and the Dali/Bunuel l'Age d'or & Chien Andalu--(one dould add Buneul's Los
Olvidados also)

Pier Paulo Pasolini -a great poet who made many  superb films--including
Chuacer's Canterbury Tales-

Robert Frank's Pull My Daisy with spontaneous bo prosody voice over
narration by Kerouac and "starring" Ginsberg, Corso & Larry Rivers-

The Howard Hawks western "El Dorado" which includes recitation of lines from
the Poe poem of that name--

Samuel Beckett films done with Buster Keaton

Antonin Artaud's astonishing screen appearances and film writing--

Eisenstein wrote essays detailing the influences of Chinese calligrpahic
poetry and influences of literature in his works

Dziga Vertov's films influenced by the art anbd poetry of Russian Futurism
and Constructivism and also Mayakovsky's starring roles in some films--

the poems and prose of Poe inspired lot of avant-garde French cinema of the
Twenties and of course the Roger Corman cult classics of early 1960's--

there's even a pretty silly Hollywood "bio-pic" of Villon--

Bertolucci's early film "The Spider Strategem" is from a great Borges
story--

Susan Howe in Writing 19 wrote a really intersting essay on Olson's "seeing
in a poem"  and cinema of Pudovkin and others--

Stan Brakhage influenced by many of the poets he encountered-for example,
-in Film Culture's Brakhage issue of Fall 1963 , Brakhage writes long letter
ot his wife Jane re his first encounter with Olson--

there must be thousands more considering how many films in so many languages
from so many cultures there are!  many come to mind but at moment can't
recall the tiles clearly enough--from, Japan and India alone--

Yes, Pasolini and Cocteau are odd oversights. And also Andrei Tarkovsky, to
me an arch poet of film, especially in Stalker. He quotes poems in most (if
not all) of his film, mostly those of his father, Arsey Tarkovsky.  I wrote
an essay on Stalker - Tarkovsky's Stalker: A poet in a destitute time - last
year, if anyone is interested -

And I should have been the one to remind you of Pasolini, thanks. To
the *Canterbury
Tales* you should add
*Decameron* (taken from Giovanni Boccaccio's homonymous work) in which the
same Pasolini appears with Giuseppe Zigaina (painter and most important
friend of the poet), the movie was also shot in this town at the Civic
Museum defined by Pasolini "the most beautiful museum he has ever seen", and

*A Thousand and One Nights* (the original title is The Flower of the One
Thousand and One Nights) a sublime poem by itself.
Later on these three movies will be defined *The Trilogy of life*.
Moreover, Pasolini chose his actors from the paintings of the masters and
reproduced the same scenes directly from the paintings. He preferred
Mannerism to all other styles, and his favorite painter was (if I am not
wrong) Andrea del Sarto. He studied at the University of Bologna, one of his
professors was Roberto Longhi (main Italian art critic, no wonder he started
out from Art).

David, yes, your list--of course--that these were forgotten...i have another film/ not quite like others in same sense but one of my favorite films "Songs From
The Second Floor" (Roy Andersson, Sweden)--a repeating scene in the mental hospital
the father laments in words such as "he wrote poetry until he went mad" or "if only
he would have stopped writing poetry"--and this film is magnificent and it's a
question i often pose to myself. Thanks, David.

Dear Amy--

oddly no one seems to have noted Cocteau's ORPHEE, which inspired Jack
Spicer's receiving  poetry from the radio, nor Cocteau's Le Sang du poete
(Blood of a Poet) probably the first film to take place entirely  between an
opening of a buidling collapsing and a final "scene" of the conclusion of
the building's collapse----a play on  on the "film within a film" and also
an expression of the speed of poetic thought traveling faster than a
building collapsing, the "film of the imagination" NOT shown in the
"documentary"--yet existing simultaneously--"mental trajectories" within a
"jump cut"--

a lot of films made in France begining with Feuillades' serials (Les
Vampyrs, etc)-- France culminating in the work of Jean Vigo, L'atalante esp
and the Dali/Bunuel l'Age d'or & Chien Andalu--(one dould add Buneul's Los
Olvidados also)

Pier Paulo Pasolini -a great poet who made many  superb films--including
Chuacer's Canterbury Tales-

Robert Frank's Pull My Daisy with spontaneous bo prosody voice over
narration by Kerouac and "starring" Ginsberg, Corso & Larry Rivers-

The Howard Hawks western "El Dorado" which includes recitation of lines from
the Poe poem of that name--

Samuel Beckett films done with Buster Keaton

Antonin Artaud's astonishing screen appearances and film writing--

Eisenstein wrote essays detailing the influences of Chinese calligrpahic
poetry and influences of literature in his works

Dziga Vertov's films influenced by the art anbd poetry of Russian Futurism
and Constructivism and also Mayakovsky's starring roles in some films--

the poems and prose of Poe inspired lot of avant-garde French cinema of the
Twenties and of course the Roger Corman cult classics of early 1960's--

there's even a pretty silly Hollywood "bio-pic" of Villon--

Bertolucci's early film "The Spider Strategem" is from a great Borges
story--

Susan Howe in Writing 19 wrote a really intersting e
ssay on Olson's "seeing
in a poem"  and cinema of Pudovkin and others--

Stan Brakhage influenced by many of the poets he encountered-for example,
-in Film Culture's Brakhage issue of Fall 1963 , Brakhage writes long letter
ot his wife Jane re his first encounter with Olson--

there must be thousands more considering how many films in so many languages
from so many cultures there are!  many come to mind but at moment can't
recall the tiles clearly enough--from, Japan and India alone--

Two mainstream movies with poetry in the plot worth mentioning--

BACK TO SCHOOL --millionaire slob RODNEY DANGERFIELD decides to go to
college, with all the predictable results. In order to pass a crucial test,
he recites Dylan Thomas' "Do Not Go Gentle " a la' Dangerfield. His
recitation was included on the film's soundtrack CD (for all you high school
teacher on the list trying to get your charges interested in the sullen art)

IN HER SHOES -- Cameron Diaz as a dyslexic ditz-moocher who has burnt out
good will with family and is now an aide at a nursing home. One of her
charges is a blind retired English prof who has Diaz recite poetry to her,
watch film and her the lovely Ms. Diaz stumble through Elizabeth Bishop.
Prof dies, but Diaz improves her reading skills through intervention of
poetry.

_______________________

I must add here an amazing episode of NAKED CITY which features a show
about cops investigating the murder of a poet. Played by Burgess Merideth,
it seems to be based on life of Maxwell Bodenheim, famous Village habitue'
who had been murdered only a few years back. Filmed entirely in Greenwich
Village, the climatic moment occurs in an early version of a poetry slam
filmed in a real coffee house. Merideth is exposed by a young (angry) poet
--played by Alan Alda-- to be passing off a poem by Kenneth Fearing as one
of his own (& the Fearing poem is accurately quoted). Also features a rare
screen appearence by famed acting teacher sanford Mesner (naked City four
year run is filled with many future stars ranging from Dustin Hoffman to
Robert Redford who were then playing in Off-broadway as Naked City was done
in NYC)This episode can be found on one of the DVD compilitations of the
show.

Dear Alison, Anny & Bobbi--

thanks so much for your insights re the film you write of.

The Andrea del Sarto! (the line in Pound poem abt him, too--) It's amazing
the trajectory Pasolini's films make--from the neo-realist Roman accented
speech of ACCATONE, which in a strange way (i saw it light years ago) made
me think of a version of Narcissus, and a meditation on beauty, the great
film of Gospel According to Saint Matthew and the austere Greek
trageies--then the bizarre invasion of decadence by even greater decadence
in Teorema--hurtling into the Mannerist Trilogy --and then the orgy of
(Capitalist?) human pigs in Porcione--

There is an amzing long poem by Pasolini that continas as one of the
tributaries entertwining like snakes in its flow a meditation on some as I
recall interview with Godard--in which Pasolini remarks that with clinical
lucidty he now sees hiw own complete lack of lucidty.

It's a bit like the film Bobbi writes of--the "clinical lucidty" gives a
"viewpoint" for the poet/filmmaker of his own "lack of lucidity"--which may
simply mean--'lack of clinical lucidity," or "lucidty" as considere by the
clinical lucidty--

So, donning the persona of a psychiatrist ("Super ego?") for a moment, the
poet judges himself "lacking in lucidity," and so "nuts, ""lost in the
obscurity of madness,"  or "seeing as through a glass DARKLY"-- (lucidity
being light)--

Pasolini's self-questioning is put a different way in a scene using  poetry
in the film Apocalypse Now (from Conrad's Heart of Darkness.) .   Marlon
Brando's Colonel Kurtz, accused by the Army of using  "unsound methods,"
breaks off reading and reciting from T S Eliot's "The Hollow Men" to himself
and Martin Sheen's Marlow, to ask if Marlow, too, finds his methods
"unsound."   To which Marlow replies "I see no method . . . at all, Sir."

It seems part of the Army's "judgement" of Kurtz has to do with his reciting
poetry while leading an Army who worship him as a God. Marlow has already
witnessed Robert Duvall's "weird glow" of surfing-obsessed Invincibility,
which makes him kind of a God to his Command, too. In the midst of all the
insanity and mass slaughter, the only thing that really sets Kurz apart
seems to be his obssesion with questions asked in poems, combined with his
leading "savages" and the "re-created" previous American assassins sent to
kill him.

The other "artist" figure on the scene, Dennis Hopper's photo-journalist,
pleads with Marlow "not to judge" Kurtz.  The only thing comensurate to such
a being, the photographer tells Marlow, is the jungle. "When it dies, he
dies and when he dies, it dies." The "only solution" in the final
"Apocalypse" is simply to send a massive air strike agsint Kurtz's jungle
realm, bombing and napalming into oblivion the T. S. Eliot reciting renegade
and all his followers. So much for asking questions regarding a scuttling
crab and Hollow Men!

Maybe becase, like Apocalypse Now,  it's an "epic" film, Dr Zhivago seems to
have been neglected of mention.  The story of a poet-doctor written by a
poet from an artistic and musical family, who when very young knew Leo
Tolstoy,  and later Myakovksy, Eisenstein, everyy one, for a glorious, open
period,-until forced into "retirement" for decades, translating Shakespeare
and Gothe to survive, the film of Pasternak's novel doesn't really allude
all that much to Zhivago's own poetry.  (Even in the novel, the poems are an
Appenidix as it were.) All the same, Dr Zhivago is one of the rare Western
poets other than Homer to recieve truly the "epic" treatment on a truly
grand scale in the cinema.  (Homer turns up in Goadard's Contempt, along
with allusions to "BB"  as both Bert Brecht/Brigitte Bardot, as well as
launching who knows how many ships and armies from Italy's Cinecitta alone.)

And who can forget the procession through the entire history of cinema from
all corners of the world of films with poetry generated by Shakespeare
alone?

Even in the 1970's remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a main
character is a poet--"Beatnik" poets in the Corman classic Bucket of
Blood--the Blake reciting painter Gulley Jimson in The Horse's Mouth from
Joyce Cary's novel--there are thousands and thousands  of poets stowed away
in the hulks of bulky old metal film containers, filled with deteriorating
celluloid and the disintegrating lines of fragements uttered and scribbled
by ever more obscure characters--real poets,make believe poets, ghosts of
poets, poets' ghost writers, poets' plagiarizers and imitators and forgers,
posthumously known poets, almost completley and permanently unknown
poets--except in their "appearances on film"--poets only known to have
existed by showing up in a fragment in a dim, jerky, blotchy old reel--and
then vanishing into the shadows of rooms of places long ago tumbled down and
becoming muclh for the unwitting descendents of Whitman's Leaves of Grass--

The films and film writings of Blaise Cendrars--of the Lettriste founder
Isidore Isou--a short film colab by Julio Cortazar--

Not to mention the serial-killing fascist, poetry plagiarizing,
sky-writing, polaraoid photographer of the gory remains of  his
"disappeared" victims, ( following Pinochet's Coup), the "atrocity exhibit"
creator and founder of the "New Chiliean Poetry." poet Carlos Weider aka
Ruiz-Tagle in Roberto Bolano's Distant Star, who is the shadowy second
camera man of porno films made in Italy, and most likely the killer of their
entire casts and crews.

Deep sea divers of the depths of film, more specialized than some of the
various other  forms of Cinephiles and Cinefous, while be empoyed on
"treasure hunts" among these "lost vaults" corroding in the Davy Jones'
lockers of the world's cinematic waters--even the Rivers will be trawled for
the remains of any poems that may have been in the pockets of some drowned
cinematic poet, pushed off a bridge, or died in a ditch like Omar
Caseres--divers
in search of" the forensic details of the drowned but undying voices of
poets rocked in the Waters of a perhaps no longer altogether obdurate and
unyielding Oblivion . . .

While floating overhead among the Armada of Ishamels clinging to coffins and
ships' furnishings, there goes Orpheus, floating on his back and spouting
water and lines high, high into the air,  like a beaming whale painted by
Gulley Jimson, surrounded by porposies and surfing sirens singing Sapphic
hymns--

Or perhaps this is already a movie, just one among the hundreds and hundreds
one remembers only vaguely---and that come back to haunt one while watching
clouds far larger than any drive in screens--loud and lurid with the
Ultra-Techniclors of a Most Dramatic Sunset--a scene escaped from some old
film too ecstatically decrepit to any longer "keep it a secret"--and launhed
into the flows of time like water borne lanterns and wine cups in an
thousand year old Chinese poem--

(Or is that the great Chinese film maker's Olympic Opening ceremeony?--)

Total Eclipse by Agnieszka Holland based on the play by Christopher Hampton
about Verlaine and Rimbaud. Someone mentioned this movie somewhere else, I
will have to keep it in mind and watch it. Thanks.

David,

Keeping your expanding approach going:

a) The Seattle guru-like poet in My Private Idaho, who was based on a actual
poet. Ther movie itself was based on S's play Henry IV. The poet and River
Phoenix figures play the Falstaff figure and Keanu Reeves the young prodigal
prince who cuts, yejects, disowns them when he rejoins his father's business
and turns away from his gay street hustler's life.

b) Whitman and kinky sex (painting the toes to Whitman) in Bull Durham,
where baseball itself is treated like a poem, and even Doc Hollywood where
the old doctor of the Utopian fantasy town in the middle of the United
States which grows the biggest squashes, after dinner and drunk, reads
Whitman endlessly through the night.

c) Endless quotations from philosophers, artists, poets, revolutionaries,
jingles and phrases from T.V. commercials which permeate all Godard movies.

d) In the Mood for Love the man character is writing a Karate hero comics
while his cigarette smoke fills the entire screen. This writing (a
collaboration between the hero and heroine) is treated as a secret love
affair taking place in small rooms, first a boarding house surrounded by
spouses and neighbor, then in a hotel room with beautiful wall paper.

The movie in which Coyote plays the Italian poet Montale. Coyote is now
doing voice-overs in history and nature documentaries.

Ciao,

Murat

One should not forget Miami Blues in which the psychopathic Alec Baldwin
character burgles a house to steal a coin collection, simultaneously
composing a haiku about it, the middle line of which is "breaking and
entering." Absolutely priceless! Does anyone remember the entire gem?

Has Eternal Sunshine of the Spotlless Mind been mentioned? The title is bas=
ed on a line from an Alexander Pope poem. (I have to admit that I am not fa=
miliar with it, although I did study Pope at one time--long ago.) The movie=
 does support the title. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett are in it--both have =
their minds erased and thus their love affair. Well, I am sure that you hav=
e all seen it, and perhaps it has been mentioned in the posts about movies =
with poetry.

David,

Keeping your expanding approach going:

a) The Seattle guru-like poet in My Private Idaho, who was based on a actua=
l
poet. Ther movie itself was based on S's play Henry IV. The poet and River
Phoenix figures play the Falstaff figure and Keanu Reeves the young prodiga=
l
prince who cuts, yejects, disowns them when he rejoins his father's
business
and turns away from his gay street hustler's life.

b) Whitman and kinky sex (painting the toes to Whitman) in Bull Durham,
where baseball itself is treated like a poem, and even Doc Hollywood where
the old doctor of the Utopian fantasy town in the middle of the United
States which grows the biggest squashes, after dinner and drunk, reads
Whitman endlessly through the night.

c) Endless quotations from philosophers, artists, poets, revolutionaries,
jingles and phrases from T.V. commercials which permeate all Godard movies.

d) In the Mood for Love the man character is writing a Karate hero comics
while his cigarette smoke fills the entire screen. This writing (a
collaboration between the hero and heroine) is treated as a secret love
affair taking place in small rooms, first a boarding house surrounded by
spouses and neighbor, then in a hotel room with beautiful wall paper.

The movie in which Coyote plays the Italian poet Montale. Coyote is now
doing voice-overs in history and nature documentaries.

Murat

Please excuse the possible redundancy,
but how's about the Ken Russell flicks:

_Dante's Inferno

_Gothic (featuring both Shelley's and a Byron)

And his two Clouds of Glory films:

_William and Dorothy (the Wordsworths)

_The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

Gerald S.

Has Eternal Sunshine of the Spotlless Mind been mentioned? The title is
based on a line from an Alexander Pope poem. (I have to admit that I am not
familiar with it, although I did study Pope at one time--long ago.) The
movie does support the title. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett are in it--both
have their minds erased and thus their love affair. Well, I am sure that you
have all seen it, and perhaps it has been mentioned in the posts about
movies with poetry.

Best,
Mary Kasimor

David,

Keeping your expanding approach going:

a) The Seattle guru-like poet in My Private Idaho, who was based on a actual
poet. Ther movie itself was based on S's play Henry IV. The poet and River
Phoenix figures play the Falstaff figure and Keanu Reeves the young prodigal
prince who cuts, yejects, disowns them when he rejoins his father's
business
and turns away from his gay street hustler's life.

b) Whitman and kinky sex (painting the toes to Whitman) in Bull Durham,
where baseball itself is treated like a poem, and even Doc Hollywood where
the old doctor of the Utopian fantasy town in the middle of the United
States which grows the biggest squashes, after dinner and drunk, reads
Whitman endlessly through the night.

c) Endless quotations from philosophers, artists, poets, revolutionaries,
jingles and phrases from T.V. commercials which permeate all Godard movies.

d) In the Mood for Love the man character is writing a Karate hero comics
while his cigarette smoke fills the entire screen. This writing (a
collaboration between the hero and heroine) is treated as a secret love
affair taking place in small rooms, first a boarding house surrounded by
spouses and neighbor, then in a hotel room with beautiful wall paper.

The movie in which Coyote plays the Italian poet Montale. Coyote is now
doing voice-overs in history and nature documentaries.

Ciao,

Murat

if lines of poems it is, then=20

No Country for Old Men should be included, it's the first line of Yeats' Sa=
iling to Byzantium.=A0=20

I guess it depends on how far you want to take it.

Has Eternal Sunshine of the Spotlless Mind been mentioned? The title is bas=
ed on
a line from an Alexander Pope poem. (I have to admit that I am not familiar=
 with
it, although I did study Pope at one time--long ago.) The movie does suppor=
t the
title. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett are in it--both have their minds erased=
 and
thus their love affair. Well, I am sure that you have all seen it, and perh=
aps
it has been mentioned in the posts about movies with poetry.
=A0
Best,
Mary Kasimor

David,

Keeping your expanding approach going:

a) The Seattle guru-like poet in My Private Idaho, who was based on a actua=
l
poet. Ther movie itself was based on S's play Henry IV. The poet and River
Phoenix figures play the Falstaff figure and Keanu Reeves the young prodiga=
l
prince who cuts, yejects, disowns them when he rejoins his father's
business
and turns away from his gay street hustler's life.

b) Whitman and kinky sex (painting the toes to Whitman) in Bull Durham,
where baseball itself is treated like a poem, and even Doc Hollywood where
the old doctor of the Utopian fantasy town in the middle of the United
States which grows the biggest squashes, after dinner and drunk, reads
Whitman endlessly through the night.

c) Endless quotations from philosophers, artists, poets, revolutionaries,
jingles and phrases from T.V. commercials which permeate all Godard movies.

d) In the Mood for Love the man character is writing a Karate hero comics
while his cigarette smoke fills the entire screen. This writing (a
collaboration between the hero and heroine) is treated as a secret love
affair taking place in small rooms, first a boarding house surrounded by
spouses and neighbor, then in a hotel room with beautiful wall paper.

The movie in which Coyote plays the Italian poet Montale. Coyote is now
doing voice-overs in history and nature documentaries.

Ciao,

Murat

Great movie! That rare book-to-film adaption that's not only well cast and
directed, but which also captures the essence of Charles Willeford's
writing.

The whole haiku is:

Thinking he's alone (he starts, then...)

Breaking, entering
the dark and lonely places.
Finding a big gun.

Smelling like a rose...

I wish he'd finished more.

Below is an email from Scott Draves sent to the generative art list. It
links to a work of generative visual art by Scott Draves. You can download a
(Windows or Linux) screensaver of the generative art at
http://community.electricsheep.org/node/281 . run the installer and then
right click your desktop, click Properties, and then go to the Screensaver
tab and select electricsheep. i found it crashed (just press Enter to exit
the crash) a couple of times the first day, but i gather that's just as it
first downloads videos. After the first day, it has been running fine on my
machine.

Why send this to a list concerned with poetry when Draves's piece is
generative of abstract visual art?

Well, a few reasons. It's an interesting work of net art. And literary art
can also be generative. And there are a few interesting poet-programmers,
and this piece is quite well programmed.

Also, on the mememe side, I've been developing a generative piece called
dbCinema ( http://vispo.com/dbcinema/meditations.htm ). Which has both a
visual and a literary dimension (a text 'brush', for instance). You can
compare Draves's visuals (and concepts) with mine and see what you come up
with.


***************

Good news: this year siggraph chose my generative artwork as their
graphic identity:
http://www.siggraph.org/s2008/credits/

i am here at the conference and the image is all over the place, from
t-shirts to the 5 big screens in the main presentation hall.  if anyone
wants to meet-up to chat pls drop me a line or come to the party
(tonight, sorry late notice):

http://www.new.facebook.com/event.php?eid=26490437002

where i'll be showing the 100GB HD installation as well as the all-new

Thanks Larry. If I remember correctly, only the first three lines are the
haiku. The Baldwin character pronounces the second in a quaint way, which
makes that scene so memorable, fitting the steps of the burglary to a poem.
Another fascinating detail is that Baldwin commits the deed while his girl
friend is preparing dinner (vinegar pie?), which he always likes. Crime as a
poem? Domestic life as crime?
I agree with you. Every scene in the movie is memorable.
Ciao,
Murat

Keeping your expanding approach going:
The death scene for Rutger Hauer's cyborg character in "Blade Runner" contains a tercet that goes something like this:
I've seen ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion
and star gleam on the Tannhauser Gate,
Now it's time to die. . .

Dear Jordan:

as the creator of the cover art or your poem collection FACINGS
i am happy to bring more "art information"--

you can find the lecture in its entirety at the following site,(below)
as well as in print in Mary Ellen Caws superb anthology the site is for
and also in print in the always easy to find always superb anthology ed. by
Herschel Chipp Theories of Modern Art
it was published first in 1951
though i believe the lecture itself given in 1950 (at the Museum of Modern
Art

(i found  your question taking a break from the poetry of general patton & =
a
french book on Torture:  Cancer of Democracy)

there is an incredible essay on the Anarchism of many of the Abstract
Expressionists, an aspect usually left out in discussing them, though often
very obvious in their statements, by John Zerzan

abstract expressionism actually didn't sell al that well in its time period=
,
but it was used, like Jazz, to promote America abroad, as Jenny  Holzer is
today (her one million dollar installation at Venice Bienale, etc)

(Sartre wrote a fascinating essay on the effects of American literature in
Europe in the late '30's and during ww2--and how the various governments,
Facist, Communist, esp, and Occupation Forces German and then American, use=
d
these books to tell completely opposing narratives/versions of the usa as
presented in the Big Name writers of the time--)

Drive, he said--Jack Nicholson's directorial debut and a Cannes entry of
1971--

i have always imagined the title to come from the famous Creeley line/poem--
though the film is from a novel by jeremy Lerner--
i haven't seen that film in so long --and what i recall, it's quite possible
the line is from Creeley--

Basketball Diaries from the book by Jim Carroll, also songwriter/musician
band leader (the Jim Carroll Band)and poet

and i keep thinking about William Blake being quoted in The Horse's Mouth
and William Blake as the name of the character (played by Johnny Depp) in
the film Deadman
who, while is NOT william blake the poet,  the American Indian who finds him
wounded and escorts him to the  "waters of oblivion" keeps speaking to as
though he IS william blake the poet--the spirit of him--

an extraordinary film in which there is also a "case of mistaken
literary/cinema identity" is the magnificent The Spirit of the Beehive
directed by Victor Erice with the astounding Anna Torrant--in which a  young
girl, greatly moved by the sadness of the Frankenstein in James Whale's
film version of Mary Shelley's book, enlists her young girl friend in
helping a tramp in whom they see the qualities of Frankenstein which so
greatly affected them--

the film leaves open the "obvious" ambiguity of the Frankentsein in the
film, who kills a young girl he tries to befriend, as what the young girls
"read onto" the tramp is the "good" Frankenstein who they see as wronged and
sad and in need of a caring hand--

hovering in the air is also the recent Spanish Civil War and the WW2 in
which Spain is neutral--this "background hum' as it were permeating the
repression of national and cultural  trauma by the Franco Regime--

( a person who intends Good to more extreme  tramp figures is treated in an
entirely other way, as the repressed  cancers that Franco's Spain produces
explode in violence, murder and attempted rape on the former Novice
Viridiana in Bunuel's film of that name)

there are a number of film versions also of writings by Dylan Thomas--A
Child's Christmas in Wales, Under Milkwood--

as well as the films from Lorca's plays and poetry including the flamenco
ballet of Carlos Saura's  Blood Wedding --

a "reverse engineering" of poetry and cinema exists for me in a lot of my
work done this year, which had inspiration from a person and images in the
film Battle of Algiers, which i saw yet again, with a very young
audience--as always the film inspries a great enthusiasm for the fight for
independence and justice in the face of the Oppressor-in the audience-
what was s striking was that in the hall after the film had let out, it was
hitting as in a wave al the people discussing what they had seen--that the
roles of the French in the film are now those of the US and its
allies--torturers, creators of outdoor prisons made of entire city areas,
mass arrests, detentions--

a great many techniques, images, lines from the cinema have affected those
in poetry--
that is, in many cases, the cinema and its formal and techniocal devices
have had a great many effects in poetry, as well as the other way round--

Kerouac called it "book-movie, the original American Form"--and in
Philadelpho Menezes' Poetics and Visuality A Trajectory of Contemporary
Brazilian Poetry, sonority is presented as the next problem facing an
experimental poetry (for Menzes this means Concrete, Visual, Sound and
Inter-sign Poetries) which has "in its undeclared project" the "rejoining"
of the  the verbal, visual and sound, with sound NOT being the oralization
of the writtten word/sign. To point in this direction, Menezes gives
examples taken from the cinema, in which the sounds being heard are not
those of the object being shown/read. This embraces such techniques as uses
of music, voice-over narration and the like.

To give a sense of each Visual Poem being at once a "movie on a page" and as
a series   which the "presence" of an "imagery" in all senses of the term is
moving through, the flikr gallery "Cinema of Catharsis" is the name given to
a long series of new and recent pieces which began in finding in an old
(1963) Life Magazine a huge color foto of Vietnamese inside a wire fenced
area watched over by guards and shipers aloft in small towers, being show an
American film designed to "win hearts and minds"--

the "Serials" of Louis Feuillade made in the 19 teens in France greatly
inspired the Surrealist poets and visual artists--
"harking back" (as Max Ernst makes explicit in his
Visual-Collage-Serial-Novel creations) to the serials of th first half of
the 19th Century and their illustrations, mass ditributed in the competing
newspapers and magazines of the time which effected Poe and his uses of the
"short story" and his (reverse engineered AFTER the fact of the composition
of "The Raven"  it details)  "Principles of Composition" which proposes that
only the short poem (one that can be read in one sitting) is now really
valid in such speeded up times--

Poe's emphasis on the "short story," the "short poem," as simultaneously
"discrete and complete" makes of each work a metynomic device which "points
towards" that all encompassing enigmatic Cosmos of his "Eureka" which so
greatly inspired the mathematician-poet Paul Valery.

In his film esays, Eisenstein explores the cinematic image as a metynomic
device, so that one ship made be made to stand for a fleet, and so "leap
over" both a too literal "realism" into a poetic one and also the image as
metaphor--

montage is the order in which the discrete elements are assembled to,create
the :"effect"--which Poe argues is the "starting point" for the composition
of the poem--yet for Eisenstein is what emerges from a dialectical method of
assemblage--

in both examples, the "effect" "overall" of the assemblage of discrete
elements is to be "greater than the sum of the parts:" for Poe the effect is
to create an emotional meditation which points to his Cosmos ("mournful and
never ending remembrance") and for Eisenstein it is to point to the
dialectics of revolutionary thought as/in action--

this use of "short" stories, poems, metonymic images also produces a sense
of "focus"
which in strange way is what Ezra Pound was able to perform when editing
Eliot'sprawling mass of ms materials for "The Wasteland" yet unable to
sustain in his own Cantos--

(Eliot via LaForgue, Corbiere and Baudelaire's translations, is a rhizomatic
descendent of Poe, ironically enough shown by the then contemporary
Anti-Eliot  W.C. Willaims as The Pioneer of American Writing in his
attention with language, in the final chapter of' "In the American Grain")

At the same time as Poetry is being broekn down in trems of its focus, from
poem, to line to word to letter in avant-gardes of the the first 20 years of
the 20th Century, the cinema was also on theone hand sweeling into the Epic
and on the other into ever more focus on the discrete element of the single
frame as THE element of composition, though a frame which at the time is
being show (at that time) 16 frames per second--making of each instant a
series--

(Fordism and Taylorism are stimulated in their developments  of techniques
made possible by the anaylsis of movements provided by the cinema, as a
technology which "synthesizs" those of Muybridge already literally employed
in such a manner by the Kings of Time mande manifest in the ever increaing
efficiency of the "assembly line"--which in a sense is the "original" of
what the Surerelaists break down into the writing gmae of the Exquisite
Corpse--
which "recaptures" the Dream elements associated from its introduction with
the Cinema and the experience of the spectator inside the darkness opening
"inwardly outward"  into the projected imagery of the "unconscious" on the
screen--
echocing the opening of that great favorite of the Surrealists, Gerard de
Nerval's "Aurelia ou Le Reve et La Vie"

*"Our dreams are a second life. I have never been able to cross through
those gates of ivory of horn which separate us from the invisible world
without a sense of dread."*

The "portals of ivory"  which seem to have inspired the architecture and
decor of so many of the first "Dream Palaces"--

or the entrances to  "Caves of Lascaux" and so many others, continually
being disovred as a series moving further and further "back" into the
historical-archeological "records/recordings/notations/images" of human
consciouness/the unconscious--

which, with images viewed by flickering light on the walls of caves, are a
cinema which precedes the finding of Plato's Cave--
a Visual Poetry whose Sonorities as Menezes writes--lie ahead--
yet which at the same time may already have been "sounding" for tens of
thousands of years--
only in a sounding which, paradoxically, by having been anchored on stone in
caves, has endured so long that the while the images are still visible and
"seen" as "signs of a writing"--their sounds have  been "lost" to the
contemporary ear--
although in the sound chambers of the caves they may be sounding and
resounding,  echoing
a poetry which has outlasted its listeners--
or--
perhaps, is the poetry Jack Spicer is writing of  in declaring "nobody
listens to poetry anymore"--
making it possible to wonder in turn if perhaps in some ways "poetry listens
to no one anymore"--
a cinematic sonority found in caves that goes unheard--
and an experimental poetry(Menezes means by this Concrete and Visual Poetry,
Sound Poetry)--that will learn by listening to the cinema's sonorities--
an acoustic dimension which echoes Emerson's
"Perhaps the blank and ruin we see in Nature is in our own eye."
--a "non Poetry" one "does not hear" which is in one's own ears--
as a poetry "nobody listens to anymore"--
which in turn may suggest a poetry which does not listen--anymore--
to that which emerges out of the rocks marked in the notations of  a time
which moves at a different speed----
a sounding-
not as an object, but like Robert Smithson's "Look of the Artist," something
that is a "glance"  "taking place"  in time--
not bound to the word alone, as Menezes proposes--
(something which in effect cannot be owned)--
in a sense, "nobody listens to poetry anymore"
understood differently, as
"nobody" listens to poetry anymore-
being that "nobody" owns it anymore--
a "Utopian" nobody which  means "everybody"--
hears it--
(Rimbaud's vision in poetry of  the entrance into the "Splendid City" and
"Christmas on Earth"
in which everyone and everything is poetry--and Menezes' of the 'Utopian"
arrival via his vision of the "undeclared" mission of a  poetry  questioning
every aspect of society including language, habits, values, "'sensibility
itself'" as the manifestations of the structural bases of the dominant
ideology-in both Rimbaud and Menezes is the desire and work to overcome the
"separations" which are continually being constructed to keep poetry from
the "world"  via the "word"-- -)

Synesthesic Cell Structures
at The Cell
Monday, August 18 (8 p.m.)

The sonic flavors of brushstrokes, the smells of musical improvisation, the
tactile textures of poetic images, synesthesia. Over centuries artists
working in a range of media have been inspired by other art forms, and they
have drawn on expressions in other art forms to explain and map out creative
forays along spectrums of genres. Hunches about these connections can lead
to investigations into parallel processes and new angles. During this event
we explore correspondences among and interstices between art forms-focusing
on music, film, and poetry. The following films will be shown while music
and poetry is performed: Ginta Gets His Car Washed, by Rona Mark;
Tumbleweed, by Brian Fitzhugh; Black Earth Images, by Jayve Montgomery;
Becoming Formless and Love in Outer Space and Under Water, by Annie Heckman;
Reflect and Cityscape #1 by Mikey Peterson; and several others.

Dear Poet,
=20
The Colrain Poetry Manuscript Conference, designed for poets with a
book-length manuscript, has been a tremendous success, drawing
accomplished poets from all over the country and overseas. This
conference has been created for poets who are either ready to publish a
book-length (or chapbook-length) manuscript or who feel they need a
reality check on their current manuscript-in-progress. Since our first
conference, in March of 2006, over 20 poets have had their manuscripts
accepted for publication. Colrain publication news is found here
<http://www.colrainpoetry.com/omnis-news.htm> .=20
=20
On September 12-15, 2008, a subset of this conference, the Colrain
Poetry Manuscript Intensive takes place in Plainfield, Mass. It is based
on the regular Colrain model and methodology but strictly limited to 10
qualified participants. We have spaces still available and I invite you
to apply asap. I will lead a workshop and Jeffrey Levine from Tupelo
Press will analyze and discuss your manuscripts. Check out the web site
for more info and application:

www.colrainpoetry.com/September <http://www.colrainpoetry.com/September>

=20
If you feel you have a manuscript ready for publication, if you have
received a rejection and don't know why, if your manuscript has achieved
finalist or semi-finalist standing in a contest, or if you simply want
to gain an understanding of how publishers and editors work behind the
scenes before submitting your manuscript, then this conference is for
you.=20
=20
I hope you will join us!=20

"The Colrain Manuscript Conference managed to pack into a weekend what a

individually: offer finishing touches to a manuscript eager to be picked
up by a publisher."
Steve Fellner, Brockport, NY

"...It was a goldmine for me especially, removed as I am from the
academic world and from a community of serious poets."
LouAnn Muhm, Park Rapids, MN, Teacher, Creative Writing

"...extremely helpful to hear responses to the other manuscripts. I
learned as much or more from the critiques of others' manuscripts as I
did from the critique of mine."
Mary Crow, Fort Collins, CO, Poet Laureate of Colorado

" Attending the Colrain Manuscript Conference was undoubtedly the most
profound poetry experience I=92ve ever had. What I learned in =
forty-eight

POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT:

Executive Director for Small Press Traffic



Small Press Traffic announces a call for applications for the
position of Executive Director, to begin employment on
January 1, 2009.



Since 1974, Small Press Traffic has been at the heart of the San
Francisco Bay Area's innovative writing communities, bringing
together a diverse constituency of independent readers, writers,
and independent presses through our influential reading series,
poets theater festivals, conferences, and publications. Graciously
housed at the California College of the Arts, we remain autonomous,
and thus depend upon outside funding for our operating expenses.
Currently, we are looking for a highly skilled and creative Executive
Director to provide both artistic vision and financial leadership.



The Executive Director at Small Press Traffic serves as both
the Artistic and Financial Manager for the organization. S/he
ensures that (a) the overall quality and diversity of programming
is consistent with Small Press Traffic's history and mission and
(b) that the organization conducts its community and financial
affairs in a professional and timely manner. Areas of responsibility
include, but are not limited to: event programming, budget and
finance, fundraising, and public relations. Above all, the Executive
Director serves as the public face of the organization, and is
responsible for helping shape the vision and direction of Small
Press Traffic, as well as being open and responsive to our dynamic
and diverse communities of writers, readers, and audience members.



Programming: The Executive Director, in consultation with the
Board of Directors, oversees the planning and development of
Small Press Traffic's artistic program, which includes live literary
events, fundraisers, the website, archives, publications, and any
other forms of literary presentation and preservation.



Fundraising: The Executive Director initiates and coordinates
Small Press Traffic's fundraising efforts. These efforts include
submitting grant applications to government and private funding
agencies, meeting and corresponding with potential funders,
cultivating individual members and donors, planning and
hosting benefit events, assisting the Board of Directors with
its fundraising initiatives, submitting reports and payment
requests to individuals and agencies, and pursuing new fundraising
opportunities.



Public Relations: Small Press Traffic is a 34-year old
organization with a reputation for offering high-quality
programming that represents its commitment to a culturally
diverse avant-garde. It is important that Small Press Traffic
maintains good working relationships with writers, artists,
arts and literary organizations, funding and government
agencies, the press, and other groups and organizations
connected with the Bay Area arts and literary communities.
It is also crucial for the Executive Director to be able to
maintain a balance between her/his curatorial visions
and the desires of our audiences, and to be able to work
constructively with the Board and the wider Small Press
Traffic constituency to continue to uphold and extend our mission.



Budget and Finance: The Executive Director, in consultation
with the Board, plans and manages Small Press Traffic's
annual operating budget. S/he is responsible for ensuring
vendors are paid in a timely manner, that accurate financial
and fiduciary records are kept, and that actual expenses do
not exceed those proposed in the annual operating budget.
The Executive Director is also responsible for oversight of
interns and volunteers, as well as outside contractors
(such as designers, accountants, etc.).



Compensation: $27,000 annual salary. While the workload can vary widely,
depending on fundraising cycles and event schedules, the position typically
requires an average of twenty-five (25) hours per week. The position comes
with an initial 18-month contract, followed by one-year renewable contract(s),
with annual evaluation process. Benefits are contingent on available funding.



Position begins January 1, 2009. To apply, please send CV, cover letter,
and three letters of recommendation to:

1111 8th Street

welcome to email to confirm receipt of mailed applications.

Women, people of color, disabled, and LGBTQ persons

I'm putting together a  poetry page for Organic Valley's twice yearly

poetry readers can sink their teeth into without being complete
dreck.  Send 2-5 poems plus any comments on what Organic Poetry might
be to:

miekal.and@organicvalley.coop

As a little extra incentive, 200,000 copies of ROOTSTOCK are
distributed to food coops & natural groceries across the US & Canada.


I need works by Sept 1.

TEXISTENCE
by Geof Huth & mIEKAL aND

2008, 5.06" x 7.81", 300 pgs, $20.00 includes US postage.
ISBN 1-438250-10-X | EAN-13 978-1-43825010-6

"There is a trick or two to writing a 300-page book and typesetting it =20=

in two days. One is to have two people work on the book, and the other =20=

is to require only one word per page. And that is what mIEKAL aND and =20=

I did on June 29th and 30th in West Lima, Wisconsin: We wrote a book =20
of 300 collaborative pwoermds, certainly the longest book of pwoermds =20=

ever and, to my knowledge, the only collaborative pwoermds ever made.

The pwoermd is a queer little literary beast, one that combines the =20
art of neologism with the practice of poetry. The goal of the pwoermd =20=

is to provide the experience of a poem over the course of a single =20
poem. As a poetic form, it is doomed to fail frequently, but ts size =20
makes the attainment of perfection at least possible.

The way mIEKAL and I created texistence worked, one of us wrote =20
fragments of two words on facing pages of a page layout on a computer =20=

and the other added letters in any way to those words and then wrote =20
two partial words of his own. Occasionally, I wrote a starter word of =20=

only two letters, which mIEKAL had to work hard to make into =20
something, and occasionally I wrote him a starter word so seemingly =20
complete that he wasn't sure what he could add. It was great fun. We =20
worked on this for hours at a time. I usually was working on another =20
writing project simultaneously, and mIEKAL would turn the computer =20
towards me when it was my turn, and I would turn it back to him when =20
it was his turn."

Tuesday, August 19, & Tuesday August 26
8-9:30pm PST.
Martha Cinader Mims will host an open mic internet radio show
http://www.blogtalkradio.com/listenandbeheard


Listen & Be Heard has a history of hosting open mics going back to
the early nineties in the lower east side of New York City where it
all began at the University of the Streets and later moved to the
Nuyorican Poets Cafe. Moving with me to the West Coast my husband and
I opened and three years later closed Listen & Be Heard Poetry Cafe
where we hosted an open mic every Friday night at 8pm.

Now, I've come around to a virtual concept of an open mic here at
Blog Talk. Four poets are booked to be featured in the first portion
of the show, when they will each give us a lightning poem (thirty
seconds or less). After that they will each get five minutes to read
what they wish. The four featured poets signed the open mic list
ahead of time at Listen & Be Heard Poetry Cafe (http://
www.listenandbeheard.net/htmlarea/poetrycafe.) There are four more
already scheduled to be featured on August 26th. Poets interested in
being featured during future shows may go there to sign the open mic
list.

The remainder of the show will be open mic for listeners to call in
and share one poem. I am excited to work with this format and already
know that it will be fun and interesting. Since I was a volunteer
producer at WBAI/Pacifica Radio for 10 years, this is a natural way
for me to stretch myself.

One of our featured poets will be calling in all the way from Germany
where he is currently stationed in the American Service.
Please join us Tuesday from 8-9:30pm California Time.

Following is some info about our features for tomorrow night. You'll
find their pictures on the listen and be heard blog at http://
www.blogtalkradio.com/listenandbeheard.

Wishing you Peace and
Poetry Martha Cinader Mims


DDE is a 24 year old poet currently stationed in Germany who has been
writing since the 9th grade. What started as a one month anniversary
gift for a girlfriend has now been a great source of pride. Always
writing about his personal experiences or feelings on issues, much of
his poetry can be related to by many people from many backgrounds.
Although only performing in coffee shops in the states, in Germany he
has been a part of a small comedy/poetry group at the military posts
in the area that he works at, as well as being invited to several
slams in Germany. "Forward and up, the only two directions I know how
to go"


Alicia Jones: I am currently 24 yrs. old. and I have two grown men
ages of 4 and 5. I love them with all my heart everything I do is for
them. Originally from Lubbock, Tx but I currently reside in
California. . All my life I am a live walking, talking, big beautiful
ebony individual and proud of it. Poetry is my passion, my enjoyment,
a fantasy into another world. I have been writing since I was in the
7th grade. I get emotional, explicit (with still good taste), erotic,
sad, joyful, etc. I believe in making people feel my words and see an
image.




DON HAGELBERG participated in the 1960's Civil Rights movement. While
manager of San Francisco's The Precarious Vision Coffee House, he co-
wrote AN ARTISTS LIVING COOPERATIVE helping to promote Communes.
Imprisoned in 1964-1965 for refusing induction, he never seemed to be
able to complete any college course with satisfaction unless it was
Creative Writing. He created and hosted LIVE POETS, a two-hour radio
program broadcast on a Bay Area listener-supported radio station in
the 1970s. A founding member of the BAY AREA POETS COALITION, he
edited their first monthly publication, POEMPHLET, later re-named
POETALK. In 2000 Don asked the BBC that they broadcast THE KALEVALAin
English. They did: in installments. The broadcast pleased him because
many international listeners heard the epic poem.


Adam Gottschalk lives in Portland Oregon, his favorite American city
outside of New York, which is his hometown. He has been writing
poetry and performing spoken word for more than 20 years. His poetry
has appeared in several literary journals; he was a featured
performer at the 1998 Seattle Poetry Festival and the 2001 St
Petersburg Times Festival of Reading. Adam is also a brutal editor
(for hire), a playwright, a graphic designer (of some 12 years), a
trained singer, and is on his way to becoming a professional natural
perfumer. Adam considers natural perfumery his final frontier as an
artist. Adam is never ever satisfied (except with food).

My Late Mother as a Ruffed Grouse
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0-- Ashokan High Point, Catskills

Never before had a grouse failed to explode
from the underbrush with a wing-beating panic,
a feathered cannonball fanning a leaf-ripping tail.
But this bird didn't budge. It kept pecking
at leaf litter as methodically as a maid
checking under cushions for coins.
For several minutes, I focused my binoculars
on its lady-bug eyes, its black-banded tail,
but didn't want to spoil the magic by staying too long.

Bushwhacking through acres of mountain laurel,
I navigated tangled stalks like woody barbed wire.
Finally, a boulder ramp led me down to a clearing.
But which direction to the reservoir lookout,
rumored to lie east of the blueberry bald,
I couldn't sense any better than from above.
Behind me, I spotted the grouse half-sliding,
half-hopping on clownish chicken feet to catch up.
It stopped on the rock, cocked its head sideways,
then eye-balled me with an orange intensity.
Oh, yes, I remembered that look,
unblinking, undeterred, unashamed
of being in charge, yet being in love.

Could this bird really be my late mother?
At her burial last winter I scattered grouse feathers
to honor her passion as an Audubon birder.
Did I unwittingly plant the seed for her return?
Crippled by strokes, she lived so long in a nursing home
she had no idea I lived in a cabin, not Hoboken
or Manhattan. To her, I was always 23 and married,
for some unfathomable reason, to my cousin, Muggsie.

This grouse clearly knew what she wanted.
Softly she cooed and finally winked.
I murmured my best grouse impersonation,
eager to talk no matter what we happened to say.

I sat on the grass, an invitation she accepted
to prance close to my boots, cocky as a city pigeon.
For her country outing, she'd dressed
in subdued browns and whites, but make no mistake:
her feathered crest sharpened her head.
When her blinking turned almost flirtatious,
I lowered my eyes, apparently a fresh invitation,
for she paraded alongside my leg, pausing
every few steps to nip at a blueberry flower.
With my hands I could have cradled her like a dove,
cooing, content. Was that what she wanted?
Behind my back, she pecked at my daypack zipper.

How could I explain my bachelor's cabin,
the dirty socks from last week's hike still hanging
on the upstairs railing, the dirty dishes forever
crowding the sink? Did she think
she'd be satisfied eating seeds from a bowl
made of plastic and sharing my cold wooden floor
with the mice? Didn't she know
I could be arrested for bringing a grouse home
under the Wildlife Protection Act?
Did she know how rarely I swept?

No, I needed to end this strange encounter.
I stood and shouldered my pack, nodded good-bye.
But giant steps up the rock didn't do any good.
She hopped up her own crooked ladder
of laurel stalks, then paused at the next dirt patch
for me to catch up. How could I shake her?
Whenever I plunged in a new direction,
climbing and tripping through bushes,
she scampered nearby, easily low-hurdling
trunk tangles and roots. I barged like an oaf,
but she didn't act disappointed in me as a grouse.
She waited and cooed with encouragement.
Not until I broke loose on the blueberry bald
did she stop at the edge of her laurel protectorate.

Yet no matter how long I rested on the only boulder,
pretending to admire the quixotic flight
of black butterflies sampling blueberry nectar,
I knew she waited with unbending love and devotion
in the bushes I couldn't avoid to hike home.

Here's a very short film that was created by the Belgian-Canadian artist and
phenomenologist Jean Detheux (www.madhattersreview.com/issue4/gallery2_*jean
**detheux*.shtml ) based on one of my poems (recited). It's being shown at
film festivals.f you're interested in viewing and hearing it, you'll have to
be patient.  It takes a long time to load.

in 1971, which featured original compositions written and arranged by Lawn
and Ives. Compass was one of five musical groups on a promotional program
that opened the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in 1972. Ives, with Lawn,
wrote and arranged "What is Man?" an ecumenical jazz service with an
accompanying slide presentation which was performed in New York City and
later produced for television by Iowa Public Broadcasting. A revival of
"What is Man?" took place last year.

**Todd Carlstrom and The Clamour
http://www.myspace.com/toddcarlstrom
After Todd Carlstrom recorded his solo album, Gold on the Map, it was clear
to him that the songs deserved more than to simply remain a studio project.
He set about recruiting members of the band that would become Todd Carlstro=
m
and The Clamour. He managed to entice drummer Eric Shaw of The Domestics
into moonlighting. Guitarist Brian Elmquist, a singer/songwriter from
Georgia by way of Nashville, came on in early '08. Their show expertly
intertwines the poppy wrath of The Pixies, the classic rock nods of Built t=
o
Spill, the rumbling slink of Sleater-Kinney, and, occasionally, the odd
stoner jam a la Brian Jonestown Massacre.

Liv Carrow=E2=80=99s songs are like the little animals that your 4-year-old niece=

and nephews make out of Play-Doh=E2=80=94lumpy yet distinguishable in form,
rudimentary to the point of psychedelic complexity, dry and crumbly on the
outside but "all kinds of squishy" on the inside. The mysterious and oddly
lovable bassist from ecstatically weird Huggabroomstik and Griffin and the
True Believers takes the scenic back road to your heart with her clever-ish
observations on life, death, love, health food, human reproduction,
geography, the unseen world of the earth spirits and cosmic currents,
awkward crushes, metaphysics, and everyone's favorite-despair. Liv plays
frequently in NYC and the surrounding area as a solo acoustic act and
accompanying Huggabroomstik and the burgeoning alternapop collaboration Fee=
l
The Feelings. She is also available for Tarot readings which can be obtaine=

http://www.myspace.com/dibson
Dibson T. Hoffweiler is the latest in a long line of quirky anti-folk
ing=C3=A9nues, among them Beck, Adam Green, and Jeffrey Lewis. With a low voice
that=E2=80=99s sweet and deadpan, and a guitar-style that=E2=80=99s virtuosic and slopp=
y,
Hoffweiler carves out a space of compassion and intelligence in a landscape
of boring love songs and thinly veiled songwriterly misogyny. Known for his
work in anti-folk flagship bands Cheese On Bread, Huggabroomstik, and Urban
Barnyard, Dibs began his musical career generating buzz with his old band,
Dibs & Sara. Eventually he established himself as a solo artist, including
several month long tours of Europe and North America. Dibs has proved (to
himself, and to others) that his bizarre, ramshackle aesthetic is palatable
outside the freaky comfort zone of New York anti-folk.

miscproj is a blogmag; it is a continuation of the hard-copy poetry magazine Misc. Proj., which was published in Atlanta in the late 1990s.  Work accepted will be published within a few weeks of acceptance.  We're very interested in seeing submissions of poems.  But we are also quite open to essays on poetics, and book reviews.  Like the initial paper mag, the current version of miscproj will feature miscellaneous projects relating to poetry:  interviews, essays, comments on the poetry scene, debates.

A blogmag follows the logic of the blog software: we do not publish issues, but rather post work in a continuing stream.  Items in a blogmag relate to each other without the mediation of larger "issue" groupings.
Please visit the blogmag for your reading pleasure.  Before submitting you should become familiar with the material there, especially the overall range of poetics mapped out by the first five issues, which have been mounted in online facsimile form and my be viewed at the blogmag.

"To me, in this fallen world, the question that true literature prompts is never "what does it mean" but rather:  what circumstances (what kind of perceived world) have given rise to writing of this kind, which is trying to provoke a different way of "being in the world," and why?  Writing that does not provoke this question, but aims instead at meaning--is entertainment..."

sorry if this is stirring up old whatevers, but I recall a pretty lengthy
series of posts on the list, maybe 5-10 years ago, on anti-semitic streak in
Dorn (among other things I remember Tom Mandel offering to punch Dorn in the
face if he ever saw him--maybe that will jog someone's memory!).  Anyway a
quick search of the list archive didn't turn up anything, so I'm wondering
if anybody can lay hands on the pertinent posts or range of dates.  I'm
trying to direct a friend to the discussion.

thanks for any help,

Tenney

I noticed your thread, and I thought I'd send you a list I've compiled some=
 time ago... I have created a few separate categories: (semi-)biographical =
films; films on fictitious poets; documentaries; and then some films having=
 poetry as an object in some sense. I wasn't at that point looking for cine=
matic adaptations of poems... Definitely not exhaustive, repeating many fil=
ms already mentioned here, but I hope you'll find it useful *-))=0A=0A=0A[]=

Woman Arrested For Failing To Return Library Books
"Angels and Demons" and "White Oleander" borrowed last year

http://www.wisn.com/news/17258567/detail.html


GRAFTON, Wis. -- A woman has been arrested for failing to return two =20
books to the Grafton Library.

Woman Arrested For Not Returning Books To Library

Heidi Dalibor was arrested after she failed to return the books, =20
"Angels and Demons" and "White Oleander", last year.

=93I said, what could they possibly do? They can=92t arrest me for this=85=
 I =20
was wrong,=94 Dalibor said.

Dalibor did not respond to four notices from the library, two phone =20
calls and two letters. The library forwarded the case to police, who =20
issued a citation for Dalibor's failure to return the materials or pay =20=

the fine. The citation included a court date, which Dalibor admits she =20=

ignored.

With arrest warrant in hand, police showed up at Dalibor=92s door and =20=

led her away in handcuffs.

While the police have been criticized for going so far, the police =20
chief said they simply followed the law.

=93None of this would have been necessary if she followed the agreement =20=

and returned the books,=94 said Grafton Police Chief Charles Wenten.

Dalibor paid her $170 fine and was released.

=93I completely take responsibility for not paying my fine on time and =20=

not going to my court date,=94 Dalibor said.

Still, she isn=92t planning on returning the books.

=93I still have the books and I don=92t plan to return them because =20
they=92re paid for now,=94 Dalibor said.=

This, of course, raises the question of what books list members would be
willing to go to jail for.

Thanks for sending Daniel--
the Great Robert Ryan is terrific in "The Set-Up", as so very often in his
relatively overlooked long career, in this film--

(who can forget his chillingly evil Claggett in Peter Ustinov's film of
Poet, Novelist & Short Story writer Herman Melville's *Billy Budd*?--
and Terence Stamp as Billy; Stamp, who also plays "*Toby Dammit" in
Fellini's film of the Poe* *story "Never Bet the Devil Your Head"* and turn=
s
up yet again in the Poet-Film Maker Pasolini's "Teorema?"--)

(the Fellini film is in a trilogy of Poe stories,called in English "Spirits
of the Dead"; the others filmed are "William Wilson" with Brigitte Bardot
and Alain Delon , directed by Louis Malle, in which a man is haunted/hunted
by his double; and Roger Vadim's "Metzengerstein," in which the "family
team" of Vadim's then-wife Jane and her brother Peter Fonda portray cousins
with an incestuous yearning.)

"The List of Movies with Poetry--

(let alone the Lists themselves which exist in poetry--inside poems
themselves as a famous one by Rimbaud of the "degenerated" forms of writing
including crudely painted signs. children's book illustrations and the like
which influenced him--)

Alongside "accumulation" there exist also the ever ongoing rhizomatic water=
s
of poetry traveled by "The Drunken Boats" of poetry, those ships which Emil=
y
Dickinson called "books"--for "Voyages" Baudelairean among Symbols that are
not in Books but exits as "a Forest"--and which can also be found not only
the open eyes of a reader/writer, by those of the imagination--"To shut the
Eyes is Travel"--or--to open them or not--perhaps even "sleep walking"--"I
cross the room and am in the Spice Islands"--
much as Celine writes at the forefront of his "Voyage au bout de la nuit"--

" . . . Our journey is entirely imaginary.  That is its strength . . .It
goes from life to death.  People, animals, cities, things, all are
imagined.  It's a novel, just a fictitious narrative.  Littre (famous
dicitionarian, like Webster) says so, and he's never wrong. . . . And
besides, in the first place, anyone can do as much as much.  You just have
to close your eyes.
          'It's on the other side of life."

        A poem, a novel, each of which can be for Blanchot a "recit," like
"Moby Dick" and "A Season in Hell"--writing,  as "Movies with Poetry,"  is =
a
voyage from one medium to another, and that one in itself "takes place in
the dark"--where one opens the eyes in the dark and "sees life from the
other side" as in a dream--or a form of Orphic Voyage through the Land of
the Dead--

     as though humans are stil watching the fire-flickering shadows on the
walls of a cave themselves  intermeshed and "moving pictures" among those
already painted there on the Stone Screen-
not only "predating and predicting the Cinema"--but also the Voyage of
Writing--from the Stone Screen to the scroll to the tablets of clay, to
papyri scrolls and the "leaves" of paper and books and then back again, to
the Screen of Computers on which one is returned to the Scroll--and is i
turn convertible by the PDF Creator into e-books--which "materialize again
as paper leaved books"--which in turn may become movies with titles taken
from the title of a poem in the book as a collection of poetry that
previously had to be "scrolled down," on a previous screen to that of the
movie theater--

so it is that writing and cinema are "wedded", as Melville writes of images
emergent from those who observe the surfaces of waters--on and through
which  and by which images move --"water and meditation are wedded" "  in
the opening chapter of "Moby Dick"--
and are traveling--
and so readers and viewers may, like Narcissus, plunge into the waters of
oblivion when "meditation and water are wedded,"   and die--not knowing tha=
t
the countenance they encounter is their own--a "reflection" thought to be
"meditation"  which is simply one's own self-contemplation----

so writing like Ishamel's, is born alive to rescue floating on an empty
coffin made for a perished and ocean buried friend--

Bobbing into view as he emerges from the pages and is seen on the "Silver
Screen"--

like Poe's "MS. In a Bottle"--thrown overboard from a ship, like all Poe's
ships--rushing into the Vortex, or the final sentences of Arthur Gordon
Pym-- where awaits the shrouded figure much larger than any found among
humans, with a skin of the whiteness of the South Pole snows.

so it is that writing survives these voyages on the way to the Cinematic
version, by being thrown overboard as it were--onto the floating coffin of
Ishmael, who writes the story of the "Whitenessnss of the Whale"--
and in the various MS of Poe's which also escape in various ways from a
figure of Whiteness--

perhaps allegories of the "attack" of the journeys to "find" and "capture"
or kill the Whale and the White Figure of the Whiteness of Snow--awaiting i=
n
the vast wastes of snow--

in a journey in which the Whiteness is the whiteness of the empty screen or
page--which writing harpoons or har-pens--or har-pixels--

yet all the same, "Movies with Poetry"-- through overboard their own MS
floating along to be found--among which are questions of "translation," as
one "passes from one medium to another"--

passes from one "state of seeing"--reading--to another--"watching a film"--

which are themselves also various ways of "looking into" the differences
these "states of seeing" "states of being"--and also "states of believing,"
in the sense of "seeing is believing"--a term often enough transferred to
"reading is believing"--due to such phrases as
"If it's not in writing, it never happened."
          In other words, the "willing suspension of disbelief" that is
considered by many wise souls limited to the reading of fiction, is in fact
also at the heart of all things written--
         For--if only what is in writing "actually occurred," then writing
immediately introduces an incredible freedom for lying--
         Everything in writing could then be "nothing but a lie"--and of
course it has through history very much been that writing conveyed close to
nothing but lies, as writings themselves, whether or not truthful to begin
with, pass through a continual "degeneration" of "versions" due to
translations, synopses, interpretations, commentaries,forgeries and
plagiarisms--
         this "translation" occurred every time writings traveled from one
"state of publication to another"--whether copied by hand from scrolls to
codexes, and then from codexes to printed books and from printed books to
virtual books-- at each step of the process translators are required who my
be induced by any number of reasons to "edit" the texts to more suitably
reflect the beliefs and ideologies of the day--hether those of the
translator/scribe/typist/data entry worker or those of of their culture,
religion, political or ethnic affiliations--along al these rhizomatic water=
s
of writing writing is continually becoming something else --and that which
is to have occurred in writing likewise is continually being rewritten,
edited, censored, "improved," or "cast into a different form," with prose
writings "poeticized" and vice versa--
      and so it is with "Movies with Poetry"--
as "translations" at least in part--
        The great Poet become Clergyman John Donne writes of a belief in
which translation is actually the "translation to a better state" of
existence itself--in which all humans participate--


all mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one
chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language;
and every chapter must be so translated; God employs several translators;
some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, some by war, some by
justice; but God's hand is in every translation, and his hand shall bind up
all our scattered leaves again for that library where every book shall lie
open to one another.

which brings one back to Cocteau's saying that "the Cinema "shows Death at
work."

That's why I think in considering "Movies with Poetry" Cocteau and Pasolini
as Poet-Film makers--are among the most interesting of al in this regard--

As examples--in which the "trnalsation" pocess "works" but in very differen=
t
ways than it may in works by others or in wiich poetry is in films and film=
s
in poetry--


"As unlikely as it seems=97in the long history of the cinema, how many
pictures, let alone boxing pictures, can have been based on a *poem* ?"

Jefferson Hunter writes in the article you sent--after describing the
opening Title/credits sequence of "The Set-Up"--

(in Raging Bull, Robert De Niro as  the retired former Middle Weight
Champion Jake LaMotta becomes a reciter and writer of poetry, his
recitations including "Shakespeare and Budd Schulberg's"  works, among
others--Budd Sculberg wrote the original story and co-wrote the screen play
for The Harder They Fall--Humphrey Bogart's last film, as a journalist
despaerate for work who accepts the job of publicist for a "glass jaw"
fighter, being built up as much as possible so that "the bigger they are th=
e
harder they fall"--meaning a wind fall for the gamblers--based on the tragi=
c
career of Primo Cannera--)

The dramatic opening of Hunter's  Hudson Review article's second paragraph'=
s
"rhetorical question" is like the "screaming headlines" of a film
trailer--with the white letters blasting at one out of the distance of the
depths of "noir" dark screen--

(the later Stars Wars opening words in reverse-mimiced in Jenny Holzer's
also Rienstahl-mimicing "Projections"----not going away, but "RIGHT AT
YA"--)

"HOW MANY POEMS HAVE HAD A FILM MADE FROM THEM"--


the number must be immense-HUGE---!!

"For Whom the Bell Tolls"--

charge of the light brigade, "el dorado," the illiad, odyssey, "drive, he
said," the canterbury tales" of the great poet-filmmaker Pier Paulo
Pasolini--

"Les Bons Debarras" --the Quebecois film in which al the characters speak i=
n
rhyme in Joual--

but there is only ONE poem which has been filmed  and has an NFL team (any
major sports team) named for them,
let alone a team that has won the Super Bowl--
The Baltimore Ravens,

the name chosen by  popular vote by the good citizens of that fair city--,
from:


THE RAVEN by E A Poe--

or as Carl Solomon , dedicatee of HOWL called it  in a self invented joke
aboutt "a poem abt mental illness"--"The Ravin'"--


where there is the "Tomb of Edgar A Poe" immortlaized in the poem of that
name by Stephanie Mallarme--for the Municpal Monument Dedication--

also written of by Whitman, who was invited but could not make the
dedication due to illness----

Baltimore-- the city where ironically Poe had died, it is, claimed due to
being used as a "multiple-vote casting citizen" --
who was paid in liquor, some meager coins--
a common practice of the times--
though mysteriously in Poe's case, some now claim rabies was also involved
in the Poet's raving and terrified death in a a public ward--  not delirium
tremens has legend has had it for a centuryand a half--

death indeed by a a foaming version of a  "Red Plague," as in Poe's famous
story of that title--
perhaps a harbinger of that "Read Plague" which pursued him after death in
the notorious and extremely effective "chaarcter assasination" of Rufus
Griwswold's Poe Obituary--which has affected the American vision of Poe to
this day--
this multiple vote-casting method was a common practice employed in many
American cities of Poe's time-- which was the dawning of the era of such
Lords of Urban Power and Corruption as Boss Tweed in NYC--
and later on by Mayor Daley the First in Chicago--affecting it is said even
the National Election of 1960, won by Kennnedy the Urban Legend has it by
the good citizens of  Cook County, Illinois,
where the mulitple-voting citizens had been  voting in "multiple Elections
through Multiples of Decades"
as there is no voting limit on the Dead  who vote at the Polls that Never
Close in the Cemeteries of the County--

Thus the Dead Voters --obviously Poetry Lovers!!!--made sure of the Poetry
and Prescence of Robert Frost at the Inaugeration of their favored
candidate, John Fitzgerald Kennedy--

both Frost and JFK have had mumerous films made of them and their
words----documentaries and poetry filled ones as well as those in the
fictional realms--

Here at the "Cinema of Catharsis"  frequented by the personnages living,
dead, fictional, ghostly, ghost written and posthumously writing of the "Ne=
w
Extreme Experimental American Poetry & Arts,"
one awaits such future *Poem Entitled Cinema Epics* as these:

"*God of Battle*"  a prolonged and sweeping visionary 'Poetic masterpiece,"
from the title of the George  Patton poem, and based on & explicating the
life and poetry of the General, in which frequently are seen American
Soldiers chanting his verses as they go into Battle--

9with Iraq War Solider Poet Brian Turner perhaps being called upon for
consultation and script writing and maybe even directorial assistance-- ?)
*
"Ascent of Lushan"*--from a 1959 poem by the Great Chairman Philospher and
Poet Mao Ze Dong, written and directed by the director and his assitants wh=
o
produced the Olympics Opening Ceremony, Bejing 2008--and starring a cast of
thousands and hundreds of thousands--

*"Il Pleurt sur la ville"*- the title of this film is from the famous poem
by Paul Verlaine (dedicated by Verlaine to Rimbaud, who the poet was at the
time serving two years in prison for shooting in the wrist)

This "unique historical bio-epic-pic" presents Pol Pot as a
Philosopher-Poet-King not unlike Mao, except that he preferred others'
poetry to writing his own--
(ironically, the poetry of the former French Colonial Masters of "French
Indo-China"--themselves heavily funded by the Americans, who a few decdes
later heavily funded Pol Pot agsint the Vietnamese Invasion

this complicated Cultural heritage of Pol Pot's, who like Ho Chi Minh and a
great many others from the former "French Indo-China" had studied at the
Sorbonne-- is examined in the film  alongside the huge influence since
childhood of Camodian Buddhism on the development of the "bland and
Invisible"  former mediocre student known born and known as Saloth Sar, who
emerged "seemingly out of nowhere" in 1975  as Pol Poet, leader of the
Victorious Khmer Rouge

Pol Pot once remarked that in the 1950's that the Authorities "knew who I
was, but not what I
was"--

as a former student writes:

from:  "The Diabolic Sweetness of Pol Pot"-- Soth Polin, Translation by
Jeremy Colvin and Lavonne Leong

"In the beginning was the Word/and the Word was with God/and the Word was
God./All things were made by Him/and without Him nothing was made. The
Prologue of St. John

"At the time that Pol Pot was teaching me Verlaine, I had not yet learned t=
o
distrust sweet things. In 1957 , he was my French teacher, though later he
claimed to have been a history teacher, in order not to appear to have been
an advocate of the colonialists' culture. We knew him by the name of Saloth
Sar, and nothing he said to us betrayed his engagement in politics -- until
the day in 1962 when he left for the resistance. I need to revise my memory
of that school year: Pol Pot was not just the disciple of Verlaine who, as =
a
good philologue, knew how to win over his students with his explications de
texte: "It rains in my heart as it rains on the city. From whence comes thi=
s
languor that pierces my heart..."
The Cambodian Buddhist Poet resident in the US

<http://muse.jhu.edu/mirror>
 and Pending the Outcome of his Trial for War Crimes, there is no doubt to
be a Cinematic work produced regarding the works and life of  the
Pyschiatrist-Poet-King--Radovan Karadzic

and perhaps some day a film of the *Cantos* by the American
Poet-Philosopher-Propagandist-Traitor of Italian Fascist Radio Fame --
a complex and "ideogrammatic" work in which an attempt wil be made to conve=
y
the "Confucian side of Disney" which the Poet spoke of in  a Paris Review
Interview--

One's first reaction is naturally to rail against the "persecutors"--the =
Grafton public services. Upon further reflection, however, one can read =
Dalibor's dismissive attitude and actions as typifying a mindset that =
won't see the relationship between failed contracts and broken =
obligations on a small scale and and a sense of obligation and =
responsibility on a larger scale. I would bet that her one seemingly =
small act of ignoring the notices, court date, etc. reflects a much more =
comprehensive set of attitudes concerning her sense of place and =
community, debt and obligation.=20
=20
Just a thought.

Woman Arrested For Failing To Return Library Books
"Angels and Demons" and "White Oleander" borrowed last year

GRAFTON, Wis. -- A woman has been arrested for failing to return two=20
books to the Grafton Library.

Woman Arrested For Not Returning Books To Library

Heidi Dalibor was arrested after she failed to return the books,=20
"Angels and Demons" and "White Oleander", last year.

"I said, what could they possibly do? They can't arrest me for this... I =

was wrong," Dalibor said.

Dalibor did not respond to four notices from the library, two phone=20
calls and two letters. The library forwarded the case to police, who=20
issued a citation for Dalibor's failure to return the materials or pay=20
the fine. The citation included a court date, which Dalibor admits she=20
ignored.

With arrest warrant in hand, police showed up at Dalibor's door and=20
led her away in handcuffs.

While the police have been criticized for going so far, the police=20
chief said they simply followed the law.

"None of this would have been necessary if she followed the agreement=20
and returned the books," said Grafton Police Chief Charles Wenten.

Dalibor paid her $170 fine and was released.

"I completely take responsibility for not paying my fine on time and=20
not going to my court date," Dalibor said.

Still, she isn't planning on returning the books.

"I still have the books and I don't plan to return them because=20
they're paid for now," Dalibor said.

Several points:
=20
Yes=2C poetry is "popular" - ne essential - in the arab culture.  When Syri=
an poet Nizar Qabbani died=2C his funeral in Damascus was attended by crowd=
s numbering at least in the 100s of thousands.  Qabbani spoke not only radi=
cally and openly against Israeli occupation in the Territories=2C but held =
quite open and liberal views about the status of women in relation to the Q=
ur'an and within Muslim society in general=2C that were widely admired=2C n=
ot only by arab women=2C but be a large percentage of arab men as well.
=20
As far as Dorn's anti-Semitism=2C I recall him saying something in a Rollin=
g Stock editorial that the paper had as its target a basically Semitic (Jew=
ish) readership=2C because these=2C he said=2C were probably among the best=
 educated persons in the country=2C and probably were majoral in number of =
the few that would even appreciate the paper's basic point-of-view.
=20
About Muslim culture=2C he noted=2C as far as I know=2C only the single ins=
tance in his recent volume of interviews=2C that it is a severe mistake by =
the US State Department that regards Muslim politics as secular=2C rational=
 and negotiable.  That it is based instead solely on religious sentiment.
=20
At any rate=2C I doubt that anything Dorn said about either Jews or Muslims=
 can come up to his persistently negative assessments and assertions about =
Rome through history and the position of the Catholic Church vis-a-vis poli=
tics and economic development as well as religion (and all related topics=
=2C including everything from pro-fascist stances during and post-WWII=2C t=
o negation of women's right=2C bitter homophobia=2C etc) during the years o=
f his writing career.
=20
Dorn also bore the brunt of controversy in a spate of letters to Exquisite =
Corpse related to sexist comments he made to a Grad student in Denver=2C an=
d much later=2C on this list=2C for his own alleged homophobia.  So=2C
=20
he was no angel.  He showed Max Douglas how to shoot up.  Max subsequently =
OD'd on heroin at age 21.  Not Dorn's responsibility=2C clearly=2C but . . =
. not the wisest sort of instruction to provide one of that day's hot new y=
ouths=2C either.
=20
BTW=2C just as a point of correction=2C arabs are Semites=2C too.  The divi=
sion of Semities=2C arabs and jews=2C came later=2C with the split between =
Ibrahim's sons=2C Itzak and Isma'il.  At the celebration at the weaning of =
Itzak=2C Isma'il is seen making mock of the ceremony=2C and is cast out wit=
h his Egyptian mother Hagar to wander the lands near Beersheba.  His ancest=
ors eventually become first=2C the Bedouin tribes=2C and thereafter=2C the =
arabic speakers that populated all the lands east of Palestine.
=20
Finally=2C those rocks that Dariwsh mentions=2C that were all the Israelis =
left for the Palestinians=2C after stealing their orange groves=2C olive or=
chards=2C and dispersing the Palestinians into now-permanent exile=2C are s=
till there.  There are lots of them.  Palestinian teenagers use them as wea=
pons against the incursion of Israeli tanks.  Yellowish-grey=2C not too hea=
vy=2C like moon rocks.
=20
They have them in Iraq as well.  Villagers use them against persistent and =
unwarranted attacks by US and British soldiers.  A rather hopeless proposit=
ion=2C it would seem=2C at first.  But=2C then=2C what would you rather fig=
ht with - a reliable rock whose substance was made by and thus has the divi=
ne properties of Allah=2C or an M-16 that probably isn't going to work prop=
erly=2C because of contractural difficulties leading to poor manufacture?=20
=20
The fact that such rocks still rely on inherent qualities of creation in or=
der to attain to and hold their status as "objects"=2C make them far superi=
or as weapons=2C as against rifles=2C which=2C we all know=2C are=2C like f=
ountain pens or vacuum cleaners=2C merely devisive=2C and made only to kill=
.  But=2C kill what?  You cannot kill the spirit that lives and guides all =
things in accordance with the ethic that reveals the position of each indiv=
idual thing in relation to all others=2C as the always penultimate situatio=
n.
=20
This is the Whirlwind of Speaking that is testamental to Allah's presence=
=2C still and centered=2C in the midst of everything.  Jews call this "malb=
ush" - clothes - or=2C as birdsong hidden in the leaves of morning trees.  =
Sublime perception of beauty=2C unforeseen.
=20
I state these things=2C just to make clear that "popular" isn't quite the p=
roper word to employ in beginning to determine the value of poetry in the M=
uslim world.  It is part of an overall life force=2C a vitalism=2C that is =
completely gone dead in the West.
=20
The opening of the throat=2C the voice=2C the song.  The hearing's always h=
eard=2C the word of God obeyed=2C but the question always remains: can you =
spot the bird?
al-Sadiq.

But it is a form of theft - and what's more it's not  thieving from some
faceless multinational chain but from a  local library which is a community
service therefore it's thieving from everyone who would like to access those
books and now can't.  I found her cavalier attitude to the library worthy of
arrest - especially as she still refuses to return the books -  but maybe
the handcuffs were a bit heavy handed!

So good on Wisconsin for taking your library books seriously and trying to
protect them for everyone.

Listees whose minds incline toward the devious will note this method for
obtaining books (rare or out-of-print) from the library: check out the
book(s) you want to keep, report them as lost, then pay the going rate.

I've never done this of course but recall the tip from an How-To book I
found in the library some time ago.

bruno  ;-)

i have this insomnia thing going on and no blog. too many thoughts. but I love poetry. & i'm still recovering from seeing my hero, Auster, read recently. Here's Ashbery's blurb on Auster: "Magnificent poetry; dark, severe, even harsh-yet pulsating with life."
& since i'm been on this Auster kick for the last week, here's one of my favorite Auster poems.
From FRAGMENTS FROM COLD, 1976-1977.
Nothern Lights
These are the words
that do not survive the world. And to speak them
is to vanish
into the world. Unapproachable
light
that heaves above the earth, kindling
the brief miracle
of the open eye-
and the day that will spread
like a fire of leaves
through the first chill wind
of October
consuming the world
in the plain speech
of desire.

[Moderator: I am sorry about my last message. I accidentally pushed send be=

I agree with you. I am surprised that I was not arrested while writing my d=
issertation. lol=A0=20

Seriously, though, I don't understand how the fine for the books can be so =
much more than the actual value of the items. It seems to me that she shoul=
d have been charged the price of replacing the books. Charging almost two h=
undred dollars in fines seems quite excessive to me.=20

Tenney, why don't you just look up Tom Mandel's edress in the list
archives and ask him about it, since you mention him here? Better
yet, why not make more accurate uses of the search function offered

I understand the desire to possess books--esp. the ones so dear to us that
are otherwise far beyond our budget.  But isn't it selfish--taking those
rare, out-of-circulation books away from everyone else, too?  I suppose this
is why large libraries, and university libraries, have those guarded
"special collections" reading rooms.

This is all sort of sad--the cavalier attitude that contracts are worthless,
that there are no consequences, etc.  It seems so American, makes so much
sense in light of spiraling consumer debt, home foreclosures, and on and
on.  Where's all the accountability gone?

The fine is for taking the books away from other readers.  Libraries
struggle for funding--millages for libraries in my state are the first to
get the "no" vote each election cycle.  Just as lawsuits ask for "pain and
suffering" damages, the libraries too have to build that in--each patron wh=
o
doesn't get to read those books while they're being held up by another
patron, and the potential fallout: no longer using the libraries (when
libraries depend on grants showing how many patrons they've had, and get a
certain number per patron, any lost customer is incredibly costly), bad wor=
d
of mouth, etc.

when i was a kid i stole lots of books from the library

one day my mother collected em all and returned them
they told her she'd have to just leave them in front of the building
for if they brought them inside they'd have to arrest her
it's a federal thing........ ah the trouble we cause our MOMS

recently i wanted to take a film out of the library
one copy was reported to be available but alas unavailable because it was
either stolen or never returned
that's not so kosher since i nor any one else can now access it

In his memoir Auster writes that he had made a bet that he was going to mak=
e
his living as a poet. At the end of the book, he has shifted to becoming a
novelist. The memoir implies that he Auster has won his own bet. Actually.
the reverse is true. He had to change his field -basically starting with an
off beat genre novel- to unite his "vocation with his profession."

Though I admire his novels -and particularly the movie script *Smoke* (the
photographing of the same place over and over again)- personally I believe
as a poet Auster is derivative, never adding anything to what other poets
(Mallarm=E9, for instance) have done. *The Invention of Solitude*, another
memoir, for me is brilliant in its first two thirds, when he uses his dead
father's photograph to start a profound meditation. Then, as the "fruit" of
these meditations, he ends up translating Mallarm=E9. The translations are
much less interesting, more "literature" than projecting the cold fire at
the heart of Mallarm=E9's poetry.

I think, instead of quoting from Ashbery's blurb- one should confront
Auster's poetry more directly.

Dear Ismaelia al-Sadiq

Thank you so much for your letter, for the rocks. for that which is,
everywhere found yet hidden in plain sight--(or site/sight/cite-)--

I remember when the discussion re Dorn and the Mandel etc transpired-- it
seems to return here in a cyclical pattern--

Thank you for writing of the funeral of Nizar Qabbani and what he and his
works meant to so many--the death and funeral of Darwish show very
powerfully what you right of as the vitality of poetry in the Muslim world.

These events, with so much else that continually happens every day, make me
think of the so often quoted Jack Spicer line "Nobody listens to poetry
anymore," as I often wonder if it is not the other way round, that poetry
itself in America is not listening anymore, and not listening, does not see
those things hidden in plain site/sight/cite.

At "The Insitution for Criminal Thinking," there was one window through
which one saw daily a large tree degnerating into an organic ruin from
diease, in which a bird had made a very large nest.  In the devastating
bleakness, this nest on autum days filled with light, held it. and ignited
the blood of life.  Winter came, the leaves dropped away, and the light now
came from the South, a paler light, which the nest gathered and kept strong.
          Huge winds came that early winter, and I thought--what will happen
if the nest is blown down?  The light will go out, and in the waning
bleakness, the harshness lacerate the veins.  Standing by the window seeing
the first light rushing into the nest hollow, I saw that the heart I had
found there was my own, inside me.
      Two hearts regard each other, and then it is found that, yes, the nest
will soon be gone, yet, having met, the hearts' regards will be exchanged
everywhere for there are no boundaries.
      One morning, the harsh light and air trembling violently with the
sounds of the chainsaw, the tree and the nest were cut down and carted
away.  Since then, I find them everywhere.

            When everything is stolen and taken away, including movement,
books, water, fuel, food, everything--and "nothing" but rocks and light
remain, that is not nothing at all, but everything.  And necessity, the
motherfucker of invention, finds much with which to work.

               Writing, art objects, virtuality--"form"--can all be made
into prisons and Walls--very often are--

               And so it is possible that "poetry" may not listen to or see
that poetry you write of--
               may even be "terrified" of it, as when rock throwers are
fired at with tear gas, bullets,tanks,  missiles fired from low flying
planes--

               or try as in many ways possible to "nullify" it--as has been
done at every step of the way with the "The Poets of Guantanamo"--

Thanking you again for your profoundly moving letter, --

(and I shd note perhaps for Mr Dorn's benefit, not that he wil care to be
sure!--not that he is "lisetning"!----or is he?-- that the countless
Priests, Nuns,Bishops murdered in Latin America were opposed to the monsters
oppressing the Indigenous and poor--and today in the US are the last or only
resort for illegal immigrants and their families to find shelter and
support--
for example, in Postville, Iowa, where the local Parish has had to intervene
and raise money and donations of food and clothing, a poetry "hidden in
plain sight" may be found in the movement of persons and words--the illegal
workers knowingly employed by the world largest Kosher met packing
corporation in a plant repeatedly cited for appallingly substandard
conditions and child labor, are arrested--and held in the building of the
National Cattle Conference--people treated like animals working with animals
specially treated when arrested are housed in a building where animals are
discussed in terms of trade and slaughter--
their wives meanwhile are provided with electronic monitoring bracelets so
they will not be able to "leave" nor to work, being illegal, so their
children will starve along side the meat packing plant--
which their fathers are being punished for having worked in--
and in conditions which no other workers could bear the punishment of
toiling in, let alone for the low wages which they had no choice but to
accept--
in these movements among meat and substandard conditions ending up in the
Cattle Conference building--
is not there a form of "Poetic Justice" being "meted" out--
and all of it for the sake of meat--
in a place where living humans and dead animals meet-
on a perhaps "unequal footing"--
the dead animals being "legal" and the living humans not-)

Hello Susan,
It's really irrelevant how much the book(s) cost because the books are not
for sale and that's the whole point. She cannot say, as she did, that she is
not now returning the books because she paid for them. She cannot pay and
own  something that was never being sold.  The fine is nothing to do with
the value of the books. She should return the books.  They don't belong to
her and it seems to me the fines reflect her bloody-mindedness and selfish
attitude.  The fine is fine it is her attitude that is excessively arrogant.
Libraries are one of the best institutions the world has (they are a public
service and free in the U.K.)  but  they only work on the trust of the
users.

Dear Mr. David=2C
Thank you for your kind response to my letter.
=20
I recall a number of years past=2C overhearing a perfume dealer near the Gr=
and Market in Damascus suggest to two customers he had taken to be American=
=2C but who in fact turned out to be Canadian - or so they said=2C although=
 Americans in Syria often say that they're Canadian because they are afraid=
 of admitting they are American - that many of the problems between our two=
 cultures could be eradicated if they would only read the Qu'ran.
=20
They countered that perhaps he should read the Bible.  He said that he had.=
  That he had studied it=2C not only in translation into Arabic=2C but that=
 he had studied it in Hebrew=2C along with the Qabbala and many of its vari=
ous commentaries.
=20
Convenient enough=2C we think.  The Israelis live next door.  So Hebrew is =
"available."  But the suggestion by these tourists / theorists / terrorists=
 (to go along with your site / sight / cite) that studying what is consider=
ed locally to be the essential and determining religious / cultural text - =
they ignored his imprecations=2C and walked away - was simply a matter of f=
urther American arrogance taken to a level so individuated that even whatev=
er largesse is left in American culture - Popeye the Sailor=2C for example=
=2C who at least is regardful of the fact that enmity is not a natural stat=
e - will fail to penetrate to a level of sympathetic plasma and merciful re=
gard.  We will have war=2C here=2C
=20
forever war=2C because people like these "Canadians" care little to learn o=
f the pagan Cargo Cult that brought the Mecca Stone under image to verisimi=
lar "truth" (yes=2C we have problems of our own . . . yet=2C we do maintain=
 a real sense of 'aql 'amali=2C the "hobbling" brought on in combining the =
Speculative and the Practical in a single conscious spate of language )=2C =
but that they care absolutely nothing for the language of creation and reve=
lation=2C and tend to believe=2C for example=2C that Sufic "angelism" is ju=
st another fanatical Saracen throwback whose false imagination in terms of =
poetic belief and spiritual praxis simply excuses the knee-deep blood flowi=
ng through the Old City of  Jerusalem in 1099.
=20
As far as I can tell=2C poetry is read with complete abandon and necessity=
=2C from the Eastern shores of the Meditarranean=2C all the way to the Sout=
h China Sea.  So=2C the lack of western regard for it=2C is not just a Musl=
im problem.  Or specifically as a religious problem attendant upon that.  I=
t is a problem of perception.  The West has a problem with perception.  A p=
henomenological problem.  And since perception is related to knowledge=2C t=
hey have an epistemological problem.  And as these two are related to creat=
ion - the Creative Project - they have problems with religious sensibility=
=2C sexuality in the largest sense=2C and with submission=2C overall.
=20
And=2C where I come from=2C poetry is the ballasting force among these thre=
e.  The Qu'ran is poetry in the way that Mr. Jack Spicer's poems are.  Dict=
ation.  However=2C one has to make a space through which this can be receiv=
ed=2C where the three "live" intertwined=2C and are not so restricted by do=
ctrinaire "rationality." - And this is exactly what the West is lacking.  T=
he poets of the West receive "signals"=2C certainly=2C but they are intelle=
ctual and dry.  "Canadian."  Not really admitting who they most actually ar=
e.
=20
Americans lie.  Fulsomely.  What Arab doesn't know that?  The Great Satan. =
 Of course=2C when a Muslim says this=2C he is actualy referring to Shaitan=
=2C "the trivializer".  Which is the correct view.  America is the great tr=
ivializer of that sense of spirit - which even the most devout Meccan acoly=
te knows has a primarily sexual energy base - through which language is mor=
e than just a slogan on a straw hat on the head of a tuba player in a Dixie=
land band at the Republican National Convention.
=20
Is it any wonder that we love our lands - reduced as they currently are to =
a scatterment of moon rocks - and that their "dryness" is an American impor=
t?  The first thing that both Bushes did in teir reign of terror across our=
 lands=2C was to destroy our water sources.  Bush I & II both bombed water =
facilities in and around Baghdad and other cities and towns of significant =
size=2C while at the same time=2C spading up the rich marshlands of souther=
n Iraq=2C to make those waters equally unavailable.
=20
Water is the first poetic.  Need I say more?  Why do you hate us so=2C that=
 you need to parch our creative drive into those naturally violent reaction=
s against your deadly stealth=2C through which your attacks can be ultimate=
ly justified?
=20
Of this=2C I cannot understand.

WOMAN



a group exhibit



Tuesday, 2 September - Tuesday, 7 October, 2008



Opening reception for the artists:



Sunday, 7 September, 2008



7 pm - 9 pm



New York, NY



Today's popular culture has created a climate where there is scant
recognition or respect for female modesty or achievement that isn't coupled
with sex appeal. Being "sexy" is the ultimate accolade, trumping
intelligence, character and all other accomplishments by a woman during the
various stages of her life.



Popular culture has created a climate in which women are valued more for
their appearance than for their contributions to society, forcing women of
all ages to become willing, active and conscious participants in a tawdry,
tarty, and very cartoon-like version of female sexuality.



"WOMAN" FusionArts Museum's first group exhibit by female artists examines
this new female imperative with the assistance of the Roman poet Ovid who
said:



"What one beholds of a woman is the least part of her",



reminding us that women are more than their Manolo Blahnik pumps.

A visit to the Strand a couple of days ago brought me a hardbound copy of
Auster's latest novel, Man In The Dark, a signed hardbound copy slightly
discounted.  His book The Invention of Solitude is first rate example of my
all time favorite genre, the fictional memoir; the book is among the very
best of its type I've ever read. Auster signed my copy at Books and Company
in 1985. But among my very best book finds ever is my copy of his second
book of poetry Wall Writing, which I unearthed in a bookstore constructed
out of an old trailer in Sarasota, Florida. If I purchased the one signed
copy available online now it would cost $500. An unsigned copy goes for
$125. I paid $1.

Murat's judgment "derivative" concerning Auster's poetry for me is tempered
by an engagement with Auster's experience and thought that has accrued over
decades of reading his work. There is an indirectly autobiographical
element, a poetics of experience seen in the light of an evolving philosoph=
y
of perception and writing that, for me, has led to a craving for material
that makes it worthwhile to push through works that might feel at first
glance less crucial, or even less successful. With writers of such
persistent concern with obtaining and transmitting insight, it is well wort=
h
forcing myself through what might be their less canonically important works=
.
The contrast between what makes literary work accessible in places yet hard=
,
or displeasing to pierce in others, is similar to the process of getting to
know a person.=20

Over time I have realized that when I neglect a worthwhile writer's lesser
works I invariably lose an important opportunity. When later, I go back and
force my way through them, I am usually grateful. For me there is no
question that time spent with a previously unread work of Auster's, perhaps
avoided because of some critic's point of view, or because of some surface
or other flaw, often pays off. This includes his poetry, his journals and
other autobiographical works. The process is like getting to know any
worthwhile person; you try to take the good with the bad, which involves
feeling critical but also includes taking care about dismissing works, or
sides of a person, with too great finality.

Hello to Murat and best to all,
Nick

*Media Talk:  What George Orwell Wrote, 70 Years Later to the Day
<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/business/media/25orwell.html?ei=5070&emc=eta1>
*
 By NOAM COHEN
 George Orwell's copious diaries are now being published every day in blog
form, exactly 70 years after they were made.

One of the stated purposes of this project is to present Orwell in a
familiar and popular form to the electronic reader.
A "doubleplusgood" idea as Orwell not only "remains" a great critic of the
totalitarianization of language and the language of totalitarianism.

Works such as the "The Principles of Newspeak" Appendix to 1984 become not
only "more frightening" today, but "most frighteningly," more familiar on a
daily basis--so the use of the "daily blog" is a very intersting method of
approaching his works as an introduction.

From "The Principles of Newspeak":

"No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral.  A great many were
euphemisms.  Such words, for instance, as joycamp (forced-labor camp) or
Minipax (Ministry of Peace i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exact
opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand,
displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of
Oceanic society.  An example was prolefeed, meaning the the rubbishy
entertainment and spurious new which the Party handed out to the masses.
Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation "good" when
applied to the Party  and "bad" when applied to its enemies.  But in
addition there great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be
mere abbreviation and which derived their ideological color not from their
meaning but their structure.

" . . . The name of every organization . . . was invariably cut down to the
familiar shape; that is, a single, easily pronounced word with the smallest
number of syllabus that would preserve the original derivation. In the
Ministry of Truth {Propaganda} for example, in which Winston Smith worked,
the Recrods Department was called RecDep, the Fiction Department FicDep . .
. even in the early decades of the 20th  century, telescoped words and
phrases had been on of the characteristic features of political language;
and it had been noticed thatthe tendency to use abbreviations of this kind
was most marked in totalitarian organizations.  Such words as Nazi, Gestapo,
Comintern, Inprecorr, Agitprop. In the beginning the practice had been
adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeak it was used with a
conscious purpose.  It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one
narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most of the that
associations that would otherwise cling to it. . . . . Comintern . . refers
to something almost as easily recognized and as limited in purpose, s a
chair or a table.  Comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without
taking thought, whereas Communist International is a phrase over which one
is obliged to linger at least momentarily.  In the same way, the
associations called up by a word like minitrue are fewer and more
controllable than those called up by Ministry of Truth.  This accounted not
only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the
almost exaggerated care which was taken to make every word easily
pronounceable."

          A good reading/writing exercise (which can become almost '"second
nature" at various moments of the day's involvement with such activities and
the hearing also of such words--) is to follow the guidelines of Orwell's
"Principles" by reversing, condensing, making ambiguous the meaning of a
word until it is attached to a "good" or "bad" "ideological expression," and
in turn, using the not the meaning, but the  structure of a word to present
its "ideological color."

             The manipulation of words as independent of "meanings," and
reliant on "structures," makes it far easier to create a language which
controls thought.  A word created with such a purpose and in such a manner,
makes it impossible to think certain thoughts.  The compounding of words
split into fragments creates such easily pronounced and --what?--words as
"vispo," "langpo," "CentCom,"  For example, "vispo"--hack off a hunk of
"visual" and make a sandwich of it with a slice of "poetry"--and you have
"vispo."  Condiments of a few sorts and rolls or choices of wheat or white
bread are available to be sure!  It's fast food approach that "saves time"
and "explaining" or "defining" or having to deal with such  really
troubling, complicated, time consuming things as thousands of years of
discussion re "visual poetry."
It also "immediately" conveys the speed with which, at the flick of the
software program, , one may become a "vispoet," rather than al that boring
"labor" and "study"  involved with something that "visual poetry " sounds
like.

(Note: I'm using "vizpo" or "vispo" as an example that's familiar to readers
here, and because a firend of mine, himself a visual poet, often has asked
me what and why I think "what"  of the term "vispo," which is becoming
almost as "universally used" as the terms it reminds me of via "close
rhyming" and "associate thinking"------"Gizmo" and "Gitmo."  Since various
Gizmos are employed in thousands of Gitmos--perhaps a Newspeak neologism may
come into use which expresses their interelationship  as "Gitzmo." Which
might --who knows after all--produce such further developments as "Blitzmo"
and Glitzmo" which in a sense are already "hovering in the wings" of the
Theaters of War,  full ready to "make their entries,  , assumes their
postions,  and perform their requisite roles.")

Also, there being no previous "vispo" in the strict sense, other than its
"ancient," pre-digital "proto-forms," what is called "vispo" need only
concern those works which are done in the very recent past.  The creation of
"new" "stars" and "masterpieces" is much easier when there is basically a
dearth of "competing" discourses, histories, examples, artists."

In fact, "vispo" in a sense "colonizes" the space formerly inhabited by
"visual poetry" and, in a real sense, "takes it over" "under the umbrella of
new terminology."  In this way, Orwell's acute perceptions of how language
can be used to "form and control thought" regardless of the now meaningless
former meanings of the amputated and compounded words,  points the way
towards the vast possibilities of all sorts of "formal devices"  which can
be put at the service of making "invisible" and opaque the "ideological
meaning."  By making "neutral" and "ambiguous" what had been too easily
observed as contradictions and  oppositions within a word or phrase,  the
word can be rendered meaningless and dependent on  a "compound -context"
which determines if it is "good" or "bad." This is a great aid in the
reduction of thinking, which involves questioning, rather than simply
repeating, or following, what the "leaders" "set the tone" for  as the
"immediate and unquestioning" reception of their version of the  "Truth."
Without realizing it, the "follower," or "Party member," or "citizen," is
ACTING in a "willing suspension of disbelief" which is taken not as "mere
fiction," but as "The Truth."  In such a state, the "state of consciousness"
of the actor, citizen, Party member, becomes AUTOMATIC--that is, it
"immediately goes into action" without any doubts, any costly delay in
questioning the meaning --let alone"'morality"--of what it is to be done and
thought.
            In effect, this use of language is a form of "mobilization" of
citizenry in a Permanent State of War--whether Poetry Wars, Culture Wars,
Wars on Poverty, Wars on Drugs, and the War on Terror.  In the latter
instance, after all, what use would be the "thought provoking" and hence
"time consuming" words of FDR, that "we have nothing to fear but fear
itself?" In the War on Terror, the ONLY thing we have to fear is fear--to be
so terrorized by terror that the only response is with --Terror. Of course,
"our" terror is NOT terror, but "Homeland Security" or "the Right to Self
Defense," and the "terror" is assigned to "terrorists only."  Suicide
bombers and uncontrolled, unaimed, "improvised" weapons are monstrous
because they "kill innocent civilians. "  The weapons used against these
"terrorist barbarities" are "clean " and "smart," that is to say,
"civilized" and "justified" by never killing civilians.  ""Collateral
damages" after all are not "people," but simply unnamed non-person who "met
their fate" that day while on the way to market or school.  That these
non-persons might be considered "similar or equal to" the "innocent
civilians" killed on their ways to market or school is "unthinkable.   After
all, such non-person collateral damage is the fault of the  "terrorists" who
are  "inhumanly" using their neighbors as "human shields."
                To even suggest that there is a contradiction here, a
blatant form of hypocrisy, a double standard, is of course "unthinkable,"
because literally in the language of Newspeak, words are "equally neutral"
until assigned their positions in the battle between "Good" and Evil."Then,
the same word may do "double duty" and the "double standard" become
invisible in the "double talk" of Newspeak.
               In a strange way, then, one might think that "vispo" or
"vizpo" is a "making invisible and soundless" what was previously known
cumbersomely and with difficulty as that worn out anachronism "visual
poetry."
               "Vispo" is more immediately accessible," which indicates that
it is also "more easily and swiftly learned, with that that knowledge put
immediately into production in creating the new product lines, best sellers,
"sexy models" and "hottest intellectual properties."
                   At the same time, none of these "Newspeak" interventions
does away with the "Author."  For, if al things are "the same until assigned
their place in the Party hierarchy," the only distinguishing feature of a
"leader," among "non original artists" and "non original" products made by
"boring" work, and who makes it all appear so exciting, so glamorous that
you just can't help yourself, you want to "sign up" and "join," is the one
whose "signature" insures and guarantees that the whole "production" and
"product line"  is "good," and "good for you as it is Good for Me." And this
person of course is none other than the, as it used to be said, " Author of
my days," now no longer "Our Father," but Big Brother and/or Sister.
                That is why the "signature" of an Author before/after a
piece of writing makes "all the difference."  If the Author is the Great
So-and-So, every word will be seen and heard as of "great significance,"
analyzed, commented on, and  "furnish room" for discussions, symposia,  web
sites, speaking tours, and the Living Enshrinement of Fame, all  due to this
signature, this mark, this sign, of Authority.   Othrwise, the exact same
words written by "somebody never heard of" or "obscure, minor"  of course
will be "immediately forgotten,"  if not on certain necessary occasions
being first detained, "interrogated" and then '"disappeared.'" In that way,
any previous "ambiguity, uncertainty, indeterminacy" will be "decided" by
Authoritative Judgement, "chance operations" or simply by the "erasure" of
what previously had been suspended in the detention cells "under erasure,"
those limbos of the lost on their ways to submergence in the Waters of
Oblivion, there to be consumed by the piranhas of shredding machines and
delete keys.
                    For in the stead fast aussurance of Authority, the
Homeland Security of "our  way of lifeand language, thought and action, our
Freedom and Happiness,"  will be "automatically" "taken care of."  As will
the immediate erasure and disappearnce of all those who oppose it here in
this best of all possible worlds.

Dear Ismaelia al-Sadiq

Thank you so much for your letter, for the rocks. for that which is,
everywhere found yet hidden in plain sight--(or site/sight/cite-)--

I remember when the discussion re Dorn and the Mandel etc transpired-- it
seems to return here in a cyclical pattern--

Thank you for writing of the funeral of Nizar Qabbani and what he and his
works meant to so many--the death and funeral of Darwish show very
powerfully what you right of as the vitality of poetry in the Muslim world.

These events, with so much else that continually happens every day, make me
think of the so often quoted Jack Spicer line "Nobody listens to poetry
anymore," as I often wonder if it is not the other way round, that poetry
itself in America is not listening anymore, and not listening, does not see
those things hidden in plain site/sight/cite.

At "The Insitution for Criminal Thinking," there was one window
through
which one saw daily a large tree degnerating into an organic ruin from
diease, in which a bird had made a very large nest.  In the devastating
bleakness, this nest on autum days filled with light, held it. and ignited
the blood of life.  Winter came, the leaves dropped away, and the light now
came from the South, a paler light, which the nest gathered and kept strong=
.
          Huge winds came that early winter, and I thought--what will happe=
n
if the nest is blown down?  The light will go out, and in the waning
bleakness, the harshness lacerate the veins.  Standing by the window seeing
the first light rushing into the nest hollow, I saw that the heart I had
found there was my own, inside me.
      Two hearts regard each other, and then it is found that, yes, the nes=
t
will soon be gone, yet, having met, the hearts' regards will be exchanged
everywhere for there are no boundaries.
      One morning, the harsh light and air trembling violently with the
sounds of the chainsaw, the tree and the nest were cut down and carted
away.  Since then, I find them everywhere.

            When everything is stolen and taken away, including movement,
books, water, fuel, food, everything--and "nothing" but rocks and
light
remain, that is not nothing at all, but everything.  And necessity, the
motherfucker of invention, finds much with which to work.

               Writing, art objects, virtuality--"form"--can all be
made
into prisons and Walls--very often are--

               And so it is possible that "poetry" may not listen to

Good points. I am curious as to why the library did not merely declare the =
books lost and charge the replacement cost plus a fee for the librarian's t=
ime and trouble.=A0 Our local library and the library at my former universi=
ty both charge a set fee and replacement cost for unreturned items. Replaci=
ng a rare book would be difficult, but popular fiction (such as the texts i=
n question) could be replaced fairly easily.=20

Hello Susan,

her and it seems to me the fines reflect her bloody-mindedness and selfish=

Libraries are one of the best institutions the world has (they are a public=

users.

Nick,

You are utterly right. The failures of a truly superior writer -which Auste=
r
obviously is- are more precious, interesting and rewarding than the
successes of a more run-of-the-mill writer.

I completely agree with you that a writer -if one respects that writer's
work- must be trusted in the totality of his or her work. This goes as much
for publishers as for readers.

Ciao,

Murat

a
whole. At last count, I had found and corrected 32 errors=96only 3 of which=
 were
mine. The other errors were ones made by the editor=96jagged margins, dropp=
ed italics,
misspelled words. But I didn=92t mind doing the editing. After all, this wa=
s my
book, and I wanted it to be right=85

=A0

But it gets even better.

=A0

The letter went on to say that even though they had
=93revoked=94 the book award and were not publishing the book, the publishi=
ng
contract was still valid and in effect and that they owned the rights to my
book in all its formats. In order for me to get my rights back, I had to re=
pay
them the $1000 prize money I had been given as well as give them the $200 t=
hey
had spent acquiring the cover art for a book THEY were choosing not to publ=
ish.

=A0

In short, they were breaching the contract, refusing to
publish my book, and holding the rights to my own work hostage.=94

=A0

right word, intolerant, ed was intolerant of all fools, jew,
aboriginal, cowboy, philosospher,black, yellow, gay, straight,
rich or poor, supreme court judge or petty thief, swindler or
sanctimonious.

Joe Tsujimoto is a writer born and raised in NYC who has lived in
Hawai`i for many years. His writing is wonderful; I'm a fan.
The book, Morningside Heights, is available from Bamboo Ridge and from
SPD. Try it out!


Morningside Heights is a gritty and heartfelt insiders’ take on a unique
Manhattan neighborhood, a tough no nonsense environment where any young
man would have to scramble to find himself. If you want to know what
life was like for the son of Japanese immigrants, making his way in the
world of the '60s, then this is the book for you. Its narrative tells
many fascinating stories, and, in the end, leaves the reader wanting more.
--Oscar Hijuelos, Pulitzer Prize winning author of
The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love


In the footsteps of V.S. Naipaul's Miguel Street and Sherwood Anderson's
Winesburg, Ohio, Joe Tsujimoto's Morningside Heights explores the heart
of a neighborhood in transition. Gritty and poignant, this collection of
semi-autobiographical stories traverses the streets of New York, Makawao
and memory, using intimate details and tender riffs to invoke the spirit
of a time past, recall a community dispersed, and recreate the feeling
of home, lost and found.
--Nora Okja Keller,
author of Comfort Woman and Fox Girl


Readers: Make room for Morningside Heights on your shelves. This
collection of short stories, which chronicles the life of a
Japanese-American New Yorker ­ from his rebellious childhood on the edge
of Harlem in the fifties and sixties, to his enlistment in the Air Force
during the Vietnam War, to his present life as a teacher and writer in
Hawaii ­ gives John Okada’s No-No Boy and Carlos Bulosan’s America Is In
The Heart a run for their money. Read this book for its urgency, its
tales of love and loss, of one man’s determination to make something out
of himself when the heart of his world seemed to have stopped beating.
Most of all, read it for its craftsmanship its tough prose charged with
the beauty and blues of Billie Holiday and the supreme cool of John
Coltrane.
--R. Zamora Linmark,
author of Primetime Apparitions and Rolling the R’s


Stories with the ring of truth from someone who would know.
--David Milch, writer for “Hill Street Blues,”
“N.Y.P.D. Blue,” and “Deadwood”





Joe Tsujimoto's most influential teachers were Joseph Heller, Donald
Barthelme, and the Greek poet, Konstantinos Lardas, writers, whose words
had made an indelible impression on him during his undergraduate studies
at C.C.N.Y. Now more than forty years later he has put together a
collection of his own writings, produced between various jobs and many
years of teaching young people. He is perhaps best known for his teacher
texts: Teaching Poetry to Adolescents and Lighting Fires: How the
Passionate Teacher Engages Adolescent Writers.

Dear Poetics List:

I am pleased to announce the publication of Stephen Rodefer's new book, Call
It Thought/Selected Poems, now out from Carcanet Press, at 300 pages, with a
foreword by Rod Mengham. It is available in the United States for $38.95 via
the Independent Publishers Group - http://www.ipgbook.com - and in the UK
for 15 pounds directly from Carcanet -
http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781857549492

Back cover blurb:
Call It Thought spans more than forty years of writing by an American poet
whose career has encompassed a large portion of modern literary culture. As
a student, Stephen Rodefer conversed with Robert Frost; he studied with
Olson, Creeley, Ed Dorn, Amiri Baraka, and Basil Bunting before moving in
the 1970s to San Francisco, where his work was first published and where he
was an original member of Poets Theater.

Grounded in the modernism of Stein, Pound and Williams, Rodefer is heir also
to Frank O'Hara's playful virtuosity, and associated with the
experimentalism of Language poetry. Touching all these, his work is a series
of provocative re-inventions, exhilarating, innovative and independent of
any orthodoxy.

This volume brings together his work for the first time. New, unpublished
writing is included as well as some of his acclaimed translations of Villon
and part of his award-winning Four Lectures, of which Robert Creeley
declared, 'Very SOLID, GREAT and useful satiric ploy with bedrock concerns.
Grab Four Lectures, it's possibly the last real sense you'll be offered.'

'Youthful what? Where is Rodefer, he'll know. That damn Lycidas. Whatever
else England draws upon, it's native talent will out. The damn Lycidas!
Where did Rodefer go? Youthful what?' - Charles Olson

'Stephen Rodefer's writing is simply one of the eighth wonders of the
invisible world.' - Ian Patterson

I didn't realize that Auster had made his curious wager until Murat had inf=
ormed me of it. Auster, a great writer, but no Pascal. Maybe he decided to =

Subject: Nathaniel Tarn Reading at Acequia Booksellers


Dear Friends,
    Just a note to let you know that poet Nathaniel Tarn will be reading on
Sunday September 7 at 3pm at Acequia Booksellers, 4019 4th St. NW in
Albuquerque.  The reading is free and the public is invited. More
information on Nathaniel below:

Nathaniel Tarn, Poet, Translator, Critic, Anthropologist has led a
distinguished literary and academic career studying and/or teaching at the
Universities of Cambridge, Paris, Chicago, London, SUNY Buffalo, Princeton,
Pennsylvania, and Colorado.  He has published over 35 books including The
Beautiful Contradictions (Random House), Views from the Weaving Mountain
(1991), Lyrics for the Bride of God (New Directions), Selected Poems :
1950-2000 (Wesleyan), and Where Babylon Ends (Grossman/Cape Goliard). His
most recent book is Ins and Outs of the Forest Rivers (New Directions 2008).
He was the founding editor of Cape Editions & Cape Goliard London-New York
in the late 60's, publishers of Charles Olson, J.H. Prynne, Ted Berrigan and
others. He is the recipient of numerous awards including the Guinness prize,
a Wenner Gren fellowship, a Commonwealth of Pennsylvania fellowship, and a
Rockefeller Foundation fellowship. Until his retirement in 1985, Tarn was a
professor in comparative literature at Rutgers.

    For over forty years, Nathaniel Tarn has been celebrated as an
extraordinary figure in American writing. His work in a variety of scholarly
and literary genres has ranged from Maya ritual to Jewish mysticism, the
monasteries of Burma to the arctic seas of Alaska. One of the founders of
ethnopoetics, he has brought to poetry an almost limitless range of
interests and a remarkable dexterity in both open and closed forms. As Eliot
Weinberger has written, "What holds it together is Tarn's ecstatic vision,
his continuing enthusiasm for the stuff of the world."

Hope to see you at the reading. This is a "don't miss" event.
Best,
Gary

Hi everyone,

Idiolexicon, the folks who've brought you the popular Idiolexicon Poetry
Series at San Francisco's Cafe Royale, have just released late-summer's
Idiolexicon Issue 2.1 =96 "Sorry For Sedoka" =96 to the website.

Elliot Harmon writes:*  Jack Morgan and I had been talking about doing some
sort of cross-promotional doohickey between Sorry for
Snake<http://stormypetrelpress.com/s4s/>and Idiolexicon. He just
suggested that I put a note on the Idiolexicon blog
saying that the first ten people to comment on it would get a free copy of =
*
S4S4* in the mail. But I resisted because frankly, I don't like you people
that much. You and I know you don't deserve such an excellent poetry journa=
l
just for leaving a lousy comment.

So instead, I thought, why don't we revive a traditional poetic form, just
like that ghazal guy did for ghazals a few years ago? In the world of
traditional Japanese poetry, the haiku gets far too much attention to the
exclusion of its buddies. Japanese poets would sometimes use the sedoka for=
m
to send each other messages. With the discursive usage and Twitterish lengt=
h
of the form, 2008 clearly has a sedoka-shaped hole. -EH*

Check it out!  Submissions will be open soon for the next issue once the
final theme has been hashed out.  Keep checking back!

Denver - along with the convention - is featuring a number of public art

Steve,

The title of the book where the bet occurs is *Hand To Mouth*. The shift in
the book from poetry to writing a novel (specifically a detective novel)
occurs very subtly. On the surface, the memoir seems to end with success,
Paul Auster becoming a successful writing earning his living from it. In
reality, at least to me reading it, the book ends with failure. The
protagonist has to shift from poetry to writing a genre novel to reach his
end, completely ignoring the original bet, which was more specific, making =
a
living out of writing poetry. In fact, *Hand To Mouth* at the end reinforce=
s
the fact that economic unviability is of the essence of poetry (at least in
The United States) and facing that fact is essential, a defining act, in
becoming an American poet. Auster is reluctant to face that fact (at least
in that book) and maybe for that reason I feel something missing in his
poems.

Ciao,

Murat

This is a digression from the discussion on Auster, but Thomas Hardy, who
mainly prized his poetry writing, now neglected by comparison to his novels=
,
late in life published the following poem, that I couldn't help but copy
out:

Thoughts at Midnight

Mankind, you dismay me
When shadows waylay me!-
Not by your splendours
Do you affray me,
Nor as pretenders
To demonic keenness,
Nor by your meanness,
Nor by your ill-teachings
Nor your false preachings,
Nor your banalities
And immoralities,
Nor by your daring
Nor sinister bearing;
But by your madnesses
Capping cool badnesses,
Acting like puppets
Under Time's buffets;
In superstitions
And ambitions
Moved by no wisdom,
Far sight, or system,
Led by sheer senselessness
And presciencelessness
Into unreason
And hideous self-treason....
God, look he on you,
Have mercy upon you!

part written 25 May 1906

(published in his last book of poems "Winter Words in Various Moods")

Dear Poetics-L:


RE: http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

The Holy Forest: Collected Poems of Robin Blaser, Revised and Expanded Edition.

Robin Blaser is Professor Emeritus at Simon Fraser University. Among
his many books are The Fire: Collected Essays of Robin Blaser (UC
Press), Pell Mell, and Syntax. Miriam Nichols is College Professor at
University College of the Fraser Valley and editor of Even on Sunday:
Essays, Readings, and Archival Materials on the Poetry and Poetics of
Robin Blaser.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Blaser


Robin Blaser, one of the key North American poets of the postwar
period, emerged from the "Berkeley Renaissance" of the 1940s and
1950s as a central figure in that burgeoning literary scene. The Holy
Forest, now spanning five decades, is Blaser's highly acclaimed
lifelong serial poem. This long-awaited revised and expanded edition
includes numerous published volumes of verse, the ongoing
"Image-Nation" and "Truth Is Laughter" series, and new work from 1994
to 2004. Blaser's passion for world making draws inspiration from the
major poets and philosophers of our time-from friends and peers such
as Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer, Charles Olson, Charles Bernstein, and
Steve McCaffery to virtual companions in thought such as Hannah
Arendt, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida,
among others. This comprehensive compilation of Blaser's prophetic
meditations on the histories, theories, emotions, experiments, and
countermemories of the late twentieth century will stand as the
definitive collection of his unique and luminous poetic oeuvre.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is
available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Blaser

It's just arrived and it's exquisite.  The poetry is and the vehicle -
well - how do they do that double binding?  The doubled-up strength of
translucent paper? The precise beauty of presentation?   Sigh.  Poetry gets
the home it deserves.  This is a 'must have' even if you don't like poetry.
If you do- and that's why you're reading this -you'll be in double heaven.
An utter treasure for you or a gift for a very special loved one.

as an aside to Nick's digression, i've unearthed this nugget. Jean Baudrillard's "Forget Foucault."
...you both use the same strategy. You don't speak about the media, the media speaks through you. As soon as you turn on your theoretical screen, the great myths of history are turned into a soap opera, or into "serials. You make them share the fate of that TV program, "Holocaust," which you analyzed so well.

The very first two paragraphs of Paul Auster's *Hand To Mouth* (Henry Holt,
1997), pages 3-4, reads as follows:

"In my late twenties and early thirties, I went through a period of several
years when everything I touched turned to failure. My marriage ended in
divorce, my work as a writer foundered, and I was overwhelmed by money
problems. I'm not just talking about an occasional shortfall or some
periodic belt tightenings- but a constant, grinding, almost suffocating lac=
k
of money that poisoned my soul and kept me in a state of never-ending panic=
.
   There was no one to blame but myself. My relationship to money had alway=
s
been flawed, enigmatic, full of contradictory impulses, and now I was payin=
g
the price for refusing to take a clear-cut stand on the matter. All along m=
y
only ambition had been to write. I had known that as early as sixteen or
seventeen years old, and I had never deluded myself into thinking I could
make a living at it. Becoming a writer is not a "career decision" like
becoming a doctor or a policeman. You don't choose it as much as get chosen=
,
and once you accept the fact that you're not fit for anything else, you hav=
e
to be prepared to walk a long hard road for the rest of your days. Unless
you turn out to be a favorite of the gods (and woe to the man who banks on
that) your work will never bring in enough to support you, and if you mean
to have a roof over your head and not starve to death, you must resign
yourself to doing other work to pay the bills. I understood all that, I was
prepared for it, I had no complaints. In that respect, I was immensely
lucky. I didn't particularly want anything in the way of material goods, an=
d
the prospect of being poor didn't frighten me. All I  wanted was a chance t=
o
do the work I felt I had it in me to do."

This is a digression from the discussion on Auster, but Thomas Hardy, who
mainly prized his poetry writing, now neglected by comparison to his novels,
>>

This is silly.

As I've been here, it might have been true that Hardy was rated as a
novelist rather than a poet in the sixties, but certainly from the seventies
on, Hardy is (rightly) seen as a poet first and a novelist second.

Who argues this?

To expand this slightly ...

This is a UK take on things ...

Up to the sixties, Hardy was certainly seen as a novelist, but in the wake
of Philip Larkin (both in his practice and his criticism -- as Yeats created
an audience for Blake in the late 19th / early 20th C, so Larkin in the
50s/60s for Hardy), Hardy was recognised (at least in the UK) as one of the
central poets of the late 19th /early 20thC.

I can put my finger on when this was happening in the UK, since as an
undegraduate in the mid to late 60s, I was expected to write essays on
Hardy-the-Novelist.

After the early 70s, this would have been seen as a joke.

It was part of a larger shift that revalued Clare, Edward Thomas, and Robert
Frost.

Oddly enough, Robert Graves and the Georgian Movement generally didn't get
similarly revalued.

Fair does -- Thomas Hardy was easily the best, and you can dis Larkin by
pointing out that he is essentially Hardy-and-Water.

But Hardy-the-Novelist today?

Geeuz a break, jimmy ...

  I had a similar experience to that of Murat's in reading The Invention of
Solitude. (Which perhaps may be thought of also as The Convention of
Solitude--)

 Steve Russell wrote  that Auster is a non-Pascalian thinker, which is
certainly interesting  in considering the title, "The invention of
Solitude,"  for Pascal writes at one point that al the problems for persons
begin from the fact that they cannot remain of their own volition solitary,
and stay simply in a room.  And in that room--to write perhaps--"perchance
to dream"--to follow Memory and Time as Proust does in the Solitude of the
cork lined room, or to
 invent something new to the "solitariness of the male"--"the "A Room of
One's Own" of Virginia Woolf--or that room of Emily Dickinson's of which sh=
e
wrote--"I have but to cross the room to be in the Spice Islands."

               (Might one not ask and have not and do not millions
continually do so-- if a woman has far less opportunity, far less time, (fo=
r
time more than money even is required for Inventing Solitude)--far less of
that time, most precious of commodities---- which for a woman is so little
permitted--for the Invention of Solitude--, an almost invisible, barely
heard, "solitude" compared to the "Solitariness of the Male of the Species,=
"
who gets to sit and look "wise" like the Solitary Male Lion--resplendent in
meditation on the Shadow that he casts--as he poses there between the Sun
and that other shadow of himself, his son---who will carry "his name" into
the next and next generations, much as his own shadow lengthens across the
landscape with the coming of twilight-- for is not the "critique of the
self" conducted with an eye to its improvement?--and in what better way to
improve oneself than by those extensions through Space via shadows and Time
via progeny--and via these extensions make of the self both shadow and
substance in such a way that they portray nothing less than an enduring
presence of a God-like Being--)


 To invent solitude is a Pascalian paradox, for it means that one begins
with the goal of attaining one's own inventing of something that one alread=
y
has seen examples of and desires.  In other words, the paradox is that the
invention is of something already KNOWN.
         By this Pascalian reversal--one finds that the "invention of
solitude" is the Convention of finding its rejection. By seeking to "invent
solitude," the writer is faced with the convention of finding that the
conventional is what calls to him.  And thus a "gambler" on Poetry faces hi=
s
conventional responsibilities as a "son of a father and father of a
son"--and realizes that in order to support these additional "male members,=
"
one must choose between the poverty of poetry and the relative security of
"conventional prose genres."  Being an "ethical being," Auster chooses to
sacrifice the poetry--and poverty--and instead become not only the "author
of his sons day's," but his "hard working father, toiling in the lower
depths of literature that the son might find his way to a better future--"

        In Auster's case the paradox is that by using blueprints and
previous texts as "guides," in the invention of solitude, what his inventio=
n
will be of is something "Already KNOWN, already WRITTEN,"   This is why
perhaps he is certain of his bet on the outcome of events in terms of
writing.  He thinks of and follows in the footsteps of others and their
examples, thinking to win his bet, and then, discovering he has made the
outcome dependent on writing alone--he has missed the fact of money which
concerns not only oneself but one's family. Writing an invention of solitud=
e
becomes a selfish act, and so Auster turns to one far more familiar to thos=
e
who are readers of much literature, as he is himself a reader of a great
many texts, and so knows the "conventional choices facing those who are
obsessed with invention."

That is , to work as a translator, anthologist, writer of Prefaces and at
first "manfully" toiling in the "prosaic prose" of Genre novels known for
their 'formulaic prose" and "narratives" which Poetry tends to look down
on--Auster is able to harness both is craft and talents and his ability to
be a respectable bread winner, and so elude that other convention of
literature, the "dead beat dad" who puts all his eggs in one basket,
sacrificing all--including the family--for the pursuit of that fickle
chimera, the Muse.

     That is, in the exchange between poetry and money, he has considered
only himself as being the one to benefit. When the "more prosaic demands of
life" begin to "prey on him," he discovers that the only form of
reconciliation he thinks open to him is that of  joining together writing
and the prosaic demands of life.  That is,  --to write prose that some of
his poetic colleagues may think of as of a "Common" and "Prosaic Nature."
The "problem of the bet," is not necessarily the terms in which it was to b=
e
tested, but that it was an exclusionary bet made by a Poet who had
"overlooked" the demands of the Prosaic existence of his ignored roles as
son and father.

        In The Invention of Solitude, the "room" Auster finds turns out not
to be solitary, for there are in it both his father and his son.  The
"linking of generations of men" follows the same pattern as that of the
literary.  A writer, even  a Poet, is not without a place in the already
waiting and written series of Solitudes, examples, fathers and sons--
linkings-which are in sad disrepair and need  this Poetic worker to set to
work "mending"--- and if one is indeed both a Poet and a Man, must find a
way to reconcile these--to be "responsable"--and accept one's place in the
traditions of writing--in a way he had not "counted on" when making his
bet--and so find that that to be the "Author of Days" is to be a "Real
Man"--


      The "failure" which Murat notes in terms of poetry, is a success in
the very real sense that Auster is able with his writing to make that room
"livable" which he finds himself sharing with his father and his own son,
and so in that space making a linkage, becoming a part of and not apart
from, a "lineage," a cultural and familial narrative which he wouldst fain
interrupt, for to do is to risk becoming an "outsider," a "pariah,"   and
effectively a criminalized 'dead beat dad" sought after by the IRS, Family
Services and other organizations, let alone flocks of those buzzards known
as lawyers.

           This "Invention of Solitude" which is sacrificed for the
Conventional narrative of Male Cultural and Social heritage preserved as a
lineage--- creates an implicit critique of the female "solitude" in the
strict sense connected with that "solitary confinement/confining oneself to
one's room'"  of  Emily Dickinson or the more social Virgina Woolf-, in tha=
t
for a woman to be "solitary" means the commission of a "crime' more
dangerous than that of being a "dead beat dad"--the choosing of being
childless by the being who is supposed to be the child bearer.

             For who is the representative of the Female Solitude in
Auster's book but the tragic and damned Cassandra?  Who "speaks" in Auster'=
s
text via an obscure old English translation of an obscure Latin version--an=
d
is "rescued" from these "obscurities" by the "generosity " of the Male
Author.  This generosity has its limits, though, for while "allowing the
voice of the obscured voices of the doomed female prophetess to speak," at
the same time what Auster puts in the mouth of a young prostitute hired to
come to his "room of his own"is not words, but that "pen-ultimate"
instrument of the Authorship of Days--


At  first twas very exciting to me, and I thought, aha, finally a
contemporary writer I can look forward to accompanying for along time in hi=
s
writing. Unfortunately, the book crosses a Rubicon, and turns into the same
old story of the father-son-son mold.

This discovery simulatenously "realizes"  one's solitude as an entity among
others,  part from them,  and as also an entity among others, apart of them=
.
  In the same way that the life follows the book and the book follows
thelife engender from that engendersed from books, the writing of books as
the "link inthe chjain" of both writing and being--"reconciles" the formerl=
y
gambling writer with the realization that with his "placein the family
found," there is a respsoansabiulity to be a provider.
     In that manner, the turning to the writing of a genre work, which is
the same genre turned to be so many many writers in order to "make a
living," is not a turn of "defeat," but rather one of understanding how to
secure a "success," in that he being a writer does have a way to write and
at the same time "take care of his family.

        It is not a "compromise," but a recognition and embrace, or at leas=
t
acceptance, of the reality in which the writer is living, as both apart fro=
m
the family due to the solitude of the act of writing itself, if not
literally always, certainly often enough figuratively, and also being a par=
t
of the community which he shares with not just his family, but this family
of writers he is a son among fathers in and father among sons now realizing
his responsabilities.

         The use of translation in the book--and Auster's own translating a=
s
another way of Supporting himself and his family"-- --and its reversal in
the act of oral sex that is paid for--"illustrates" another form of reversa=
l
in which the making of money by translating others' poetry "transmutes" the
earlier failure to make money of Auster's own poetry into a "conventional"
means of "doubling the earning power of one's skills"  as poet and
bi-lingual expatriate.

 The  use of the Mallarme's "Tomb for Anatole," about the grief beyond
measure (that is a poetic measure also, as the work is a fragmented series
of prose notations which are on a jagged edged line of grief stricken
utterance close to stutter-ance.)--signals that Auster is aware of what the
life and death of others (his father, his son) is beginning to mean to him.
This  "awareness of death" in "aesthetic form" as a broken utterance which
will ultimately "find expression" in the grave, the tomb, the monument is
another way in which Auster faces the the "mending process" which is the
"conventional narrative" of the book.
       (Mallarme also wrote a poem for "le Tombeau d' Edgar Poe"--for the
occasion of the dedication in Baltimore of a monument to the American poet
who via Baudelaire's translation has so influenced generations of French
poets.  Whitman, unable to attend the ceremonies due to illness, also wrote
a brief note, which was inspired by a dream, quite a fitting way in which t=
o
"encounter and remember Poe.")


          To keep alive the dead--is the action of Mallarme and Poe, while
knowing full well that what activates the presence of the writing is the
absence that one is having to face of the being whom one cannot "keep alive=
"
in any other way than by writing, which as Poe puts it, is "mournful and
never ending remembrance."

         Perhaps that is why the most striking words in the book are those
of the obscure English translation of an extremely obscure Latin version of
Homer, in which the shrieks of Cassandra, that "ill-omened bird," are in an
agony, for it is she, truly who is the one who exists in solitude, and in
solitude with seeing that Apocalypse which is coming to meet her , her
family, her city, everything Trojan---




        If one thinks of Cassandra's "voice of poetry" as visionary and
tragic, existing in a solitude which is invented for one, rather than being
invented by one, then, the movement of males among males is the linking wit=
h
the writing which "earns a living for the family."  Or at least the male
members, no pun intended!!
      Meanwhile, in the book is the complete absence of females, other than
the prostitute who is paid to "service" the "very important member" which
cannot seem to abide the solitude the writer attempts to invent.

       Again, the book Auster is creating which is created out of books,
"follows a pattern," and so the "happy ending" of reconciliation of what ha=
d
seemed to be "difficult situations" in the writing of a genre novel, in a
genre which is associated with the resolution of difficulties, the solving
of cases and if one want sot, of case histories.

           The writer is brought face to face with the conventional--the
convention genre novel, the conventional "story of my life and how i found
my father and my son and became a Man," and conventional i the sense that
"poetry" which is so "strange"--Mallarme's, Cassandra's, becomes "lost in
translation," and sinks into a kind of obscurity, a fading backdrop for the
ongoing saga of the generation unto generation existence as a member
(forgive me, there it is again!!)) of a family )one's own) and also of the
"family of man," for this family is that, a family of man, and so Cassandra
that immensely tragic and harsh voice which spills beauty forth with blood
and death, is abandoned, and what was once "needed" (poetry) can now be
purchased to "satisfy a need." (The young prostitute.)

      This discussion and thinking of Invention of Solitude brought to mind
two of my personal favorite books ever written on the interrelationship of
literal Hunger and literary Hunger, which do not come about nor "conclude
(for neither concludes at all--) with those reconciliations the literary an=
d
the literal that Auster finds.
          These books are Knut Hamsun's HUNGER, (which Auster has used also
as title) and FOR BREAD ALONE by the Moroccan writer Mohamed Choukri.  In
HUNGER, the writer seems to be without any family at all other than the
"friends" and "uncles" he creates of those whom he encounters and play apar=
t
in his "season in hell" which is simultaneously for the protagonist-writer
"Illuminations."
            In Choukri's book, the dysfunctional family trying to survive
the famines sweeping the Rif during the World wide Depression of the 1930,s
the family itself "eats its young," for his father kills his small brother.
Everyone in the family is at the mercy of the moods of the father, himself
enraged by the frustration of a poverty which seems hopeless to make even a
dent in, to make small hole in, to find anything other than what the writer
finds:  the existence and persistent beauty of stones.
         These in a sense speak to him the parable of his life:  "By bread
alone," rather than "one does not live by bread alone."
           The "niceties" of being able to write a genre novel as a "a way
out of the difficulties," are extremely limited for Hamsun's protagonist,
who only manages no and then to sell apiece to the daily papers, while
starving steadily into evermore "extreme states of destitution and altered
consciousness."  This young man, determined to be a writer, doesn't once se=
e
himself in terms of literary tradition of 'starving writers," at all.  His
solitude is that he finds himself a "dead man walking" in broad daylight,
chewing on wood splinters and writing with a pencil seated among the
cemetery stones.  He becomes a walking HUNGER--barely existing as person,
yet persistent in this despite everything with that "imp of the Perverse"
continually dogging his heels and making the smallest of situations into a
drama of such high strung nerves he collapses into faints that are not far
from death.
        Choukri's autobiographical being in FOR BREAD ALONE is thrown out o=
f
the house, and has to find a way to live among the alleys and gutters,
hustling for this and hustling for that.  To find nothing but "bread alone,=
"
the illiterate child and then young man is trapped in a the picaresque, in
which one event after another follows in an inexorable series of
disconnected fragments which now and then "rhyme" as the repetition of
certain sites, the grave of his brother, the poverty all around one which
makes it impossible to see HUNGER as an experimental act for the generation
of writing, which in part the HUNGER writer is able to do--because he is
already a writer, and which Auster self consciously essays in order to
follow in the footsteps of previous literary apprenticeships.

    Hunger's writer is not even a genre NOVELIST, but a sort of wild
essayist of the daily press who now and then hits on an interesting idea
which he is seized by as much as he ever is able to seize himself due to hi=
s
almost complete debilitation at the "hand to mouth" existence in which the
mouth is devouring him and l that he has is a writing hand, which seems to
go on as though separate from himself, yet connected tenuously as it needs
the writers body to "fuel its writing's journey across the spaces of the
page, and from there, hopefully on to the pages of the daily press.

        "Poetry is news that stays news," Pound may say, but for this write=
r
the only news is poetry--that is to say, it doesn't stay new unless one eat=
s
and ones doesn't eat unless one writes,.  One is trapped in a solitude in
which the only way out is not a reconciliation of writing with living, but
of further traveling--as the young man convinces a somewhat skeptical
employer to give him work on a ship bound for England and eventually the
USA. -

        The ending of the novel has the writer looking back from the ship
pulling out of the harbor and seeing that strange city which marks everyone
who encounters it, and has marked him as much as he has marked pages, --he
sees this as the city where in al the windows "light shone with such
brightness."
           That is, the comfortable family life of home is--what he is
completely "letting go of" in setting out for the Unknown.
            In that sense, the write-in HUNGER is taking, unknown to
himself, that Voyage which Baudelaire begins and which Rimbaud
continues--the "long reasoned disordering of al the senses in order to
arrive, finally! At the unknown."

          Mohamed Choukri is an illiterate living hand to moth doing
whatever he can to find something to eat, something to drink, to quench the
thirst which bothers him more than hunger--thirst being a sign of thirsting
for the Spirit, for "knowledge," and not, in this world he lives in which
has no use for any materials other than the stones and light of its esteras=
e
poverty--not anything so material often as even bread.  Simply water--or a
times wine.

            An event occurs, and so slight and simple that it seems almost
as though "going unnoticed" by the literary reader, increases greatly the
thirst of the one living by bread alone, and the young man, age twenty,
approaches a street scribe letter writer an asks if he may be able to learn
to read and write.
           Rimbaud writes in the "fetes de la faim" (the Feasts of
Hunger)--je ne mange guerre/que des rochers et des pierres"--I eat nothing
more than rocks and stones"--
              (I wont describe the scenes waving to do with stones which ar=
e
a kind of "moment of clarity"  in For Bread Alone--)

               The writers in Hunger and For bread Alone, (in the latter
family IS important to the writer)--I think are much closer to "Poetry" in
the sense that neither of them goes to Poetry or writing expecting at al to
"make a living."  There are for them no "literary examples" to follow as a
Material Guide Book and no connection of writing with anything more than
this rock-bottom existence they lead.  Writing is not "a way out" to some
hoped for and planned for "future," as neither writer has any "models" they
aspire to, and writing is not for either on of them "a way to make a
living," a phrase echoing "the invention of solitude."
              These writers find solitude al around them and in them, a
harsh and enduring solitude, which simply IS, solitude, and one not judged
as being "positive for one's development," nor "negative" in terms of
loneliness and suffering."

           It is hinted that the writer in Hunger was once a student, but
now he is falling like a stone into the waters o social oblivion--a "drop
out," who insists on living as a writer, even when he has "nothing to show
for it."  The apprenticeships which Auster's characters and he himself "set
up" to follow in the footsteps of the masters--isn't something the writers
of Hamsun and Choukri 's books are ever conscious of existing.  They have
accepted the "gamble" and just gone ahead and dived straight into the
unknown, the only "goal" being not even to "publish, to produce, but in
actuality to "learn how to write" at the most basic level. And neither
writer finding themselves embarked on this voyage in to the unknown, even
really any "clear idea' why it is they are willing to go to such extremes
for something that may ell end up "going nowhere."
           In these two writers, where "Necessity the Motherfucker of
invention" meets that Calling of the Waters which is their thirst--it is no=
t
"solitude" or "hunger" that is "invented," but instead--an as yet unknown
writing that the near crazed dead man walking boarding a ship and the the
illiterate street hustler purchasing a notebook and pen for his first
lessons in writing the first sings-embark on.
            Of course, one says with the sagacity of hindsight, Hamsun did
win Nobel Prize and Mohamed Choukri learned to write and became a famous an=
d
banned author--so are they not part of the same story as the one Auster
seeks to be a part of?
             The difference among these writers is that Auster began with
"an accepted and prosaic idea"--that is, the apprenticeship of writer and
that also of the "family man.," of a man a part of the traditions he had
thought himself apart from.
             Auster in other words from the start envisaged both poetry and
prose as books which make money.  The other two writers don't see anything
of this at all.  Leaders of day to day "bare existences," their only
motivation in writing is that seemingly "without reason" they KNOW that is
what they must do.  Not for any goal they can think of at the moment--simpl=
y
to learn how to write.
          And where it may or may not if ever take them neither has the
remotest idea other than a dim consciousness of things written and "shown"
as fotos in the "daily papers.: or the "news " of letters to family dictate=
d
to a scribe in the streets.
              And, in their Voyage into the unknown, both Hamsun and Choukr=
i
became known for having "invented" "new forms of writing" in the traditions
they come to know "later on," rather than "before," as Auster does.
         In Choukri's case, what is even more of an unknown unthought-of of
at al at the outset by himself or anyone else, is that this account of the
picaresque journey to literacy is written not in language of the streets bu=
t
in Classical Arabic, thereby establishing the work as being not a part from
the Classical Traditions of the Arab World, but apart of it, though a
complete "newcomer" in many ways.
            (Not surprisingly Choukri the young hustler-writer found himsel=
f
spending time with this man he wanted to meet who also lived in Tangiers--a
man not unlike himself--the Thief, pimp, Hustler and self taught writer
Genet, who also introduced the languages the streets to the Classical Frenc=
h
Tradition in       Writing.
             There is a great short work by Choukri, "With jean Genet in
Tangiers"--with fotos of the young Choukri and Genet and some other young
men, sitting on the floor or in an outdoor cafe, drinking, smoking, talking=
,
Poets of the Unknown who smuggled into Classicism their street hustling
words, with al the skill of Poet Hustlers long ago used to many other forms
of Solitude such a are found in the prisons and hell holes the "world withi=
n
the world," that concealed and veiled world which veils itself yet in their
works by "disguising themselves" as Classicists in street clothes, sitting
on the floors of tiny rooms or at the little tables in the streets of place=
s
which "take care of one's thirsts."



 Hunger's protagonist barely eats--but he does drink when he can
prodigiously of the public waters in fountains, and suck on the water which
remains inside even slivers of wood And Choukri's young man is also one
driven by thirst, thirst in the heat and light and stone dust that
eventually leads him via these veilings" into the places where he finds the
beginning off the journey into the Unknown.

       For how is an illiterate young man starving in a colonialist country
to find anything but by such a means as thirst--for an oasis, yet not an
isolated one--the --for in the cafes are gathered people who drink and read
and write.  One does see them, these examples, this man writing others
letters in the "office" in a corner of the stony street.   The "family of
writers"=97which Choukri wants to join, to be part of a world which is apar=
t
from yet still a part of the world which has led him to seeing writing as a
way of "bridging worlds"=97and languages=97to see life as it were "from the

Not quite true Robin as they we were definitely reading Hardy-the-Novelist
when I did my degree in '88 - I know this because I've still got the mental
bruises of having to read Jude the Obscure - arrgghhh (it ran neck and neck
in sheer awfulness with Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter). Despite a fairly
adventurous poetics programme I can't remember Hardy- the-Poet figuring.  I
think the blockbuster films
of Hardy's novels plus the ghastly concept of now having a 'Hardy country'
for the tourism industry has put Hardy the Novelist back in pole position -
at least with the general public.

Possibly I exaggerate a little, Geraldine.

Though I'm surprised Hardy-the-Novelist was still running in degree courses
as late as 88.

But there would be a shift at *some point -- difficult to see Donald Davie
or Tom Paulin taking Hardy-the-Novelist seriously.

And nobody should *ever be made to read Jude the Oscure, and I doubt if
anyone would willingly read it twice.

Because once is too many.

[Mind you, thinking of this, most of my teaching experience was at
Loughborough, so with John Lucas in charge, natch there would be a focus on
Hardy-the-Poet.  Unintentional bias on my part, mibee ...  But I stand by
the point about Larkin creating an audience for Hardy's poetry.]

It's important that you book your room as soon as possible, as the
Chicago Marathon is taking place October 12.  (We only discovered this
convergence recently, after we'd already booked the featured
readers.)

A Visitor's Guide for the Beat Symposium is pasted below, with a list
of nearby hotels.  Columbia College Chicago is located downtown, in
the heart of the city's South Loop neighborhood, and is easily
accessible from these hotels by foot or cab.  All major subway/El
trains come into the South Loop, too, so it's possible to book hotels
in other parts of the city and make it to the Symposium without
difficulty.

Mention that you're a Columbia College Chicago visitor to receive
discounted rates at some of these hotels.  It's crucial to book as
soon as possible because of the marathon.

VISITOR'S GUIDE:  THE BEAT GENERATION SYMPOSIUM

Airports:
O'Hare Airport (western suburbs) and Midway Airport (southern suburbs)
are the two airports servicing the Chicgao area.  They are approximately
equidistant from Columbia College.

Transportation:
 >From Midway Airport, take the Orange Line elevated train to Adams
Street. From there, walk south on Wabash until you reach Congress
Parkway. From O'Hare Airport, take the Blue Line to La Salle. Walk East
on Congress (away from the Chicago Stock Exchange Building, which you'll
see upon emerging from the subway) until you reach Wabash (about 5 short
blocks).

Use www.transitchicago.com's free Trip Planner service to plan the rest
of your trips while you're here. Simply enter your starting point and
destination, and Trip Planner gives you detailed directions. As of 2008,
fares are $2.00 one-way with a $0.25 transfer. Each train station has
kiosks where you can buy transit cards and reload them (cash only). The
Blue Line and Red Line run 24/7; the other lines stop running for a few
hours late at night.

Taxis are available throughout the city. From Midway Airport to the
English Department, cab fare would be approximately $25 and from O'Hare
Airport cab fare would be approximately $50. If you need to call a cab,
call (773) or (312) TAXICAB.

Metra Trains service suburban areas.  Visit www.metrarail.com for an

and maybe Biden is the monster from the deep that has truly sunk
Obama into the  mundane. It's really hard for me to watch yet another
generation of youthful political energy and optimism sacrificed by
this extraordinarily inept decision. How on earth can the choice of
Biden be sustained under the banner of change? Someone better
enlighten me.

so i've been thinking about poetry, art, & the difficulties of  actually making a living exclusively through art. & when i think of poets, i mean those who can make a living without the benefit of a teaching position. & i also mean 1st rate poets. of recent contemporaries, only Ginsberg comes to mind. Bukowski had his moments, and i consider him an important minor writer, but i don't consider him the equal to Ginsberg as a poet. not by a long shot.

of the still living, only Merwin fits the bill. i'm not sure if he's ever had a full time teaching position. i'm not aware of him ever having had a teaching position. he's tutored. he's done translations, & he's won the McArthur grant, if I'm not mistaken. Unlike Auster, Merwin never claimed to have made a cute wager concerning how he made his living.

"(Might one not ask and have not and do not millions
continually do so-- if a woman has far less opportunity, far less time, (fo=
r
time more than money even is required for Inventing Solitude)-"

David,

Does this not mean that the basic activity of poetry is not production (of =
a
poem), but *a consumption* of time. I write about this in "Is Poetry a Job,
Is Writing a Product."

This is another great exploratory piece, with its stunning and thrilling
jumps and connections David is capable of and which are, basically, new
kinds of poems. Thank you. How long did it take you to write it? All your
life?

Following your father/son (and Cassandra and responsible male/ Obama)
insights, I thought again of Auster's movie *Smoke*. The same
father/son/responsibility theme enters the movie: a young black kid enters
the hero's apartment (a space engulfed, an emptiness saturated with the
grief of having lost a female companion). An immediate tension develops
because the kid also intrudes into  the hero's space "of solitude, a
separate room in the apartment where the hero writes. A series of
negotiations develops, initially as short tempered instructions by the hero=
,
to set the rules so that the boy and writing can exist in the same space. I
am fascinated by the reasonance of all this in relation to Obama's speech
yesterday where the idea of "responsibility" appears (of fathers towards
their sons, which Jesse Jackson thought worthy of castration)  and might be
the single word which finally turns this election to the side of Obama.
Obama is also a writer (writing about his absent father, as Auster in The
Invention of Solitude. "Political speech" becomes his "genre detective
novel" through which responsibility is fused with writing, in both "stock"
forms being basically transformed.

*Smoke* contains a second, alternative kind of solitude/writing, the Harvey
Keitel character shooting photos of the same spot every day through a numbe=
r
of years -an activity the very essence of which is time, *its consumption*,
where the ultimate discovery/restoration this *passage,* this
*trip*contains is death (the figure of the lost wife passing through
it). How does
the Keitel character unite his *writing* with responsibility? Through *smok=
e
*, in the movie a magical, subversive activity which involves the
trafficking in Cuban cigars (Interestingly, the Stockard Channing character
who plays Keitel's ex-wife and whom he uses the Cuban cigar money to help
wears an eye-patch, the very image of piracy). "Responsible" writing is
transformed into a subversive, magical one (indirectly still involving a
family). In my view, *Smoke* is revisiting the Pascalian bet. On the one
hand, one has the linear plot, the hero helping the black kid find and join
his absent father. On the other hand, one has smoke, through a series of
superimposed photographs, a repetitive, *useless* act involving the
consumption of time, a trip of re-discovery of the lost wife, the mourning
whose absence is the core of the movie. If this analysis is true, then in *
Smoke* Auster is returning, to use David's terms, to that female/Cassadra
side of poetry which Auster so deftly ran away from in *Hand To Mouth* and
the deep mourning in *Smoke* is the mourning for that fateful decision.
Literally and symbolically, in *Smoke* Auster is saying that the language o=
f
film may become the means to a new synthesis where the visual and the verba=
l
(responsibility and subversive female spirit) become unified in a complete
new way where a poem is a film and a film a poem. It is a synthesis -the
possibility of a truly new form- poets should be interested in.

Subject:      The Death of Ilhan Berk (1918-2008)
MIME-Version: 1.0

The great Turkish poet Ilhan Berk died the day before yesterday. His poetry
in English translation can be found in *Selected Poems by Ilhan Berk, edite=
d
by Onder Ot=E7u* (Talisman Books, Jersey City, 2004) and in *Eda: An Anthol=
ogy
of Contemporary Turkish Poetry, edited by Murat Nemet-Nejat* (Talisman
Books, Jersey City, 2004).

Here is a passage from my introduction to the *Eda* anthology discussing
Ilhan Berk's poetry and its relation to other Turkish poets. The passage
ends with his poem "Garden":


"Though associated with The Second New, Berk's poetry has nothing to do wit=
h
depth, everything to do with motion. Born before S=FCreya and Ayhan and sti=
ll
alive =96that is to say, writing more than sixty years- his work assimilate=
s
the poetic movements from Hikmet and Veli on. The great pleasure of Berk's
poetry is to follow his agile mind weaving in and out of historical time
periods, following the contours of crooked streets in Galata, naming names,
or stopping at a now defunct whore house listening to the voices of women
there. In "Garlic," ostensibly a prose piece, time as a layered entity with
past and present disappears and becomes a unified place of the spirit, of
mind play.

    In Berk, S=FCreya's sense of unexpected connections and Ayhan's awarene=
ss
that Istanbul is a mongrel accumulation floating on a sea of history are
unified into a flat tapestry of pure motion, an irreligious but still
spiritual  space where splits associated with time are abandoned. Berk's
poetry reveals no secrets but lights everything it touches with its
inflections.

    From the 1950's on,  everything Berk writes is associated with his "lon=
g
poetic line." To understand what that line is, one can go to a Hashim poem,
the first poet in the anthology: "In a grieving perfection's insomnia..."Wh=
y
is perfection associated with insomnia? Insomnia is the most intense state
of wakefulness (consciousness) because it is nearest sleep. This is a
poetics of limits,  a motion of the mind towards zero, the unreachable, the
forbidden.

    Berk's long poetic line approaches the limit of prose, growing in
intensity doing so. A lot of Berk's best poems look like prose; they are
continuous strips of poetic line moving towards and away from a limit. Here
lies the essential paradox of Berk and Turkish poetry. He seems to be the
most pagan, least religious of poets, as Turkish poetry rarely is about
religion. But an irreducible spiritual essence runs through both of them, a=
s
it does in Veli or Hashim or Hikmet or S=FCreya or Iskender or G=FCntan....=
 It
is buried in the agglutinative cadences of Turkish, a language of affection=
s
inflected by proximity to a movable, elusive verb =96a dance towards and aw=
ay
from limits. The sensual, metaphysical and historical are unified in this
movement =96the eda- a continuum of earth, water and human habitation:


                                             Wall
                                             Door

"I am in the middle of a garden that looks like 444."

GARDEN

The house, 'vertical creature'.
You enter the house through the garden.
But the garden does not know the house.
Nor perhaps the other way around...

How beautiful!
What's more, the world of objects is like this.
They all gather to enjoy the unknown.
The garden's choice has been freedom, from the very beginning.

It has the capacity of eclipsing the house,
however conspicuous the house might make itself to show off.

- I am in the garden, says the garden.

It has its own language, history, geography.

We have also come to realize that it has some peculiar thoughts of its own.
(Actually, it is through these peculiar thoughts that it takes shape.)

I SEE THE HOUSE AFTER I LEAVE THE GARDEN BEHIND.

To compare the garden and the house: the garden is wide open in the face of
the close-mouthed, conservative quality the house characterizes (permeated
with that despotism which wounded it long ago).

THE GARDEN DETESTS CALENDESTINE OPERATIONS.

Full of sound and voices.
Its face overflowing into the street.
Offering a female reading.


To compare them, it is sexual (what is not?)

THE HOUSE IS MORE AS IF TO DIE IN THAN TO LIVE IN.

Oh garden, the muddy singer of the street.

"Dirty Child."

Hello gardens, here I am!  (1997, trans. by Onder Ot=E7u)"

Subject:      FW: Rave review of THE REALITY STREET BOOK OF SONNETS
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

Chris Goode=92s review of  The Reality Street Book of Sonnets, which you =
can
buy from http://freespace.virgin.net/reality.street/ or by snail mail =
from=20
Reality Street, 63 All Saints Street, Hastings, East Sussex TN34 3BN UK
for fifteen pounds =96 add something for postage =96 Google the title =
and check
the website.

[And yes, Goode is right =96 is really is an absolutely terrific book.]

This is from Chris Goode=92s Blog.=20

Look! It's The Reality Street Book of Sonnets. I thought I might die =
before
it finally emerged from its epic pupation; but in its own good time in =
the
end it arrived -- and once again I thought I might die: the range, the
chutzpah, the sheer bloody excitingness of this anthology is
heart-attack-inducing. I'm a sucker for anthologies, but this is =
something
else entirely. Someone over at Dennis's blog reminded me today of the =
phrase
"all killer, no filler", and that sums this book up perfectly: there is
literally nothing here that doesn't abundantly reward the reader's =
attention
and imagination. The compass of the anthology is the life of the sonnet =
from
1945 up to about this time yesterday (culminating with the gobsmackingly
brilliant Justin Katko and Sophie Robinson), and its scope easily
accommodates plenty of visual and soundtext work as well as exhilarating
adventures with both the cumbersome baggage of the form and its =
startling
elasticity and mutability. Watch me ride half a league into the valley =
of
individiousness as I choose some favourite stuff: Tim Atkins's droll and
weirdly poignant refashionings of Petrarch; a ravishing sequence of
brush-stroke sonnets from David Miller, which effectively reframe for me
everything of Miller's that I've ever read; Giles Goodland's sublimely =
funny
and disconcerting compositions from found documentary sources; and Jen
Bervin's reticently poised and lyrically reverberant writings-through of
Shakespearean phantoms. One of the best things about those four examples =
is
that nothing else here is not at least nine-elevenths as good as them. =
And
it's a pleasure also to see more familiar sonnets (from Adrian Clarke, =
Tony
Lopez, Ken Edwards, Peter Jaeger, Peter Manson...) in this context and =
this
company, where everything folds itself outwards like a house party =
spilling
onto the lawn outside.
=A0
Worth noting, I think, in passing -- though it's touched on briefly in =
the
excellent introduction -- that one of the centres of gravity to this
anthology is the Writers Forum workshop, instituted by Bob Cobbing and =
these
days helmed by Clarke and Lawrence Upton. At least a dozen of these here
poets, probably many more, have or have had strong links to that =
workshop,
which meets fortnightly through most of the year, these days at the =
Betsey
Trotwood pub in Farringdon. A book like this brings home the importance =
of
that meeting-place, and of its longevity not least. It was sitting in =
that
circle that I first heard Jeff Hilson, the editor of this astonishing =
volume
and himself one of the most brilliant poets I know, read from his Bird =
Bird
-- just about my favourite thing to have ever happened. I really want to
start going to the workshop again, but I'm sick of making the =
resolution,
only to have it swamped by my own disastrousness.
=A0
Anyway, I don't think I can recommend this anthology any more highly =
than I
already have; if you think I can, then please take it as read that I do. =
I
definitely can't think of a better or more inspiring introduction to =
what
remains to be done in your life, starting now.

I'm not sure how many folks on the list have heard audio of the infamous =
Charles Olson reading in which he asks Harvard scholar, Harry Levin, to =
leave the room, but... see my post about the reading, and listen to it =
here:

http://donshare.blogspot.com/2008/08/poets-voice-charles-olson.html

Enjoy, and be grateful to the folks at the Charles Olson estate, as well =
as to my former colleagues at Harvard, for making this possible!

i haven't verified this, but a professor once told me that the last
poet to make a living from the "publication and sales" of poetry
(this does NOT include lecture fees, readings, poetry-related
teaching gigs, etc.) was Alfred Tennyson. But then, there can't have
been too many to do so, at any time in history, right?

Steve,

There is nothing cute about *Word To Mouth*. It has a significant place in
Auster's total work, as I tried to show in my last post

I think Merwin comes from a prominent family and is independently wealthy. I
agree with your distinction between poets who make a living out of their
poetry and those who do it from teaching.

I am not sure the distinction between minor and major is relevant here. Who
is to know? There are a many poets I personally know who do not teach, at
least not in a college or university: Joel Lewis, Basil King, Martha King,
Kimberly Lyons, Ron Silliman, David Chirot, Gary Sullivan, Nada Gordon,
Elinor Naueen, Maggie Dubris, Bob Hershon, Simon Pettet, Ed Friedman, Tony
Towle, Anne Tadros, Stacy Szymaszek, Anselm Berrigan. The list goes on and
on. On the other hand, it is informative to inquire if these poets' works
are different from the poets who teach at a university, *specifically* in a
Masters of Fine Department. For instance, Bruce Andrews teaches I think
philosophy, which is not the same thing.

Ciao,

Murat

I do have to laugh--I am a poet, but I teach at a technical (vocational/tra=
de school) college. I do teach writing and literature,=A0and my students ar=
e a very interesting group. Several days ago, one of my students mentioned =
that he had attended MCAD (Minneapolis College of Art and Design), but foun=
d all the students too "yuppied," and he realized that he also needed to ma=
ke a living. So, here he is, back at a small public technical college, lear=
ning how to be a autobody specialist!=20
=A0
I won't even get into my personal perspectives because I don't think that I=
 have always been fair to my colleagues and I certainly have not been open =
about my poetry.=20

!!!Very sad news!!!

EDA gave me a chance to read Ilhan Berk.
Doubtlessly, a great poet by any yardstick shaped by any geography...

True, we live in gardens that really don't know the house.
An ancient house, that is.....

Subject: The Death of Ilhan Berk (1918-2008)


The great Turkish poet Ilhan Berk died the day before yesterday. His poetry
in English translation can be found in *Selected Poems by Ilhan Berk, edited
by Onder Otçu* (Talisman Books, Jersey City, 2004) and in *Eda: An Anthology
of Contemporary Turkish Poetry, edited by Murat Nemet-Nejat* (Talisman
Books, Jersey City, 2004).

Here is a passage from my introduction to the *Eda* anthology discussing
Ilhan Berk's poetry and its relation to other Turkish poets. The passage
ends with his poem "Garden":


"Though associated with The Second New, Berk's poetry has nothing to do with
depth, everything to do with motion. Born before Süreya and Ayhan and still
alive –that is to say, writing more than sixty years- his work assimilates
the poetic movements from Hikmet and Veli on. The great pleasure of Berk's
poetry is to follow his agile mind weaving in and out of historical time
periods, following the contours of crooked streets in Galata, naming names,
or stopping at a now defunct whore house listening to the voices of women
there. In "Garlic," ostensibly a prose piece, time as a layered entity with
past and present disappears and becomes a unified place of the spirit, of
mind play.

    In Berk, Süreya's sense of unexpected connections and Ayhan's awareness
that Istanbul is a mongrel accumulation floating on a sea of history are
unified into a flat tapestry of pure motion, an irreligious but still
spiritual  space where splits associated with time are abandoned. Berk's
poetry reveals no secrets but lights everything it touches with its
inflections.

    From the 1950's on,  everything Berk writes is associated with his "long
poetic line." To understand what that line is, one can go to a Hashim poem,
the first poet in the anthology: "In a grieving perfection's insomnia..."Why
is perfection associated with insomnia? Insomnia is the most intense state
of wakefulness (consciousness) because it is nearest sleep. This is a
poetics of limits,  a motion of the mind towards zero, the unreachable, the
forbidden.

    Berk's long poetic line approaches the limit of prose, growing in
intensity doing so. A lot of Berk's best poems look like prose; they are
continuous strips of poetic line moving towards and away from a limit. Here
lies the essential paradox of Berk and Turkish poetry. He seems to be the
most pagan, least religious of poets, as Turkish poetry rarely is about
religion. But an irreducible spiritual essence runs through both of them, as
it does in Veli or Hashim or Hikmet or Süreya or Iskender or Güntan.... It
is buried in the agglutinative cadences of Turkish, a language of affections
inflected by proximity to a movable, elusive verb –a dance towards and away
from limits. The sensual, metaphysical and historical are unified in this
movement –the eda- a continuum of earth, water and human habitation:


                                             Wall
                                             Door
                                          Window
                                  +_________________

                                          HOME

"I am in the middle of a garden that looks like 444."
                                                           Cansever

GARDEN

The house, 'vertical creature'.
You enter the house through the garden.
But the garden does not know the house.
Nor perhaps the other way around...

How beautiful!
What's more, the world of objects is like this.
They all gather to enjoy the unknown.
The garden's choice has been freedom, from the very beginning.

It has the capacity of eclipsing the house,
however conspicuous the house might make itself to show off.

- I am in the garden, says the garden.

It has its own language, history, geography.

We have also come to realize that it has some peculiar thoughts of its own.
(Actually, it is through these peculiar thoughts that it takes shape.)

I SEE THE HOUSE AFTER I LEAVE THE GARDEN BEHIND.

To compare the garden and the house: the garden is wide open in the face of
the close-mouthed, conservative quality the house characterizes (permeated
with that despotism which wounded it long ago).

THE GARDEN DETESTS CALENDESTINE OPERATIONS.

Full of sound and voices.
Its face overflowing into the street.
Offering a female reading.


To compare them, it is sexual (what is not?)

THE HOUSE IS MORE AS IF TO DIE IN THAN TO LIVE IN.

Oh garden, the muddy singer of the street.

"Dirty Child."

Hello gardens, here I am!  (1997, trans. by Onder Otçu)"

I just returned from Copenhagen. When I asked poet Niels Hav what he "does for a living," he replied "write poetry." Assuming there was a language problem, I tried to clarify be asking him what he does to pay the bills. He told me the state pays him to write. Other poets (it was a dinner party) chimed in and acknowledged Hav: apparently some artists are provided living wages just to be artists. And though Niels' work probably falls under the "school of quietude" banner, it's still a fairly remarkable state of things..Of course, as they acknowledged, income tax is extremely high (by our standards) but as one poet said to me, "It's a trade off. We choose to [urchase security, choose to support arts and artists." He acknowledged that Denmark's relatively small size had to be taken in as a factor...

Today, poets who make a living from poetry (and not from teaching) can only=
 do so through the combination of sales, readings, and fellowships. Ashbery=

Murat,
Oh yes - lots - probably most . The Bronte sisters, I love Wuthering Heights
but oddly enough so many poets I know hate it - but they all love Jane
Eyre - why's that then. Discuss!)  George Eliot (one of the greatest prose
stylists within the conventional narrative format), Henry James, Melville,
Edith Wharton.  The two I mentioned as not liking stick in my mind because
if you labour through a novel and you end up not liking it that's a lot of
time spent not liking something so you tend to be harsher than you would if
you spent 5 minutes on a poem you don't like.

Hello Peter,

It may be a rave review but it's so London-centric it  gives a totally
distorted picture of what the book is about and I think Chris inadvertently
makes it sound rather parochial.  It's not all London poets emanating from
Writers Forum workshops (excellent poets though they are) but a selection of
British, American, Canadian, Australian  and New Zealand poets. He doesn't
even mention the maestro Ted Berrigan nor other prominent Americans like Lyn
Hejinian, Kathleen Fraser, Anselm Hollo, Juliana Spahr and  more.  An odd
rave review which doesn't really take the book on outside Chris's own circle
of associates which I find a tad misleading. But that's the swing and
roundabouts of blogs for you!

Subject: FW: Rave review of THE REALITY STREET BOOK OF SONNETS


Chris Goode's review of  The Reality Street Book of Sonnets, which you can
buy from http://freespace.virgin.net/reality.street/ or by snail mail from
Reality Street, 63 All Saints Street, Hastings, East Sussex TN34 3BN UK
for fifteen pounds - add something for postage - Google the title and check
the website.

[And yes, Goode is right - is really is an absolutely terrific book.]

This is from Chris Goode's Blog.

Look! It's The Reality Street Book of Sonnets. I thought I might die before
it finally emerged from its epic pupation; but in its own good time in the
end it arrived -- and once again I thought I might die: the range, the
chutzpah, the sheer bloody excitingness of this anthology is
heart-attack-inducing. I'm a sucker for anthologies, but this is something
else entirely. Someone over at Dennis's blog reminded me today of the phrase
"all killer, no filler", and that sums this book up perfectly: there is
literally nothing here that doesn't abundantly reward the reader's attention
and imagination. The compass of the anthology is the life of the sonnet from
1945 up to about this time yesterday (culminating with the gobsmackingly
brilliant Justin Katko and Sophie Robinson), and its scope easily
accommodates plenty of visual and soundtext work as well as exhilarating
adventures with both the cumbersome baggage of the form and its startling
elasticity and mutability. Watch me ride half a league into the valley of
individiousness as I choose some favourite stuff: Tim Atkins's droll and
weirdly poignant refashionings of Petrarch; a ravishing sequence of
brush-stroke sonnets from David Miller, which effectively reframe for me
everything of Miller's that I've ever read; Giles Goodland's sublimely funny
and disconcerting compositions from found documentary sources; and Jen
Bervin's reticently poised and lyrically reverberant writings-through of
Shakespearean phantoms. One of the best things about those four examples is
that nothing else here is not at least nine-elevenths as good as them. And
it's a pleasure also to see more familiar sonnets (from Adrian Clarke, Tony
Lopez, Ken Edwards, Peter Jaeger, Peter Manson...) in this context and this
company, where everything folds itself outwards like a house party spilling
onto the lawn outside.

Worth noting, I think, in passing -- though it's touched on briefly in the
excellent introduction -- that one of the centres of gravity to this
anthology is the Writers Forum workshop, instituted by Bob Cobbing and these
days helmed by Clarke and Lawrence Upton. At least a dozen of these here
poets, probably many more, have or have had strong links to that workshop,
which meets fortnightly through most of the year, these days at the Betsey
Trotwood pub in Farringdon. A book like this brings home the importance of
that meeting-place, and of its longevity not least. It was sitting in that
circle that I first heard Jeff Hilson, the editor of this astonishing volume
and himself one of the most brilliant poets I know, read from his Bird Bird
-- just about my favourite thing to have ever happened. I really want to
start going to the workshop again, but I'm sick of making the resolution,
only to have it swamped by my own disastrousness.

Anyway, I don't think I can recommend this anthology any more highly than I
already have; if you think I can, then please take it as read that I do. I
definitely can't think of a better or more inspiring introduction to what
remains to be done in your life, starting now.

The Plastic Exploding Inevitable
an installation by Christine Wertheim

Right Window at ATA
992 Valencia at 21st Street, San Francisco

Opening:  September 7, 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.
At 6:00 Christine Wertheim will talk and answer questions about the project

Installation continues through October 3

Coral reefs the world over are dying faster than rain forests. In
homage to these vanishing wonders, Margaret and Christine Wertheim of
the Institute For Figuring instigated a project to crochet a woolen
reef, an effort that now engages women around the globe. This
collective testimony also celebrates the strange hyperbolic geometry
of the oceanic realm. As it has grown the reef has spawned, dividing
and growing into multiple sub-reefs, each with its own unique ecology
of corals, anemones, kelps and other sea life.

In September Right Window will be showing the Plastic Exploding
Inevitable (PEI), a spawn of the Toxic Reef, aka Bikini Atoll, made
from plastic bags and other refused and recycled materials.  The most
psychedelic of the Institute for Figuring reefs, the Plastic
Exploding Inevitable features irradiant pink "sand," miniature white
plastic spires, a grove of wine-glass trees, and a gorgeous reef
panorama painted on a take-out box by Alicia Escott.  In the decades
since Warhol created his Exploding Plastic Inevitable, the multimedia
component of the Silver Factory, the words he strung together have
taken on a more sinister edge, and Wertheim's installation helps us
parse this new reality.  In the North Pacific, for example, there is
a gyre of floating plastic debris roughly the size of Texas.

Contributors to the Plastic Exploding Inevitable include:
Kathleen Greco, Sarah Simons, Evelyn Hardin, Alicia Escott, Margaret
Wertheim and Christine Wertheim.

The Right Window at ATA is curated by Dodie Bellamy for the month of
September, 2008.

When she is not crocheting reef items, Christine has a full-time job
in the Department of Critical Studies at the California Institute of
the Arts, where she teaches experimental writing and feminism. She is
also an experimental poet and writer whose work deals with the
intersection of language and logic. Christine's first book of poetry,
+'Ime-S-pace, was published in 2007 by Les Figues Press, LA.

For some years now I've been studying and finding methods in different medi=
a
with which to create what i call "The New Extreme Experimental American
Poetry & Arts."

Futurism (the 20th Century's first) and Dada were avant-gardes focused on
the interelationships among the military and "art" uses of the term
"avant-garde."  Futurism, to celebrate "War, the world's hygiene" and Dada,
using its NO to War as a springboard to the NO of everything which the
immense War Machine Culture  produces.  "Anti War Anti Art Anti Poetry --
For quite some time, the "avant-garde" has been separated from its originar=
y
interconnection with the military and War, War Machines, War Culture--as
though "the avant-garde" occurs "at a distance" from the Theater of War,
which is Artaud's theater of Cruelty run completely amok, while the audienc=
e
looks on


In times like these with multiple Wars being conducted by the US, as well a=
s
those it funds and arms and in turn is affected by itself, why not re-join
the military and arts in examining what is occurring in a culture where the
language and images have also run amok?

       And why not, while we' re at, examine the appearance of not only eve=
r
more censorship, distranslations, forgeries, propaganda-running amok, a
"plague" as Artaud calls it---that "Avian Flu" lurking in the peripheries o=
f
awareness, language and terror---but also of Torture as the ultimate
expression of "forcing one to speak," even when knowing the information
produced may well not be true at all.  For with torture, what counts is tha=
t
the person spoke, confessed,  betrayed,as no matter what they say is alread=
y
a "confession," a betrayal, and so, as a Russian artist has pointed out:
"Language is a fascism not because it censors, but because it forces one to
speak."

"As usual," Pier Paulo Pasolini noted in his famous "Glow Worm" essay, "the
only thing we had to go on was language."

It is in the symptoms of language that Pasolini begins his researches and
investigations into what is happening, that is making for example, the glow
worms disappear where they had been not so  very long ago at all such
numerous and beloved presences..


In the first lines of his Introduction to *Torture: Cancer of Democracy
France and Algeria 1954-62*, Pierre Vidal-Naquet asks


"Can a great nation, liberal by tradition, allows its institutions, its
army, and its system of justice to degenerate over the span of a few years
as a result of the use of torture, and by its concealment and deception of
such a vital issue call the whole Western concept of human dignity and the
rights of the individual into question?"The forcing to speak of torture, of
language as a fascism, begins to "push the envelope" of what is said and
written, in terms of what is being done that must be concealed. The
"transparency of language" sought by the public, is replaced with the
"opacity of language," a hard, smooth surface which functions as a kind of
"black hole" of meanings, facts, and blurs the borders of fictions,
fantasies, lies, dreams and a kind of Horoscope that furnishes Propaganda
with a sense of the Inevitability of Events which portrays the "ones in
charge" as being on the side always of the Deus ex Machina.


The adoption of a God Apparatus within the functioning of the terms
necessary to "promote" what is designated as "Reality," enables the Leaders
to place themselves "beyond questioning," while creating the Right to
question anyone, anywhere, anytime, on the entire planet.

A word--"terrorists, Al-Queda"--points--and a person vanishes, "detained
with out charge for an indefinite period"s stretching into years. This
"Black Hole" effect of the Leaders' Language uses words not only on persons=
,
places, events, but on words themselves also.  Words that "are pointed out"
are vanished, "tortured," "betrayed."and if allowed to be released, returne=
d
in a severely mangled and "shadow of their former selves" form.


As Vidal-Nacquet points out, once this process is begun "outside the
country" by the troops, police paramilitary organizations and mercenaries
employed by a system, that "cancer" begins to spread "back" into the countr=
y
of origin of the initial decision making and orders which sent this plague
out into the  world. (As Artaud entitles a great essay:  "The Theater and
the Plague")


The "problem " of language then becomes how to split words which mean the
same things into what are separate entities, when judged as actions.  Yet i=
s
the splinting simply a ruse, or the making of cracks in language which begi=
n
to "bring down the whole system?"  The double talk of double standards,
hyper-texts of hypocrises--the practice of denial which creates Walls
separating and partitioning parts of one's own mind and being from others,
in order to function as a "rational, civilized being," whose society may
sanction horrific things, but are these not neccessary means to the greater
end when faced with the Terminality of Evil?


Vidal-Nacquet cites Thucydides, in Book Three of the Peloponnese Wars, when
the Greeks have to confront and conceal a massacre committed, a War crime.

   **

In *The Peloponnesian War*, Book 3, Thucydides states:
"To fit in with the change of events, words, too, had to change. What used
to be thought of as a thoughtless act of aggression was now regarded as the
courage one would expect to find in a party member; to think of the future
and wait was merely another way of saying one was a coward, any idea of
moderation was just an attempt to disguise one's unmanly character; ability
to understand a question from all sides meant one was totally unfitted for
action; frenzied violence came to be considered an attribute of a real man.


"The ability to understand a question from all sides" in this situation
needs to be partitioned, separated, made to exist in carefully
compartmentalized ways so that what is happening will not be seen, and the
image created of what is occurring, will be all that is "seen, heard and
read."  The separation of language from  a material actuality and its
production as a form of artifice of "material language"  used for the
purpose of substituting a "spectacle" for "events on the ground" in such a
way that one and one's allies are always Right, Good, Democratic and Just,
and the Other is always Wrong, Evil, Un-Democratic and Unjust.  This
reduction of complex terms bit by bit structurally, is to condense,to  make
one the many, to alter or remove meanings.  Orwell demonstrates these as
among the purposes of "New speak" in the Appendix to his novel 1984.

This creates situations that are happening "right before one's very eyes
" which one is "not to see," and so doesn't.  For if one did one might ask
questions, rather than doing what fiction readers are supposed to do:
"accept what is written in a willing suspension of disbelief."

This separation allows one not to see that what is happening "there" and
"here" are related, and in the first place what is happening depends not on
what is being done, but by who.  This means that the same word has its
opposite meaning depending on with whom it is "associated," and what the
"context" of its placement is within the new order of sentences, phrases,
names and descriptions.


Today, as Hurricane Gustav may or not hit New Orleans on the third
anniversary of Katrina, the Republicans are getting ready to hold their
convention , something which would appear to be done with the most
unmitigated gall.  Yet, the way that New Orleans is being presented for the
most part is as a "New City" which is "now prepared" for the storm, though
the levees, still, are not considered really high enough.  Why a nation
would let, despite years of warnings, one of its major port cities and a hu=
b
of its oil industries, be destroyed--was al to easy to see three years ago,
and now is trying to be concealed.

     Everything in the article follows the examples and histories set down
so harrowinlgy and in such great and indelible detail in Naomi Klein"s The
Shock Doctrine.

   New Orleans, one can see, is being turned into not only a "New City, but
something more like a "settlement," an "outpost" of a kind of
re-colonization of many areas of the USA, turning them into gated
communities with their own entertainment set ups and businesses connected b=
y
power grids, while the rest of the population, conveniently without
electrictiy and off line, is "disappeared" from the "overall picture" of a
"steady recovery.

    One of the things that very much struck me in reading this is many of
the details and the words used for them, are almost identical to those used
to describe what is happening in the Occupied territories, and is being
funded to the tune of over 20 billion a year by the USA.  The article here
notes th same "ethnic cleansing" going on, with the same (American)
equipment being used, the bulldozers, cranes and trucks hauling away the
demolished homes and any sign of the original tenants.  Everything has been
altered--the school system, the transportation system, the entertainment an=
d
leisure systems of organization and presentation, the areas designated as
:off limits" to much of the remnantsof the survivors of Katrina.  The news
on tv even notes that this time around though there is no Super Bowl Dome
and other facilities as before with which to shelter the victims from
danger, there are "increased numbers of wel equipped buses, stocked with
food" with which to simply transport the undesirables out of the city,
permanently, no doubt, flung into a life time of itinerancy  among "interna=
l
refugee camps" and "temporary shelters."

    The artilce here also uses the terminology of "the right of return,"
which almost everyone knows will never happen for them.  The City has in
effect not only been Occupied, but taken over, every bit of earth, of water=
,
of light, taken away and privatized, leaving no room for those unwanted
Others who had created the city and its world famous culture to begin with.


In The Shcok Doctrine, Naomi Klein lists some of the huge number
ofcompanies, tehnolgoies, "show rooms," trade shows, products of security
and surveillance that have completely turned around the Israeli econ0omy
since 9/11 and made it the world's 4th largest exporter of military
equipment and technology, as well as the fourth largest military.  Huge US
funding of this has helped to bring these technologies to work in the areas
created by "disasater capitalism" like Katrrina and the Mexican Border.
Klein writes that the "wealthy New Orelans neighborhood of Audoban Place
needed its own police fioorce after Hurrican Katrina, it hired the Israeli
private secrurity firm Instinctive Shooting International."


While Immigration agents for the Mexican Border are trained by the Israeli
founded Goaln Group, Boeing and Elbit, the Israeli firm most involved in
building the 2.5 billion dollar Separation WWall, are being paid 2.5 billio=
n
dollars to create  the as yet non functional "virtaul fences" along the
US-Mexican borders which includes electronic sensors, unmanned aircraft,
surveillance cameras, and 1800 cameras.

Human rights organizations set up within the USA to deal with the explosion
in detainee arrests and camps describes their proliferation as "Gitmos
Across America."


As this article asks, what is Obama going to do about any of this?  His
speech at AIPAC and his total embrace of Israeli Policies in the Occupied
Territories is not a
bad sign" for Palestinians only, but for huge chunks of the American
population also.  Because that stance, that huge shift from his former
support of Palestinian rights, friendship with Edward Said and interest in
in a Just Peace rather than colonialism and ethnic cleansing, is being used
to reintroduce the same things into the USA under new names, new guises, as
Naomi Klein writes of, that are created by the Friedmanism Chicago School o=
f
Shock Doctrine Economics, which, curiously, in Latin America saw itself in
Anti-Artaudian  terms as "antibodies" fighting the "plagues" of "Leftism,"
"Indigenous rights," "solidarity among peoples," "oppostion to
privatization."

For once the strategies of the post 9/11 Patriot Act were adopted and
torture entered the equation, and with it the importation of the techniques
and methods and attitudes practiced and supported and funded by the US
abroad, the only way to prevent confrontiong these things is to deny
realitieson the ground in favor of images, and words in which the meanings
have been drained and shifted so that they no longer "stand for anything"
except a "place in a symbolic context that shifts by the hour."

The US may have a Black President who embraces and endorses Apartheid abroa=
d
and a similar practice within the US, that of the Katrina experience and
those of the detainees confined in ever worse condtions in ever more
"camps," not to mention toiling in the sub standard sub human conditons tha=
t
were found in Postville, Iowa and since in i several more sweat shops and
near slave labor condtions usualy thought to exist "only abroad" but are
right here, in nice little American towns.

The USA now leads the world in number and per entage both of civilans in
prison, and as well on any day ios running at an averge of 30,000 detainees
being held inside the US in prisons as smal a a village's to huge outdoor
"detention camps" surrounded by fences, walls, barbed wires, eletronic
warningng and surveillance.

 Recent talk of the return of the "Cold War Era" coupled with what many hav=
e
seen as a new form of McCarthyism in the post 9/11 era contribute to the
role of language/torture as a "forcing to speak," in which detainees,
prisoners, internal exiles and refugees are produced by disaster capitilism=
,
and much of the US becomes ever more open Ocupied Terrirtores Occupied by
the US Governement and its privatized forces. Corporate-State Fascism as
Mussolini defined it, in operation.  During the course of almost two years
of campaigining and billions spent--Obama has chnaged postions 180 degrees
and McCain as also.  The longer the elections go on the more they begin to
resemble of al things Bush Mach Two--the most unpopular Presdient ever, hea=
d
of the most disastrous regime ever.    Yet the American public is being tol=
d
it has a choice between "Change" and a "Maverick"--when in fact what is
going to win no matter who is elected is that new and ever more powerful
construction of the sytem--the Office of Presdient, whose powers are close
to that of a dictator-God.  This means that who ever occupies this place

   *The Disneyfication of New Orleans

*The city's redevelopment has ignored the needs of what was one of the
closest-knit black communities in America

*' -- - T*hree years after Hurricane Katrina, a more glamorous image of
black America is presenting itself to the world in the person of Barack
Obama. Meanwhile, in New Orleans, America's story of black urban poverty is
still unfolding, largely beneath the radar of the global media.

Three years after Hurricane Katrina, a more glamorous image of black Americ=
a
is presenting itself to the world in the person of Barack
Obama<http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama>.
Meanwhile, in New Orleans, America's story of black urban poverty is still
unfolding, largely beneath the radar of the global media.

In August and September 2005, areas like the largely black Lower Ninth
ward<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Ninth_Ward>,
almost entirely invisible to the hordes of tourists who flock to New Orlean=
s
every year, attracted worldwide sympathy as the levees
broke<http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/hurricanekatrina.=
usa>.
Now they have been all but forgotten. While tourists long ago repopulated
the French Quarter, 57% of New Orleans' black population =96 against 36% of
whites =96 have yet to return to the city. Many never will. This is because
since Katrina, developers have clubbed together with the authorities to
complete New Orleans' makeover into a playground for wealthy tourists.

As house prices soar and homelessness rises, the authorities are quietly
doing away with the city's remaining stocks of affordable housing in moves
that the UN has recently claimed constitute human rights violations. The
fact that these demolitions will overwhelmingly affect black people has led
some to call this ethnic
cleansing<http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2005/sep/24/usnews.hurrican=
es2005>
.

Looking back, these developments should come as no surprise. The sympathy
that met Katrina's immediate aftermath was short-lived. In August 2005 it
was poor African-American residents, statistically the least likely to have
the means to evacuate the stricken city, who bore the brunt of the storm
damage. Viewers all round the world watched in horrified fascination as
conditions in the convention centre and Superbowl deteriorated. News report=
s
did focus on the government's apparent abandonment of its own people, but a
hysterical and arguably racist undercurrent was almost compulsively drawn t=
o
rumours of rape and murder =96 nearly all of which turned out to be untrue.

As residents evacuated the city, and before the floodwaters had even
receded, the future of New Orleans and its residents was being spoken about
in no uncertain terms. "We finally cleaned up public housing in New
Orleans", declared Republican congressman Richard Baker soon after the
storm. "We couldn't do it. But God did." Alphonso Jackson, the then US
secretary of housing and urban development, made the racial implications of
the gentrification process perfectly clear when he predicted that the
reconstructed New Orleans would be a whiter city.

In the three years since, race and class stereotypes have paved the way for
New Orleans' so-called "revitalisation". "We don't need soap opera-watchers
right now", claimed the city council president, Oliver Thomas =96 perpetuat=
ing
the view that New Orleans' high unemployment rate can be tracked to
individual laziness as opposed to the systemic discrimination affecting mos=
t
of America's inner cities. At the same time, those same forces that demonis=
e
poor and particularly black families =96 for their apparent "dysfunction" =
=96
are actively preventing the regrouping of some of the most close-knit black
communities in the US.

The city is now in the process of phasing out the low-cost housing, public
transportation system, and public health facilities that have supported the
existence of low-income residents in New Orleans for decades. The US
department of housing and urban development and the housing authority of Ne=
w
Orleans say that they wish to de-concentrate poverty in areas that were
previously hotbeds for crime and drug abuse. Currently though, there are
only plans to replace one-third of the units available for low-income
renters. And as Audrey Stewart of the Loyola Law Clinic explains, the resul=
t
is:

... thousands and thousands of homeless people camping out, under bridges,
we have folks staying with relatives and friends =96 I see that all over my
neighbourhood, five, six, seven, eight people living in these tiny houses.
We have people getting kicked out of Fema [Federal Emergency Management
Agency] trailers with nowhere to go.

Many displaced New Orleans residents, black and white, are now calling for
the "right of return" =96 and are in the process creating a dynamic grassro=
ots
movement that threatens to disrupt the relative calm that has eased the
passage of the city's controversial reconstruction programme. This is just
the kind of movement that Barack Obama spent the first part of his career
organising for South
Side<http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1177.html>Chicago,
and it may turn out that his ability as president to respond to
this call proves decisive.

Obama has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration's recovery and
reconstruction programme, and his restoration plan for the region includes
housing displaced residents who wish to return to the city. This time last
year, Obama expressed concern that New Orleans would once again become the
scene of the nation's broken promises, and told residents, "I can promise
you this: I will be a president who wakes up every morning and goes to bed
every night with the future of this city on my mind." He said:

... racial discord, poverty, the old divisions of black and white, rich and
poor, it's time to leave that to yesterday.

But as the presidential campaign intensifies, Obama is increasingly under
pressure to "transcend race". If this insidious demand should persist into
an Obama presidency, it could seriously hinder a sustained focus on so
racially charged an event as Katrina and its disastrous aftermath. What's
certain is that the longer the world looks away, the more likely it is that
a Disneyfied "new" New Orleans will mean the loss of a city that boasts one
of the most complex cultural heritages in the world.

Three years on from the storm, during an election year that has focused
attention on a spectacular symbol of African American success, it seems tha=
t
once again, no one is looking in the direction of a black America that has
experienced only the rough end of the American dream.

To get into The Accidental Artist catastrophe site, it's best to fly in.
At one point years ago, it was possible to access the ground floor by
taking the front stairs; after these began their slow precession, it
seemed possible at times to wait, then climb when they were properly
positioned. Now, everything's different; the stairs are treacherous and
you might find yourself beneath the ground, drowning without a clue,
shapes falling, rotating, and shuddering around you, choke choke. Best as
I said to fly in. At another point months ago, that was easier to do,
flying ahead across the threshold, entering the space, it's 'turned to
stone' perhaps or deconstructed, or less treacherous, you could always be
assured of air. At yet another point weeks ago, better to fly above, how
high is that, above the space, the walls, the particles, the objects, the
translucencies, the part-objects, fly above I say, then descend, slowly
and carefully and to be sure unlosing oneself or winning oneself back,
unfacing oneself, descend certainly and unsurely, through an artificial
air that sounds like you're there, somewhere to be sure, the air is cold,
warm yourself, the air is cold. Then to the colder light and buffeting,
you might, you will, lose your footing, and I, myself, I can no longer
edit objects which escape, love to disappear, were told to disappear,
we're happy, we're not threatened, we're really happy, so much light and
color! so much sound. I make myself lose myself, Julu said, and I lose you
too.

Steve,

I am sure there are multiple other examples, including you. Mine was a free
association, and at one time I needed to stop. What does "within an academic
setting" mean? Is being educated a impediment to poetry? Non academic does
not mean anti-intellectual.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear Al(l),
I designed a Visual Poetry course which I have taught in 3 iterations at =
Rhode Island School of Design, the second time in collaboration with =
Graphic Design professor, Jan Baker.  This course is the first in a set of =
3 courses in Concrete Poetry.  The second is Sound Poetry, which I will be =
teaching for the first time this fall.  When that is up & running, I hope =
to turn to Digital/Kinetic, the third course in the sequence, which will =
probably be called something completely different by then as technology =
changes, maybe Molten Poetry!  The three courses aren't discrete.  As I =
approach sound, I understand more how visual it is.  Someone, maybe =
Michael Basinski, said that sound poetry always has strong visual =
announcement too.  Each course includes the others too.  I am happy to =
share my most recent Visual Poetry syllabus, & also Sound Poetry when it's =
done.

Steve, thanks for the rant ; ). The other Steve professes an adherence to p=
opular poets and poetry as shuttled from the "PhDs" to the many minds hustl=
ing their way through academia, which is just as valid, if not moreso; it's=
 indicative of the prevailing mindset in the uptight sanctions of groups su=
ch as this one.=20

Many fine poets are undegreed, and yet are awarded teaching positions; in f=
act, the late poet Carol Berge, after her 8-1/2 years of education/classes =
wound up with invites from 16 universities despite her failure to obtain a =
single letter beyond h.s.diploma. Yet here again we quibble, as many of her=
 contemporaries, some of whom are listed below, worked very hard for their =
doctorates etc.=20
(And need we remind ourselves that an MFA is the furthest one can advance i=
n the "field of creative writing"?)

Geraldine,

I asked the question because Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge left a a very
strong impression on me when I first read it forty years ago in Turkey (in
English). The Scarlet Letter also which I read about the same time. It blew
my mind.

An interesting connection: I read The Scarlet Letter at Robert College, the
American school In Istanbul. Robert College was built by missionaries who
came from Massachusetts. The poet, critic and publisher Ed Foster is writing
a fascinating book about 19th century Istanbul (and its surrounding areas up
to Iran) and a group of New England missionaries.

Reading Moby Dick for the first time was an excruciating experience for me,
but that reading changed my DNA as a writer. So nothing was wasted.

I share your enthusiasm for Middlemarch, which interestingly I also thought
is the best 19th century English novel. I also love Henry James, who was a
feminist, an American novelist and a great admirer of Hawthorne. My guess is
The House of Seven Gables is his favorite Hawthorne novel, the first few
pages of which anticipate I think James's later style.

I am so happy Jane Austen is not in your list.

Ciao,

Murat

                In Paul Collins' immensely entertaining and crazily
informative "Banvard's Folly  Thirteen Tales of People Who Didn't Change th=
e
World," a Chapter entitled  "He being dead Speaketh Not" (after the weirdly
eerie  and prophetic-sounding literalness of the words on the subject's
headstone) is devoted to Englishman Martin Tupper, at one point in the mid
19th century the best selling most famous poet ever yet to have written in
the Enlish language---and this in his own lifetime, to boot.  His works wer=
e
translated into over thrity languages, including Latin and Ojibway, and set
off on some outrageously warmly welcomed tours of the USA. Of course,
Francois Villon, reading this would think of a good warning from a poem of
his own:  "Warmly welcomed, rebuffed by everyone."

       Tupper, with currency adjustments allowed for, was in fact the first
poet ever to earn a million dollars by poetry alone. Tennyson barely manage=
d
to edge him out for Poet Laureate. Stranger still, within his own lifetime
he also became a poet who could no longer get published, not even
republished, the loser of all his fortune and beautiful estate due to poor
investements, and finished his days in poverty as the producer of an
incredible volume of out-of-print and forgotten or ridiculed verse.
                  As swiftly as a generation after his greatest triumphs,
Tupper's name furnished a new term for the ridicule reserved for and heaped
upon first-publication poets.  "A Tupper," was a smear indicating the
swiftness with which oblivion's waters would most assuredly be closing over
the neophyte's laurel crowned locks.  In his old age Tennyson was horrified
to find the epithet bestowed on himself also, and, as Collins writes:   "In
fact, so many poets were tarred this way that a new insult,'Tupperian,'
entered the language  It  can still be found in the the eternal rest of dea=
d
verbiage deep between the covers of the *Oxford English Dictionary.*
                 Collins notes that in one of the only articles about Tuppe=
r
written in the 20th Century, in a 1938 issue of the Times Literary
Supplement, the Poet's  incredible rise and just as dramatic fall is
tentativiely explained by the poetry's massive popularity making it also
too  easily tired of within a short time from sheer omnipresent
overeposure.  Think the of Mega Monster Music Hit that sells unholy numbers
of CDs, and before the year is out no one wil admit they ever liked it,  le=
t
alone owned a copy of it.  Trying to unload these once Biggest Sellers of
All Time in used stores is the equivalent for the would-be seller of being
seen by snickering others as a 'Tupper,' indeed.

            How different this in Arab culture, Ismaelia Al-Sadiq wrote of
last week in noting:
"
Yes, poetry is "popular" - ne essential - in the arab culture.  When Syrian
poet Nizar Qabbani died, his funeral in Damascus was attended by crowds
numbering at least in the 100s of thousands"

        A similar world wide outpouring--including non-Arabs also--attended
in the last two weeks the death and funeral of Mahmoud Darwish.


        A friend during the days of mourning for the poet,  forwarded
Mahmoud Darwish's "Edward Said," a beautiful "farewell to the poetry of
pain"

There is nothing quite like it after all, being the Unacknowledged
Legislators of the Human World! To triumph and suffer at the same time
produces a state of exquisite ecstasy, and is one not to be trifled with.
The "unacknowledgement" assures a fate Non-Tupperian, while the
"Legislators" holds out the hope of positions within society from which one
may, indeed, legislate.., in quite a wide variety of ways.

"The Green Monster of Jealousy reared its head . . . " for a moment with
regards to the better selling prose--but since when have prose writers been
found to be the "True" though "Unacknoweldged Legislators" of Humanity.
Though they complain of it, and turn it into an insult to their True
greatnness,   Poets after all have a Poetry Month--when has anyone heard of
such thing as even a National Prose Hour?

"Necessity is the motherfucker of invention," and so out of its
"marginalized status" in the Western world which a poet may indeed often
identity with, there is created its gigantic double, that Colossus known as
the Unacknowledged Legislator and who holds forth on fine days--handing dow=
n
sentences on the "enemies" and granting Laurel Wreaths to those with whom
the Legislators are in sympathy.

 And so one imagines this thoroughly Poetic Being to be not unlike Bunuell'=
s
Saint Simon of the Desert--hobnobbing with God and eating the occaisional
miraculously appearing air-borne bug. Carried away by his own rhetoric at
times, the good Saint wil commence Blessing Everything and indeed Speaking
as though He Were Indeed God--but Simon wil catch himself just in time, and
laugh at himself and wonder if after al he is just not completely nuts, and
the One Who has Led Him to This Postion--a Mad Being  Far Madder than
himself, who is after all, just a poor mortal. .

           In a sense, though no one may admit it, to be a Western Poet is
quite an enviable position! In a way it does indeed have the "best of both
worlds"--the "unackowledgement" and lack of pay which meansone is in deed a
"suffering artist," and at the same time that Legislative sense in using th=
e
language which unlocks the possibilities of other means of attaining power
and influence in some manner.

Murat,
I think you pinpoint the fact that a novel's impact on the reader is
strongly related to the reader's circumstance at the time, especially age.
I was in my thirties when I read Jude O & The Scarlet Letter so I had a lot
of reading under my belt by then and they just didn't measure up.  I'm not
even sure if I could slog through Wuthering Heights now - but when I was a
teenager (and the Bronte's lived about 20 miles away from where I was born
and brought up so I knew the landscape and language ) it was magnetic.

Jane Austen?  Oh I'm so sorry Murat I didn't include her simply because
she's a bit on the cusp and not really what we think of as 19th Century (not
that she's what you'd call 18th Century either - I think that's part of the
fascination - the world in transition  - she's very modern and yet curiously
old fashioned).  She's also very wicked!  I nearly bust a gut reading
Northanger Abbey.  But she's no Eliot that's for sure.

Geraldine
