I turned 72 on Wednesday. Thursday/Friday, depending on where you are, out
comes issue #31 of Otoliths <http://the-otolith.blogspot.com/>. In twelve
years time I'll be 84 but *Otoliths* will only be up to issue #79=97if that=
,
since I'll probably be infirm & unable to bring out more than two issues a
year. It's improbable that the number of issues of *Otoliths* will ever
catch up to my age. As the tortoise once said to the hare, "Read your Zeno,
Dude, & eat my dust."



In the meantime, I'm proud to bring out another solid issue, again
containing a wide-ranging spectrum of work, this time from Katrinka Moore,
Andrew Topel, Philip Byron Oakes, John Hand, Bjarte Alvestad, Louis Armand,
Jac Nelson, rob mclennan, Bob Marcacci, Anna Ryan-Punch, Robert Lee Brewer,

Hi all,  could you please send this along to interested parties?


Thanks, **


Lisa Jarnot

I'm going to run an abbreviated pre-holiday workshop for students who are
trying to finish manuscripts.  It will be 5 weeks, monday nights from
6-8:30 at my place in Jackson Heights, Queens. I'm seeking 3 (1 is already
enrolled) students (we'll spend one session devoted to each student's
manuscript, and one week looking at publishing options.) The class will
start November 25 and end December 23.  The fee is $250. I've run this
class twice before and it's been a productive one (some books coming out of
it). Let me know if you're interested. I'll also be doing a workshop on
Robert Duncan's poetry beginning in January. ****

 personal life. We liked him=2C but we were wary of him just as he was of=

Subject:      Amanda Earl to be inducted into the 2014 VerseOttawa Hall of
              Honour!

above/ground press author Amanda Earl is one of two inductees in the 2014
VerseOttawa Hall of Honour, following the announcement of William Hawkins
and Greg "Ritalin" Frankson for 2013. Congratulations, Amanda!

The VERSeOttawa Hall of Honour is an independent body with close to ties
to VERSeOttawa and VERSeFest. It was formed to recognize the important
contributions of individuals to the Ottawa poetry community.

An induction ceremony will be held on March 30th, 2014 --  the final day of
VERSeFest 14.

As the press release begins:

   It is with great pleasure that the VERSeOttawa Hall of Honour announces
   the two inductees for 2014: Amanda Earl and Danielle K.L. Gregoire.

   Amanda Earl is a fearless and supportive promoter of poetry and poets in
   Ottawa, and she is a long-time poet herself. She is a very visible and
   active member of the community. Through her organizational work, she
   promotes and encourages poets  emerging and established, and of diverse
   styles. The Ottawa poetry community would not be what it is without
   Amanda's contributions through Bywords and her many other important
   contributions. In these activities, Amanda Earl is vital in keeping the
   poetic arts alive and thriving in the Capital.

See the entire press release here.

you ever wished you could tell Van Gogh that every sunlit stroke of his
brush leaves you longing to twirl in a field of sunflowers? Do you wish you
could lay your words like laurels at the feet of Vermeer? Many of the

paintbrush or the quill. Now is your time to join the conversation. In this
workshop, we will invoke the alchemy of inspiration to grow new and
beautiful works from the masterworks of the past. Be prepared to create
your most powerful poems yet!

Poems with Cats
by John Allman

On the Blackness of Sidney / In the Forest
At the Window / Chameleon / Feeding Blossom
Five Cats and a Discussion of the Soul
Claws / On the Love Between Jake and Molly
The Destruction of the Tower in Khafji 1991
Thinking of Gustav Klimt with Molly on My Lap
Three-Tailed Cat Clinging to a Peony Branch
The Last Poem About Cats

Born in 1935, and initially raised in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of
New York City, John Allman, author of eight book-length collections of
poetry, two chapbooks, and a volume of short stories, was a high-school
drop-out who earned his diploma in night school while working as a lab
tech for Pepsi-Cola. Eventually turning away from science for the
humanities, and knocking about in many jobs, he earned degrees in English
Literature and Creative Writing from Hunter College and Syracuse
University (where he worked with Delmore Schwartz and Philip Booth), while
becoming more and more involved in writing poetry. At the age of 44, after
some years of having his work appear in journals, he published his first
book, Walking Four Ways in the Wind (1979), with Princeton University
Press in its Princeton Series of Contemporary Poets. His most recent
poetry collections are Loew's Triboro (2004), Lowcountry (2007), both from
New Directions, and Algorithms, prose poems (2012) from Quale Press. His
Inhabited World: New & Selected Poems 1970-1995 (1995) was published by
the Wallace Stevens Society Press. His recently completed collections,
Older Than Our Fathers and The Blue Gazebo, are making the rounds, looking
for a publisher, while he is working on a new collection titled Something
Rather Than Nothing, poems from which will soon appear in The Yale Review
and Hotel Amerika. His work has appeared in most of the major American
journals, from The American Poetry Review to The Yale Review. Allman has
received two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, a
Pushcart Prize in Poetry, and the Helen Bullis Prize from the original
Poetry Northwest. He earned his living teaching college English and
retired from that in 1997, to have more time for writing. He lives in
Katonah, NY, with his wife, Eileen, a Shakespeare and Jacobean Drama
scholar and writer. They spend their winters on Hilton Head Island, SC.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Nic Sebastian*=92s Poetry Storehouse* is an effort to promote new forms and
delivery methods for page-poetry by creating a repository of
freely-available high-quality contemporary page-poetry for those multimedia
collaborative artists who may sometimes be stymied in their work by
copyright and other restrictions. The main mission is to collect and
showcase poem texts and, in some instances, audio recordings of those
texts. It is their hope that those texts will serve as inspiration or raw
material for other artistic creations in different media.

Subject:      book launch! Ground rules: the best of above/ground press,

Ground rules: the best of the second decade of above/ground press 2003-2013

Produced to begin the re-launch of Ottawa literary publisher Chaudiere
Books, co-publishers rob mclennan and Christine McNair invite you to the
launch of Ground Rules: the best of the second decade of above/ground
press 2003-2013.

Co-sponsored by our friends at the Ottawa International Writers Festival
and The Manx Pub, the event will feature readings by three of the books
contributors: Sharon Harris (Toronto), Marilyn Irwin (Ottawa) and Stephen
Brockwell (Ottawa). The event will be (lovingly) hosted by Chaudiere Books
co-founder, editor and co-publisher rob mclennan.

5pm, Saturday, December 7, 2013
The Manx Pub
370 Elgin Street, Ottawa

Sharon Harris is a Toronto artist/writer whose poems have been
anthologized in The Broadview Introduction to Literature, The Last Vispo,
and Shift & Switch: New Canadian Poetry. She is the author of chapbooks
from bookthug, In Case of Emergency Press, and above/ground, and her first
full-length collection, Avatar, was published by The Mercury Press. She
has written articles for Geist, The Globe & Mail, and Open Book Toronto;
is a past contributor to Torontoist and Word Magazine; and her work has
been published in The National Post, dANDelion, The Capilano Review,
Drunken Boat, The Volta, broken pencil, and Vallum. I Love You Toronto,
her exhibition of photographs, appeared in newspapers, magazines, and on
radio and television across Canada.

Marilyn Irwin's work has been published by above/ground press, Arc,
Bywords, and New American Writing. A graduate of Algonquin Colleges
Creative Writing program, she has three chapbooks: for when you pick
daisies (2010), flicker (2012), and little nothings (2012). She won Arc
Poetry Magazines Diana Brebner Prize this year.

Stephen Brockwell cut his writing teeth in the eighties in Montreal,
appearing on French and English CBC Radio and in the anthologies
Cross/cut: Contemporary English Quebec Poetry and The Insecurity of Art
(both VhiculePress, 1982). George Woodcock described Brockwell's first
book, The Wire in Fences (Balmuir, 1987) as having an extraordinary range
of empathies and perceptions. Harold Bloom wrote that Brockwell's second
book, Cometology (ECW Press, 2001), held rare and authentic promise.
Fruitfly Geographic won the Archibald Lampman award for best book of
poetry in Ottawa in 2005. His Complete Surprising Fragments of Improbable
Books is newly out from Mansfield Press. Brockwell currently operates a
small IT consulting company from the 7th floor of the Chateau Laurier and
lives in a house perpetually under construction.

  Working out of Ottawa, poet and publisher rob mclennan's baby, above/ground
  press, marks a second decade of the production of broadsheets, chapbooks,
  magazines, and anthologies that trace out the best shapes of the best of
  contemporary Canadian (and, increasingly, international) poetry. From the
  span of that second ten of years, he has compiled this book of traceries:
  a selection of work by writers ranging from the likes of the late Artie
  Gold, and Robert Kroetsch, to the living derek beaulieu, Rachel Zolf, Eric
  Folsom, Natalie Simpson, etc., all collected here as representative of a
  decades aesthetic count.
		from Gil McElroy's "Introduction: An Integral"

Edited by rob mclennan, with an introduction by Gil McElroy, Ground Rules
features writing from the second decade of one of the most active micro
publishers in Canada, selected from a series of hundreds of publications
lovingly edited, produced and distributed by editor/publisher rob
mclennan. A follow-up to Groundswell: best of above/ground press,
1993-2003 (Broken Jaw Press, 2003), Ground Rules includes a wide range of
work by Artie Gold, Mark Cochrane, Suzanne Zelazo, derek beaulieu,
Stephanie Bolster, Amanda Earl, Nathanal, Lisa Samuels, Rachel Zolf,
Sharon Harris, D. G. Jones, Julia Williams, Eric Folsom, Gregory Betts,
Natalie Simpson, Aaron Tucker, Monty Reid, William Hawkins, Emily Carr,
Cameron Anstee, Helen Hajnoczky, Marilyn Irwin, Stephen Brockwell, Robert
Kroetsch and rob mclennan.

Copies of the book will be available at the event. See the OIWF link to
the event here.

Dear all,

I hope you'll join us at the Zinc bar *this Saturday 11/9* at 4:30, for
readings by


ALEX WATERMAN

Alex Waterman is a cellist, composer, writer, and teacher. He has completed
three books with the typographer Will Holder--Agape, Between Thought and
Sound, and The Tiger's Mind, and they are completing a new book on the
American opera composer, Robert Ashley: Yes, But is it Edible? Beatrice
Gibson and Alex Waterman's collectively written and scored film, A
Necessary Music, premiered at the Whitney Museum ISP show and won the Tiger
Prize for Best Short Film at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 2008. He is
currently scoring music for a new piece by Maria Hassabi--premiering at The
Kitchen this Fall-- and touring with Either/Or. Waterman is producing and
directing Robert Ashley's opera Vidas Perfectas--which has been performed
in New York and London (at the Serpentine Pavilion and Cafe OTO). Vidas
Perfectas will return to New York in a 'live television' version (Spring of
2014) and travel on to Ballroom Marfa and the El Paso Opera. He teaches at
the Bard College MFA program, New York University, and has
taught--alongside Will Holder-- at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

JAAP BLONK

Jaap Blonk (born 1953 in Woerden, Holland) is a self-taught composer,
performer and poet. A comprehensive collection of his sound poetry came out
as a book with 2 CDs in August, 2013, entitled "KLINKT".

Season curated by Genji Amino and Daisy Atterbury.

Zinc Bar, 82 W 3rd St, NYC.

Hey poetics,

Do you like poetry? Or poets? That's funny. There's a poetry event coming
up, that you might like to go to.

Steve McCaffery and Allen Fisher are reading their poetry at it. They're
quite good poets, depending on what you mean by good. If you know what I
mean.

It's on November 17th, so about 10 days from now. It's at 4pm at 435 West
22nd Street. That's the Page Poetry Parlor, where Lee Ann Brown and Tony
Torn live. They're famous people. Please be prompt.

Ok. If you're in England it's 9pm, same day, at the the Judith E. Wilson
Studio, on the same day. The street address is the Faculty of English,
University of Cambridge, 9 West Road. In the basement.

Ok. Please come. Thanks. If you like websites, there is one. It's unamac.org.
Thanks.

Luke

the Center for MARGINALIA presents:

Some questions regarding Russell Atkins vis-=E0-vis Charles Olson
TYRONE WILLIAMS
Friday
15th November
4pm

from Tyrone Williams:
"What overlapping concepts of the "field" determine the poetics of Atkins a=
nd Olson? To what extent is Atkins' relationship to avant-garde European mo=
dernist music (including serialism which he apparently detested) analogous =
to Olson's relationship to jazz (and in particular the bebop of Charlie Par=
ker and Dizzy Gillespie)? What is the relationship between Atkins' promotio=
n of "force" in his aesthetics and Olson's valorization of "energy" in his?=
 What is the nature of the "human psychology" that motivates Atkins' psycho=
-visual poetics and Olson's attempt to bracket, if not erase, the "lyrical =
interference of the individual ego"? Finally, what are we to make of the in=
fluence of the Olson essay on "Projective Verse" and the relative lack of i=
nfluence of Atkins' ideas in his various manifestoes (e.g., is Atkins' pros=
e simply too idiosyncratic? Does the institutionalization of Olson's work v=
ia Black Mountain account for the dissemination of his ideas? Did race, geo=
graphy, etc. play a role?)?"
Participants should read in advance:
- Atkins, Russell. "Preface", "Manifesto", "Egocentrical Projection As Obje=
ct in Perspective."**
- Nielsen, Aldon Lynn. "Black Deconstruction: Russell Atkins and the Recons=
truction of African-American Criticism." diacritics 26.3-4: 86-103.**
 - Olson, Charles. "Projective Verse."

**PLEASE EMAIL the series curator, Edric Mesmer, at esmesmer[AT]buffalo[DOT=
]edu to receive copies of the works by and about Russell Atkins for next we=
ek's talk by Tyrone Williams.

 The Division of Languages and Literature presents

 Special Views of History Benjamin Hollander and Ammiel Alcalay read from
their work Monday, November 18, 2013 7:00 p.m. =97 9:00 p.m., Olin Language
Center, Room 115

Continuing from their afternoon practicum, and in the spirit of Charles
Olson=92s *Special View of History*, Hollander and Alcalay will read from
their poetry and prose. Their reading will play off Hericalitus=92s maxim
which begins Olson=92s *Special View*: =93Man is estranged from that which =
is
closest to him.=94
For Alcalay, this means tracing event to memory to create another kind of
consciousness in the present, a third eye on a distant landscape coming
into zoom focus, or, like Jack Spicer=92s poet as radio, radiating poems as
messages coming in at different frequencies, frequenting multiple
dimensions:  writing which, in Robert Duncan=92s view, works toward immedia=
cy
as it seeks after origins.
For Hollander, this means a writing which reshapes and brings to focus our
historical Imagination, where facts on the ground can be transformed into
fables in the air: writing which aspires to conditions articulated by the
biographer and translator Robert Payne, that =93America was [and could be
again] fable before it became fact.

Please also join our guests in Olin 115, 11:50am-1:10pm  for our
practicum, *Ammiel
Alcalay and Benjamin Hollander:  **on Translation and Poetic Identity in
the Age of Identity Politics*

 Ammiel Alcalay and Benjamin Hollander on Translation and Poetic Identity
in the Age of Identity Politics Monday, November 18, 2013 11:50 a.m. =97 1:=
10
p.m., Olin Language Center, Room 115

*Ammiel Alcalay* and *Benjamin Hollander *will address how translation as
act and idea has shaped their practices and poetic identities.
Hollander, who grew up between German and Hebrew before coming to the
English he now writes in, will speak to how this linguistic and cultural
journey has been *translated *into the un-Americanness of his American
language and philosophy. His new book, In The House Un-American (Clockroot
Books), is partly guided by the metaphor of translation as transport, as
the perpetual crossing and metamorphosis of an immigrant=92s language,
identity, and culture. David Shapiro has called it =93so America, so like a=
n
inner emigration, as if we had all changed names.=94 Hollander will address
how the foreignness of his writing can inform the singularity of poetic
thinking: how, in terms of syntax and fluency and perception, he wants, as
the poet and translator Murat Nemet-Nejat writes,  =93to help English
 [and American identity) grow a limb it does not have.=94
Alcalay has been publishing translations from a number of languages for
over thirty years, and will speak to how these experiences inform poetic
thinking and knowledge. As an advocate of writing from various parts of the
world=97particularly the Middle East and the Balkans=97he has been instrume=
ntal
in forging a space for engaged political encounters with other cultures and
languages. He will address how his immersion in projects, centered in and
on other regions and languages, have evolved into comprehending the context
of how one uses American English and what that might mean for a
reconfiguration of post Second World War American culture, as well as what
that might mean for exploring new approaches to North American political,
cultural, and literary history and identity. Taking, on the one hand,
Meso-American scholar Gordon Brotherston=92s crucial idea that =93the prime
function of classical texts is to construct political space and anchor
historical continuity,=94 and poet Charles Olson=92s idea that the history =
of
these States remains =93unrelieved=94 as starting points, Alcalay will addr=
ess
how his experiences as a translator and writer have taken him into realms
that have little to do with the prevailing discourse in which literary
translation has become embedded.

History:  Benjamin Hollander and Ammiel Alcalay read from their work.*

The Richard Brautigan Collection from poet Joanne Kyger

Featuring an extraordinary archive of original artwork, inscribed books, =
rare ephemera and magazines, photographs, typescripts and more.    =20

Joanne Kyger met Richard Brautigan at a gallery opening in San Francisco =
in the spring of 1957 when they were both 22 years old. After dinner the =
following night Richard gave Joanne her first tour of North Beach.

In 1960, Joanne left San Francisco and lived in Japan for several years =
where she married Gary Snyder and studied Zen Buddhism. She became close =
friends with Richard when she returned to San Francisco in February =
1964.

Joanne and Richard were greatly influenced by Jack Spicer early in their =
careers and both were important and vivid figures in the remarkable =
literary and art scene in San Francisco in the mid-to late 60's. They =
often read poetry at the same events and published in the same =
magazines, including the one-shot "Change," (1963) edited by Richard and =
Ron Loewinsohn, and "Wild Dog," guest edited by Joanne in 1965. They =
spoke on the phone nearly every day during this period and Richard would =
often read new work to her.

Richard's book "In Watermelon Sugar" (completed in 1964, published in =
1968) was dedicated to Joanne Kyger, Donald Allen and Michael McClure. =
He began writing it while staying in Bolinas, and Joanne would sometimes =
visit Richard there while he was working on it. She eventually moved to =
Bolinas in 1968 where she now resides.

Richard bought houses in Bolinas and Montana and divided his time =
between the two while making trips to Japan. Though they were not as =
close as they had been, Joanne and Richard were in contact until 1984 =
when Richard Brautigan died in Bolinas.

FROM THE INTRODUCTION BY JOANNE KYGER:

INVISIBLE IDYLLS
by the Reverend Philip Whalen
Sam, Shorty, Peter, Gwendolyn, May Margaret and Chandler. They all live
exquisitely sturdy and grandiosely intelligent lives.
Sam, Shorty and Peter have terminally minimal money between them and reside
within the vast holdings of The Laetitia Norton Feinschreiber Memorial
Foundation for the Advancement of the Arts, with its memorial museum and
library, stables, squash courts, swimming pools, sculpture studio, and the
music library housing the Ernestine Pratkredl Feinschreiber Memorial
Baroque Organ which overlooks the lotus pond with its expensive imported
ducks from Kashmir. Still, its inhabitants have barely enough money to take
a bus downtown.

"2 Juries + 2 Storeys =3D 4 Stories Toujours" by K.S. Ernst & Sheila E. Mur=
phy


In "view points pierce the mise en scene / once words afar farce," each
poem has two frames, and each frame has two parts: words superimposed on an
image. The clear greyscale shapes echo the architecture of typesetting,
reminding the reader of the physicality of the printed page. "'Call on me
call on me call on things built up in rectangles' said those words" KSEM's
little mirrors are double all the way down, reminding us that although
collaborative poetry may desire a unified voice, it is always the effort of
at least two distinct individuals.


=97Jessica Smith


An invitation to explore a gallery of sedulously built faces, ways of
seeing, unfolded structures. Complex forms "chase your imagination" through
a collaborative exploration of distinct individuals' negotiations with
closely related realities. Each visual and verbal play reaches down into
itself to surface the shape itself, hypnotic in its simplicity.


=97Mara Patricia Hernandez


from the introduction:


Over a period of several years, we have cultivated a way of working
together that feels creatively stimulating, natural, and distinctly
different in style and character from our respective solo efforts. Since a
couple of years into the 21st Century, we have been creating gallery works
on a medium to large scale, in addition to a good number of small-sized
pieces with the printed page in mind. Many of these smaller pieces are
represented in our book Permutoria (Luna Bisonte Prods Press, 2007), and
one of the pieces ("Vortextique") appeared in Poetry magazine as part of a
special feature on visual poetry, under the guest editorship of Geof Huth.


mIEKAL's invitation to create a book for Xexoxial arrived at a perfect time
for us. Following a burst of creation of gallery pieces that spanned
several years, we had taken a breather. Xerolage 55This book represents a
re-emergence of our work together. The mode of development for this project
led us to examine "double dozens," based upon the 24 inner pages we would
create. The design involves dual "story lines," two distinct yet oddly
inter-relatable perceptual mechanisms, based upon a framework encompassing
the blend of visual and textual work.


We find ourselves increasingly devoted to the shared design of an
architecture that seems to us to invite new work. Perhaps the process
really amounts to our learning to look at blank areas for a long time, and
to stare the pre-existing works into the realm of a life we recognize. In
either case, the process seems magical, and we are grateful for it.

Once again, this brings up the intention of ED's actions, and I think
shines a spotlight on the fallacy that's unleashed on the reading
public beautiful books featuring scraps of paper and envelopes written
upon by ED.  This fallacy is the same one committed by Eric von Daniken
and the Ancient Astronaut crowd (to pick a really extreme example), and
it's called presentism and sometimes the historian's fallacy and
Whiggism and it involves peering back through spectacles of today--with
our present "sophistication concerning aesthetics and advanced literary
theories"--and attributing these same concerns to someone who was most
probably trying to conserve paper when writing her poetry.  In fact my
grandmother did the same thing with envelopes--neatly turning them into
scratch paper to save money.  She'd lived through the Great Depression
and presumably learned the habit from her own parents.

Presentism also gives us ED's "art"--when word lists look like clouds
and trees and such--ED's "postmodern poems" with blanks and wordlists
to fill into the blanks so that the poem ever makes itself anew, ED's
"speak-singing" diacritical marks instead of simply the uncertain
pencil strokes of a great poet's work sheets--a great poet in an age of
poetesses--but one who suffered from problematic eyesight most of her
adult life, which also goes far to explain many more of the ambiguities
in her manuscripts.

ED's poems are really remarkable and they shine through all the
silliness some people (who should know better), try to dress them in.

These kinds of misunderstandings are sometimes great fun and can open up
whole new money-making territories--as our friend Eric von Daniken could
tell you, but do they bring us closer to coming to grips with what
really happened when a gifted individual takes up the pen?

Let's stop to burn a candle to poor Occam, who gets a drubbing these
days.

Jess

Subject:      Words and sounds from Stockholm
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I have for several years worked with a sort of mix of words and
sounds, linguistic elements transformed into instrumental music. Here
are a few:

** "Promotion is over" is the latest. Synthetic speech of a prose
poem together with pianistic intrusions that mimic the structure of
some of the sentences. At the top of this page:
https://soundcloud.com/tallmo

** "Nota bene". A musical composition structured after a lecture.
Available here:
https://soundcloud.com/tallmo/nota-bene

** "Kruska" is a sort of a derivative of a derivative. It is a
composition (with improvisational elements) made after a
text/syllable-sound composition I made in 2006, "Crux crux wim crux".

"Kruska" is available here:
https://soundcloud.com/tallmo/kruska

"Crux crux wim crux" is on Spotify here (the first track):
