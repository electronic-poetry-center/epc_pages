????? In this social satire, the beaches in Venice, California are in trouble. The grassy park and pristine sands which separate the high-dollar houses from the water have been defiled by dogs and their owners. Then Sergeant Smelzkoff of the LAPD appears. With the task of bringing order to the oceanfront and considering his life thus far a failure, Smelzkoff vows to succeed in what may be his last mission before retirement. But things are soon complicated when his estranged gay son moves back to California from New York with his own dog. Trouble ensues. The novel features 40 black and white line drawings by illustrator Nathan Geare.

????? The reading is free to the public and begins at 4 PM with appetizers and beverages to be served. Join author Ronald Alexander and illustrator Nathan Geare for their publication party at James Beach Restaurant, where cocktails and dining are always "beach style."

Dear List Members:

For the tenth year NYU/SCPS/McGhee Division is holding its two week intensive writing workshop in June. The dates are June 8th-June 20th.

Students gather at beautiful Ireland House, just north of the Washington Square Arch, for two weeks of intense work with guest writers and NYU faculty. Each year a fiction writer, a poet, and a nonfiction writer come to NYU to work closely with students.
This year the poet will be Bei Dao, the fiction writer Margot Livesey, and the nonfiction writer Peter Balakian. Students will spend fifiteen hours in class with the guest writer in their own genre and three hours with a writer in a different genre. No more than twelve students in each genre group.  Students will also have private conferences with the guest writers.

Mornings are spent in improvisation workshops taught by Ruth Danon, Catherine Barnett, and April Krassner, all NYU faculty.'

Evenings are devoted to talks and readings by writers and students.

Sessions on graduate school and publishing are also included in the program.

For application and information contact Charles Bradshaw at cb97@nyu.edu or backchannel me.

I hope you will spread the word.

Thank you,

Ruth Danon

Subject:      ON poets writing NOVELS (OH! it pains me to write those words!)

A good friend who knows HOW MUCH novels irritate me, and how physically ILL
I become when I hear of YET ANOTHER poet writing novels (or as I say
FORSAKING poetry for novels!) sent me this link:

http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/plotting-novel-left-poet-at-a-loss-for-words/2008/03/28/1206207399861.html

This makes me want to SHOUT OUT many thanks to Rhyll McMaster for her brave
nod to the truth!  I have met many poets who have taken up the novel, and
have had many arguments about it with them.  EVERY SINGLE TIME the poets
insist that they will always be able to write poems, and I wait for those
poems.  They never come back from the illness (YES, ILLNESS!) of the novel.

There are very very few poets I can think of who MASTER both.  Or, better
yet, poets who ACTUALLY continue to write poetry as well as they did before
the task,task,task driven "art" of writing novels.

Eileen Myles is a RARE exception!  Her poems have gotten BETTER AND BETTER
despite her novels.  But then I feel almost no one alive has her abilities
for writing, she's so beyond us.

Magdalena Zurawski may not write poems anymore, but her novel THE BRUISE
reads exactly like her poems always did, and I Love her poems.

Maybe it's poets who were writing poems outside the mainstream who can make
it work out for the better?  Magdalena's novel REALLY IS like her poems, and
it took her 7 years to write.  IT'S A THING OF GREATNESS, but to me it's an
epic experimental poem.  It's coming out this fall, and won the Scholnick
Award for experimental fiction.

But, to be honest, 99 percent of the poets I've met who take up the novel
get lost.  Permanently lost.

One poet I know who now writes novels was an AMAZING poet when I first met
him in 1993, or 1994.  He hates my guts because I wouldn't share his
enthusiasm at having discovered enjoying novels.  He also hates me because
when he last wrote to me and said that I should try to write a novel, that I
would be good at it, I wrote back, "I'D RATHER FUCK A JAR OF NAILS!"  BUT, I
feel if I can PREVENT a poet from killing themselves with novels, then I
have to take the risk!

Poetry is too important to NOT risk being hated for it!

It's OK being hated.  Or maybe I'm just used to it.

 I just received this note from Paul Pines

 Dear Friends:  have just received word of the death of a dear friend, Rochelle Ratner. She had been fighting cancer for the last six months after two prior battles with breast cancer. She was a wonderful writer and worked tirelessly to build a significant body of work and did so until the last phone call we shared a few days ago in which she said, "I have been looking back over my journals and pulling out short stories. There is so much there." I pause to reflect. The reservoir of things to say and ways to say them is inexhaustable. Not so our own resources. I do think the effort to express our lives as meaningful is ongoing and sustaining, but part of this must include our connection to those around us. Cliched, I know, but true. I am constantly reminded of that message in Pere Lachaise Heloise left even after many years of separation from Abelard: "The love that united us was all our joy."  Love to all. Paul


I will remember Rochelle for her intense presence, her writing and her care for writers,as well as  her commitment and attention to reviews of  small presses, and her reviews of work by many of us.

 In sadness,

 Stephen Vincent

I'm writing with the sad news that Rochelle Ratner has passed away
today. There will be a funeral in Rhode Island but I have no details of
it at this time.

I imagine there will be a memorial for Rochelle in NYC some time this
spring. Marsh Hawk Press will certainly hold an event to remember her,
in any case (details tba).

Praise for Handsome Fish Offices by Ara Shirinyan:
While office supply products and tropical fish might at first thought seem
to have nothing to do with one another, once side by side they reveal the
interconnections between global acquisitions, multinational capital, and
environmental destruction.  - Juliana Spahr

Of cut-up writing, in which different textual sources are spliced together,
often jarringly, William Burroughs once said, "The results will look a lot
like you." Handsome Fish Offices, Ara Shirinyan's book of profoundly 21st
century cut-ups, takes up this insight with hilarity and irreverence,
showing readers how the world looks like them, and they look like the world=
.
No matter whose language he's playing with, the startling juxtapositions of
words in these poems reveal the contemporary global condition of being
incorporated and measured, invariably down to the smallest detail. "This
laterally flattened species is ideal / For catalogs, direct mail,
promotions, etc," he writes, and you'll know what he means, because your
species, too=97and right now=97is one of the many getting flattened. -Mark
Wallace

Personally, I've found that working on a novel increases the frequency with
which I get ideas for poems, but then I never do end up finishing the novel.
Hmm.

Dress Rehearsal

I love you like wood and you laugh
with high birds I can't see.
White flat ducks wake the morning to leaves
that have slanted from night.

Talk . . . talk . . . I hear noises--
It's only the fish that are flying now,
bodies and words.

Borrowed sunlight is crossing our sleep
like a child in the woods.
It's cold and then warm in the haloes,
the dark strung together like travel.

Time was geology then.
It was summer. We always had friends.

Israel and South Africa, the colorful, creative and improvisational
performances of Mo(ve)ment will finally make its US debut. Mo(ve)ment is a
two-act, multi-disciplinary, live on-stage performance that spotlights
energetic dialogue between visual art and modern dance. Benno Hübner dances

connections between these two disciplines develop a conversation that is
playful, passionate and at times intimate. During this performance, Tali
Farchi and Benno Hübner will be joined by Royce Deans (painting), Steve Cohn
(keyboards / shakuhachi / poetry), Joel Wanek (upright bass), and Dan
Godston (trumpet / poetry). Please contact Dan at 312.543.7027 or

Performers’ Bios:

Jerome Bryerton
Jerome Bryerton is an experimental percussionist and visual artist from
Chicago. He has recorded, toured or played with many of today's most notable
free improvisers: John Butcher, Wolfgang Fuchs, Peter Van Bergen, Cecil
Taylor, William Winant, Alan Silva, Torsten Muller, Frank Gratkowski, Henry
Kaiser and Vinny Golia. He has performed at notable festivals—such as FMP
record's Total Music Meeting (2002), Kaleidoscope (2003), Seattle's Earshot
Festival (2003)and the Sf Alt (2004).
Jerome's musical concept is a cross-pollination of techniques derived from
European improv, Japanese Taiko, American Jazz and European Modern-
Classical. Percussionists that he incorporates into his approach are: Jack
DeJohnette, Paul Lytton, Paul Motion, Stewart Copeland and Le Quan Ninh.
Also, applicable to his percussive philosophies are extended techniques by
non-drummers—the multi-phonic and harmonic practices of saxophonist Evan
Parker; the multi-layered double-bass preparation of Barry Guy; and the
orchestral, multi-timbered instrumental selection of reed player Wolfgang
Fuchs. Jerome's goal is to use his percussive materials to mirror practices
of modern art, philosophy and post-modern theory. The idea being—to develop
and express the improvisational elements that life itself presents.

Steve Cohn
The music of pianist and shakuhachi player Steve Cohn has continually and
dramatically evolved. A native of San Francisco, he performed as a blues
pianist in Los Angeles, where he began studying the shakuhachi flute at
UCLA. He then spent two years in Japan returning to study at San Francisco
State University where he worked with Pulitzer Prize Winner, Wayne Peterson,
and also appeared as a jazz pianist performing with musicians such as Eddie
Henderson, and Sonny Simmons. Ultimately he moved to New York where he has
devoted himself to totally improvised music, combining unconventional use of
non-western winds and percussion with a unique piano style.
Cohn has performed his own works in venues including New York City's Miller
Theatre, New Works October Series, Fiesta International USSR, the Newport
JVC Festival, Sweet Basil, The Great American Music Hall, World Shakuhachi
Festival 1998, the Ottawa Festival; appeared in multimedia performances with
Japanese Taiko drummers and the Elinor Coleman Dance Ensemble. He was also
commissioned to compose and perform an original work that premiered with the
Watanabe Dance Company in Japan. Cohn has performed and recorded with
musicians including Reggie Workman, Jason Huang, Tom Varner, Fred Hopkins,
Karl Berger, Oliver Lake, William Parker and Bob Stewart.

Royce Deans
Royce Deans studied art at the American Academy of Art in Chicago. His work
is characterized by a combination of abstract lines and figurative images.
Subject of his work is often the human body - even when he paints a
landscape or a still life. His color blindness is not noticeable in his use
of colors, but his paintings have a rich texture. His work was debuted in
Amsterdam with Mo(ve)ment in September 2007.

Tali Farchi
Tali Farchi was born in Haifa, Israel. She studied for seven years in the
Netherlands, at the Vrije Academie in The Hague and the Rietveld Academy in
Amsterdam. Subsequently, she began her own studio for the production of
animations for television, commercials and video productions – first in Tel
Aviv and from 1998 onwards in the Netherlands. Recently, her work was
exhibited in various galleries and museums. Her impressionistic style and
expressive images developed within Mo(ve)ment into live painting, a style of
painting that reminds one of the tradition of action painting. In
Mo(ve)ment, the audience not only sees the result of the painters' work, it
is the actual witness of the creative process.

Guillermo Gregorio
Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1941, Guillermo Gregorio became an
American citizen in 2003. With his Chicago-based trio and other ensembles,
Gregorio has performed his own compositions in Europe and the USA. In 2005,
New World Records released his CD, Coplanar. Previously, the Swiss label hat
Art issued six CDs, among them, Degrees of Iconicity (hat[now]ART 134)-named
"Star of the Month" in Fono Forum (Germany) in 2000-and Faktura (hat[now]ART
146), also featuring his compositions. In addition, he has worked and
recorded with various improvisational groups, as well as participated in
ensembles that recorded the music of Anthony Braxton and Cornelius Cardew.
In January 2001, he founded the Madi Ensemble of Chicago, which performs
original and historical scores that draw from the conceptual foundation of
the 20th century Argentinian avant-garde.
In 2007, Gregorio served a week-long residency as Composer-in- Residence at
Wesleyan University, sponsored by the Edward W. Snowdon Fund and the Music
Department. He has been Radio Curator of Armonia, a Musicians Residency
Program created by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. His composition Otra
Musica 4 was nominated for special notice by the 2006 IAMIC Annual List
selection panel (American Music Center/The International Association of
Grantmakers).
He has a degree in Architecture, and taught history and theory of
architecture and industrial design and visual communication at the
University of Buenos Aires and the University of La Plata, Argentina.
Currently, he teaches Art Appreciation and 20th Century Art at Purdue
University NC. He has also worked as an architect and consulting designer in
Buenos Aires and Los Angeles. "What affects my music more than any other
thing," Gregorio explains, "is my involvement in visual arts, and my
architectural and design experience." In his compositions, a
reinterpretation of the fundamental and structural concepts of
Constructivism converges with the historical experiences of Argentinean
Conceptualism, Fluxus, intermedia synthesis, and graphic music. In addition
to the acceptance of sound as material, constructive and geometrically
generated ideas are used in scores ranging from conventionally notated
statements to graphs, including planimetric projections of spatial
structures.
He was an active participant on the Argentine music scene throughout the
1960s, '70s and early '80s. His involvement with New Music included both
composing and playing saxophone, clarinet, and miscellaneous instruments in
the Movimiento Música Más (Fluxus Group), the Experimental Group of Buenos
Aires, and the Group of Contemporary Music of La Plata, featuring Fluxus
events, multi-media spectacles, environmental pieces, experimental concerts,
and aleatory realizations, as well as works by Cage, Ligeti, and avant-garde
Argentinean composers. Documentation of this period of his career is
available on the CD Guillermo Gregorio: Otra Música. Tape Music, Fluxus and
Free Improvisation in Buenos Aires 1963-70 (Atavistic UMS/ALP209CD). He has
also published many articles about avant-garde music (Musique Concrète,
Futurism, Grupo Nuova Consonanza, Cornelius Cardew, AMM, Musica Elettronica
Viva, Morton Feldman, Earl Brown, Robert Ashley, LaMonte Young, Albert
Ayler, Bob Graettinger).
As a composer and improviser, Gregorio has collaborated with Vinko Globokar,
Stephen Dembski, Enrique Gerardi, Steffen Schleiermacher, Ran Blake, Jim
O'Rourke, Ken Vandermark, Axel Dörner, Gene Coleman, George Graewe, Franz
Koglmann, Le Quan Ninh, Akikazu Nakamura, Ab Baars, Sebi Tramontana, and
Mary Oliver, among others.

Benno Hübner
Benno Hübner was born in Zwolle, the Netherlands. He studied at the Dance
Academy in Arnhem and  the renowned school 'Amor de Dios' in Madrid. He
developed his own dance vocabulary in which his academic background, his
Indonesian roots and personal body language are intermingled. As his career
developed, he focused on producing and performing multi-disciplinary theatre
pieces in which the dialogue between various art disciplines such as dance,
theatre, music and visual arts is explored. He is responsible for the
productions Syrinx, Circles and Ruis.

Dan Godston
Dan Godston teaches, writes, and composes music and plays the trumpet and
other instruments in Chicago. Last year his trio -- Ways & Means -- released
their debut CD, entitled “Fire of Dream”; this recording features a
collaboration with poet Ed Roberson. From 2005 till 2006 The Ways & Means
Trio hosted a monthly series at Muse Café called Lower & Upper Limits, which
showcased collaborations between poets and musicians. Dan has worked with
Jim Ryan, Daniele Cavallanti, Tiziano Tononi, Joel Wanek, Jayve Montgomery,
Eric Glick Rieman, Guillermo Gregorio, Jerome Bryerton, Mankwe Ndosi,
Douglas Ewart, Paul Hartsaw, Mars Williams, Tom Abbs, Nicole Mitchell, and
other musicians. In 2006 he founded the Chicago Calling Festival, which
provides opportunities for Chicago based artists to collaborate with artists
living in other locations around the world.

Rochelle and I first met in it must have been 1973. Unfailingly
generous, and never once, to my knowledge, descended to the nasty
soap-opera that sometimes infects the poetry world. She also wrote
some very good poetry.

I saw her last a few weeks ago. She had been sick for a long time,
and it was clear that the chemotherapy had become a form of torture.
But she expected to survive. A sad loss.

but there are so many great, or at least interesting, novels by people who
are primarily poets? (I admit, I seek them out)

didn't every 1st gen NYS poet write a novel?

I've found that since I started writing poetry again, I can't write

I did not know Rochelle Ratner but I received a very sad note by Karl Young
who forwarded the following links:

"you can see some of her work and my most important essay on her at

Of course you can write poetry and novels together; it's simply a matter of
desire. They can be totally complementary activities. I have a book of poems
coming out this year with Salt as well as the fourth and final instalment of
my fantasy quartet. (Although perhaps many people wouldn't think those were
"proper" novels.) They're simply different modes of literary being, and
there's nothing inherently exclusive about either form.

All best

Alison

Sometimes hard to know what's primary, what secondary. Here's a handful:

Cervantes
Swift
Emily Bronte
Melville
Hugo
Hardy
Poe
Lezama
Williams

A note from the Gothics News Service:

 From Washington, D.C. it was barely, if at all, reported this morning that someone, or a group, had hung a bright red laundry line, elevated between the Capitol Dome and the upper floor of the Washington Monument. Against the sunrise, it was possible to make out the figures of George Bush, Dick Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Wolfolitz, Feith, and a few other architects of the invasion, war and occupation in Iraq. Ceremonially spaced apart by several feet, each figure was strung up and hung upside down from his or her heels. The laundry line was motorized in such away that the figures wheeled back and forth, up and down the mall, the ties of the men flapping in the breeze. Apparently, digital speakers were placed inside each figure. Those looking up from the mall could hear a cacophony of voices.  “Forgive us. Forgive us. We knew not what we would wrought.” After that, they went on trying to explain themselves.

 The variously, quickly assembled crowds below, yelled back up, “Rot, Rot, Rot.”

 Apparently it was an April Fools stunt. As quickly as they realized what was happening, Snipers from Homeland Security – stationed on the tops of surrounding institutions -  severed the rope with a couple of careful shots. The figures came down to the lawn in a crumbling crash. Security personnel were seen throwing the remains as quickly as possible into a suddenly convenient dumpster. No arrests in the incident have yet to be made.

 Apparently most news organizations have honored the White House’s request for a news blackout. The official memo was rumored to say, “…This Government has no intention of permitting the use of effigies, and the implications of either lynching or torture to be part of our national media or dialog…”

Series A, a series in Chicago devoted to innovative writing, is being
featured during an hour-long broadcast this Sunday at 9 p.m. on
ChicagoPublic Radio (WBEZ).  If you are in the Chicago area, please
listen.  If
not, make sure to download the recording.  You can do that from
ChicagoPublic Radio's web site (
http://www.chicagopublicradio.org).  WBEZ tracks the downloads to see which
shows they should focus on in the future.  That's partially why they picked
Series A.  It's one of the most downloaded of their podcasts.  It's also
Poetry Month, so they wanted to focus on Chicago poetry/work.  If the show
receives many downloads, they might start spending more time on
Chicagoinnovative literature.

Some of the readers will include Gabe Gudding, Simone Muench, Lauren Levato,
Garin Cycholl, Cris Mazza, and perhaps Josh Corey (They hadn't decided when
I left.  Sorry Josh.)  In my interview, I talked about people like Paul
Hoover, Michael Anania, Chris Glomski, Kerri Sonnenberg, and others; plus, I
briefly mentioned the impact of writers like Ron Silliman, Susan Howe, and
Charles Bernstein on my own work.

So, please listen.  Download it to show your support for
innovative/experimental writing in the Midwest.

Best,
Bill Allegrezza

Kenneth Patchen: The Journal of The Albion Moonlight was one of the finest/strangest novels of the 20th century. Denis Johnson and Jim Harrison have done both (poetry/novels) for decades. Paul Auster gave up poetry but considers his poetry to be among his best work. Howard Nemerov wrote novels. Derek Walcott wrote plays and poetry. Ditto Brecht. Rilke too. & Pier Pasolini and Margaret Atwood (both wrote plays and novels).
Atwood still cranks them out.

I think that the more recent poems of Michael Ondaatje and Margaret
Atwood are pretty good.
I think it is hard to fault the last poems of WCW.
Didn't HD do some pretty good poems in her last years?
Nicole Brossard is no slouch at poetry in late years.

Updike, too. & across the border, Margaret Atwood. Pirandello wrote novels and short stories as well as plays and poems.Stephen Dobyns writes a detective series. Thomas McGrath wrote novels. The list goes on and on. I've mentioned others in a different post.  It's almost like listing prime numbers next to real numbers, except writers comprise a finite series.

have had many arguments about it with them.  EVERY SINGLE TIME the poets
insist that they will always be able to write poems, and I wait for those
poems.  They never come back from the illness (YES, ILLNESS!) of the novel.

There are very very few poets I can think of who MASTER both.  Or, better
yet, poets who ACTUALLY continue to write poetry as well as they did before
the task,task,task driven "art" of writing novels.

Eileen Myles is a RARE exception!  Her poems have gotten BETTER AND BETTER
despite her novels.  But then I feel almost no one alive has her abilities
for writing, she's so beyond us.

Magdalena Zurawski may not write poems anymore, but her novel THE BRUISE
reads exactly like her poems always did, and I Love her poems.

Maybe it's poets who were writing poems outside the mainstream who can make
it work out for the better?  Magdalena's novel REALLY IS like her poems, and
it took her 7 years to write.  IT'S A THING OF GREATNESS, but to me it's an
epic experimental poem.  It's coming out this fall, and won the Scholnick
Award for experimental fiction.

But, to be honest, 99 percent of the poets I've met who take up the novel
get lost.  Permanently lost.

One poet I know who now writes novels was an AMAZING poet when I first met
him in 1993, or 1994.  He hates my guts because I wouldn't share his
enthusiasm at having discovered enjoying novels.  He also hates me because
when he last wrote to me and said that I should try to write a novel, that I
would be good at it, I wrote back, "I'D RATHER FUCK A JAR OF NAILS!"  BUT, I
feel if I can PREVENT a poet from killing themselves with novels, then I
have to take the risk!

Poetry is too important to NOT risk being hated for it!

It's OK being hated.  Or maybe I'm just used to it.

such resistance should be studied rather than celebrated, because it
can only stem from ignorance. criticism by class is pretty abhorrent,
the sort of thing I would keep to myself.

Hello Listservers,

  Does anyone on the list have any literacy at all with Pashto? I'm at the beginning of a translation/ ethnographic project of a poet who has written extensively in Pashto. If anyone is interested in helping out with some questions and concerns circulating around this project, or has any interest in what will inevitably be a larger translation project please back channel. Thanks for your time.

  Bets for now,
  Warren

people forget Robert Penn Warren. He won 3 pulitzers, I think. & one of them was for fiction. Dylan Thomas wrote fiction as well. Ditto Jack Kerouac.

I, for one, fully have your back on this. Novels by poets are like a
Standards album by Anthony Braxton (he actually did one- go listen to
judge of the analogy, pretty bad).

Hi,

  I generally just lurk on this list, but wanted to say that Rochelle was a lovely lady. I have MS, and met her through workshops she taught through the MS Society. She was my teacher for six years or so. I wrote this for one of her assignments.

  For Rochelle

  Dark images
  Running, playing, giving
  Dearest friends, now gone

Check out Heather O'Neill's novel, published in 2006, "lullabies for little
criminals". This novel combines social insights concerning the street life
of poverty stricken children on the level of Baudelaire and Dickens in
poetic ways I never could have imagined was possible in the 21st Century.
Illustrates beautifully Rilke's maxim that "beauty is the beginning of a
terror we can just barely endure". O'Neill is a Canadian poet who writes in
the afterword of this novel: "I don't like to tell people I am working on a
novel because they ask me literally thousands of times when it's coming out.
People around me seemed to get very upset while I was writing this book.
They were like: What's with all this paper! This simply isn't right. Nobody
really believes you when you say you're writing a novel, and they look at
you all suspiciously. I used to get pulled out of line in customs every time
I said I was a writer. They'll dump out everything in your suitcase if you
say that you're a poet. The last thing they want is another poet in their
country. They apparently have enough trouble dealing with their own domestic
population of poets."

Last time I looked, there's a stack of O'Neill's masterful novel in the
Union Square Barnes and Noble.

I also can't resist citing both James Dickey's "Deliverance" in the context
of this discussion, and Cesare Pavese's novels, one of which, "Among Women
Only" ("Tra donna sole") , inspired an early film of Antonioni's, Le Amiche.
This discussion led me to once again open Jonathan Monroe's important 1987
book on the contentious topics surrounding prose poetry, "A Poverty of
Objects", which elucidates and deeply examines the emergence of prose
poetry, particularly in Baudelaire, as a utopian, democratic gesture. For a
period of time I read these amazing prose poems aloud every night before
going to sleep, which are inexhaustible in their poetic evocation of
Baudelaire's inspired social observations and insights. This is from "The
Cake":

"I was slicing my bread in peace, when a slight noise made me look up. Then
I saw an undersized young imp standing in front of me, dressed in rags,
swarthy and unkempt, whose wild and yet beseeching sunken eyes were
devouring my bit of loaf. Then I heard him heave a sigh and whisper in a low
voice, the word *cake*. I could hardly refrain from laughing at the
expression with which he chose to dignify my not very white bread, but I cut
him a thick slice and held it out from the object of his longing, then,
snatching the crust, he recoiled as fast as he could, as though afraid that
my gift was not sincerely intended, or that I was already having second
thoughts....At that very moment he was knocked down by a similar little
savage who had appeared out of nowhere, such a perfect replica of the first
that he could have been his twin brother. Now they rolled around on the
ground, fighting for possession of their precious prey, neither of them
willing to sacrifice half for his brother....When at last, exhausted,
gasping and covered with blood, they stopped fighting only because it was
impossible to carry on any longer, to tell the truth there was no trophy
left- the chunk of bread had completely disintegrated....This happening left
me feeling depressed long afterwards, as I repeated to myself, "So, there is
a wonderland in which *bread* is known as *cake*, such a rare delicacy that
it is enough to cause a fratricidal war." [1862] [Baudelaure, The Poems In
Prose, translated by Francis Scarfe].

michael ondaatje's 'coming through slaughter' is one of my favorite novels.
it's the story of buddy bolden and the beginning of jazz. a tragedy.

if you ever go to an ondaatje reading, you have to be in range. if you are
out of range, it's just another reading. if you are in range, it's something
else. this is partly why recordings of his poetry readings are so good. one
is generally in range when listening to recorded sound. by 'in range' i
don't mean just that you can hear it. close enough that you are in some
other type of range.

Mo(ve)ment / Yuganaut show at Peter Jones Gallery
tonight, at 8 p.m.

1st set: Mo(ve)ment

2nd set: Yuganaut (www.yuganaut.com)
     Stephen Rush -- keyboards, electronics, toys
     Tom Abbs -- upright bass, cello, didgeridoo, violin
     Geoff Mann -- drums, cornet, mandolin

3rd set: combined groups

Mo(ve)ment
After 5 years of performing in the Netherlands and playing festivals in
Israel and South Africa, the colorful, creative and improvisational
performances of Mo(ve)ment will finally make its US debut. Mo(ve)ment is a
two-act, multi-disciplinary, live on-stage performance that spotlights
energetic dialogue between visual art and modern dance.  Benno Hübner dances
in front of a a large screen on which the paintings of Tali Farchi are
projected, even as they are being created live for all to see. The
connections between these two disciplines develop a conversation that is
playful, passionate and at times intimate. During this performance, Tali
Farchi and Benno Hübner will be joined by Royce Deans (painting), Steve Cohn
(keyboards, shakuhachi, poetry), Joel Wanek (upright bass), and Dan Godston
(trumpet, poetry). http://www.jazzpolice.com/content/view/7641/116/

Tom Abbs
Bassist, tubist and improviser Tom Abbs has been performing and recording in
a variety of contexts (classical, rock, jazz, and improvised musics) for the
past 20 years. A Seattle native, Tom relocated to New York in 1991 where he
studied with such masters as Reggie Workman, Buster Williams, Joe Chambers,
Junior Mance, Chico Hamilton and Arthur Taylor. In the past decade Tom has
developed a driving percussive style on the bass that encompasses the deep
emotion and grit of Charles Mingus and Jimmy Garrison while showing the
dexterity and inventiveness of Scott La Faro. His fluid tuba style has shed
many of the instrument’s sluggish connotations and transformed it into a
soaring solo and sharply percussive groove machine. Equally comfortable in
"free" and "inside" settings, Abbs' versatility and depth as a player has
kept him busy backing up the likes of Lawrence "Butch" Morris, Charles
Gayle, Daniel Carter, Steve Swell, Roy Campbell Jr., Sabir Mateen, Jemeel
Moondoc, Assif Tahar, Borah Bergman, Billy Bang, Andrew Lamb, Warren Smith
and many others. Tom is currently a member of the collective experimental
trio, Triptych Myth with Cooper-Moore and Chad Taylor (Hopscotch Records)
and is leading his own group, “Frequency Response” (CIMP Records).

Steve Cohn
The music of pianist and shakuhachi player Steve Cohn has continually and
dramatically evolved. A native of San Francisco, he performed as a blues
pianist in Los Angeles, where he began studying the shakuhachi flute at
UCLA. He then spent two years in Japan returning to study at San Francisco
State University where he worked with Pulitzer Prize Winner, Wayne Peterson,
and also appeared as a jazz pianist performing with musicians such as Eddie
Henderson, and Sonny Simmons. Ultimately he moved to New York where he has
devoted himself to totally improvised music, combining unconventional use of
non-western winds and percussion with a unique piano style.
Cohn has performed his own works in venues including New York City's Miller
Theatre, New Works October Series, Fiesta International USSR, the Newport
JVC Festival, Sweet Basil, The Great American Music Hall, World Shakuhachi
Festival 1998, the Ottawa Festival; appeared in multimedia performances with
Japanese Taiko drummers and the Elinor Coleman Dance Ensemble. He was also
commissioned to compose and perform an original work that premiered with the
Watanabe Dance Company in Japan. Cohn has performed and recorded with
musicians including Reggie Workman, Jason Huang, Tom Varner, Fred Hopkins,
Karl Berger, Oliver Lake, William Parker and Bob Stewart.

Netherlands, at the Vrije Academie in The Hague and the Rietveld Academy in
Amsterdam. Subsequently, she began her own studio for the production of
animations for television, commercials and video productions – first in Tel
Aviv and from 1998 onwards in the Netherlands. Recently, her work was
exhibited in various galleries and museums. Her impressionistic style and
expressive images developed within Mo(ve)ment into live painting, a style of
painting that reminds one of the tradition of action painting. In
Mo(ve)ment, the audience not only sees the result of the painters' work, it
is the actual witness of the creative process.

Benno Hübner
Benno Hübner was born in Zwolle, the Netherlands. He studied at the Dance
Academy in Arnhem and  the renowned school 'Amor de Dios' in Madrid. He
developed his own dance vocabulary in which his academic background, his
Indonesian roots and personal body language are intermingled. As his career
developed, he focused on producing and performing multi-disciplinary theatre
pieces in which the dialogue between various art disciplines such as dance,
theatre, music and visual arts is explored. He is responsible for the
productions Syrinx, Circles and Ruis.

Geoff Mann
Born in New York City in 1975, Geoff Mann has been playing music from the
age of 7, starting on guitar then quickly making the switch to the drums.
Over the years, he studied at Appel Farm Arts & Music Center, Walnut Hill

Moses, Reggie Workman, Arnie Lawrence, Charli Persip, Andrew Cyrille,
Michael Carvin and Herman Foster. Geoff now lives in Brooklyn, NY where he
plays with a number of bands, including his own "Eternal Buzz Brass Band".
In addition, Geoff plays mandolin, cornet, banjo & bass, and writes music
soundtracks for film & television. He also plays currently with the
Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra, Key to the City, and Fire of Space. Past
groups have included Steve Swell's NY BrassWood Trio, Ori Kaplan, Carol
Lipnik & Spookarama, and with his late father, flutist Herbie Mann.

of colors, but his paintings have a rich texture. His work was debuted in
Amsterdam with Mo(ve)ment in September 2007.

Mr. Russell, YES, I forgot how much I LOVE The Journal of Albion Moonlight!

Jean Genet, I also forgot him.  How could I forget Genet?  Forsake Genet!?

And Richard Brautigan!  GEEZE!  OK!

Maybe I'm wrong, a tiny bit.
BUT I STILL DON'T LIKE IT!  Poets writing novels!

I guess I hate MOST novels!  99 percent of them!  They're like TV shows, or
something as tedious AND DANGEROUS occupying the mind like a FILTHY
pedophile robbing you of your magic as you sleep!  There's NO ROOM for the
most part TO HAVE YOUR OWN IDEAS!  No SPACE on the PAPER for the eyes to
take you when you need to digest and transform your life!  They want to
DIRECT like a fascist, like a corporation!  HOW MANY NOVELISTS WORK FOR THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION!?  I don't know, but I suspect THOUSANDS are in there!

Although Joseph Torra is pretty amazing at both.  He's one of the best
novelists I've ever met, and I also like him as a person, and I
generally hate novelists.

I'm going to plant marigolds and violets now and forget those
SHREWD novelists lurking about,

If want to hear prime Braxton, listen to his two albums with Gunter Hampel
and Jeanne Lee - The 4th of July and Famille. Spectacular jazz with a

I, for one, fully have your back on this. Novels by poets are like a

If anyone can get a hold of this book, Louis Zukofsky's Collected Prose Fiction contains a novel length novella which I am reading at the moment and find enchanting.  Alas, the book was remaindered at St. Mark's Bookstore so it may be out of print.  It was published by Dalkey Archives Press.  It's probably available online somewhere.  I would suggest anyone who can get it read it, especially lovers of classical music as it concerns that, too.  Regards, Tom Savage

I like the way you put this, Alison, "different modes of literary
being."

I like Selah Saterstrom's novel The Pink Institution. To me it resists
binary distinctions of poet/prose writer. It embraces "different modes
of literary being" in the space of one book.

Maggie Nelson's Jane too.

On my list to read for the potential to do the same: Jenny Boully.

Of course you can write poetry and novels together; it's simply a matter
of
desire. They can be totally complementary activities. I have a book of
poems
coming out this year with Salt as well as the fourth and final
instalment of
my fantasy quartet. (Although perhaps many people wouldn't think those
were
"proper" novels.) They're simply different modes of literary being, and
there's nothing inherently exclusive about either form.

All best

Barry,

check out the Lezama book I published in the Poets for Millennium
series:

http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9834.php

his poetry is as, if not more complex than the prose of Paradiso, but
very much worth the energy & involvement.

Pessoa of course!
And yes, I find it far too harsh on WCW's late poems.
And speaking of literature in the portuguese language... Oswald de Andrade,
Paulo de Andrade e Carlos Drummond, the founders of brazilian modernism in
the thirties  (Drummond wrote short stories and I'd understand anyone
objecting that this doesn't count).
One shouldn't forget french surrealists such as Desnos and Breton himself.
Poundians will remember Laforgue (thanks Ez, Laforgue deserved your praise)
And who would deny that Goethe was not as good a novelist as a poet. Or
Rilke.
I don't remember seeing the name "Robert Creeley" in the present exchange,
but I might have missed some posts
Pound wrote that poetry shd be at least as good as prose. The dictum remain=
s
worth pondering whatever one's opinion is about it...

Subject:      Epigramititis: 118 Living American Poets
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

A friend just sent me the URL for a description of this book, which,
I must confess, had escaped my attention when it was published last
year.  I find that I am one of the fortunate 118, but also find the
illin' epigram under my name utterly incomprehensible.  I'm not at
all sure why Kent Johnson bothered to include me, unless it was his
odd way of thanking me for bothering to inquire of him whose
permission I should seek prior to publishing a previously
undiscovered sheaf of Yasusada poems that had come into my possession.

While I am not at all sure what to make of this thing, I note that it
is replete with demonstrably false claims, such as : "Not a single
Language poet has ever said a single word about Will Alexander. " --
So I suspect that this book, perhaps Kent Johnson himself (if you
click on his name at the Amazon listing for the book, it takes you to
a series of volumes on model railroads) is another hoax.

I don't think one can generalize about whether poets can write fiction and
vice-versa. Some writers do both very well. Some also write plays, play
music, paint, etc. It's a matter of an individual's talents, which ones are
the strongest and which ones the individual wants to focus on.

I just bought this for $1 online.  Especially check out Zukofsky's
early dictionary poem "Thanks to the Dictionary".  & tho Little seems
to be endlessly dissed by Zukofskyites, it remains on my list of 20th
century classic novellas.

Long Poems ::: Major Forms

16-17 may, 2008

University of Sussex

An international conference that will consider ways in which comprehensive,
often formally complex and expansive poems may respond, or fail to respond,
to certain "obligations toward the difficult whole," and to explore what
these obligations might now entail; it will address aesthetic, formal,
generic, compositional and literary-historical questions the 'long poem'
brings into particular focus.

Speakers include:

Charles Bernstein (U Penn)
Rachel Blau DuPlessis (Temple)
Ronald Bush (Oxford)
Simon Jarvis (Cambridge)
Tony Lopez (Plymouth)
Peter Middleton (Southampton)

The full conference will be =A340 waged; =A325 unwaged (for a single day th=
e
prices are =A325 and =A315).

Please follow the link to register before the 1st of May.

http://www.sussex.ac.uk/modernist/1-2-1-8.html

Those without access to British cheque-books should send in a completed
form and then pay at the conference.

All queries should be sent to:

These days, I find nothing more annoying than rigid genre distinctions.  Wh=
o cares whether someone is writing a novel or writing poetry, as long as th=
e work is interesting?  And how did poetry become THE sacred form of writin=
g above all others, anyway?  Though innovation may be more "present" within=
 poetry these days, it doesn't mean it is absent in fiction.  To write with=
 a genre so vividly lodged in ones mind seems so limiting and boring to me.

It's practically impossible that some poet is not writing a novel that includes CA Conrad as a character,maybe even as the lead protagonist. Conrad definitely lifts up earth and sky wherever he goes, speaks, etc. Perfect material! I even suspect somebody has already done it. Does anyone know - title, author, et al??

CA,

I don't quite agree with you, but I am sympathetic to your distrust of the
novel and your fears about poets writing novels.

Too many novels feel, to me too, like straightjackets. There are, of course,
hundreds and hundreds of great novels, great novelists, but the dominance of
American realist fiction--with its terribly narrow sense of the
"real"--drives me away from most fiction and keeps my interest focused on
poetry.

Which brings us to why I seek out poets who write novels--I seek out their
novels with the hope that they will bring some of the discovery and life of
the poem to fiction. William, Creeley, Stein, Desnos: the best fiction from
poets feels contiguous with the poets' poems, not like a break from poetry.
And yet, isn't there that horrible notion that poets should "grow up," leave
poetry, and start writing novels? I remember when I was in graduate school,
I took a class from a poet-turned-novelists who thought that I had
potential. He spent the whole semester trying to convince me to stop writing
poetry and start writing fiction.

I love a lot of fiction from poets, but I hate it when a poet leaves
poetry for good for the larger readership of the novel.

Okay, but "novel" and "poetry" are not names of genres.

"Spy novel" and "epic poetry" are names of genres.

Mr Conrad, you are right, we should keep our ill-considered prejudices
in the open, the better to combat them. as it happens, tho, I did not
suggest that YOU should refrain from posting or that I don't like your
posts. there are enough catastrophes of the novel form that support
your view, I mean I think you are generous in only hating 99%, but the
exceptions are absolutely in the poetic realm. and there is so much
crappy poetry out there, as well, probably the same 99+%. that part of

CA,
I like innovative poetry & reastic novels usually. jane austen is not a
straightjacket--she has something to say abt what real love is. dostoyevsky
creates characters that sit right next to me they're so 3-dimensional.
or I read fiction that is contiguous w. the author's poetry--like stein's.
then again stein wasa one of the first to break down distinctions btwn
genres, calling tender buttons prose, putting acts of plays not in numerical
order, finally writing meidtations w/ are both poetry & prose--no
distinction these days for many poets, in this crossing the genres
world--like crossing genders maybe or saying the categories fall apart
finally.

Yes, I heard about this story and am very excited. The recorded sound itself
is wonderful--amazing to think of how far back that voice comes from,
beautifully grainy--and how can one not be overjoyed that the first
recordings were etched in soot?

And how did poetry become THE sacred form of writing above all others, anyway?  Though innovation may be more "present" within poetry these days, it doesn't mean it is absent in fiction.

CA,

I don't quite agree with you, but I am sympathetic to your distrust of the
novel and your fears about poets writing novels.

Too many novels feel, to me too, like straightjackets. There are, of course,
hundreds and hundreds of great novels, great novelists, but the dominance of
American realist fiction--with its terribly narrow sense of the
"real"--drives me away from most fiction and keeps my interest focused on
poetry.

Which brings us to why I seek out poets who write novels--I seek out their
novels with the hope that they will bring some of the discovery and life of
the poem to fiction. William, Creeley, Stein, Desnos: the best fiction from
poets feels contiguous with the poets' poems, not like a break from poetry.
And yet, isn't there that horrible notion that poets should "grow up," leave
poetry, and start writing novels? I remember when I was in graduate school,
I took a class from a poet-turned-novelists who thought that I had
potential. He spent the whole semester trying to convince me to stop writing
poetry and start writing fiction.

I love a lot of fiction from poets, but I hate it when a poet leaves
poetry for good for the larger readership of the novel.

Our desire to label things dates back to the Pre3M era, when
multi-industrial genre barons plotted and plated ways to suck human/mankind
(again, another LABEL! Damnit!) dry of hard-earned ___________ (label of
currency here).

Once the adhesive had been stumbled upon, their (the barons, who never would
admit they were barons. "Never ask about the money," they would never say)
fortune was a good as made.

"We will make them labels. And they will label." And today, here we are,
wasting the walls rememberingyou.

some novels i've read have been as important to me as the story of life =
and the mind.=20

still, it isn't hard to understand the resentment of some poets toward =
the novel. not so much the novel as the dominance of story, and certain =
types of stories, at that, in western language art. to the point where =
one begins to just abhor story of any kind. more art propaganda! more =
product! more gag me with a spoon!=20

until the right one comes along, of course.=20

it's said that we understand our lives in stories. that story is crucial =
to our making sense of ourselves and the world. dunno. to me, there's a =
lot of blather leading up to some good moments. cut to the frickin =
chase. no, hold on, that's a story metaphor. car chase? forget the =
chase. cut to the sex scene. cut to the illumination. cut to the =
revelation. cut to the good stuff. then cut it together. then cut it up. =
cut it up and together so it's like the one line story the poet told the =
king that caused him to give up the throne and wander as a seeker the =
rest of his days.=20

best movie i've seen in a long time was 'a russian ark'. no cuts at all, =
actually. not one. i woke up on the couch and there it was on tv. didn't =
know what it was, who made it, or anything. but it led me through a =
vision of russian history and art that was brilliant, disjunctive, time =
travelling, yet without a cut, seamless. disjunctive yet seamless. the =
story of a people told as a walk through the hermitage, through its art, =
but also as a walk through history. yet as in a dream. such a dream. =20

cut.

 Allen, OK.  And YES.

 LET ME BE HONEST about something I hadn't mentioned earlier.  I FIRMLY
BELIEVE the poets I have known in the past (most of them at least) who
turned to novels did so because of MONEY and because of READERSHIP.  Or
wanted to be LOVED MORE or something.  (poets who NEED that much LOVE are
always trouble!)  Poetry wasn't getting that for them, and on many levels
they were dissatisfied.  And I LOATHE this behavior because I think it takes
courage to write poems, TO NOT GIVE A FUCK that it's not making you money,
or whatever it is you WANT.

In the end it's a very sincere, pissed off way I had entered this
discussion!  I want the poets I have Loved to not want such nonsense from
this world!  I hate when I find out I have cowards for friends!  I'd rather
my family were cowards than my friends frankly.  But I DO actually find most
novels a tedious thing to approach, besides these other reasons.

In some cases it's for very different reasons that some poets write novels,
like my friend Magdalena Zurawski, who turned to fiction for reasons more
complicated than the above mentioned ones, but they're not my reasons to
explain.  Magdalena, who is one of my ABSOLUTE favorite people on earth has
SLAVED over her novel THE BRUISE for seven LONG years and as I've said
before, it's an epic poem to me.  It's a poem.  When I read it (and I've
been reading it for years as it comes out of her) her poems WHICH I HAVE
ALWAYS LOVED are there, are in it, this, this thing she calls a novel.  A
NOVEL!  I will say NOOOOOOVEL slowly in a mirror a thousand times and it
still makes no entrance.

If I MUST read a novel it usually needs to be a poet's novel.  I guess.

Poems are my life in every way, everyday, and I no longer mean poems I'm
reading but hearing-feeling-seeing-smelling them on the streets, unwritten,
sometimes better left unwritten.

Sarah, Patchen's Journal of Albion Moonlight is not a novel?  See, you're
getting us into the PAINFUL task of figuring out what a novel is, and I
don't know how to have that discussion.  I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT
DISCUSSION LIKE MY "STRAIGHT" WOMAN FRIEND WHO IS TERRIFIED SHE IS A LESBIAN
BUT NEVER SAYS SO AND what can I do about that?  If I ever write a novel I
will title it SARAH DON'T HATE MY MARIGOLDS!

 Sarah, DON'T HATE MY MARIGOLDS!  Well, you like 1 percent of them anyway.
Ah, fuck it, I don't care if you hate them, as they probably don't like you
either!
JUST kidding, I think.

Content-Disposition: inline

 Yes, I'm about to talk about a novel, which is ridiculous considering how
much I've recently railed against them on this List, but, I feel I have to
in this case.

An old friend told me about Susan Bernofsky's new translation of Hesse's
Siddhartha, saying it's amazing, actually, she said it's "sublime!"  The
link she sent me was from Barnes and Noble, and there's a descriptive tag on
the website under the book which reads, "Once the preferred marching song of
'60s hippies, Hermann Hesse's *Siddhartha* has returned to its rightful high
niche in world literature."

When I was in college (the very same semester I was not so politely asked to
leave) we read it for a literature class.  One of my mother's stinking
hippie friends had already turned me onto the book years before I was in
this class.  It had changed my young life, and I was happy to share that a
few years later in college with my seemingly indifferent classmates.  The
professor was a crabby old guy who HATED hippies, so my original experience
with the book didn't go over well.  He said something like, "THE HIPPIES HAD
NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE READING!  HESSE IS ART!"  (Some of my classmates
asked later if my mother could score them some acid.)

I argued that my mother's generation (stinky or NOT!) REALLY DID get it,
REALLY GOT IT as a matter of fact because THEY were the ones to take
CENTURIES of layers of oppression by the balls and RUN INTO THE DARKNESS to
reinvent the world!  The generation who gave us Civil Rights, the Women's
Movement, and Stonewall, and an awareness of FOOD and the environment, and,
frankly, with all of this, at its core, a bright, magnificent epiphany
of how EVERYTHING can change!  My argument was lost on my snobbish professor
who wanted to discuss the nuances of the lines, not the spiritual flux, THE
AWAKENING!  And then I pointed out what I thought to be the obvious, which
was that to talk about the lines was to talk about the TRANSLATION of the
lines, not the original German, which only derailed his plans further, and
pissed him off further.  But, it's true, right?  Anyway, who cares!

I bring all of this up because I FEEL a bit of that snobbishness in this
Barnes and Noble descriptive tag for the book's latest translation.  MAYBE
I'M WRONG, it's possible I'm conflating memory with the tag's intent.  But,
still, it feels kind of snobbish.  It feels similar to the words of my old
professor who is probably dead by now.  Of course IT COULD mean that the new
translation is what raises the book "to its rightful high niche in world
literature."  But maybe not.  To me it sounds like it's saying, "Well, the
hippies screwed around with it, but NOW, NOW WE HAVE it to place on the
golden podium with our MORE REFINED tastes!"

Yes, it's great literature.  I agree.  Even that older Hilda Rosner
translation (you know this version, it's a blue mass market paperback?)
makes you FEEL literature at its best in the book.  But isn't "G"reat
"L"iterature also a sense of spiritual awakening on some level?  Maybe it's
just me, but I've never been interested in anything (especially poems) if
I'm not TORN OPEN!  Of course you have to be willing to be torn open, I
think, but, if you are willing, the right thing meaning the CAPABLE thing
can, and will.

Also, in my opinion, to say that Siddhartha is not showing how DEFIANT you
must be to achieve grace, then it is to say you don't really GET the story
as it could be for your life.  (I mean, Siddhartha told The Buddha to FUCK
OFF essentially, like my mother's people told their own elders to do!)
Hesse created an allegory for the Soul.  And I say "S" Soul as in a
collective BUT individual path(s).

So I say HELL YES THE HIPPIES!  They weren't perfect, of course, but neither
was Siddhartha, of course.  Nor are we meant to be perfect, at least I hope
we aren't meant to be, because if we are we're in trouble!

Dear CA -

In Australia recently there's been a veritable plethora of a form that will
certainly flummox you...the verse novel. Every second creative-writing
poetry student is doing it.

One poet cum novelist whose reasons for choosing the novelistic form seems
to me to be outside the scope of your reasoning is Margaret Atwood who was
one of the best Canadian poets during her time but chose to write novels.
I'm just speculating here but she may have chosen this path as a result of
her feminism and the novel afforded her the best opportunity to explore
those issues that had taken on significant importance to her. I don't see
how the issues she explored in, for example, The Handmaid's Tale, could have
been explored to such depth other than in the form she chose.

To limit oneself to discussing only one of Hesse's books is unfortunate.
What about The Glass Bead Game (otherwise known as Master Ludi), or
Steppenwolf, Journey To The East or his numerous other masterpieces - =
all
devoured by the Hippies along with their electric koolaide which was a =
true
acid test of fine literature.
This discussion reminds me of the discussion had in the late 60s when =
Miles
Davis released his Bitch's Brew or when Ornette hired James "Blood" =
Ulmer on
guitar and the jazz world watched sadly as fusion took control. The only
artist during that period who didn't sell out was Coltrane - perhaps =
that's
why a church was consecrated to him in San Francisco. And yet, one can
listen to Weather Report or the Mahavishnu Orchestra at times without
cringing provided one does not think about what could have been had many =
of
these artists who had started out in avant garde jazz (Chick Corea being =
a
prime example with Circle) continued along this road. However, having =
said
that, it=92s the ones who entered the jazz scene at the time of =
transition
that I most respect as they did create some fine music and, because of =
their
late entry, could not be considered sell-outs.
Just a thought.

still, it feels kind of snobbish.  It feels similar to the words of my =
old
professor who is probably dead by now.  Of course IT COULD mean that the =
new
translation is what raises the book "to its rightful high niche in world
literature."  But maybe not.  To me it sounds like it's saying, "Well, =
the
hippies screwed around with it, but NOW, NOW WE HAVE it to place on the
golden podium with our MORE REFINED tastes!"

Yes, it's great literature.  I agree.  Even that older Hilda Rosner
translation (you know this version, it's a blue mass market paperback?)
makes you FEEL literature at its best in the book.  But isn't "G"reat
"L"iterature also a sense of spiritual awakening on some level?  Maybe =
it's
just me, but I've never been interested in anything (especially poems) =
if
I'm not TORN OPEN!  Of course you have to be willing to be torn open, I
think, but, if you are willing, the right thing meaning the CAPABLE =
thing
can, and will.

Also, in my opinion, to say that Siddhartha is not showing how DEFIANT =
you
must be to achieve grace, then it is to say you don't really GET the =
story
as it could be for your life.  (I mean, Siddhartha told The Buddha to =
FUCK
OFF essentially, like my mother's people told their own elders to do!)
Hesse created an allegory for the Soul.  And I say "S" Soul as in a
collective BUT individual path(s).

So I say HELL YES THE HIPPIES!  They weren't perfect, of course, but =
neither
was Siddhartha, of course.  Nor are we meant to be perfect, at least I =
hope
we aren't meant to be, because if we are we're in trouble!

 Allen, OK.  And YES.

 LET ME BE HONEST about something I hadn't mentioned earlier.  I FIRMLY
BELIEVE the poets I have known in the past (most of them at least) who
turned to novels did so because of MONEY and because of READERSHIP.  Or
wanted to be LOVED MORE or something.  (poets who NEED that much LOVE
are
always trouble!)  Poetry wasn't getting that for them, and on many
levels
they were dissatisfied.  And I LOATHE this behavior because I think it
takes
courage to write poems, TO NOT GIVE A FUCK that it's not making you
money,
or whatever it is you WANT.

In the end it's a very sincere, pissed off way I had entered this
discussion!  I want the poets I have Loved to not want such nonsense
from
this world!  I hate when I find out I have cowards for friends!  I'd
rather
my family were cowards than my friends frankly.  But I DO actually find
most
novels a tedious thing to approach, besides these other reasons.

In some cases it's for very different reasons that some poets write
novels,
like my friend Magdalena Zurawski, who turned to fiction for reasons
more
complicated than the above mentioned ones, but they're not my reasons to
explain.  Magdalena, who is one of my ABSOLUTE favorite people on earth
has
SLAVED over her novel THE BRUISE for seven LONG years and as I've said
before, it's an epic poem to me.  It's a poem.  When I read it (and I've
been reading it for years as it comes out of her) her poems WHICH I HAVE
ALWAYS LOVED are there, are in it, this, this thing she calls a novel.
A
NOVEL!  I will say NOOOOOOVEL slowly in a mirror a thousand times and it
still makes no entrance.

If I MUST read a novel it usually needs to be a poet's novel.  I guess.

Poems are my life in every way, everyday, and I no longer mean poems I'm
reading but hearing-feeling-seeing-smelling them on the streets,
unwritten,
sometimes better left unwritten.

Sarah, Patchen's Journal of Albion Moonlight is not a novel?  See,
you're
getting us into the PAINFUL task of figuring out what a novel is, and I
don't know how to have that discussion.  I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT
DISCUSSION LIKE MY "STRAIGHT" WOMAN FRIEND WHO IS TERRIFIED SHE IS A
LESBIAN
BUT NEVER SAYS SO AND what can I do about that?  If I ever write a novel
I
will title it SARAH DON'T HATE MY MARIGOLDS!

 Sarah, DON'T HATE MY MARIGOLDS!  Well, you like 1 percent of them
anyway.
Ah, fuck it, I don't care if you hate them, as they probably don't like
you
either!
JUST kidding, I think.

Andy,

The same kind of elusiveness exists in a mid-19th century English
photographer Talbot's photograph which was taken I think by a method of
direct application, rather than the camera obscura method.

So many people I know work across genre "boundaries" that I can't give one
form primacy over another.  To my way of thinking, no artistic medium or
genre is superior to another. Each expresses something a little different
from, or a little more easily than, another. My poetry has incorporated
fictional and visual techniques while operating as an "orchestrated text"
that would fit readily into musical accompaniment in several idioms. My
fiction employs playwriting and screenwriting techniques. I seem to need to
cross boundaries regularly to achieve the expression I seek. It's nothing
new. We've had at least 50 years of mixed-media in the United States and
other countries, possibly 100.

Aside from differing tastes, what's the big deal?

I write novels principally because the form fascinates me. I am a lyric poet
and there were times when I felt constricted and restless within the line, I
wanted the space and architecture of long prose. Epic fantasy seems to me to
be a logical extension of poetry, the contemporary form of epic poetry,
which were popular art forms in their day. I don't see anything wrong with
popular art forms. I doubt I'll write another series though. My other
published novel is a poetic non-narrative memoir/fiction/essay of around 100
pages. I have various plans for others. One day I'd like to write a prose
piece as perfect as Dubliners, in the spirit of feeling that one's reach
should exceed one's grasp. Poetry has always taken care of herself.

All best

Aldon,

I've read Epigramititis. It's quite an extraordinary book. Centuries from
now, perhaps we'll be remembered in the way that we are read about. To mimic
Catullus seemed to be Johnson's idea here, truth be sometimes damned,
sometimes not; and in the process, to rescue the idea of the epigram. The
idea of these epigrams, and indeed, their goal, seems to be wit rather than
truth. I can't say that I would use real, living people as my subjects were
I to publish something similar, but the result here is interesting, and I'm
quite sure that the best result cannot possibly be roundly dismissing the
work and writer. Certainly this doesn't belong in the bin with Holocaust
survivors raised by wolves and gun-toting Native American suburbanite moms.

So what redeems this work? Its effect, its longevity, its referentially
dense and rich dictionary-like quality, to name a few. I was thrilled
reading this, asking myself, "Is this true? Did Poet X really do that?"
Unbelievable as it may seem, I didn't believe most of it. I tend not to
believe most of what I read. I sought many of the answers to other
questions: what about the Will Alexander epigram is false? Moreover, what
does the Alexander epigram's falsehood suggest about both its subject and
the LANGUAGE poets? It's interesting to see the duality of focus, the
meta-reference that we don't get from modern fiction.  The truth being
implicit in most novels, the characters are false, and the reader can make
out the difference. Johnson has turned the circus tent on its bum. No longer
can we be safe in imagining that certain fates don't befall real, living
people. We are left with shuffling through tabloidal gems, some true, some
less true, some false. Using falsity as a basis for dismissal of such a rich
and provocative reversal of our standards of "fact" and "truth" seems as if
we're setting ourselves up to be duped by lesser daring and wit.

I agree. No big deal. Again, why shouldn't a painter get his hands dirty with some sculpter? Or a still photographer turn to film? & didn't someone mentioned the verse novel? Hybrids have been around since... at least a century.

from, or a little more easily than, another. My poetry has incorporated
fictional and visual techniques while operating as an "orchestrated text"
that would fit readily into musical accompaniment in several idioms. My
fiction employs playwriting and screenwriting techniques. I seem to need to
cross boundaries regularly to achieve the expression I seek. It's nothing
new. We've had at least 50 years of mixed-media in the United States and
other countries, possibly 100.

Aside from differing tastes, what's the big deal?

Aldon,

That book's not only not a hoax, it's a terrific book. I don't have it at
hand right now, so can't attest to the intelligibility of your own "illin'
epigram," but I'd wager that you'd agree that some higher truths get said
best by tinier, humorous falsehoods, so that "Not a single Language poet
has ever said a single word about Will Alexander" points rather
magnificently to the overwhelming middle class whiteness of Language
poetry. Kent Johnson, of course, could say this all much better and throw
in a guffawable or two besides. But then he's not here, still languishing
under the banishment from these pristine List premises, dating back, what,
*nine* years now?

The book's available here: http://www.blazevox.org/bk-kj.htm
and is a delight, a savage delight.

Best,
John

well, there is so much to sort through here that I won't try to address all of
it -- I wouldn't call my comment dismissive -- I suggested that the work, and
the author, might be a hoax,,,,, which I had thought would alert readers to my
own impishness in response -- I have reason to believe Kent exists, but he may
well exist for me much in the way that some poet named "Aldon Nielsen" (we may
note in passing that no book of poems signed "Aldon Nielsen" has ever appeared,
though there are five books of poetry that have been published by the guy this
seems to refer to) will exit for readers of EPIGRAMITITIS.

yes -- truth some times be damned/sometimes not -- there is not time today to
get into the philosophical questions around truth and poetry -- but let's say
for the moment that the majority of readers will probably judge a claim within
a poem such as "there is no emperor but the emperor of ice cream" differently
from such a statement as "Not a single Language poet has said a single word
about Will Alexander."  I'm not sure how to read your queston, "what about the
Will Alexander epigram is false" in light of what you say leading up to that
question.  It's a line that would strike most people who note that Alexander
was published by Messerli as odd on its face.  I suppose some may choose not to
count Messerli as a Language poet, for all I know Messerli himself doesn't
claim to be a language poet, but that aside, the epigram makes a demonstrably
untrue remark -- a quick google, for just one instance, will bring you to this:

"I take great heart to read the writing of Will Alexander, a poet whose
concerns seem almost obsessively personal. I donâ€™t know the man and so have
no sense if he is conscious as to what a major political claim he is making in
staking out this territory for himself. The fact that he is publishing so
widely is hopefully a sign that conditions spelled out by that little table
above might be open to change in the future. "





That's Ron Silliman, who I think most readers of the epigrams would take for a
Language poet.





So that the real question turns out to be, what do we make of an assertion in a
poem whose author had to have known that it wasn't true?  which in turn gets us
back to your more intriguing question, what does the epigram's falsehood
suggest about both its subject and the Language poets?  Well, I'd like to hear
your answer to your own question . . .





No, this doesn't belong in the bin alongside Holocaust survivors raised by
wolves -- but I'm not at all clear why you would toss the non-native American
housewife who did not run with the Crips in the bin while rescuing the epigrams
-- if that hoax memoir is worthy literature, isn't it still worthy literature
once you know it's a hoax?





and you'll have to explain for me how the "longevity" of a book published last
year redeems it . . . You've got me scratching my head over that one --





I think the Epigrams are every bit as good as the poetry of the Spectra poets,
which I did not throw in any bin and still occassionally read --

Ah, for the days when Poetry and Story worked in each other's service
-- those glory days before writing was "invented" in the Fertile
Crescent, the golden age of oracular transmission!  The primacy of
Mnemosyne!

In 1871 Rimbaud wrote, "In Greece ... words and music gave a rhythm
to Action.  Afterward music and rhymes became toys, pastimes."  He
was referring to how Poetry was the way Story was told -- its
metrical devices were the rhythm of the action, what made those long
ass epics memorable to tellers and listeners.  Once writing was
invented poor Poetry had to make its way alone.   And we forgot that
Memory was the mother of the Muses.

I don't know -- I just finally finished a novel that I worked on for
twenty years, with no promise of agent, publisher, movie rights,
whatever.  I've also written short fiction, essays, articles and a
play, though I'm primarily a poet.  Sometimes the content seems right
for a novel, sometimes for a short story, sometimes for a poem.   In
other words, "Form follows function" (a phrase usually attributed to
the architect Louis Sullivan, but I think he got it from a
sculptor).  Some novels changed my life as a teenager ("The Heart Is
A Lonely Hunter") just like some poems did ("Sunflower Sutra").  I
don't think we should take what passes for novels these days in
America, the crap that's crapped out by most mainstream publishing
houses, and decide that THAT'S exemplary of the form.  It most
certainly is NOT.  A novel is a lived expression of experience, just
like poetry is.  Has anyone mentioned Kawabata Yasunari's PALM OF THE
HAND STORIES, in which he combined the shortest form (the haiku) with
the longest form (the novel)?

Any good suggestions and/or appraisals - from ancient to contemporary??
 I remember Kathy Acker did some - maybe they were wonderfully scandalous or may be not intended that way at all -  auto/fictional or 'real' celebrations and/or satires of sexual encounters with some now well known language poets before such bodies were even formally identified as such - vaguely remember them as printed in small, stapled editions at Kinkos before Kinkos was Kinkos.

Dear Poet,
=20
As you may have heard, the Colrain Poetry Manuscript Conference, a
unique and exciting conference designed for poets with a book-length
manuscript, has been a tremendous success, drawing accomplished poets
from all over the country and overseas. The conference has been created
for poets who are either ready to publish a book-length manuscript or
who feel they need a reality check on their current
manuscript-in-progress.  =20
Since our first conference, in March of 2006, sixteen manuscripts have
been accepted for publication. (Read more HERE
<http://www.colrainpoetry.com/May/omnis-news.htm> .)
=20
On May 2, 2008, the eleventh group of poets will meet in Colrain,
Massachusetts. The conference will last three days and includes Jeffrey
Levine, editor and publisher of Tupelo Press, Susan Kan, founder and
director of Perugia Press as well as workshop leaders Ellen Dore Watson
(editorial board, Alice James Press) and Joan Houlihan (poetry editor,
Del Sol Press). =20

Complete information and application can be found here:

Information on other upcoming conferences can be found here:
http://www.colrainpoetry.com/
=20
The Colrain Poetry Manuscript conference is designed to place poets on a
realistic path toward book publication. If you feel you have a
manuscript ready for publication, if you have received a rejection and
don't know why, if your manuscript has achieved finalist or
semi-finalist standing in a contest, or if you simply want to gain an
understanding of how publishers and editors work behind the scenes
before submitting your manuscript, then this conference is for you.=20
=20
I hope you will join us!=20

Best Wishes,
Joan Houlihan, Founder & Director

Attendees say:
=20
"The Colrain Manuscript Conference managed to pack into a weekend what a
lot of grad school teachers never had time to do in their classes or
individually: offer finishing touches to a manuscript eager to be picked
up by a publisher."
Steve Fellner, Brockport, NY
=20
"...It was a goldmine for me especially, removed as I am from the
academic world and from a community of serious poets."
LouAnn Muhm, Park Rapids, MN, Teacher, Creative Writing
=20
"...extremely helpful to hear responses to the other manuscripts. I
learned as much or more from the critiques of others' manuscripts as I
did from the critique of mine."
Mary Crow, Fort Collins, CO, Poet Laureate of Colorado
=20
" Attending the Colrain Manuscript Conference was undoubtedly the most
profound poetry experience I=92ve ever had. What I learned in =
forty-eight
hours will be with me for years to come."  Tracy Kroetsky, Berkley, CA=20
=20
"...My consultation completely changed the way I view the manuscript.
There is nothing like what you are providing. Kudos!" Dawn Fewkes,
Horseheads, NY
=20
"...The Colrain conference was everything I'd hoped it would be and
more. I feel well on my way, now, to a publishable manuscript." Pat
Lowry Collins, MA

albion definitely is a novel but even if you don't think so patchen also
wrote shy pornographer and at least one or 2 other novels
albion is in joyce-ian mode very experimental for its time  as is his

Thanks, Wystan. Is Reading Room online??
 Just reading Hank Lazar's review/refleciton on On Kawara's collaborative book on the body and achitecture.  Be interested in the connections you make with Ron and Acker.

Dear Members of the Small Press Traffic Community:

It is with great regret that the Board of Small Press Traffic (SPT) announc=

forward to helping guide the organization through this time of transition, =
we also want to take a moment to acknowledge our deep gratitude to Elizabet=
h for leaving SPT in a position of stability and strength. SPT=E2=80=99s ne=
w leadership will inherit a strong organization, as well as the large and p=
assionate audience Elizabeth was key to expanding over the last seven years=
. In terms of outreach, programming, and fiscal management, Elizabeth has b=
een extremely effective and will be a true challenge to replace. At the sam=
e time, we are confident that her leadership has given SPT the basic tools =
to succeed and grow during the organization=E2=80=99s next phase.=20

Since its inception, Small Press Traffic has always relied on the vigorous =
input and participation of the local writing community to sustain our missi=
on and independence. Given the upcoming leadership transitions and current =
funding climate, we will welcome continued community involvement and suppor=
t more than ever. We are eager to include feedback on how best to move forw=
ard, so be on the lookout for announcements on SPT=E2=80=99s transitional p=
rocess and opportunities to get involved.

Dear Friends,

I'm grateful for seven fabulous, illuminating years at Small Press Traffic.=
 However, I have decided against returning as director when my year's leave=
 is up in July, 2008. I will no doubt be going on to other literary and non=
profit projects. For now I'm happily engrossed in caring for my two young k=
ids.

SPT has proven over the years to be limber, deep and strong in doing its pa=
rt to maintain a relevant US literature by attending to culturally diverse =
innovation. I look forward to being a smaller part of its continuing advent=
ure.

Vive la SPT.

Elizabeth Treadwell

Talk: Kevin Killian: Go Get Me a Big Grave: Recent Excavations in the Jack
Spicer Papers at The Bancroft Library

Peter Gizzi and Kevin Killian have been re-editing Spicer's poems and other
work and, in spring 2004, were able to take advantage of the gift Holt
Spicer, Jack's younger brother, and Robin Blaser, Spicer's best friend and
literary executor, made to the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley. When Spicer
died suddenly (summer 1965), he left behind a big trunk of papers, which
Blaser eventually took away with him to Vancouver BC and out of which he
edited the magnificent Collected Books of Jack Spicer (Black Sparrow, 1975)=
.
The surprises have been numerous, not only a sizable cache of previously
unseen material, but enough supporting work to put the poems we know into a
radically different context. And as well, the existence of dozens of
Spicer's notebooks, each enough to make a grown man cry. Killian=B9s talk wil=
l
tell what it all felt like and what he and Gizzi are doing next. With Lew
Ellingham, Kevin Killian has written often on the life and work of the
American poet Jack Spicer [1925-65] and co-edited Spicer=B9s posthumous books
The Train of Thought and The Tower of Babel. Currently Killian and Peter
Gizzi are preparing a new edition of Spicer=B9s collected poetry for Wesleyan
University Press. Killian's next book of poetry will be all about Kylie
Minogue: Action Kylie will appear in the autumn of 2008.


Wednesday, April 9, 8 PM
Anselm Berrigan & Benjamin Friedlander

Anselm Berrigan is the author of three books of poetry (all published by
Edge Books), the most recent being Some Notes on My Programming (2006). He'=
s
recently completed a longer poem entitled "Have A Good One" that Cy Press
will be putting out this spring, and is Co-Chair, Writing of the Bard MFA
program. Also the new Poetry Editor for The Brooklyn Rail. He is a former
Artistic Director of the Poetry Project, a 2007 NYFA fellow in poetry, and
co-edited, with Alice Notley and Edmund Berrigan, The Collected Poems of Te=
d
Berrigan, published in 2005 by UC Press. He'd like to disfigure his writing
with toothless grins, so that's an aim, at the moment. Benjamin Friedlander
is the author of The Missing Occasion of Saying Yes (Subpress) and the
forthcoming Citizen Cain (Salt Press), and the editor of Robert Creeley's
Selected Poems, 1945-2005 (California). He teaches poetry and poetics at th=

There was also a novel in which a Welsh poet surprisingly like Dylan
Thomas is killed by a dentist. Peter Viereck maybe?

Subject:      Hilton Obenzingers New Novel!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hilton Obenzinger (a poet, too) has written a moving and wonderful new autobiographical novel, BUSY DYING (293 pages, $19.95; Chax Press), with a great design by Jeff Clark.

 Hilton - whose "Meditations" on politics et al occasionally appear on this list - was part of the occupation and strike at Columbia University in 1968. Some of his cohorts occupying buildings and particpating in the melee included Paul Auster, David Shapiro, Sharon Olds, Ntozake Shange, Thulani Davis, David Lehman among others. Many of them were students of Kenneth Koch who makes an appearance in the faculty's cordon sanitaire around Low Library - partly to help fend off the jocks who were dying to invade and beat the whatever out of these "pinkos" and partly to prevent the left-wing students from supplying the strikers. In a sweet 'novel' moment, Koch looks up at his students in the open windows to ask, "Are you  writing any poems."  Hilton says several of them immediately knocked off a bunch of collaborative poems, some of the worst poems imaginable. So much for poetry and 'mentor love' under pressure.

 Like no few slow reading, language relishing folks on this list, I don't have the patience for the usual long-haul-not-so-sensuous novel. I liked this one very much! A generational moment (at least, for me, tho via the west coast), this one captures the "survivor" plus cultural ambiance of growing up in 50's-60's New York, the passionate refusal to support the war in Vietnam, the torment around black and white civil rights organizations, folks and strategies, a combined fun and gregarious sense of anxiety, let alone the imaginative 'happening' character of staging a national media spectacle, plus his early experience of becoming a writer, even writing National Enquirer-type sensationalism. The book, however, hardly stays stuck in 60's narcissism.   Hilton goes West - Yukon and Alaska then California Indian reservation and a life on the left, as well as meeting the demons of growing up to become both writer and teacher, as well as staying politically alert and committed.
 (Hilton has been working on a conference commemorating Columbia 1968, and there will be reading of writers who took part -- including Hilton, Paul Auster, and others mentioned earlier -- on Saturday night April 26. Check out the schedule for the conference at  http://www.columbia1968.info/. I won't be able to get there.)

 Hilton teaches writing at Stanford and, one day, as the book relates, a Stanford student out of the blue comes into his office to show him a 1980's Long Island high school humor magazine named "Hilton Obenzinger." For those of us variously in the teaching biz, it's fun to see Hilton respond to the narratives of his students. Ah, just one example. The scholarship student raised partly homeless on the streets is drawn to write about her potential kinship with Horatio  Alger only to discover Alger's complicated sexual past with young boys - banished from his New England ministry and so forth.

 If you want to have a good hug with a history of which much of so-called "Red State" America and its Fox-driven media have spent so much of the last 40 years trying to erase, BUSY DYING gives a good sense of how somone has tried to stay sane these many years with a sense of humor in the face of such erasure,  this is one novel by a poet that I can heartily recommend.

 O, yes, I am told you can get it direct from Chax's website, Amazon, or SPD and, if you are lucky, if you still have one, your local bookstore.
  Hilton - when I shared this with him -  sent me a blurb by David Shapiro:


   In almost all this wonderful memoir novel, Hilton Obenzinger has been true to his life and the drawing is strong and life-size. If he forgets that I was beaten up, he remembers quite well what a brat I was. His
   skepticism is one thing; the pathos can be very convincing. It's a book about the Holocaus survivors and the price they paid to change their deepest names. A poet, as in the marvellous "NY on Fire," Obenzinger does something better than research, he tries with dayglo and phosphorescent humor to make that time breathe again. It had to be
   called a novel, though like baggy novels, almost anything can be put into this book and not, as his teacher Koch once said, smell it up. Like a city at its center, and human pluck and revolt along all other edges.
 Well, let's give three cheers for enthusiam while our fading buddies - George Bush & Company - in some fit of familiar nostalgia re-ignite the Cold War with Russia, putting Nato and our rockets on their borders.  The "Hell  Realms", yes, do they loved them, indeed.

Subject: Re: Epigramititis: 118 Living American Poets

well, there is so much to sort through here that I won't try to address all =
of
it -- I wouldn't call my comment dismissive -- I suggested that the work, an=
d
the author, might be a hoax,,,,, which I had thought would alert readers to =
my
own impishness in response -- I have reason to believe Kent exists, but he m=
ay
well exist for me much in the way that some poet named "Aldon Nielsen" (we m=
ay
note in passing that no book of poems signed "Aldon Nielsen" has ever appear=
ed,
though there are five books of poetry that have been published by the guy th=
is
seems to refer to) will exit for readers of EPIGRAMITITIS.

yes -- truth some times be damned/sometimes not -- there is not time today t=
o
get into the philosophical questions around truth and poetry -- but let's sa=
y
for the moment that the majority of readers will probably judge a claim with=
in
a poem such as "there is no emperor but the emperor of ice cream" differentl=
y
from such a statement as "Not a single Language poet has said a single word
about Will Alexander."  I'm not sure how to read your queston, "what about t=
he
Will Alexander epigram is false" in light of what you say leading up to that
question.  It's a line that would strike most people who note that Alexander
was published by Messerli as odd on its face.  I suppose some may choose not=
 to
count Messerli as a Language poet, for all I know Messerli himself doesn't
claim to be a language poet, but that aside, the epigram makes a demonstrabl=
y
untrue remark -- a quick google, for just one instance, will bring you to th=
is:

"I take great heart to read the writing of Will Alexander, a poet whose
concerns seem almost obsessively personal. I don=92=C4=F4t know the man and=
 so have
no sense if he is conscious as to what a major political claim he is making =
in
staking out this territory for himself. The fact that he is publishing so
widely is hopefully a sign that conditions spelled out by that little table
above might be open to change in the future. "





That's Ron Silliman, who I think most readers of the epigrams would take for=
 a
Language poet.





So that the real question turns out to be, what do we make of an assertion=
 in a
poem whose author had to have known that it wasn't true?  which in turn gets=
 us
back to your more intriguing question, what does the epigram's falsehood
suggest about both its subject and the Language poets?  Well, I'd like to he=
ar
your answer to your own question . . .





No, this doesn't belong in the bin alongside Holocaust survivors raised by
wolves -- but I'm not at all clear why you would toss the non-native America=
n
housewife who did not run with the Crips in the bin while rescuing the epigr=
ams
-- if that hoax memoir is worthy literature, isn't it still worthy literatur=
e
once you know it's a hoax?





and you'll have to explain for me how the "longevity" of a book published la=
st
year redeems it . . . You've got me scratching my head over that one --





I think the Epigrams are every bit as good as the poetry of the Spectra poet=
s,
which I did not throw in any bin and still occassionally read --

Book Launch & Poetry Reading: Black Dog, Black Night: a
groundbreaking compendium of contemporary Vietnamese poets

In celebration of the recently published anthology, Black Dog, Black
Night: Contemporary Vietnamese Poetry (Milkweed Editions), three
Vietnamese-American contributors, Truong Tran, Hoa Nguyen, and Nguyen
Do will read their poetry.

     This groundbreaking anthology presents the true picture of a
poetry that had been suppressed in Vietnam due to Soviet-influenced
censorship.  Projected by the government largely as a sentimental
folk poetry, Vietnamese poetry since 1954 has in fact possessed the
same variety as contemporary American poetry:  radical modernism,

Murat,

The Talbot photographs I can find are lovely. I have a photographer friend
who loves old development processes (she's carved an appreciation of
daguerretypes into me)--I'll have to ask her about calotypes/talbotypes.

This question of poetry v. fiction has been on my mind for the last couple =
of months.  I think I just get confused because when I sit down to write I =
am in a space of possibility, not in a space of fiction necessarily, even t=
hough I write what you could call stories.  For a while now I have found my=
self in a community where I am one of the only ones who doesn't write "poet=
ry," and this has partly to do with the fact that I often feel disconnected=
 from other "fiction" writers, maybe for the same reasons poets do.  I forg=
et that the poets and I are doing such impossibly different things, but lat=
ely am fairly regularly reminded.  The reading series I co-curate (Red Rove=
r) is sometimes referred to by poets as a poetry series, even though it's n=
ever been labled that by me or by the other curator.  I am interested in WR=
ITING.  Maybe I'm just surprised at this need to section off a space that s=
eems in its nature so open.  Because of this divisiveness I've almost gotte=
n to the point where I dislike the word poetry, and yet I often love work t=
hat defines itself as such.

Alison,

Thank you for your very sane and sober analysis/justification of/for your
reasons for moving from poetry to prose, which I imagine still retain a
symbiotic relationship in your repertoire. There seems to be more than a
fair share of emotion flying around about this subject, but just as a
contemporary artist might use painting, photogrpahy, video, sculpture, etc.
as part of his or her body of work, I see no reason why writers shouldn't
also use different forms without feeling that they have to justify
themselves.  I am at the other end of the spectrum to you as far as duration
is concerned, I enjoy writing short, spare poems, minimal in both subject
and execution and I also enjoy writing short stories where the widest
possible narrative can be driven by the smallest amount of written material.
I am also aware that like painting and photography, prose and poetry can
feed off and energise each other.  So often these days on the jacket blurbs
of books you can read "Poetically written' or "Brought alive through its
poetic descriptions" or "A poetic testament". Textual architecture aside,
neither form is of course exclusive unto itself, so why quibble?

Dear all,

After years of planning we are pleased to launch bpNichol.ca, an
online public archive of the works of bpNichol and his collaborators.
Here (http://www.bpnichol.ca) you will find audio, digitized print
materials, photographs, links and eventually video, critical articles
and curated exhibitions.

The site was developed by the Artmob project in collaboration with
Ellie Nichol, and is designed as a not-for-profit community
initiative. It is intended as the start of a process, and we encourage
everyone to read our submission guidelines if you have material you
would like to contribute or an idea for an exhibition of bp's work.

Artmob is a York University-based research project dedicated to
building accessible public archives of Canadian art. Over the coming
years Artmob will add tools to improve the browsing and cataloguing.
It will also provide novel approaches to intellectual property,
encouraging contributors to identify themselves and set the terms of
use for their works. Artmob hopes that a spirit of fair dealing will
assist in getting artistic materials out of shoeboxes and filing
cabinets and into the world where they belong. bpNichol.ca is Artmob's
pilot project.

Please explore and enjoy!

http://www.bpnichol.ca

best, Lori Emerson

hmmmm . . . upon reading the first few Yasusada poems that I caught in print, I
speculated that it was a hoax (and assumed the editor was in on it) -- I
obviously had not read the whole -- I didn't think I was thereby dismissing it
-- I did think I was thereby assigning it to a much beloved genre --

Epigramitits, which I have since read all of, does indeed appear to posit
opinions often based on one or two passages of work that Kent clearly has not
read much of -- so I guess that makes it journalistic reductivism -- I don't
think that laebling something a hoax has anything to do with making any
judgment about the quality of the work -- THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF AN EX-COLOURED
MAN was published with no author's name attached and was, as event, something
of a hoax, and it is also one of the greatest works of 20th century American
Literature -- REPORT FROM IRON MOUNTAIN was entirely a hoax but was also
extremely well done and sparked crucial debates about defense policy and the
economy --

I had thought that suggesting Kent Johnson was a hoax was sufficient signal
that I wasn't exactly writing a book review or rendering a judgment on the
writing --

The Aldon Nielsen who appears in EPIGRAMITITIS is entirely a hoax -- so?

Emperor of Ice Cream to sit down at a town hall meeting? I think all poetry,

for the moment that the majority of readers will probably judge a claim within

from such a statement as "Not a single Language poet has said a single word
about Will Alexander."  I'm not sure how to read your queston, "what about the
Will Alexander epigram is false" in light of what you say leading up to that
question.  It's a line that would strike most people who note that Alexander
was published by Messerli as odd on its face.  I suppose some may choose not to
count Messerli as a Language poet, for all I know Messerli himself doesn't
claim to be a language poet, but that aside, the epigram makes a demonstrably
untrue remark -- a quick google, for just one instance, will bring you to this:>

widely is hopefully a sign that conditions spelled out by that little table

Aldon,

I call anything that posits an opinion based on one or two passages
dismissive.  I called your email dismissive because labeling anything a
"hoax" is journalistic reductivism -- neatly packaged tidbits for easy
consumption -- and dismissive in the same way that merely labeling Frey or
other "hoaxers" is dismissive in not accounting for the quality of the
writing.

My response here was merely to vouch for a book that I've read, and one that
you --admittedly-- haven't. I do apologize if my initial response came off
as confrontational, I assure you my goal was to defend the book on its own
merit, and not to posit any theories as to the author's hyper/reality.

As for the book's longevity. It is a longevity to me, for me, as a reader,
that the book continues to affect those subjects and readers that come into
contact with it. We will see if this claim remains true.

As to your comment, returning my question of what does aforesaid epigram say
about LANGUAGE, it's a good question, and one I felt needed asking for more
than merely begging. What situations cause certain poems to exist? Are there
parades? Assassinations? Does the currency have to rise and fall for the
Emperor of Ice Cream to sit down at a town hall meeting? I think all poetry,
all language (all LANGUAGE, too) speaks to me of the world I'm living in.
One might say that's even why I read...

The hippies, "the stinking hippies," and such...

=20

Sonoma County, where I lived for 17 years and, largely, developed a good
deal of the most enduring parts of my personality and worldview was, to
be sure, one of the country's most primary centers of "Hippie culture."
I arrived there in 1982 - partially because a trustworthy and wise
sociology professor from undergraduate school said "you belong in
Northern California" and another

mentor, a Gestalt Therapist, turned me on to a very fine humanistic
psychotherapy training institute out in Bodega, near the coast, where I
went to study to become a therapist.  Within a few months, I met and
started a wonderful relationship with another budding hippy, or
"neo-hippy," as we called ourselves, knowing that we were one generation
younger than the 60's generation that we looked up to and emulated.  E.
was in fact the daughter of a very well established and so-called
"conservative" poet from Southern California, Robert Mezey, whom I met
when E. and I hitchhiked from Oakland to Baja in 1983 and stayed at his
house in Pomona along the way.  It wasn't until I met David Bromige in
1984 that I really took an interest in "poetry," per se.  Although I had
minored in English in undergraduate school, I preferred novelists and
prose and philosophy and psychoanalytics and such, but then David and
his pals the L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E writers seemed to be writing "stuff" that
was combination of all the above, AND MORE, and their "poetry" really
appealed to the intellectual side of me that was developing at the time
and mostly restricted to the Existentialists, Existential/Humanistic
Psychology/Psychotherapy theorists, Henry Miller, and a handful of other
philosophers.

=20

David was living in Santa Rosa at the time, not Sebastopol, where he and
his wife Cecelia reside now, but he had lived in Sebastopol in the early
80's, I think, too.  I bring up "Sebastopol" because it's one of the
coolest places for "hippies."  It's one of the areas, like Cazadero
about 15 miles further up the coast and out in "the hills," where the
original "hippies" originally began settling when they came up from San
Francisco ("the Haight") and Berkeley and Oakland in the early 70's.
Oh, they came up to Marin County, and they went further north, up to
Mendocino County, too, but Marin is so darn expensive and "upper class"
(except out in Fort Reyes and Stinson Beach and Bolinas, where poets
Kyger and Grenier and Ratcliffe live), and it's always more convenient
for me to associate "the hippy culture" with quite modest economic
means, whereas Marin has so many rich people and so much "materialism,"
but some hippies "get rich," too, so what's the use of dividing
everybody up into neat and tidy categories they cannot ultimately fit
into.  Just the same, I'll do it anyway - Sebastopol became one of the
major migration centers for the hippies, and I'm sure that half the town
remains even today the home of hundreds and hundreds of first generation
and second generation hippies.

=20

Coming from western New York, studying under 60's generation humanistic
psychology and sociology teachers in Florida, still didn't prepare me
for all the counter-culture customs and mores that E. turned me on to in
the early 1980's, but I caught on fairly quickly.  I'm refering to the
nudity, particularly.  I was already strict "vegetarian," in fact a
vegan, from my Gainseville, Florida, Hogtown Grainary "co-op grocery
store" days.  But I caught on fairly quickly.  That is, I got used to
picnics out in Two Rock (some folks familiar with David Bromige's poetry
might know his book _The Two of Rocks_) up on the hill and the swimming
pond there wearing nothing but our bathing suits, and going to public
baths, or "spas" and hot tubs, naked in public, and once even attending
a real neat birthday party where everybody, a whole bunch of "hippies"
who lived up in the hills above Santa Rosa, where all the men and women
were in their birthday suits, and the thing is that ya had to learn how
not to get an erection, and though luckily there was a pool ya could
quickly jump into when you'd been maybe sneaking peeks and thinking
certain "I'm not a full-fledged hippy and therefore don't get this
naturalism thing exactly just yet" kinds of thoughts.

=20

I'm not so sure that it takes any more courage to "write poems" than it
takes to be the only person to decline to take clothes off at a birthday
suit birthday where you're the only who doesn't strip down while 20
others are all naked and "showing off" their "lack of Uptightness," like
the one attractive, shy or reserved woman who stayed fully clothed that
afternoon or the equally reserved black man who was the only non-white
there.  I'm not so sure that it takes any more courage to write poetry
than it takes to write the kinds of novels that Henry Miller wrote or
the kind of literary criticism that Kate Millet wrote. I'm not so sure
that it takes more courage to write "experimental poetry" than it takes
to write the kind of poetry that Robert Mezey has written, or that he
and Stephen Berg included in their anthology _Naked Poetry_ that I still
have and should return to E. someday.  I'm not so sure that it takes any
more courage to write any kind of poetry than it takes to break any kind
of life script that might shackle a given individual's spirit or psyche,
and that includes scripts prescribing that that person "stay poor," live
in poverty, not write a commercially successful Children's book or
cookbook or movie script, or avoid any kind of  activity that could be
termed "materialistic."

=20

I used to, though.  And I can certainly relate to most all
"counter-culture," "hippy," anti-materialist values.  It's to those
kinds of values that I have subscribed, myself, for the most part.  But
there are people who can get all mixed up and very hurt believing that
they are "not OK" if they aspire to break ideals and seek improved
material and economic security.  Or dare to write a novel. =20

=20

Personally, if I had it to do all over again, and with the proverbial
"what I know now," I wouldn't change much of the "neo-hippy" thing that
I took to after finishing undergraduate school in 1979 and read _The
Electric Koolaid-acid Test_, Abbie Hoffmann and Ken Kesey and Timothy
Leary and Tom Robbins, and ate lots of mushrooms in the mushroom capital
of the East (Gainesville, Florida, where we used to sneak onto ranches
and farms and fill entire grocery sacks with the things back in 1980)
and went to California, where I learned that I did indeed "belong."  But
I'd goddarn have gotten a lot more aggressive (where "aggressive" has
the positive connotation that Fritz Perls gives it in _Ego, Hunger, and
Aggression_) in regard to gaining for myself a bit more "material
security," too.  There's nothing remotely wrong about choosing
non-materialistic lifestyle and values a la Thoreau or Hesse's
romanticized Siddhartha or "the Hippies," including the ones who used to
live in teepees out at the commune in Two Rock that E. took me to in the
summer of 1982, but, personally, if I myself had it to do all over
again, I would not shun money and the means to obtaining it nearly so
smugly as I did back then.  No, if I had it to do all over again, I'd
gain some of the material things and "status" and financial security
that I shunned 25 years ago.  Why?  Because it's still the same game.
Whether you can fit your entire life's material possessions into a 6' by
10' storage unit on Santa Rosa Avenue or you own three houses, two as
income properties, and one big enough for your kids to have their own
rooms before you send them to college you'll help them pay for, it's
still going to be your "counter-culture values" versus George Bush's or
Sean Hannity's values.  They're still going to force you to "compete
against" them for what you want for the world as opposed to what they
want for the world, so why subscribe to such awful financial insecurity
that you cannot even afford good legal aid if they use their control of
government to fight you if you protest them, commit civil disobedience,
become a whistle blower, or otherwise try to sabotage or resist some
project, corporation, institution, or henchmen of theirs.

=20

I am certain that a fellow like George Soros has done just as much or
more than most poets have to substantially fight or resist injustice and
inequality and crap politics and "evil."

=20

I am not sure that any poetry could have influenced me more than Henry
Miller influenced me when I was a teenager and ached like crazy to
escape small town, lower middle class, western New York "culture" and
lack thereof.

=20

I am not sure that half the most "radical" poets in the country are any
more "open-minded," "compassionate," "wise," "generous," or
"revolutionary" and "effective" than many of the psychotherapist
practitioners and theorists that I have met or read in my lifetime.  In
most case, the latter persons have seen and understood and resolved
"conflicts," "intolerances of ambivalence," "contradictions," and
"splits" between subject and object(s), person and "others," self and
"world," that pomers only write "about," that in fact often pomers would
prefer to "romanticize" or use as means to creating aesthetic objects
than actually change.  Such splits and
mental/psychodynamic/mind-body/self-world phenomena are "the juice" many
pomers use to actualize their artistic potentials even if that juice may
possibly kill them or if it in fact obstructs or retards progress in the
evolution of the collective unconscious (evolution of the human species'
consciousness). =20

=20

In most cases, there is NOT such a big split between "pomers" and, say,
these psychotherapy pioneers and others who cannot tell the difference
between a so-called truly transformational "experimental" poetry and a
School of Quietude poetry.  In most cases, they're essentially the same
folks, but I dare say it loudly and confidently, however crudely and
awkwardly, that many a non-pomer in the world today can see through and
soften the arrogance that our radical poets foist upon the world more
readily than our radical poets' verses will ever genuinely change the
social and anti-social fabrics and weltanschaungs that keep most of the
world's human population in economic and psychological chains and most
of the animals and plants in danger of becoming extinct.=20

=20

Oh, that reminds me, anybody out there enamored of msnbc.com's
_Countdown_'s Keith Olberman in the last year or so for his "radically"
"progressive" opinionating and Bush Administration
deconstructing/dismantling notice that he, along with his colleagues
Chris Matthews and Dan Abrams and David Gregory and Andrea are mostly
"preaching to the choir" these days, NOT in fact doing what is genuinely
required - slowly but surely actually changing the mindsets of the
staunch right-wing believers who "can be changed," can be "reached," but
NOT by all of us, and Keith and Gang on msnbc.com, and others at
moveon.org and additional "progressive" organizations "ramming
progressives' values and mindset down their throats," but only by more
subtle means of teaching them to, for example, experience "Disgust" that
would eventually have them throwing up what FOX News indoctrinates them
with?  What I'm saying is that Keith Olberman has consistently and
courageously and brilliantly railed against the real evildoers in the
world for 2-3 years now, but lately even _Countdown_ is becoming just
"big business" and preaching to the choir, persuading people "who
already get it" that Bush and most all right wing and most republican
trash IS the trash and the lies that they are.  But NOW, to get at the
folks who most need to be turned on to alternative critical thinking and
small changes in their mindsets, more subtle and compassionate and
"intelligent" "rhetorics" must be employed, new seeds have to be
planted, etc.  Keith and Gang are just preaching to the choir.  What
does this have to do with "poetics?"  Maybe nothing.  And I'm sure a lot
of folks don't pay much attention to the loud political concerns that I
obsess about, perhaps uselessly and stupidly, but I do think that
EVERYBODY is doing something to heal the world we've fucked up big time
of late, and I think that Keith and Chris and the gang there at
msnbc.com are on the same side most of us at the Poetics Forum are on.
Ditto the folks at moveon.org (which also includes quite a few of us,
I'm sure) and other organizations.  Well, I think that Keith and Chris
and Dan and Andrea there deal in "words" and language, and basically
need our help.  Maybe they'll never be "as radical" as we are, but they
have a more significant effect, don't they, and we should help them
avoid making the mistakes we make - including thinking we're the only
ones who know about suffering and how to lessen it (when in fact some of
us merely make a commodity out of it, suffering, and, ironically,
probably work harder at increasing it, so as to have more of it to sell
as "poetry" and poming).

 Allen, OK.  And YES.

 LET ME BE HONEST about something I hadn't mentioned earlier.  I FIRMLY

BELIEVE the poets I have known in the past (most of them at least) who

turned to novels did so because of MONEY and because of READERSHIP.  Or

wanted to be LOVED MORE or something.  (poets who NEED that much LOVE
are

always trouble!)  Poetry wasn't getting that for them, and on many
levels

they were dissatisfied.  And I LOATHE this behavior because I think it
takes

courage to write poems, TO NOT GIVE A FUCK that it's not making you
money,

or whatever it is you WANT.

=20

In the end it's a very sincere, pissed off way I had entered this

discussion!  I want the poets I have Loved to not want such nonsense
from

this world!  I hate when I find out I have cowards for friends!  I'd
rather

my family were cowards than my friends frankly.  But I DO actually find
most

novels a tedious thing to approach, besides these other reasons.

=20

In some cases it's for very different reasons that some poets write
novels,

like my friend Magdalena Zurawski, who turned to fiction for reasons
more

complicated than the above mentioned ones, but they're not my reasons to

explain.  Magdalena, who is one of my ABSOLUTE favorite people on earth
has

SLAVED over her novel THE BRUISE for seven LONG years and as I've said

before, it's an epic poem to me.  It's a poem.  When I read it (and I've

been reading it for years as it comes out of her) her poems WHICH I HAVE

ALWAYS LOVED are there, are in it, this, this thing she calls a novel.
A

NOVEL!  I will say NOOOOOOVEL slowly in a mirror a thousand times and it

still makes no entrance.

=20

If I MUST read a novel it usually needs to be a poet's novel.  I guess.

=20

Poems are my life in every way, everyday, and I no longer mean poems I'm

reading but hearing-feeling-seeing-smelling them on the streets,
unwritten,

sometimes better left unwritten.

=20

Sarah, Patchen's Journal of Albion Moonlight is not a novel?  See,
you're

getting us into the PAINFUL task of figuring out what a novel is, and I

don't know how to have that discussion.  I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT

DISCUSSION LIKE MY "STRAIGHT" WOMAN FRIEND WHO IS TERRIFIED SHE IS A
LESBIAN

BUT NEVER SAYS SO AND what can I do about that?  If I ever write a novel
I

will title it SARAH DON'T HATE MY MARIGOLDS!

=20

 Sarah, DON'T HATE MY MARIGOLDS!  Well, you like 1 percent of them
anyway.

Ah, fuck it, I don't care if you hate them, as they probably don't like
you

either!

JUST kidding, I think.

To limit oneself to discussing only one of Hesse's books is unfortunate.

What about The Glass Bead Game (otherwise known as Master Ludi), or

Steppenwolf, Journey To The East or his numerous other masterpieces - =
=3D

all

devoured by the Hippies along with their electric koolaide which was a =
=3D

true

acid test of fine literature.

This discussion reminds me of the discussion had in the late 60s when =
=3D

Miles

Davis released his Bitch's Brew or when Ornette hired James "Blood" =3D

Ulmer on

guitar and the jazz world watched sadly as fusion took control. The only

artist during that period who didn't sell out was Coltrane - perhaps =3D

that's

why a church was consecrated to him in San Francisco. And yet, one can

listen to Weather Report or the Mahavishnu Orchestra at times without

cringing provided one does not think about what could have been had many

of

these artists who had started out in avant garde jazz (Chick Corea being

a

their

late entry, could not be considered sell-outs.

Just a thought.

Subject: Siddhartha, in defense of Baby Boomers

=20

 Yes, I'm about to talk about a novel, which is ridiculous considering =
=3D

how

much I've recently railed against them on this List, but, I feel I have
=3D

to

in this case.

=20

An old friend told me about Susan Bernofsky's new translation of Hesse's

Siddhartha, saying it's amazing, actually, she said it's "sublime!"  The

link she sent me was from Barnes and Noble, and there's a descriptive =
=3D

tag on

the website under the book which reads, "Once the preferred marching =3D

song of

'60s hippies, Hermann Hesse's *Siddhartha* has returned to its rightful
=3D

high

niche in world literature."

=20

When I was in college (the very same semester I was not so politely =3D

asked to

leave) we read it for a literature class.  One of my mother's stinking

hippie friends had already turned me onto the book years before I was in

this class.  It had changed my young life, and I was happy to share that
=3D

a

few years later in college with my seemingly indifferent classmates.  =
=3D

The

professor was a crabby old guy who HATED hippies, so my original =3D

experience

with the book didn't go over well.  He said something like, "THE HIPPIES
=3D

HAD

NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE READING!  HESSE IS ART!"  (Some of my classmates

asked later if my mother could score them some acid.)

=20

I argued that my mother's generation (stinky or NOT!) REALLY DID get it,

REALLY GOT IT as a matter of fact because THEY were the ones to take

CENTURIES of layers of oppression by the balls and RUN INTO THE DARKNESS
=3D

to

reinvent the world!  The generation who gave us Civil Rights, the =3D

Women's

Movement, and Stonewall, and an awareness of FOOD and the environment, =
=3D

and,

frankly, with all of this, at its core, a bright, magnificent epiphany

of how EVERYTHING can change!  My argument was lost on my snobbish =3D

professor

who wanted to discuss the nuances of the lines, not the spiritual flux,
=3D

THE

AWAKENING!  And then I pointed out what I thought to be the obvious, =3D

which

was that to talk about the lines was to talk about the TRANSLATION of =
=3D

the

lines, not the original German, which only derailed his plans further, =
=3D

and

pissed him off further.  But, it's true, right?  Anyway, who cares!

=20

I bring all of this up because I FEEL a bit of that snobbishness in this

Barnes and Noble descriptive tag for the book's latest translation.  =3D

MAYBE

I'M WRONG, it's possible I'm conflating memory with the tag's intent.  =
=3D

But,

still, it feels kind of snobbish.  It feels similar to the words of my =
=3D

old

professor who is probably dead by now.  Of course IT COULD mean that the
=3D

new

translation is what raises the book "to its rightful high niche in world

literature."  But maybe not.  To me it sounds like it's saying, "Well, =
=3D

the

hippies screwed around with it, but NOW, NOW WE HAVE it to place on the

golden podium with our MORE REFINED tastes!"

=20

Yes, it's great literature.  I agree.  Even that older Hilda Rosner

translation (you know this version, it's a blue mass market paperback?)

makes you FEEL literature at its best in the book.  But isn't "G"reat

"L"iterature also a sense of spiritual awakening on some level?  Maybe =
=3D

it's

just me, but I've never been interested in anything (especially poems) =
=3D

if

I'm not TORN OPEN!  Of course you have to be willing to be torn open, I

think, but, if you are willing, the right thing meaning the CAPABLE =3D

thing

can, and will.

=20

Also, in my opinion, to say that Siddhartha is not showing how DEFIANT =
=3D

you

must be to achieve grace, then it is to say you don't really GET the =3D

story

as it could be for your life.  (I mean, Siddhartha told The Buddha to =
=3D

FUCK

OFF essentially, like my mother's people told their own elders to do!)

Hesse created an allegory for the Soul.  And I say "S" Soul as in a

collective BUT individual path(s).

=20

So I say HELL YES THE HIPPIES!  They weren't perfect, of course, but =3D

neither

was Siddhartha, of course.  Nor are we meant to be perfect, at least I =
=3D

hope

we aren't meant to be, because if we are we're in trouble!

I love that poem --

I guess my rephrasing of the question is a little less clear apart from the
post I was responding to at the time -- the puzzle, at least for me, is in the
reading -- what is being said about the subject in such a case?  for example,
though a post not a poem -- I suggested here that a book and its author might
be a hoax -- most readers of this list would know instantly that I had to know
neither was a hoax -- there appears to have been a difference of opinion on how
to read my suggestion.   Some thought that by suggesting the book and its
author might be a hoax  I was thereby dismissing both -- I, of course, would
never do such a thing.

I saw Alexandra, too.  I liked it but expected more from the reviews.  Still, it was nice seeing the great Russian opera singer of long ago, Galina Vishnevskaya ,acting.  No singing, of course.  Only Chaliapin could sing at what must now be her age. The camera treated her a bit too much like the monument to art her life has been which was at odds with the character she was playing.  Nevertheless, as I said, I enjoyed this movie.  Regards, Tom Savage

Sorry to see you hated hippies, Steve, while admitting to having been one.  I was, too, although I thought I was a beatnik as my involvement with Beat literature preceded the Hippies by several years.Too young to really be a beatnik.  Also I had no interest in the pop music which mostly turned them (us?) on. The drug use so prevalent in those days turned out to be almost a complete waste of time and youthful energy  Still, I miss the freedoms which were everywhere apparent in my (our) youth and which have almost completely vanished.  The younger generation now mostly, at least in New York, seems surly, money obsessed, and scared.  Regards, Tom Savage

Dr Zhivago by a great poet who wrote a great novel, Boris Pasternak, who
also provides with the novel a selection of the poetry of Zhivago.

There are several books which interweave "novelizations" and
"dramatizations" and "filmizations"of the life of Rimbaud with "actual
biography."

The novels of Roberto Bolano--a poet himself-- are filled with poets as main
and subsidiary characters, including often the narrator--

The Satyricon of Petronious may be read in a certain sense as a novel of the
adventures of a poet--

Roy, the comparison with the visual arts doesn't advance much  the =
question of  what is at stake when
poets take to fiction. The market distinction between say painting and =
photography not comparable with that between poetry and fiction. I know =
little or nothing about the US literary marketplace, but here in New =
Zealand, the rise of fiction has been at the expense of poetry, and code =
switching is one feature of the trend.

Alison,

Thank you for your very sane and sober analysis/justification of/for =
your
reasons for moving from poetry to prose, which I imagine still retain a
symbiotic relationship in your repertoire. There seems to be more than a
fair share of emotion flying around about this subject, but just as a
contemporary artist might use painting, photogrpahy, video, sculpture, =
etc.
as part of his or her body of work, I see no reason why writers =
shouldn't
also use different forms without feeling that they have to justify
themselves.  I am at the other end of the spectrum to you as far as =
duration
is concerned, I enjoy writing short, spare poems, minimal in both =
subject
and execution and I also enjoy writing short stories where the widest
possible narrative can be driven by the smallest amount of written =
material.
I am also aware that like painting and photography, prose and poetry can
feed off and energise each other.  So often these days on the jacket =
blurbs
of books you can read "Poetically written' or "Brought alive through its
poetic descriptions" or "A poetic testament". Textual architecture =
aside,
neither form is of course exclusive unto itself, so why quibble?

Go ahead and discuss away.  My reason for talking about THAT book, as I
stated, was because of the Barnes and Noble statement about hippies for THAT
particular book, which was similar to the anti-hippie statements ALSO about
THAT book from my old and irritating asshole professor.  Did you read my
post?  If you had you would have understood that I would think.

And WHY is it unfortunate?  I mean, YOU'RE now discussing these other books,
right?  So, the conversation goes forward with you, which is not
unfortunate.  I mean it's not as if I wrote a 700 page book about the
subject!  All I wrote was a handful of paragraphs.  And now you've written a
few paragraphs, and I'm writing a few more, and so on and so on.

I've received a bunch of back channeled e-mails about this, two of them from
folks on this List who want to complain to me in private about how much the
Baby Boomers destroyed the world.  One of them (DON'T WORRY SUNSHINE I WON'T
BLOW YOUR COVER!) wrote, "These are the same people who gave Ronald
Reagan the white house don't forget!"

Our current president is a Baby Boomer, so, of course not ALL of them liked
Hesse, in fact Bush probably never even read Hesse.  Wish he had, frankly.
He knew Hunter S. Thompson, but Thompson threw him out of his house when
Bush did too much coke at a party and passed out in the bathtub.  (THIS drug
use of Bush's has always irritated me because of the SHIT they put Clinton
through for smoking a little weed!  Not that I'm a fan of Clinton's since I
believe history will prove that he was one of our worst leaders EVER!)

What would have happened if Thompson had NOT thrown Bush out?  What if
Thompson and his friends had instead taken the young George Bush under their
wing with Daddy Bush working for the CIA at the time?  And Bush was close to
the radical fringes back then, hard to believe.  Well, he partied with them
at least, so, maybe he could have hung around and gotten some of that
radical juice flowing in his blood.  And maybe he would have still become
president, but a different kind of president.  A very different kind of
president.

Ever since reading Thompson's story about tossing Bush out onto the lawn
I've wondered about this.  You never can tell when you're on the edge of
changing a life.  Thompson was rather PROUD of having thrown Bush out, and
maybe he had a right to feel proud?

(BREAKING NEWS!  Poetry news!  The AMAZING Dorothea Lasky (formally trashed
on this List by the jealous and mean) has an INCREDIBLE new book out titled
TOURMALINE!  I posted about it on PhillySound just now, with links, IT'S A
GREAT BOOK!  http://PhillySound.blogspot.com<http://phillysound.blogspot.com/>
)

Now to the discussion at hand:

  Robert Zamsky wrote: >>I want those I love to do only that which I love;
anything else is a

>>There is a psychoanalytic term for this.

Robert, not sure if you're referring to the novels?  If you read carefully
you would have noticed that I was upset about friends writing novels BECAUSE
of these other things:  money, readership, etc.  For me it was a betrayal
(I'll use this word since you did as well) because they were VERY OPEN about
WHY they chose to start writing novels, for these things which had NOTHING
to do with the LOVE of writing.  And they LOVED writing poems!  Only they
never returned to them.  And frankly I LOVED the poems they LOVED to write!
It makes me sad that talented POETS I have known who sincerely enjoyed
writing poems left poetry behind because it wasn't getting them these other
phantom-things.

NOT ONE OF THEM HAS MADE IT BIG WRITING THE NOVELS, so I hope (and I do mean
this sincerely) they are at least enjoying writing the novels.

I wish they could find a way TO WRITE BOTH!  It seems, at least from what
Alison Corggon and others say in this discussion, that it IS possible.  And
this is good news.  I've already said Eileen Myles gets better and better at
writing poems even though she also now writes novels, and operas, and all
the other things she writes so brilliantly.

Just wanted to clear that up before you go too far into your case study of
my condition.  But by all means go ahead and cheer me up with some
analysis.  Is there medication at the end of it?  I HOPE SO!  I prefer a
mushroom omelet with my medication Dr. Zamsky!  PLEASE!  (sorry I forgot the
PLEASE at first!)  (I hope you have a sense of humor?  I actually burst out
laughing when I read your response!  That was FUN!)  (and, Dr. Zamsky has a
nice RING to it, don't you think!?)  (and, will you wear a white coat?)  (a
white coat would be nice I think.)  (but if you don't have a white one
then a blue one, or a green one, but not a brown one.)  (OK, a brown one if
you must, but not a black one. analysis is not a funeral.)  (at least I
think it's not.)

Tenaciously yours,
CAConrad

Old time Beat pal Conrad Rooks had made a film of the same name after the
Hesse novel in 1972.
It was a great film I thought, refeshing and personalized, if not sumptously
innovative, starring Sashi Kapoor
and Simi Gerewal, both noted Indian stars of that era. Hemanta Kumar
Mukherjee wrote an unforgettable score
for the film making good use of classical Tagorian music.

This didn't go to the list for some reason. Aldon's more recent post
regarding autobio of an ex-colored man is also a good example
(although I prefer "black no more" of the novels dealing with passing
during that era). but there are lots of cases of things dealing with
fraud all through literature. there's a certain sense of fraudulence
in a couple of the canterbury tales, wife of bath and the summoners
tale if I remember right. There's a hoaxish element to don quixote.
almost all of shakespeare's best comedy's have some element of fraud
to them. there are whole books built as confidence games like the
manuscript found at saragossa, and the topic of deceit is as greek as
greek tragedy gets. it also was one of the big obssesions of William
Gaddis and played a part in every novel he wrote from the
recognitions to agape agape

Hey, I hear you. I just happen to be an aging hippy who spent a great deal
of time digging Hesse. I made the mistake a while back of referring to
Rosemary Waldrop's Burning Deck Press as Burning Bush Press but, then again,
maybe this was Freudian. And Bush follows a long line of not very astute
presidents. Probably the last was John F. Well, Carter was decent anyway.
But then, I'm just a Canuck watching from the sidelines and considering we
have Bush's buddy Harper we can't talk very much. Me, I gave up on politics
in the 80s and haven't looked back. The way I see it, one skunk stinks as
bas as another.

Go ahead and discuss away.  My reason for talking about THAT book, as I
stated, was because of the Barnes and Noble statement about hippies for THAT
particular book, which was similar to the anti-hippie statements ALSO about
THAT book from my old and irritating asshole professor.  Did you read my
post?  If you had you would have understood that I would think.

And WHY is it unfortunate?  I mean, YOU'RE now discussing these other books,
right?  So, the conversation goes forward with you, which is not
unfortunate.  I mean it's not as if I wrote a 700 page book about the
subject!  All I wrote was a handful of paragraphs.  And now you've written a
few paragraphs, and I'm writing a few more, and so on and so on.

I've received a bunch of back channeled e-mails about this, two of them from
folks on this List who want to complain to me in private about how much the
Baby Boomers destroyed the world.  One of them (DON'T WORRY SUNSHINE I WON'T
BLOW YOUR COVER!) wrote, "These are the same people who gave Ronald
Reagan the white house don't forget!"

Our current president is a Baby Boomer, so, of course not ALL of them liked
Hesse, in fact Bush probably never even read Hesse.  Wish he had, frankly.
He knew Hunter S. Thompson, but Thompson threw him out of his house when
Bush did too much coke at a party and passed out in the bathtub.  (THIS drug
use of Bush's has always irritated me because of the SHIT they put Clinton
through for smoking a little weed!  Not that I'm a fan of Clinton's since I
believe history will prove that he was one of our worst leaders EVER!)

What would have happened if Thompson had NOT thrown Bush out?  What if
Thompson and his friends had instead taken the young George Bush under their
wing with Daddy Bush working for the CIA at the time?  And Bush was close to
the radical fringes back then, hard to believe.  Well, he partied with them
at least, so, maybe he could have hung around and gotten some of that
radical juice flowing in his blood.  And maybe he would have still become
president, but a different kind of president.  A very different kind of
president.

Ever since reading Thompson's story about tossing Bush out onto the lawn
I've wondered about this.  You never can tell when you're on the edge of
changing a life.  Thompson was rather PROUD of having thrown Bush out, and
maybe he had a right to feel proud?

Dr Zhivago by a great poet who wrote a great novel, Boris Pasternak, who
also provides with the novel a selection of the poetry of Zhivago.

There are several books which interweave "novelizations" and
"dramatizations" and "filmizations"of the life of Rimbaud with "actual
biography."

The novels of Roberto Bolano--a poet himself-- are filled with poets as main
and subsidiary characters, including often the narrator--

The Satyricon of Petronious may be read in a certain sense as a novel of the
adventures of a poet--

Adventures in the Skin Trade by Dylan Thomas--a young aspiring writer/poet

Writer, film maker, musician and culture terrorist Joe Ambrose has a
penchant for digging around the cultural
margins and teasing out of the shadows relevant irreverance,
countercultural phenomena, outside and (often)
explosive art of pivotal significance. Subject matter and artists
regularly
delineated by sitting on the periphery of
popular culture. His written output includes the novels Serious Time and
Too Much Too Soon.  Moshpit Culture, a
blood stained and sweat-soaked inside investigation on hardcore dancing;
several historical studies of the war of
Irish Independance including the best selling Dan Breen and The IRA and
is
currently editing an anthology of writings
by the revolutionary Irish Brotherhood, the Fenians. His writing also
appears in numerous magazines, journals and
collections.
In 1992 he co-organized the Here To Go Show in Dublin. This mixed media
art
show was a celebration of the
cultural impact and significance of the work of Tangier Beat Scenesters
Brion Gysin and William Burroughs. The event
was filmed extensively and the movie Destroy All Rational Thought
documented many aspects of this week long arts
show. It was initially released on video and then later, as an enhanced
DVD.  He is a DJ in art hip hop combo Islamic
Diggers and has been living in Marrakesh, Morocco for the past 7 months
hanging with the likes of the Sufi mystic
trance musicians The Gnoua Brotherhood of Marrakesh. Ambrose previously
produced the Brothers for the William
Burroughs tribute CD, 10% File Under Burroughs, which also features John
Cale, Paul Bowles, Marianne Faithfull,
Chuck Prophet, Herbert Huncke and The Master Musicians of Joujouka.
Whilst Ambrose has been getting down in Africa, the Islamic Diggers track
William Burroughs Dont Play Guitar has
featured on the soundtrack to a new Burroughs documentary, Words of
Advice,
which also features Patti Smith, Hal
Willner and Bill Laswell. Another Diggers track, Hashishin, was included
along with work by Stockhausen in a January
’08 sound installation, Cut Up, curated by Copenhagen’s Karriere in
conjunction with the Danish Museum of Modern
Art. Ambrose has previously worked with Anita Pallenberg, Richard Hell,
Chrissie Hynde and Herbert Huncke. He is
Literary Editor of LA-based magazine, Outsideleft.com. In 2007 he was
asked
by Iggy Pop to write the sleevenotes
for Escaped Maniacs, the Iggy and the Stooges DVD package. His extreme
travel writing book, Chelsea Hotel
Manhattan has recently been published by Headpress and a new edition of
Moshpit is about to be published by
Tsunami. Joe talked very recently with me about his latest ventures.

Joe, give me some background on the Tsunami edition of Moshpit.....
Moshpit Culture first came out in 2001 and reflected what I’d been up to
in
the preceding years. I first got dragged
into a moshpit, rather improbably, at a Shane McGowan show. I love his
work
but at that time, the late 90s, I was
listening almost exclusively to hip hop, reggae, and the kind of punkish
metal exemplified by Slayer, Queens of the
Stone Age, the Beastie Boys and RATM. I was going to hip hop shows
whenever
I could, I saw Snoop a load of times
and I was kind of following Gregory Isaacs, the Cool Ruler, around the
place. I must have seen Gregory in action
about forty times back then. But mainly it was hardcore acts and Slipknot
and Rancid and the likes.

So what attracted you to the Moshpit?
I liked the fraternity that I found at those hardcore shows, the openness
and the willingness to experiment with new
people and to build a new nation which was not of this world. People had
talked about experiencing these feelings in
the rave scene, which immediately preceded the emergence of the new punk
era but I didn’t go for that because I
like music and most of the music associated with rave culture was second
rate, doesn’t stand the test of time, was
mildly diverting at the time but not the real thing. Also, when they were
talking about this spirit of collective
fraternity and stuff, what they were really talking about was the drugs
they were taking.

Ecstasy and a trashy peace and love vibe. The moshpit to me seems to work
on a completly different level....
Moshers were often far more solid sort of individuals. A lot of moshers
took good care of their bodies, didn’t do
huge amounts of drugs, kept down day jobs or, if very young, lived far
away
from the city centre with their families
in hugely repressive social environments which caused them to see moshing
and much of what went with it as
hugely liberating.

The publishers, Tsunami, are based in Italy, arent they?
There is already a metal record label in Italy called Moshpit Culture so
I
knew the book had impacted a bit there.
Also Italians of a certain type are much enamoured of the black leather
jacket and shades school of rock chic. Give
them anything with a loud guitar and they’re off! I have some sympathy
with
that attitude. The Tsunami edition will
be called Moshpit. Things have changed since I wrote the book but it’s
still relevant. It wasn’t written as a
journalistic account of a scene but rather as travel writing which
brought
the reader inside the head of the alienated
teenage mosher. So, theoretically at least, somebody could pick it up in
200 years time and still find its contents
interesting or relevant.  I had a ton of fun writing it and I get emails
about it all the time, mostly from people doing
postgraduate research into youth culture or music culture. As far as I
know
it’s the only book which deals exclusively
with this huge cultural movement which has had a phenomenal influence
upon
the lives of millions.

Yeah, that book`s subject matter; the bands and people that make up the
moshpits of the world are a popular
cultural form of expression, a response to the social and political
spaces
they inhabit.....
I gave a talk about moshing at Brighton University shortly after the book
came out and the guy introducing me
admitted that, when he heard that someone was going to explain moshing to
them, he thought it had something to
do with winemaking.

Jeez.........thats crazy.  You are flying out to NYC again soon Joe,
whats
happening this time around?
The Chelsea Hotel is hosting a launch for Chelsea Hotel Manhattan. There
has been a change in management since I
stayed there so it’ll be interesting to see what improvements they’ve
made.
There’s been minor controversy about
some changes they’ve been making but I don’t see why people active in the
arts should be so caught up in trying to
preserve the past. The Chelsea’s past was great – and it all really
happened there – but that particular slice of the
past finished a while back.

We`ve jammed on those changes in another interview, havent we.....
I’ve got all those albums, I’ve read all those books. I hope, really,
that
the new management make some sort of a
dynamic intervention. Get Richard Rogers or someone to overhaul it. We’ll
see. In any case, this launch event is an
opportunity for people to come into the Chelsea Hotel and have a look
around.

How has the book been received so far?
I’ve been in Morocco the last six months. I don’t get too much feedback
about the book down there but such as I’ve
had has been positive. I got a really nice email from Chris Stein of
Blondie about it which really pleased me. I like his
work a lot, not just with Blondie but Wild Style, the Gun Club, Iggy.
That’s New York City for me.

I heard Ira Cohen was going to be involved in the launch....
Unfortunately Ira Cohen, who makes numerous appearances in the book and
who
contributed to it, has been sick
recently. Chris Stein mentioned in his email that Ira is very much
himself
again and I hope that is the case. Ira is a
resource. You can’t replace resources. I hope we get a chance to hang out
while I’m in town. I met Ira in 1991 on the
Brion Gysin scene, Ira had been a good pal of Gysin’s and I was starting
work on the Here To Go Show which sought
to highlight Gysin. Naturally Ira was involved, did a great photographic
show in Dublin, and did readings. You can
see him reading in the movie of the Show, Destroy All Rational Thought,
which came out on DVD last year.

You have been living in North Africa. Have you been working down there?
I’ve been wrestling with my third novel, The Darker Side of Me. I’ve been
having trouble with it for a couple of years
but I think I cracked it in Marrakesh, where I’ve been living. I’ve also
been editing an anthology of writings by the
Fenians, the secret 19th Century Irish revolutionary organisation. This
will come out later this year with Mercier
Press. I’ll be previewing some of my thoughts about the Fenians in a
piece,
Brotherhood, which will be in the next
Headpress Journal, the “panther” issue guest edited by the fabulous John
Sinclair, founder of the White Panthers and
onetime manager of the MC5. I’ve written something about the equally
fabulous Panther Burns for the same issue.

cecil taylor never sold out ornette using blood was not fusion it was
harmolodics a different concept at that time
70's i believe actually  hard boppers like blakey  roach many never sold
out they played what they played to make a living
but never sold out as with many musicians i know today
even tho he plays below his capacity sonny rollins never sold out
and many avante garde jazz folk i know and can name never sold out
but yes trane certainly beside cecil were two of the complete
uncompromising giants
and cecil's still goin at 79 as is ornette at 79 recently saw them both
perform  as is rollins who says he still
doesn't play as well as he'd like to

oh by the way cecil will read his uncompromising poetry at the poetry
project april 16
ah another cross over a musician who writes poetry
i know many of them who do some paint and i'm sure there's one who wrote
a novel
and ornette a so called jazz musician wrote a symphony and string
quartets  oh no should he be doing that?  good heavens
and i can name others of that ilk and stravinsky wrote a jazz piece and
scheonberg cabaret songs
and i'm tired goodnite

Thanks Roy. When you have writers like Ismael Kadare, Michele Desbordes,
Alessandro Bericco, Jose Saramago, Anne Carson, Bohumil Hrabal (to name a
few I've enjoyed recently) writing in the form, I don't think there's any
need to justify the novel's value. Nor the need to make a living. - I've
certainly paid my dues as a poor artist, and have the lack of a house, car,
savings or any sort of recognised assets to prove it... As an aside, I'm one
of the very few full-time writers I know. My husband (a playwright) is
another. We have three kids. Most poets make their living with some other
job, many in academia. I don't have an academic qualification to my name,
and in any case have never existed very well in any kind of institution.
Writing novels that others might read for pleasure seems to me to be an
honest living.

Wystan, surely the rise of the novel happened in the 19th century? Is the
perceived rise of fiction actually at poetry's expense, or are you talking
about something that is in fact a function of the increasing corporatisation
of the publishing and bookselling industries and the increasing loss of
independent bookshops? Because those factors are affecting ALL literary
publishing, not just poetry.

All best

A

Any good suggestions and/or appraisals - from ancient to contemporary??
 I remember Kathy Acker did some - maybe they were wonderfully
scandalous or may be not intended that way at all -  auto/fictional or
'real' celebrations and/or satires of sexual encounters with some now
well known language poets before such bodies were even formally
identified as such - vaguely remember them as printed in small, stapled
editions at Kinkos before Kinkos was Kinkos.

An interesting reflection A. Considering how easily the novel sat =
alongside
poetry in earlier centuries, each making room for other, one has to =
wonder
how one form began to nudge out the other. Even when Dickens, et al, =
were
serialized, this still didn't threaten the existence of poetry. My =
feeling
is that you may be looking for the villain in the wrong media. I could =
be
wrong, but this pushing and shoving of poetry to the sidelines didn=92t =
begin
to take place until the last century, i.e. the twentieth (I still have
trouble thinking about the 1900s as the 'last century', probably an age
thing). That being the case, the one tying poor Nelle to the railroad =
tracks
is probably film. Reading of any kind is work. Watching a film isn't.
Reading a poem is more work that reading a novel. Which led to the =
protest
of our Protestant ethic saying 'fuck that shit, I'm going to the =
cinema'.
Poetry was the first to fall but the novel has had its share of =
suffering.
At the end of the 21st, we shall mourn the corpses of literacy.

Thanks Roy. When you have writers like Ismael Kadare, Michele Desbordes,
Alessandro Bericco, Jose Saramago, Anne Carson, Bohumil Hrabal (to name =
a
few I've enjoyed recently) writing in the form, I don't think there's =
any
need to justify the novel's value. Nor the need to make a living. - I've
certainly paid my dues as a poor artist, and have the lack of a house, =
car,
savings or any sort of recognised assets to prove it... As an aside, I'm =
one
of the very few full-time writers I know. My husband (a playwright) is
another. We have three kids. Most poets make their living with some =
other
job, many in academia. I don't have an academic qualification to my =
name,
and in any case have never existed very well in any kind of institution.
Writing novels that others might read for pleasure seems to me to be an
honest living.

Wystan, surely the rise of the novel happened in the 19th century? Is =
the
perceived rise of fiction actually at poetry's expense, or are you =
talking
about something that is in fact a function of the increasing =
corporatisation
of the publishing and bookselling industries and the increasing loss of
independent bookshops? Because those factors are affecting ALL literary
publishing, not just poetry.

All best

Not to mention many of the works of Jack Kerouac in which appear Allen G,
Bill Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Phil Whalen, Lew Welch, Michael McClure,
Kenneth Rexroth, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Herbert Huncke ("Guilty of
Everything"), and many others--


i realize these aren't "novels"--
but-

In Elizabethan theater--for example one of Richard's famous speeches in
henry vi part Three by Shakespeare--there occurs a character referred to as
"the Machiavel"--based on the popularized image of Machiavelli--and his work
The Prince.  I like very much how an author via the associations with his
most famous work becomes a figure of True Villainy and the Most Wicked
Cunning--a "larger than life charcter" with whom Richard is going to do
battle and out perform!

In the Greek and Roman theater and poetry will often appear actual poets or
The Poet--Orpheus--

especially in epigrams for example, one finds the appearance of
poets!!--among the Greeks and Romans--
from whence of course Kent Johnson's collection--

OK -- I only have one post left in my daily quota so am combining two posts in
one:

1)  I just finished reading this morning's NYTIMES article on the three day
celebration in Atlanta in conjunction with the exhibition opening the Raymond
Danowski Poetry Library at Emory.  The celebration was determinedly middle-brow
(Wilbur, Giaoia, Snodgrass etc.) -- but the incredible scope of the collection
gives me reason to hope that there may be lots of small press stuff in there.

Have any of our Atlanta contingent had a chance to look into the Danowski
collection yet?

2) Jason et al -- Yes, BLACK NO MORE is a fantastic (in the literal sense)
novel -- though it's strictly speaking not quite of the same era as EX, whihc
is pre-Harlem Renaissance -- I love both novels (andmy students who read the
Schuyler novel last year were blown away by its power to explain more recent
racial politics in the USA )-- but it's precisely the trickiness of Johnson's
novel that I love -- many readers of the first edition didn't realize it was a
fiction -- (If you read Johnson's autobiography, you'll come across a
delightful anecdote about the time Johnson met somebody who purported to be the
book's protagonist) -- EX plays upon reader's expectations in a far more
complex way than does Schuyler's great satire -- Readers came to AUTOBIOGRAPHY
OF AN EX-COLURED MAN expecting to learn the "masonic secrets" of the black race
-- Instead, the book turns out to reveal to them the secret interiority of an
ordinay white man who has made a little money --

if you've never read these books, read them now -- you'll never forget them --

We don't hear much about Schuyler theses days -- which is one reason media
types can go on pretending that the Black Conservative is of recent vintage --
There was a very good biography of his amazing daughter a few years back, and
Bobby Hill published Schuyler's nearly forgotten Sci Fi serials a while back --

Jason,

I though the issue of something being a "hoax" or not referred to the public
information about the work, surrounding the work. It is closely related to
the idea of "fake." I do not think anybody thought Don Quiote was a real
person or that the fact Don Quiote was not real makes the novel a "hoax." I
do not quite understand what the the element of "hoax" in Shakesperean
comedies is though, of course, 99% of tragic works (particularly plays) are
based on "deception." Finally that is what dramatic irony is.

If one goes back to the original idea of a hoax (which what The Doubled
Flowering is), one can see a veryinteresting question underlying the
concept, particularly for a post modern sensibility. Is a hoax more real
than the "real"? In an age of infinite reproduction (for example, in
literature, the infinite permutations of a text's algorithms digitally as
poems, or in art "perfect" digital reeactments), which modern technology
allows us, doesn't the idea of the "real" get subverted or, to use a more
neutral word, change? It is the subversion that is crucial. My sense is that
Kent is claiming in The Doubled Flowering (or in Epigrammatis or The
Miseries of Poetry for that matery) his sense of "suffering" in that work is
more real than many real writings on Hiroshima. Interesting, this idea is as
old as Aristotle, claiming drama (?) is more real than history.

Did anyone see the Orson Welles "documentary" (another hoax?), entitled
Fake?

Ciao,

Murat

poets in novels--longfellow in The Dante Club --he becomes a detective when
he realizes the boston serial killer is using methods from the inferno--and
he's the only one translating dante into english (tho harvard disapproves).
longfellow the rock star of his time. pound was his grand nephew, I think.
james russell lowell used to walk down brattle street to longfellow's house
once a week to the translators' group.

Dear Murat & Friends-

Yes I saw FAKE and I have read the book it is based on by Clifford
Irving--very interesting as first Irving wrote of the FAKE painter Emile de
Houry--and then went onto to forge the Howard Hughes Book that was at first
thought to be by Hughes himself. (Which is also in the film--)
(Actually i have read great many books on fakes, forgeries, etc--and there
is a new one out i have yet to start called Nation of Counterfeiters--early
history of the US--counterfeiting ran rampant--)  (the USA cd be called FAKE
Nation!)

Actually, Yasusada is NOT a "hoax" because within the texts it gives itself
away over and over as not being by a "real person"--

Yasusada writes in a letter to a friend that he is writing works which he
thinks of as "After Spicer" in the manner of Spicer's "After Lorca"--

after all, After Lorca, Spicer writes letters to Lorca, "translates" Lorca's
("real/fictional" poems, and Lorca provides an Introduction.  Yasusada
writes Spicer a "last letter" which echoes the "last letter" of Spicer's to
Lorca, and Spicer appears i a number of letters and rengas throughout the
Yasusada texts.  (By appears I mean he takes part in events which are
presented in a renga.)

If a "real poet" can write letters to a "dead real poet" and the dead poet
can introduce his text, why not a fictional poet write letters to and
present a "real dead poet" in his works.

What is being created is a traveling through time and space of poets dead,
alive, and fictional--having in common the feature of all being "ghosts"
finally.  What carries from poet to poet are echoes, reflections, fragments
of sounds, of images, and what the center of their being is as a group is
"the work of mourning" as Freud called it.  Spicer spends a summer of love
with Lorca, who leaves, a departed ghost, and Spicer in turn becomes the
beloved of Yasusada, who in the end says Farewell to the ghost of Spicer,
and turns to look out to sea at the memorials of candles and names for the
dead of  Hiroshima.  Hiroshima itself provides a linkage from Spicer to
yasusada via lines in Spicer that the fictional poet cites, and is "echoed"
in Yasusada's attending a baseball game a la Spicer, in the Hiroshima
Stadium, situated at the Bomb's flashpoint.

The series Lorca-Spicer-Yasusada is one in which poetry is making  journey
of love in the land of the dead, in which dead poets are loved as ghosts,
and a fictional poet is as real as the ghosts which are Lorca for Spicer and
Spicer for Yasusada.

The Yasusada is really a series of love poems--to Yasusada's daughter, wife
and lost friends, poets of other times, and finally, to Spicer, whom he
"meets" late in life.  The last poem, "Because I live" combines the image of
the candles and names floating out to sea with those of the rowers on
Ulysses' ship passing the Sirens, on their way home to Ithaca.

I think that there are a great many issues which the works of Kent Johnson
bring up, and among them is that of, not so much the willing suspension of
disbelief, but to my mind, the willingness to believe immediately and
without question what an "authority" says about a matter.

The reasons so many "fakes" seem to exist at present  is simply that there
is far more media attention paid by the media to itself--i.e--it creates a
celebrity, then on discovering it is not a real celebrity, has to figure out
what to do with its mistake--or analyze it in terms of some sort of
psycho-babble as a "trend"--while missing what is the main point:  that
persons ask fewer questions all the time in presenting "news," and citing
"facts," and demanding strict adherence to doctrines based on things
patently untrue.  We are currently annihilating the lives of two entire
countries, one of them based completely on falsehoods, which at the time
were known to be false, yet which were presented as real--and since Colin
Powell presented them--most "reasonable people" believed it was all true.

If a nation goes to war on faked documents and false testimonies that it
wants to "hear"--then is it any surprise that the news is filled with fake
stories itself, and in turn filled with stories of fakes?

Remember all the scandals of the "embedded reporters" like Judith Miller and
others, whose "reports from Iraq" were basically written by the Pentagon?
So many histories of the last fifty years or so of events in the USA let
alone abroad, are filled with the examples of how the media was manipulated
and played along with the government in disseminating false reports,
squashing true ones and pushing for editorial and opinion columns to take up
the cudgel and war drums for one cause or another.

There are two volumes called Paper of Record which are the ongoing untruths
re in one volume Foreign Policy and in the other Israel-Palestine which have
been published non-stop by the New York Times, and that's just one major
news outlet among several fabricating news and facts in order to create a
"world view" in which now despite all the evidence to the contrary, the
American and Israeli Governments are determined to attack Iran for building
non-existent weapons.  Just days before the exposure of the fake book of the
gang survivor, that author had been given a huge photo spread essay and
interview in the Times, and her book given a postive review as being true.

I think that part of the project of a work such as the Yasusada is that it
is an opening into those worlds which exists i writing which traverse the
liminal states of being so to speak of the living, the dead, the ghostly the
fictional, the mixing of these among other poets and artists real and
imaginary with in the texts, and the ability of the love shared among these
writers to meet in acts of love and of mourning.  In a sense it a
demonstration of ways in which writing makes possible communications which
are otherwise deemed "impossible."

The works of Spicer and Yasusada do not pretend to be "really" or "unreally"
in touch with Lorca and Spicer--and yet they are both.  One of the energies
of these works is to inspire and remind readers to be questioning the ways
in which writing is presented as a limited set of "choices" between "real"
and "fictional," "fake" and "original" and the like.  And also in what ways
in reading and writing the question not only of the "author" arises, but the
question of "authority"--by whose authority do  readers and writers believe
that what they are doing is distinguishing between "willing suspension of
disbelief" and "belief" in what so and so says, simply because so and so is
a Big Name, or an Expert, or has an Important Position?


How often in having an opinion or thoughts about a work are they one's own,
and how often really a ragtag bit of scraps from hither and yon, if not some
good chapter and verse from the most approved authorities of one's choice?

The ancients so called weren't so concerned about this as person are today.
The old texts will have along with what is known to be a "real" document a
string of fragments and versions "thought to be by" or "known to be fakes by
and also excerpts in which a work is mentioned, a poet named, whether or not
what is named or mentioned is "truth" or "hearsay" it is all part of the
"existence" of that writing and poet through time--their mixture of legends
and realities, their faked MS. and their actual publications.  The 17th
century carried al of this to extremes so far out there they were part of
what led actually to the creation of the novel--simply so that supposedly
one would know that in a certain work everything was fiction, instead of of
a fine stew of truth, falsehood, plagiarism, faked translations, and a
myriad hoary old tricks and citings of "authorities" real and invented for
the occasion.

The Yasusada I think is both a reminder of these old methods and literatures
which preceded the rise of the new bourgoeis reading public and the novel
and the Superstars of Poetry who began to appear with the romantics, --an
era for the most part which has not at all vanished--and a pointing towards
a myriad possiblities existing in writing which continues on with these
questionings.

PS:--below are letters of Spicer to Lorca and Yasusada to Spicer--in a post
sent 22 march

I have nearly completed another reply to a thread from a few weeks ago abt
the "real lemons" and "literalization of metaphor" that Eireene brought up--
had to finish some other projects and the thread seemed over with--so was
just going to send to Murat--
which has to do with the "real" and "unreal" in poems, and also the
conjunction of WC Williams' "Only the imagination is real" (Spring and All)
with "No ideas but in things, Mr" in Paterson.

here is a post i sent on 22 March  for the thread Eireene began (there was
another one next day re "Radar" poem in Spicer's After Lorca, dedicated to
Marianne Moore--)

this has the letters from the Spicer and Yasusada books--



"If it's not in writing, it never happened."
Ominous "reminder" sign found in various offices . . .
Although, from another point of view, one might also say
"If it's in writing, it never happened . . . "


"Dear Lorca:

This is the last letter . . . "

"Dear Spicer:

This is the last letter.  All day I have been pacing back and forth. trying
to think about this has all meant, wondering how I might say goodbye to
you.  I've been thinking of yo writing to Lorca in a trance, of Lorca
bemused by it all, sending poems to you  for the sheer joy of it from the
grave . . . "
(further excerpts of this letter follow the --always provisional, in
progress--comments here:

One of the most interesting meditations on Spicer and especially After
Lorca, is the way that the figure and work of Spicer make their appearances
interwoven among the other figures and works which inhabit Doubled
Flowering  From the Notebooks of Araki Yasusada.
   Doubled Flowering is in effect, an After Spicer to Spicer's After Lorca,
assembled and annotated by the editors of Yasusada's Notebooks in a manner
suggested by  Yasusada  in a November 7, 1967 letter to his friend Fusei:

     I am so taken by the conception of the book (After Lorca), that I have
decided to correspond with Spicer in a like manner. . . . After I finish, I
will allow him the opportunity to introduce the collection with the same
generosity of spirit that he extended to Lorca . . .

    Since "one knows" that Yasusada is a fictional poet, one finds a
fictional being wanting to correspond with a dead poet, just as that poet
corresponded with a dead poet.  Along the way are "translations" which
themselves are fictions--of Lorca, of Yasusada--framing a discussion of
"real lemons" and "real moons" by both Spicer and Yasusada within the
contexts of fiction, and, in both cases, with correspondances with dead
poets.  Fictions corresponding with ghosts take up the issue of the real,
and what makes any of it "real" is that the poets WRITE of poems which will
be real and independent of images. So real that a cloud which has nothing to
do with the poem will cover that moon.
        And if the moon is that moon which exists in writing--a cloud may
indeed, having nothing to do with the poem pass over it--as it is there on
the page--the moon one literally sees in the four letters which create the
word--a literal cloud may pass overhead and cover it--
      Asked what he meant in his writing, Rimbaud replied, "I mean it
literally and in every sense."  Literally, "m--o--o--n" IS the moon, and
literally a cloud passing overhead could cover the four letters making the
moon seen--THERE--on the page--
        And that "m--o--o--n" is independent of images, and that cloud has
nothing to do with the poem.
         And since from the "after life" Lorca writes with Spicer "After
Lorca," so Yasusada, a fictional "after effect" of his own "After Spicer,"
writes with a Spicer himself now in the "after life."
         As one moves from the moon of Spicer, a "real" poet's moon written
of to a dead "real poet," to the moon of Yasusada, which is a fictional
poet's writing to the now dead "real poet," of the moon he has essayed
creating, the one constant, the one "reality" literally existing among the
historical poets,  ghosts and fictions is this REAL "m--o--o--n" literally
existing on the page from one text to the next.
       The series of "After effects" is a series of echoes re-sounding from
"moon" to "moon" while at the same time literally always being that "same"
"moon".  In a sense, iti s like a rhyming being of moon, the loon--the
"literal" "real" loon calls--and hearing the echo of its call, thinks that
another loon is responding, and so calls back--and again is responded to by
its own echo--to which it in turn responds again--
        The "after effect" of the echoes--creates a "call and response" in
which, though the echoes are not "real" calls from another loon,  elicit a
response in the "real" loon as though its "doubled flowering" really is from
another, who is actually itself and yet--not--
      As, in order for an echo to return, it has to have made contact with
some object, which indeed "sent it back"--to be responded with--
        A literal object like Lorca, like Spicer, off of which Spicer and
Yasusada's calls bounce--and coming back as echoes, are responded with as
though "real" and so, echoing, the moon becomes, IS,  indeed real, as moving
from text to text it continues literally as the written word "m--o--o--n"
and as an echo, an "after effect,"  is also a fiction, the sounds of a
"ghost, "
participating in a call and response with a "real" poet, a fictional poet, a
departed ghost--a real moon existing among "translations" and "letters" and
"really" fully capable of being covered by a cloud which has nothing to do
with any of this.
       (Both Spicer and Yasusada are writing as it were "love letters"
also--

Dear Spicer:

This is the last letter.  All day I have been pacing back and forth. trying
to think about what this has all meant, wondering how I might say goodbye to
you.  I've been thinking of you writing to Lorca in a trance, of Lorca
bemused by it all, sending poems to you  for the sheer joy of it from the
grave . . .

What you've taught me, Spicer, is that the real washes up like a dream from
the unreal.  Thus,  when I say that on a beach against a cliff there is a
boat older than Galilee, it is in the spirit of shellacking words to a page
like objects on a canvas.  A lemon peel, a slice of the moon, two little
girls playing and calling to their father on the beach.  The boat that is
older than Galilee comes into the real, dragging a whole cargo of ghost
history with it.  What you've taught me, Spicer, is that the unreal washes
up from the real [sic, eds] Doesn't the the sound of the burned one drinking
from th ocean make your hair stand on end?

Now here's a thing I've been waiting until the end of our correspondance to
say:  You say you would like the moon in your poems to be a real moon, one
that could be covered by clouds, a moon independent of images.  And you say
you would like to point to the moon, and that the only sound in the poem be
the pointing.  At first I was confused, thinking that you wanted it both
ways.  But now I know  you mean that the pointing and the moon are one.
Like these letters, for instance, which have at their heart an urn, made
real by the facing gaze of two identical ghosts.  An urn wrought by the moon
itself and the sorrowful pointing at it.  Why look any further for the real?
. . .

 Now reach through, and place your hand on the papery flesh of this false
face.  And I shall put into my branching voice the ashy sky of your gaze.
Love,
Yasusada

Writer, film maker, musician and culture terrorist Joe Ambrose has a
penchant for digging around the cultural
margins and teasing out of the shadows relevant irreverance,
countercultural phenomena, outside and (often)
explosive art of pivotal significance. Subject matter and artists
regularly
delineated by sitting on the periphery of
popular culture. His written output includes the novels Serious Time and
Too Much Too Soon.  Moshpit Culture, a
blood stained and sweat-soaked inside investigation on hardcore dancing;
several historical studies of the war of
Irish Independance including the best selling Dan Breen and The IRA and
is
currently editing an anthology of writings
by the revolutionary Irish Brotherhood, the Fenians. His writing also
appears in numerous magazines, journals and
collections.
In 1992 he co-organized the Here To Go Show in Dublin. This mixed media
art
show was a celebration of the
cultural impact and significance of the work of Tangier Beat Scenesters
Brion Gysin and William Burroughs. The event
was filmed extensively and the movie Destroy All Rational Thought
documented many aspects of this week long arts
show. It was initially released on video and then later, as an enhanced
DVD.  He is a DJ in art hip hop combo Islamic
Diggers and has been living in Marrakesh, Morocco for the past 7 months
hanging with the likes of the Sufi mystic
trance musicians The Gnoua Brotherhood of Marrakesh. Ambrose previously
produced the Brothers for the William
Burroughs tribute CD, 10% File Under Burroughs, which also features John
Cale, Paul Bowles, Marianne Faithfull,
Chuck Prophet, Herbert Huncke and The Master Musicians of Joujouka.
Whilst Ambrose has been getting down in Africa, the Islamic Diggers
track
William Burroughs Dont Play Guitar has
featured on the soundtrack to a new Burroughs documentary, Words of
Advice,
which also features Patti Smith, Hal
Willner and Bill Laswell. Another Diggers track, Hashishin, was included
along with work by Stockhausen in a January
â€™08 sound installation, Cut Up, curated by Copenhagenâ€™s Karriere in
conjunction with the Danish Museum of Modern
Art. Ambrose has previously worked with Anita Pallenberg, Richard Hell,
Chrissie Hynde and Herbert Huncke. He is
Literary Editor of LA-based magazine, Outsideleft.com. In 2007 he was
asked
by Iggy Pop to write the sleevenotes
for Escaped Maniacs, the Iggy and the Stooges DVD package. His extreme
travel writing book, Chelsea Hotel
Manhattan has recently been published by Headpress and a new edition of
Moshpit is about to be published by
Tsunami. Joe talked very recently with me about his latest ventures.

Joe, give me some background on the Tsunami edition of Moshpit.....
Moshpit Culture first came out in 2001 and reflected what Iâ€™d been up to
in
the preceding years. I first got dragged
into a moshpit, rather improbably, at a Shane McGowan show. I love his
work
but at that time, the late 90s, I was
listening almost exclusively to hip hop, reggae, and the kind of punkish
metal exemplified by Slayer, Queens of the
Stone Age, the Beastie Boys and RATM. I was going to hip hop shows
whenever
I could, I saw Snoop a load of times
and I was kind of following Gregory Isaacs, the Cool Ruler, around the
place. I must have seen Gregory in action
about forty times back then. But mainly it was hardcore acts and
Slipknot
and Rancid and the likes.

So what attracted you to the Moshpit?
I liked the fraternity that I found at those hardcore shows, the
openness
and the willingness to experiment with new
people and to build a new nation which was not of this world. People had
talked about experiencing these feelings in
the rave scene, whera but I didnâ€™t go for that because I
like music and most of the music associated with rave culture was second
rate, doesnâ€™t stand the test of time, was
mildly diverting at the time but not the real thing. Also, when they
were
talking about this spirit of collective
fraternity and stuff, what they were really talking about was the drugs
they were taking.

Ecstasy and a trashy peace and love vibe. The moshpit to me seems to
work
on a completly different level....
Moshers were often far more solid sort of individuals. A lot of moshers
took good care of their bodies, didnâ€™t do
huge amounts of drugs, kept down day jobs or, if very young, lived far
away
from the city centre with their families
in hugely repressive social environments which caused them to see
moshing
and much of what went with it as
hugely liberating.

The publishers, Tsunami, are based in Italy, arent they?
There is already a metal record label in Italy called Moshpit Culture so
I
knew the book had impacted a bit there.
Also Italians of a certain type are much enamoured of the black leather
jacket and shades school of rock chic. Give
them anything with a loud guitar and theyâ€™re off! I have some sympathy
with
that attitude. The Tsunami edition will
be called Moshpit. Things have changed since I wrote the book but itâ€™s
still relevant. It wasnâ€™t written as a
journalistic account of a scene but rather as travel writing which
brought
the reader inside the head of the alienated
teenage mosher. So, theoretically at least, somebody could pick it up in
200 years time and still find its contents
interesting or relevant.  I had a ton of fun writing it and I get emails
about it all the time, mostly from people doing
postgraduate research into youth culture or music culture. As far as I
know
itâ€™s the only book which deals exclusively
with this huge cultural movement which has had a phenomenal influence
upon
the lives of millions.

Yeah, that book`s subject matter; the bands and people that make up the
moshpits of the world are a popular
cultural form of expression, a response to the social and political
spaces
they inhabit.....
I gave a talk about moshing at Brighton University shortly after the
book
came out and the guy introducing me
admitted that, when he heard that someone was going to explain moshing
to
them, he thought it had something to
do with winemaking.

Jeez.........thats crazy.  You are flying out to NYC again soon Joe,
whats
happening this time around?
The Chelsea Hotel is hosting a launch for Chelsea Hotel Manhattan. There
has been a change in management since I
stayed there so itâ€™ll be interesting to see what improvements theyâ€™ve
made.
Thereâ€™s been minor controversy about
some changes theyâ€™ve been making but I donâ€™t see why people active in
the
arts should be so caught up in trying to
preserve the past. The Chelseaâ€™s past was great â€“ and it all really
happened there â€“ but that particular slice of the
past finished a while back.

We`ve jammed on those changes in another interview, havent we.....
Iâ€™ve got all those albums, Iâ€™ve read all those books. I hope, really,
that
the new management make some sort of a
dynamic intervention. Get Richard Rogers or someone to overhaul it.
Weâ€™ll
see. In any case, this launch event is an
opportunity for people to come into the Chelsea Hotel and have a look
around.

How has the book been received so far?
Iâ€™ve been in Morocco the last six months. I donâ€™t get too much feedback
about the book down there but such as Iâ€™ve
had has been positive. I got a really nice email from Chris Stein of
Blondie about it which really pleased me. I like his
work a lot, not just with Blondie but Wild Style, the Gun Club, Iggy.
Thatâ€™s New York City for me.

I heard Ira Cohen was going to be involved in the launch....
Unfortunately Ira Cohen, who makes numerous appearances in the book and
who
contributed to it, has been sick
recently. Chris Stein mentioned in his email thatresource. You canâ€™t replace resources. I hope we get a chance to hang
out
while Iâ€™m in town. I met Ira in 1991 on the
Brion Gysin scene, Ira had been a good pal of Gysinâ€™s and I was starting
work on the Here To Go Show which sought
to highlight Gysin. Naturally Ira was involved, did a great photographic
show in Dublin, and did readings. You can
see him reading in the movie of the Show, Destroy All Rational Thought,
which came out on DVD last year.

You have been living in North Africa. Have you been working down there?
Iâ€™ve been wrestling with my third novel, The Darker Side of Me. Iâ€™ve
been
having trouble with it for a couple of years
but I think I cracked it in Marrakesh, where Iâ€™ve been living. Iâ€™ve also
been editing an anthology of writings by the
Fenians, the secret 19th Century Irish revolutionary organisation. This
will come out later this year with Mercier
Press. Iâ€™ll be previewing some of my thoughts about the Fenians in a
piece,
Brotherhood, which will be in the next
Headpress Journal, the â€œpantherâ€ issue guest edited by the fabulous John
Sinclair, founder of the White Panthers and
onetime manager of the MC5. Iâ€™ve written something about the equally
fabulous Panther Burns for the same issue.

Replying to you, Alison, re-the rise and the rise of the novel. No, I =
was not thinking of the 19th century, but  a generation. The different =
position of poetry in New Zealand for my father's generation. Aside from =
cook books etc there was little or no local publishing, no full time =
writers or artists for them. Now we have both, so that there's a choice, =
but there are strings attached, and the arrival of a livelihood has been =
exchanged for the loss of any intellectual highground poetry had =
achieved before then, and with that pretty much any such highground =
literature itself. There is no real literary criticism written in New =
Zealand outwide of the academic world, and reviewing is mere marketing =
at best. That exchange, however, hasn't occurred with the visual arts.=20

Thanks Roy. When you have writers like Ismael Kadare, Michele Desbordes,
Alessandro Bericco, Jose Saramago, Anne Carson, Bohumil Hrabal (to name =
a
few I've enjoyed recently) writing in the form, I don't think there's =
any
need to justify the novel's value. Nor the need to make a living. - I've
certainly paid my dues as a poor artist, and have the lack of a house, =
car,
savings or any sort of recognised assets to prove it... As an aside, I'm =
one
of the very few full-time writers I know. My husband (a playwright) is
another. We have three kids. Most poets make their living with some =
other
job, many in academia. I don't have an academic qualification to my =
name,
and in any case have never existed very well in any kind of institution.
Writing novels that others might read for pleasure seems to me to be an
honest living.

Wystan, surely the rise of the novel happened in the 19th century? Is =
the
perceived rise of fiction actually at poetry's expense, or are you =
talking
about something that is in fact a function of the increasing =
corporatisation
of the publishing and bookselling industries and the increasing loss of
independent bookshops? Because those factors are affecting ALL literary
publishing, not just poetry.

All best

The idea of hoax in literature seems finally to be catching up --that is,
equally in how widespread it seems-- to the idea of hoax in television and
cinema.

I'm curious about this: is there a difference between hoax and fraud in
literature?

David,

In one of his interviews (I think with Gabe), Kent refers to magma being the
source of all poetry, and Doubled Flowering and his ensuing books (and
translations) being attempts to reach that source. It is within that
framework that the idea of individual authorship, and also the distinction
between "hoax" and "real" in the proprietary sense, disappears.

Ciao,

Murat

Jason,

We could start writing poetic film scripts lamenting the demise of the nove=
l
and the disappearance of the novelist as cash cow! Then maybe the consequen=
t
award winning films would trigger the revival of the novel as art-form in a
post-decadent era of candour and honesty when money will be seen as a banan=
a
skin, but watch out for low-flying pigs when that day arrives!

Roy Exley.

Hi Wystan

I think places like NZ and Australia, because they're small, tend to show
trends quicker than in other countries. And what you're describing is
happening everywhere. I once had a very depressing conversation with a sales
person from a (successful, worldwide) UK independent publisher on the effect
supermarket chains and chain bookshops were having on smaller publishers,
which impacts especially hard on new writers and literary or small scale
work. They totally skew the market, and strong arm publishers into selling
books to them for less than cost to drive up sales (this particular
publisher refused to do that, which meant they their books never appear on
the best seller lists, which themselves drive sales - you see the logic -
multinational publishers can affird to lose a bit on top flight books but
smaller publishers can't). Of course independent bookshops just can't
compete with supermarkets and go broke. The lack of literary reviews in the
mainstream press only drives this further. And poetry is always the first to
feel the chilly wind. I still remember the shock I felt when I encountered a
bookshop that had no poetry section at all.

Meanwhile, Germany and Austria protect their independent bookshops - there
it's illegal to sell discount books! Imagine! And so they have hundreds of
independent booksellers, enthusiastic and literate readers and lots of
independent publishers. Diversity is health, and our book industry is deeply
sick. All those lies about the "inevitability" of market forces are very
self serving.

Cheers

Alison

Maybe soon there will be "new" books out  by the touring impersonators of
famous writers--
Edgar Allan Poe, V. Mayakovksy, Lord Byron, Sylvia Plath etc etc--
will not only "live again" but "write again"--

the channeling of the dead can be enhanced via the computerized enhancements
of photos, engravings, recordings, "authentic costumes, and, where possible,
even "actual clothes worn by the departed"--and the inhabiting of "actual
rooms and apartments where the author lived or stayed . . . "

a new form of "ghost writing"--
proving the "immortality" of the classics--through a series of
re-animations--each one producing new works for addition to the
Canon--listed as are the layered starti of archeological city-sites, "Troy
1, Troy 2, Troy 3"  . . . .

I was saddened to hear of the recent death of Andrew Crozier, English poet and publisher. He had seemed obscured - intentionally or otherwise - for several years. I met him the summer-fall of 1967, shortly after I had left from two years in Nigeria on the heels of the start of the war about Biafra.  We were introduced  through Bob Cobbing who - along Lee Harwood -  who worked at Better Books, London's once finest poetry bookstore.  Between Andrew and Bob I got the profile and introduction to  a number of English poets, books and publishers that were heating up the  time  -  Stuart Montgomer (Fulcum Press) Tom Raworth and many others who gave the readings in store and beyond. Andrew was just fresh from U of Buffalo and had managed the research coup of tracking down Carl Rakosi who had changed his name and was living in Minneapolis. Rakosi really owed his revival as a poet to Andrew; the discovery also gave us much new  knowledge of the history of the Objectivists. And,
 perhaps, in the minds and ears of some, Andrew's Ferry Press also  managed to publish Steve Jonas' amazing,  "Exercises for Ear" I suspect Andrew's corrrespondence with Jonas - 'ripe' with paranoia and racism as he often said it was -  is a trove for a certain kind of mid-sixties American self-hate and racial research, let alone the occasion to study much more of a still under-noted poet.

  I remember one evening - for some perhaps some odd masochistic reason - we went to an evening open poetry reading at the the Poetry Society. It was pretty dreadful. Then a woman in her fifties (?) stood up and read this marvelous, autobiographical  poem from the point of view of being child at her school when this big kind of scary man all dressed up showed up on the school grounds as part of a formal visit. Yes, she was one one of the children in Yeats' "Among .....".   Andrew and I were both pretty astonished by the fact of her experience - as if she had walked out of the equivalent of a movie set aka Canonical Poem - and put a fresh truth on it - plus it was a good poem.

  When the reading was done, Andrew and I both approached her outside the Pub. Andrew identified himself as a publisher and that he would love to see a copy of that poem. Thereupon,  we saw this middle-aged woman look at us, suddenly totally terrified, and then we watched her take off running down the street! It was like watching a piece of history go up in smoke!

  Well, I knew him young before academic life engulfed him, then I lost touch. But it was fun to know him then, sharing new poems, and reading fresh publications from Ferry Press, John James et al. He was a vibrant, smart, tough and independent spirit.

  May he be remembered well,

  Stephen Vincent

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

here are some new dbCinema images: http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky3

and some writing about them: http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky3/intro

i've created a new brush for my dbCinema app. so you can import flash swf
files and use them as nibs on brushes. the kandinsky3 images were all done
with the new flash brush.

you may know how, in photoshop, say, you can use or create and import
different brushes. they are static bitmaps. these brushes are animations.

in the kandinsky3 pics, a brush has two types of motion. the motion of the
flash animation. and the motion of dbCinema moving the flash animation along
some path.

during each frame of a dbCinema movie, the brush stamps out an image in the
*shape* of the current frame of a flash animation. the shape is *filled*
with part of some kandinsky painting. during the next frame of the movie,
the *shape* of the brush changes to be the shape of the next frame of the
flash animation. and where it is stamped onto the screen changes. and every
few (configurable) seconds, the kandinsky used to fill the shape is changed
to a different kandinsky painting.

so it's a um graphic synthesizer.

earlier dbCinema images: http://vispo.com/dbcinema/meditations.htm

ja

ps: Someone who viewed the earlier dbCinema images wondered if I had a Naum
Gabo theme going on. I did not know his work. But he was a Russian
constructivist (1890-1977) who did sculptural work with wires and strings
such as
http://www.phillipscollection.org/american_art/artwork/Gabo-Linear_Construct
ion.htm (be sure to get the full url, it's long). If you put his name into
http://vispo.com/dbcinema , you get quite a few images. Cool. I'm channeling
a Russian thing, apparently. Kandinsky and Gabo. Gotta love those Russians.

Prepublication offer expires next week:

Set of all six -- 40.00

Set of two -- 20.00


1) Jeni Olin, THE PILL BOOK

Jeni Olin says, "You can't teach God anything." An ambulance cools
its jets in the arboretum, and she asks, "What have you got roughly
in your breast?" The improvised reality series THE PILL BOOK
disseminates a plethora of diagnoses and a handful of cures.

2) Stacy Szymaszek, ORIZABA: A VOYAGE WITH HART CRANE

Written in 2004 in Milwaukee and revised in Brooklyn in 2007: "...one
of the most important literary ventures into Gender Questioning, told
through the magic of Hart Crane with the magic hand of Stacy
Szymaszek...essential reading..." -- CAConrad

3) Alan Davies, ODES

"These are poems which, dancing deftly among assonance, dissonance
and diverse repetitions, while adroitly avoiding the risk of sounding
like a bad Celan pastiche, are excessively difficult to get right.
Luckily, they are right"-- Nicholas Manning.

4) CAConrad, (SOMA)TIC MIDGE

The seven poems that make up (SOMA)TIC MIDGE were each written after
eating a single color of food for a day, and carrying the color
externally. For the RED poem CAConrad ate only red foods, wearing a
red wig. The BLUE poem was written while listening to Bobby Vinton's
"Blue Velvet" on a loop for a day.

5) Jack Kimball, PATHOLOGIES

Fatality v. pleasuring, then what? Satirical wildfire is one way to
carry on, as are fabulous predictions about late-XXIst-century
historicism. PATHOLOGIES goes both ways forward, sucks it up, and
shouts it down. "What the fuck? This is so amazing!"-- CA Conrad.

6) Brenda Iijima, SUBSISTENCE EQUIPMENT

"...the mirror wraps around the body like a form fitting garment...
Efflorescent pulsations interrogate steel. Angular feet seek
mischievous nomads. Fearless assertions mute the violence of the bi-
directional stare... Vigilant outsiders threaten to pierce the face
of the geode" -- Cecilia Wu.

Subject:      Fw: What makes a Poem Great? Interview with Poet/Critic David
              Solway
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"

In honour of Poetry Month, here is The Biblio File's interview with =
Canadian poet, critic and more recently, political writer, David Solway.

http://nigelbeale.com/?p=3D797

 We first discuss what constitutes a great poem in the context of =
=91political=92 and other agendas that some poets incorporate into their =
work. According to Solway, great poems consist of authentic, =
incontestable, memorable language, with vivid power, lapidary quality =
and prodigious rhetorical flow, which takes time, education, reflection =
and maturity to work itself into themes of human importance; synoptic =
views of the complexity of human life; a confluence of eloquent language =
and major subject which has something important to say and which will =
resonate with contemporary and future generations.

Great poems are like Switzerland, says Solway: candidates must pass =
through a stringent, careful, fine-meshed filter before they are granted =
citizenship.



It is posterity that decides what is great. Aphoristic memorability and =
the wish to keep the words alive in the mind, determines its greatness.

During the interview two poems are compared. 1) A Great one: The Second =
Coming by W.B. Yeats, and 2) A not so great one: God Bless America by =
Harold Pinter. Part Two of our interview takes a closer look at these =
poems. Here they are:

1. The Second Coming

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed,
and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction,while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.=20

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?=20

2. God Bless America=20

Here they go again,
The Yanks in their armoured parade
Chanting their ballads of joy
As they gallop across the big world
Praising America=92s God.

The gutters are clogged with the dead
The ones who couldn=92t join in
The others refusing to sing
The ones who are losing their voice
The ones who=92ve forgotten the tune.=20

The riders have whips which cut.
Your head rolls onto the sand
Your head is a pool in the dirt
Your head is a stain in the dust
Your eyes have gone out and your nose
Sniffs only the pong of the dead
And all the dead air is alive
With the smell of America=92s God.=20

Thank you so much for posting this article about the soap opera character as author.  I saw it in the print edition of the paper, meant to read it, but never did.  Now that I've seen it online, it makes me laugh, nearly out loud.  Regards, Tom Savage

Maybe soon there will be "new" books out by the touring impersonators of
famous writers--
Edgar Allan Poe, V. Mayakovksy, Lord Byron, Sylvia Plath etc etc--
will not only "live again" but "write again"--

the channeling of the dead can be enhanced via the computerized enhancements
of photos, engravings, recordings, "authentic costumes, and, where possible,
even "actual clothes worn by the departed"--and the inhabiting of "actual
rooms and apartments where the author lived or stayed . . . "

a new form of "ghost writing"--
proving the "immortality" of the classics--through a series of
re-animations--each one producing new works for addition to the
Canon--listed as are the layered starti of archeological city-sites, "Troy
1, Troy 2, Troy 3" . . . .

Did anyone else but me see the 'Ouilipo' Honda ad during the Kansas/Memphis game last night?  If you did not, the ad goes through a variety of little scenes in which the letter "h" is ommitted. A car driving through "Uta ", somebody in a state of " appiness" etc., etc., until the Revelation of Honda's unmistakeable "h".  Like good Ouilipo, the ad produced an instaneous, fill the blank(s) sense of attention.

 Amazing how capital always catches up with and exploits and profits from the good stuff.    Suspect we will begin to see more advertising now from the Ouilipo playbook. Wonder where that Design group went to school!

I just reviewed his poems in A Various Art over a bottle of Italian
pseudo-Champagne. Lots of light & tracery & mornings, but fucking
excellent. Got me through my Oxford interviews.

I met him the summer-fall of 1967, shortly after I had left from two years in Nigeria on the heels of the start of the war about Biafra.  We were introduced  through Bob Cobbing who - along Lee Harwood -  who worked at Better Books, London's once finest poetry bookstore.  Between Andrew and Bob I got the profile and introduction to  a number of English poets, books and publishers that were heating up the  time  -  Stuart Montgomer (Fulcum Press) Tom Raworth and many others who gave the readings in store and beyond. Andrew was just fresh from U of Buffalo and had managed the research coup of tracking down Carl Rakosi who had changed his name and was living in Minneapolis. Rakosi really owed his revival as a poet to Andrew; the discovery also gave us much new  knowledge of the history of the Objectivists. And,

Yes, she was one one of the children in Yeats' "Among .....".   Andrew and I were both pretty astonished by the fact of her experience - as if she had walked out of the equivalent of a movie set aka Canonical Poem - and put a fresh truth on it - plus it was a good poem.

A further twist to this tale is that the role of Kendall Hart was originally
played by Sarah Michelle Geller, and established her as a huge star even
before she became Buffy the Vampyr Slayer.

Maybe somewhere in the bowels of Creation there is stirring the idea in some
writer's mind to find a way --or several different ways--of exploiting this
connection.  True, Sarah Michelle could write her own account of playing the
two roles--but how dull!!

Why not have Kendell "dream" that she is Buffy?  Or Buffy realize that in an
alternate universe she is Kendall? Or perhaps one of them will go through
"recovered memory" therapy and discover their lost other self, the "who"
that they "were" before the onset of that hoariest of soap opera staples,
amnesia?  Or that they are actually twins separated at birth--and each one
can write a book about discovering the joys of meeting her long lost
sister?  Or that Kendall when young --as played by Sarah Michelle--while in
a coma was pregnant and delivered of a baby who became Buffy? The potential
books and spinoffs are mind boggling!

(Didn't the Laura Palmer character of Twin Peaks fame publish a diary?)

In the "recording industry" of course, fictional groups performing real
songs that became hits have existed for quite some time.  The late Sixties
and early Seventies were the heyday of a great many bands who didn't
actually exist outside the studio and on the air waves--the Golden Age of
Bubble Gum Music--with groups like the Archies, the Beech Nuts (for whom Lou
Reed supposedly penned a tune), 1910 Fruitgum Company, Ohio Express, Music
Explosion and many others.  Some were "more real" than others as they had
photos of band members on the covers and actually played some shows--but
often they were members also of other bands recording as part of a stable on
the same label, whose faces one never saw.  It was like a devolution of the
Motown Sound, which involved creating group personas and styles, dance
steps, costumes, and the different groups used different songwriters, and
also created single artists.  The bubblegum hits all sounded pretty similar,
employed a rotating group of writers and musicians and studio staff and
rolled off the assembly line onto the AM Top 40 with nothing more than a
name to identify them as being distinct one from the other.
      The ultimate "triumph" of the fake band was Milli Vanilli, who won a
Grammy--leading to the discovery that they didn't even sing their "own"
songs--they simply lip synched while "someone else" had performed the actual
recording.

With an already "captive audience" which can be counted on to be interested
in Kendall's book, it's easy to see why "she" would write one, and market
perfume along with it.  Another twist might be for writers to start writing
books by characters in poems, novel,s films, songs--and not so much the wel
known easily recognizable characters but ones that one is more personally
attached to or having  a cult status.  In creating a work by "X" who exists
via another's imagination at first, one enters into a process of not only
imagining the original author's idea of "X" but "X's" own idea of "X."  The
more one essay to enter into the imaginative and creative being of "X" in
order to produce a work, the less "X" will be like oneself, or like the "X"
created by the original author.  As the work goes on, indeed, who may really
be said to be the "author" of this text of "X's?"

Did the as yet anonymous author of Kendal's book experience a
"becoming-Kendall" in a much different way from that of the actress of who
plays Kendall for the tv audience?  Is entering into becoming-Kendall as an
imaginative act solely different in what ways from embodying Kendall as well
as imagining her?  Or does the writer, too, begin to "act" Kendall and so
begin to vie for the role with the actress?

One day will the author, tired of anonymity, tired of playing the unseen
"understudy" to the diva--one day will the author rush madly on to the set,
seize the actress by the throat and throttle her, in order to claim
Kendall's voice for her or his own?  Screaming "I wrote the book! I am
Kendall! You're just an actress!"--

Because you see, as Kendall, as Kendall-the-author, she/he wrote her own
words--while the actress was merely reciting those written by others for
her!

Or perhaps O marvel of marvels it will turn out --not all that
unsurprisingly--that the actress who plays Kendall--also actually wrote the
book--because she IS for the millions of her fans--she IS Kendall.

Open a poem, a book, a film, a song, a painting, choose a character inside
there--and --begin to work on that character's writings--fragments, shopping
lists, enraged letters to the editors, foul sallies directed at no one in
particular, the starts of novels and poems, the beginnings of autobiography,
the memories of dreams, the flotsam and jetsam of that character's being
until it begins, like blood, to coagulate--and patterns emerge--and before
all that long--when you go out--or someone walks in on you--you will be for
some moments entirely unrecognizable, on the road to becoming someone else .
. .

Has one kidnapped a character in order to write from inside that
character--or does the character trick one, closing the trap door behind one
once inside, and one finds that it is the character who is the kidnapper?

One may see at each step of the way a myriad possibilities opening . . .


Will Buffy appear and slay the "new" Kendall? This Vampire feeding off the
character she originally embodied, brought to life?

And will there be a grand reunion scene with her mother Erica Kane--(Susan
Lucci)--who as the article points out, already wrote HER own book in 1997?
And then they each may write, as Kendal-Buffy-Kendall and Erica Kane--the
accounts of their reunion?

Meanwhile in another zone of the Writers' Union Hall--there is rioting going
on as the ghost writers and "posthumous authors" begin loudly and
vociferously and violently demanding their rights and copy rights, their
existences as Authors--and the overthrow of the "fakes" who paraded all this
while as the "real" authors when in fact their works had been written by
ghosts--vengeful ghosts--seeking a name and nice fat check!!!

And what will happen when the characters who have produced works via
another's writing get wind of it?  Will they not go after these "real life"
"ghost writers" for all they are worth?

And the "posthumous writers" of works produced by publishers, editors,
scholars, family members, estates--when their characters and works start to
be further tampered with and brought to "life" via the work of another--will
they not rise from the dead and go forth--fleshing eating zombies
terrorizing the literary landscapes?

As the bodies of writers living, dead, real, fake and of "uncertain status"
pile up--a strange malaise begins to ripple through the survivors--who
indeed did the writing of these works so hotly contested--or was it writing
itself which had written them, authors, ghost writers,fake writers,
characters in books, persons writing as characters found in others'
works--the whole lot of them--created by an outside energy--forces from
elsewhere than "authors"--arriving at creating writing in every human and
non-human way imaginable--grains in wood, cracks in rocks, bones on a path,
limbs of a tree, an insect-marked leaf, smoke in the sky--the drift and
accumulation of dust motes--patterns of snow--blood stains and mud
streaks--the markings of animals--on and on--

Where does it come from this immense energy and drive--looking at the
incised letterings and numerals on telephone poles beside the dumpsters with
their plastic lid letterings, the graffiti on the wall behind them, the
overflowing heaps of writing on things thrown out--and thinking of the
verses of Sappho found inscribed on the papyri of fifth rate mummies tossed
out in the garbage heaps of Egypt, scuttering in a dry wind among the feral
cats--

Where soon enough may be found, when not at garage sales, Salvation Army
Stores and remainder bins--Charm by Kendell Hart--

Wright Morris, the late novelist, taught many years in the Creative Writing program at San Francisco State. In fact, in the early sixties I had him for the 'short story' where I would meet him with individual once every couple of weeks. A macho sort, he really did not like most of my writing, 'too sensitive', he would say and send me out the door. He liked to talk to guys who took long difficult car trips over narrow mountain roads in the west. (Much of which I have done since!). I think he really did not like poets or poets who wrote prose, and women writers not at all, So it was fun today - in doing a little research on Philip Shultz, on his winning of one half of this year's Pulitzer Prize; Philip took creative writing at the State in the late sixties - talk about Morris' response to one of his stories:

  "When he was 20, Schultz went from his hometown of Rochester, New York, to San Francisco State University to study writing. Schultz buzzed through a 20-page story in a night and submitted it to his teacher, the novelist Wright Morris. Morris summoned him to his office. Holding the pages, he looked Schultz in the face, and said, "I hope you understand what I'm about to do."

   He then took a lighter from his pocket, set fire to the story, and threw it in a wastebasket.

   "He hoped I got the message!" Schultz laughs. "It took me ten years.""

 I suspect Morris' honest response would have had him kicked out of most writing programs. Not exactly good promo for the business. Akin to art school teachers who would paint over a student's work, as some were once much known to do.

 I knew Philip during that time. He, to put it politely, was not at all at home in San Francisco, particularly  Haight Street of the late sixties (indeed an illiterate time mostly on that street).  I think he moved as soon as possible on to Iowa's writiing program and its much more contained realms.

RECONFIGURATIONS: A Journal for Poetics & Poetry / Literature & Culture
<http://reconfigurations.blogspot.com/>

Volume 2: Process: Fields of Signification

Submission Deadline: August 1, 2008

Publication Date: November, 2008

Call for Work: Articles, criticism, dialogues, essays, fictions, images,
interviews, manifestos, poems, reviews, statements, translations, vectors
& whatnots.

Guidelines: Volume two of Reconfigurations
<http://reconfigurations.blogspot.com/> seeks innovative works concerning
process--the dynamics of action, exchange, mediation and
transformation--in relationships and communities.  In what ways are
relationships either subverted or sustained by the idiosyncrasies of
communication?  How and why are the fields of commerce, inquiry and
performance shaped primarily by their experiments and questions rather
than by their commodities and results?  What may be discovered by studying
what is often forgotten or overlooked (process: inside-out & outside-in)
during this age of fascination with product?  Submissions addressing
matters of process defined broadly and surprisingly are welcomed.  In
addition to the themes suggested above, other possibilities might include:
editing, politics, research, teaching, translation, travel, etc.
Reconfigurations invites submissions that engage with those diversified
fields of signification.

Electronic Submissions: showard@du.edu

Reconfigurations is an electronic, peer-reviewed, international, annual
journal for poetics and poetry, creative and scholarly writing, innovative
and traditional concerns with literary arts and cultural studies.
Manuscripts accepted for editorial review: April 1 - August 1.
Reconfigurations launches/publishes during the month of November.
Copyright remains with the authors.  Reconfigurations is an open-access,

An interesting review of tonight's PBS American Masters edition devoted to
Zora Neale Hurston--

the reviewer notes the "unreliable memoirs" of Hurston (with some possible
reasons for this)--as well as many contemporary qualities of her character--

given the "unreliable" side of the writer, what really still sounds most
exciting about this episode is the inclusion of a lot of the documentary
footage Hurston shot as part of her anthropological researches of Black life
in the South--a rare opportunity to see an other way of her seeing which she
also used in her writing beyond her research papers--

Just received word that, after some 50-plus years, The Stinehour =20
Press in Vermont is ceasing operations. In terms of quality of =20
production, one of the best printers ever in America. Very elegant =20
books came from there. I only had the opportunity to use their =20
services when I had a budget that wa supplied by someone else, but I =20
relished those opportunities, and I always thought, for what =20
Stinehour produced, costs were entirely reasonable. It's a sad day =20
for printing.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: April 7, 2008
CONTACT: Joe Choquette, 802-225-5510
Stinehour Press Announces End of Operations
(Lunenburg, Vt.) Managing Director and CEO Warren Bingham announced
today that The Stinehour Press, an award-winning book design and =20
printing firm, will be
ending operations and liquidating its assets after more than 50 years =20=

of operation in
northern Vermont. The company, which had several million dollars in =20
sales last year,
employed a staff of 21 highly skilled workers.
=93Although it=92s been lovingly cared for, our offset press equipment =
is =20
more than 25
years old and lacks many of the digital time-saving devices and speed =20=

of newer presses;
and we=92re behind the technology curve by not yet having adopted fully =20=

digital pre-press
capability,=94 Bingham said. =93Our sales force estimates that the =20
company had to forfeit
several million dollars in business last year because of capacity =20
constraints caused by our
old equipment, and we would need to invest at least $3 million to be =20
competitive. In
today=92s economy, when added to what we=92ve already invested in the =20=

company, it=92s
beyond what a small group of committed owners can do. We=92re heart-=20
broken that what
began with so much hope and represents the hard work and passionate =20
commitment of so
many is ending.=94
Bingham met with employees on Monday to advise them of the closing. =20
He said
workers will be paid for any accrued vacation time and, if possible, =20
will receive
severance pay based on seniority as long as the workout plan enables =20
the company to
provide it. The company has contacted the Vermont Department of Labor =20=

to advise them
of the closing, and intends to be proactive in assisting workers in =20
finding new
employment.
Founded by the legendary book designer and printer, Rocky Stinehour, =20
the Press
operated as a family-owned business until 1998 when it was sold to an =20=

Irish multinational
corporation. Its customer list includes many of the country=92s leading =20=

arts and
cultural institutions and its alumni include an impressive list of =20
some of the most noted
book designers and technicians in the country. Clients include the =20
Art Institute of
Chicago, the San Francisco Fine Art Museums, the Museum of Modern =20
Art, the Museum
of Fine Art in Boston, the Norman Rockwell Museum, The Getty Museum, the
Guggenheim, the Whitney and the Smithsonian. Publishers included =20
Random House,
Little-Brown and many university presses, including Harvard, =20
Stanford, Yale, Princeton
and Dartmouth.
Several years after the initial sale, in 2001, the Irish parent =20
company announced
that it was leaving the printing business and planned to close the =20
Press. The current

I've just recently joined the listserv and wanted to step into this
great space .  I'm a poet and a free-lance journalist based in
London.  I'm researching poetry as a form of 'journalism' and
interested in the ' inbetweeness' as the space, the pause, that
allows a poetic inlet/outlet. a weaving to take place.
Trobadours, minstrels, azmari (Ethiopia) were/are oral traditional
poets  but also journalists/timeless historians bringing a different
kind of 'news' to the community.   Reading between the lines is a
poetic detour in present journalism but I just wondered what its
existence is.  Does it need different data?  Is it a comparison of
worlds?


This is an old piece I wrote

For my money, Chris McCabe is one of the finest younger poets writing in the UK today. His work tends towards analyses of class, societal structures/superstructures, from the standpoint of a devout liberal with few bourgeois aspirations. He is also interested in revamping traditional forms. Some poems from his latest opus in the making (he already has two books out with Salt), "The True History of the Working Class," are here, on PFS Post:

I'm also planning on reading some of my favorite poems,

who are your favorite poets? what are your fav poems? what draws you to these poems/poets?

hit me back with your top, i dunno, three? four? i'd
like to collect poets/poems to read through prior to my reading, to expand my repertoire. i'm also interested in putting together a verbal collage of people's reading interests/loves/trebles/trembles.

The Pierre Bourdieu Memorial Readings Series presents

Juan Manuel S=E1nchez and Josh Corey

Friday, April 11, 2008
Illinois State University
7:00 pm at the University Galleries
(http://www.cfa.ilstu.edu/galleries/)

Juan Manuel S=E1nchez was born and raised on the US side of the San
Diego/Tijuana
border. His work is forthcoming in Pembroke, Mandorla: New Writing from the
Americas and in the anthology Junta: Avant-Garde Latino/a Writing. S=E1nche=
z
received an MA in Literature from UC San Diego and is completing the
MFA at the
University of Illinois. He has worked as an assistant editor for Ninth Lett=
er,
has lectured at various universities, and is now Lecturer of Spanish at the
University of Chicago.

Joshua Corey's full-length books of poetry are Selah (Barrow Street
Press, 2003)
and Fourier Series (Spineless Books, 2005). He is also the author of two
chapbooks: Composition Marble (Pavement Saw Press, 2006) and Hope & Anchor
(Noemi Press, 2007). He is assistant professor of English at Lake Forest
College and lives with his wife and newborn daughter in Evanston, Illinois.

*

The "Pierre Bourdieu Memorial Readings Series" is sponsored by Mandorla: Ne=
w
Writing from the Americas / Nueva escritura de las Am=E9ricas.

*

The "Pierre Bourdieu Memorial Readings Series" is so-named to commemorate t=
he
contributions of this important sociologist to a critical understanding of =
a
range of phenomena specific to the field of cultural production against whi=
ch,
in which, and through which social actors such as writers, readers, student=
s
and professors create, consecrate, fetishize, and disparage. Bourdieu's
theories and methodologies provide unusually perspicuous tools with which t=
o
correct subtle and pervasive injustices in the field and to envision the
possibility of a community of friendly makers less beholden to the
illusions of
aestheticism, the fetish of the author, and the preciosity of writing -- fo=
r a
closer, sparer, clearer relation of use, wonder, kindness, being, love, wor=
ld.

Subject:      Brooklyn Rail rail reviews Obenzinger's Busy Dying.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Many here expressed interest in my note about  Hilton Obenzinger's new novel BUSY DYING.  It just received this lovely review (below) in the new issue of Brooklyn Rail, a paper that seems to be the home of much intelligent reviewing these days - a review of Nathaniel Mackey's new book also appears in this issue.  Hilton, by the way, will be giving a reading at the Morningside Bookshop - across from Columbia -  on Tuesday, April 22, as well as reading at the Columbia 1968 Conference, the evening of April 26 (with Paul Auster, David Shapiro and other now well known writer cohorts of events back then)

 Hilton Obenzinger, Busy Dying
 (Chax, 2008)
 “[He] takes a trip to heaven and talks with all sorts of dead people. It’s like some kind of travel book.” In Busy Dying, a character’s offhand comment on the mystic Emanuel Swedenborg’s Spiritual Diary may as well describe Obenzinger’s fictional memoir itself: only in an apocalyptic 1968 could heaven and hell converge. Life is rhythmically punctuated by death, just as memory is punctuated by moments of revelation, in which the characters are transformed by sudden glimpses of the world beyond knowledge or language. A young handyman believes he sees the finger of God; a girl confined to bed by a nervous disorder feels blessed by the splendid visible and invisible worlds; a college student dives out of his ninth-floor window to, after a poem by Juan Ramón Jiménez, “catch the stars more quickly.”
 Obenzinger, like Conrad and Woolf, is attracted to the dark, unknown realm of which our daily life is only a mirror image. The Columbia strike in 1968, the centerpiece of the memoir, represents such an effort to reach the beyond. The students fail to write poems during their occupation of the president’s office, realizing that the breach of social semantics needs “a language no one had yet invented.” For Obenzinger, in particular, the search for a new language has tangible implications. The son of Polish Jewish immigrants, he has lost Polish, his mother tongue, and Yiddish, his father’s language. Haunted by his brother’s untimely death as well as all the deaths before and after, Obenzinger inherited his father’s “survivor’s guilt” reminiscent of Lord Jim. With the Dada practice of inflicting the Biblical ten plagues on Columbia campus, he was reenacting the history of his lost ancestors.
 The travel to the other world ultimately confirms life. The memoir starts with the death of Obenzinger’s mother, which, to the author’s amazement, transforms her back to a pretty young girl at peace. It ends with the discovery of his father’s youthful poems, where, alone in the strange New World, the father recognizes himself in his son.
 —Lu Chen

Dear Friends, Neighbors, Potato Eaters,

My new collection
of poems, The Importance of Peeling Potatoes in Ukraine, was recently
released by Penguin.  It can be found at Amazon or from me
directly (with a pretty ugly little drawing inside) at:
http://markyakich.com/potatoes/ippu.html

Sample poem:


A SOURCE OF STYLE

Hart Crane vaulted from a ship's railing in purple pajamas.
Purple to soften the blow.


Take care,
Mark

Thank you, Obododimma!  Do you also have a blog?  I read some of your poems at Shadowtrain (even before you read my blog!):  http://shadowtrain.com/id232.html

I really dig "The City" with its:

new-yorking
parising
londoning



I also really loved, "Museum Piece" with its "Skin of water, thriving / Will find us here"


Cheers,
Amy

Hi All, I have been mulling over an idea for an essay for awhile, on the to=
pic of poets who write about themselves in the third person, as if they wer=
e a character in their own poetry. Some examples:Tomaz Salamun in "History"=
, which begins: "Tomaz Salamun is a monster."Poems by Dean Young, Dan Chias=
son, Terrance Hayes, Kenneth Koch, Walt Whitman. In prose, Philip Roth does=
 this in "Operation Shylock," Borges does this in "Borges y Yo." Obviously,=
 my list is mostly American and totally male. So, I am looking for any othe=
r examples of poets writing about themselves as characters in their own poe=
ms to round it out. I am new to this list. Thanks a lot for any help,  Cour=
tney Queeney

TOWN HALL MEETING
Tues. Apr. 15, 6:30 pm
Clemente Soto Velez: 107 Suffolk St., First Floor

JOIN R.U.C.M.A.!  (RISE UP CREATIVE MUSIC AND ARTS)
STAND UP FOR INNOVATIVE MUSIC AND ARTS!

The ongoing loss of venues, cultural centers and rehearsal spaces in NYC
must be addressed.  We must not only stop the erosion of NYC as a leader
in the innovative arts, but develop strategies and actions to safeguard
and guarantee the creation, performance and exhibition of serious,
visionary contemporary music and art.  "NOW'S THE TIME" for the community
of artists and their supporters to make a stand.  We are fighting for our
livelihood – musicians need venues suitable in size and comfort, with a
quality piano and sound/light systems.  Practice and rehearsal studios.
Affordable apartments.  We need STABILITY – so as to keep and develop our
community base.

WE MUST STAND TOGETHER TO:
? run our own (subsidized) performance spaces
? help find, and pressure government to build, affordable housing for
artists
? inspire and support each other and our local communities
? create a cooperative environment between arts groups
? save art in our schools – and thereby foster creativity and innovation
? use our collectivity to gain government support

Changing the Conversation
Rise Up Creative Music and Arts (RUCMA) is a grassroots alliance of
musicians and music lovers, united to address their creative, political
and practical concerns through advocacy and actualization of specific
goals.  RUCMA aims to change the role of artists in society by changing
the role that art plays in the life of the average citizen.  To
accomplish this we must change the conversation surrounding the arts.
History has shown that a thriving, creative artistic community is an
essential for a healthy, prosperous, intellectually and spiritually vital
society.  We must now stand up and remind our civic leaders of the
contributions we have made and continue to make.  We must now stand up
and refuse to have our contributions to continue to be taken for granted.
 We must now  -- in unified voice -- stake our claim to our place in
society and the value of our work.

At this meeting we will discuss RUCMA's progress and future goals.
Attendees will have the opportunity to join and become involved in future
actions.
Everything we do will be through Creative Action and with RESPECT.

RUCMA's MESSAGE
Innovative music and arts need a strong STABLE Community base in
Manhattan - come to Town Hall Meeting Tuesday April 15 at CSV at 6:30
"Peter Brotzmann has exemplified European improvised music for over
40 years.”  - All About Jazz

“What makes Bennink special is his manifest love for the music, a
love that inclines him to tear down the cardboard walls that too
often separate different schools of jazz.”        – Drummer World


New York, NY – Arts for Art proudly presents a special concert for
the Vision/ RUCMA series with two legends of modern music,
saxophonist Peter Brotzmann and drummer Han Bennink.  The two free
music masters have a long history, beginning with Brotzmann’s
landmark 1968 recording, “Machine Gun.”  A trio with Belgian pianist
Fred Van Hove grew out of these collaborations.  But in 1976 the two
free music masters began work as a duo releasing a series of
recordings, concluding with 1980’s “Atsugi Concert.”  They weren’t
heard from again “on wax” until Brotzmann booked a series of
performances in early 2004 with the explicit intention of capturing
the performances for later release.  The result, “Still Popular After
All Those Years” was issued on vinyl on Brotzmann’s own resurrected
BRO label later that same year.  Joining them for this special
performance are trumpeter Peter Evans and bassist Tom Blancarte.


Brotzmann was involved with the Fluxus movement, but grew
dissatisfied with art galleries and exhibitions. He has designed most
of his own album covers. One of his first musical partnerships was
that with bassist, Peter Kowald. In the 1980s, he flirted with heavy
metal and noise rock, including a stint in Last Exit.  He has
released over thirty albums as a bandleader, and has appeared on
dozens more. His "Die Like A Dog Quartet" (with Toshinori Kondo,
William Parker and Hamid Drake) is loosely inspired by saxophonist
Albert Ayler, a prime influence on Brötzmann's music. Since 1997 he
has toured and recorded regularly with the Peter Brötzmann Chicago
Tentet (initially an Octet).  His latest release, ”Born Broke” is a
series of duets with drummer Peter Uuskyla.


Through the 1960s Han Bennink drummed with American musicians
visiting the Netherlands, including Eric Dolphy, Dexter Gordon and
Sonny Rollins.  He became a central figure in the emerging European
free improvisation scene, co-founding the Instant Composers Pool in
1967 with Misha Mengelberg and Willem Breuker.  Through much of the
1990s he played in Clusone 3 with saxophonist and clarinetist Michael
Moore and cellist Ernst Reijseger.  His style is wide-ranging,
running from conventional jazz drumming to highly unconventional free
improvisation, for which he often uses whatever objects happen to be
onstage (chairs, music stands, instrument cases), his own body (a
favorite device involves putting a drumstick in his mouth and
striking it with the other stick), and the entire performance space
-- the floor, doors, and walls.


Trumpeter Peter Evans has been a part of the avante-garde music
community in New York City since 2003. His recording debut as a
bandleader, “The Peter Evans Quartet” was released on Firehouse 12 in
2007. Recent collaborators include: Perry Robinson, Fred Frith, Ned
Rothenberg, Okkyung Lee, and Chris Speed.

Tom Blancarte is a bassist, improviser and composer living and
working in New York City. He is a busy performer in a variety of
ensembles in the New York area, his most active groups being the
hyperactive duo Sparks with trumpeter Peter Evans, Dave Smith’s Who
Put The Bad Mouth On Me, the trio Totem, and the Peter Evans Quartet.

That is indeed a rare concert - and a privilege for those interested in =
the
jazz avant garde (although this term, after 50 years, has probably lost =
its
meaning a long time ago) - to hear the greats of the European jazz avant
garde theatre. Brotzmann was here in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada (that's
north of the U.S. border) a few years ago but, to my great misfortune, I =
did
not find out about it until the evening of the concert and could not =
roust
enough funds to go on short notice. Enjoy the show and know that I wish =
I
could be amongst you.

I just heard Meryl Streep and John Guare read two of my favorite poems at an Academy of American Poets fundraiser so I offer these two as ideas to you for your reading: Wallace Stevens' Sunday Morning and William Carlos Williams "Of Asphodel, That Greeny Flower".    They went over well at a packed Avery Fisher Hall, particularly Streep's rendition of Stevens.  Regards, Tom Savage

I will be leaving Kentucky in about three weeks for a four-week writing =
residency at Footpaths House to Creativity on the island of Flores in =
the Azores (yes, I had to look on a map to find it, too).  I was =
wondering if any of you have been there and, if so, what your experience =
was. =20

I just learned that I may be there by myself (with no other artists or =
writers or even a caretaker for the property). I don't speak Portuguese =
and only a little Spanish.  I'm up for an adventure, but I'm wondering =
if I should concerned. =20

Do any of you have an experience with the Azores or this particular =
artist retreat?

Thanks,
Christina Lovin

yes i totally agree about the term avante garde especially since
everything when it's new ala louis armstrong
and well way back to cave drawings  is ....then it's not
interesting question what if anything today can reallly be considered
avante garde??

not just merely foward thinking but truly avante-garde besides
ecology????

Steve,

Well, I suppose avant-garde is a modernist concept and now that modernism
Is a part of history, an anachronism as far as contemporary culture is
concerned, then its concepts can no longer apply to what is happening now,
in this post-postmodernist age of rampant pluralism. More later.

Instead, let's just use "the cops" each time we mean "avant garde."

I wonder if, in one hundred years, someone (I was going to say we'll but I
don't think that I'll be around at that time) will be talking about
post-post-post-post-post-post modernism. Better yet, maybe its time to think
of a new term and leave the posts to the fences and corrals.

i really love the post-avant thing because it says something funny about
temporality, and not until we think through that new temporal thing will we
be free of the post-post-post-posts.

& so, let's get going on that... any ideas about the temporality of this
post-avant thing?

the post-language poets are a good place to look (the subject who speaks has
to have changed for this post-avant thing--no more linear,
nature-dominating, and self-expressing  lyric 'I' (not unless there's a
broader conception of the self, that is).

and Ed Roberson's Voice Cast Out To Talk  Us In (something about how we fall
out of music and moods...).

John, and All,

I doubt it. I have often wondered this, but I think most groups reject the
idea of being "post" since it implies you're not the "first." Post avant,
post-avante, povante or pomo, post modernist, etc, all seem to be hated
terms within the communities these very terms seek to "label".

What if, *gasp*, we were to get past labels?

John,

that could have saved you all those other posts and obviously a little anger
and irritation,  I would have thought that my reference to our age of
pluralism, (which while a label in itself, ultimately disempowers the art of
labelling)  would have pointed the way to our obviation of that perennial
urge to label and ossify things.  More later.

Roy Exley.

"neo" has used most by artists as in neo abstract expressionist, neo realist

Subject:      Obama is correct about rural PA
MIME-Version: 1.0

Having grown up in rural Pennsylvania I can promise you that Obama's
assessments are correct about many of these people being bitter and clinging
to their guns and religion.  It took me YEARS to dig out of my anger for the
torture they put me through for being queer, for not wanting to kill deer,
pheasants, rabbits, and instead planting and tending flowers, vines, and
other boys.

What's MOST IMPRESSIVE is Obama's ability to take his statements and STAND
BEHIND THEM saying, "YES, OF COURSE THEY ARE BITTER," and listing why they
Should be.

He's right of course.  What's terrible though is that the harsh world of
rural Pennsylvania (harsh as in trying to actually survive when the
factories and industry disappear DUE in large part to the Clintons!), like
most places where life is very hard, scapegoating is the major pastime.
It's bottomless, the racism, homophobia, sexism, and I can't see HOW anyone
will ever be able to break through it.  These things make me very sad,
mostly because there are many people where I grew up who I got to know as
intelligent and talented, until they found out I was queer, which of course
put an end to communications with me.

But many of the people where I come from will NEVER vote for a white woman
for president anymore than they will vote for a black man for president.
And if ANY candidate ever dares say ANYTHING positive about homosexuals,
well, THAT'S IT, THEY'RE OUT!  Abortion is also a hot button, of course.
Oy, I'm exhausted thinking about the wicked things I know they're saying in
the bars and beauty parlors, at the mills and diners.

But Obama is correct in every way.  And he's amazing that he remains so
focused and on topic, even if the topic is about something he himself said
that might hurt his campaign.  He has integrity I thought IMPOSSIBLE for
Democrats!  He has my support!  (Part of me is SO AFRAID he's another Bill
Clinton though!  I heard Clinton's one speech at a gay rights rally in DC
when he was first running for president, and I BOUGHT IT, bought every lying
word of it!)

But if Obama doesn't win the nomination I'm voting for Ralph Nader again.
Nader was just in Philadelphia and gave an amazing speech!  Nader is the
sexiest LIVING MIND!

Louise Erdrich publishes both. Since her work is primarily narrative
she finds poems limiting. Recently (Original Fire, 2003) she published
poems based on the characters in her novels.

Then I think of Paul Muldoon who writes many, many narrative poems
instead of novels.

I send out *Meditations in a Time of Delusions and Lies* periodically, but
you may have noticed that you have not gotten any lately. Some of you may b=
e
relieved, but let me explain.

I've been very busy publishing a book, and it's just been released. It's an
autobiographical novel, *Busy Dying*, which revolves in great part around
the student occupation and strike at Columbia University in 1968. (The titl=
e
is taken from a line in one of Bob Dylan's songs: "And he not busy being
born is . . .") I've also been helping to put on a conference on the
anniversary of that student revolt 40 years later, which will be held April
24-27 at Columbia. You can take a look at the schedule for that conference
at http://www.columbia1968.info/ . I will also be holding the first of
several book events for* **Busy Dying*, and if you're in the vicinity,
you're invited to come:

*=B7        April 22, 7PM, at Morningside Bookshop on Broadway and 114th
Street, New York City.
=B7        May 13, 7PM at Modern Times Bookstore at 888 Valencia Street, Sa=

=B7        May 15, 6PM at the Stanford Bookstore on the Stanford University
campus.

You can find out more about this as well as my other books, by going to

If you would like to get the book, you can order it from the publisher Chax
at www.chax.org, Amazon, or badger your local bookstore to order it from
Small Press Distribution at www.spdbooks.org .

BUSY DYING
An autobiographical novel by Hilton Obenzinger

At Columbia University on April 23, 1968, Hilton Obenzinger was one of many
students who dramatically occupied the president's office in Low Library.
For six days they protested the university's secret research to support the
Vietnam War and its plans to build a gym in Morningside Park despite the
opposition of Harlem. The occupation and subsequent strike 40 years ago was
a generational moment repeated in universities around the country and
throughout the world. Busy Dying is an autobiographical novel, a portrait o=
f
the author's Polish Jewish "survivor" family, a coming of age in poetry,
music, politics, and friends in New York City and Columbia, including a
dangerous exodus through the Yukon to end up teaching on an Indian
reservation in Northern California.  All of this is comically and sometimes
tragically relived as the author is inspired by a series of encounters and
coincidences, including the revelations of students he teaches at Stanford
today and the surprising discovery of the story behind Hilton Obenzinger, a
1980s Long Island high school humor magazine

Some comments by fellow authors (Bill Berkson, Paul Auster, Luc Sante) and
the first Public Review in the Brooklyn Rail:

No one tells the story of the Columbia University variation of Apocalypse
1968 -- its prelude and its up-to-date fallout (e.g., This Is Your Life) --
better than Poet-and-Communard-in-Residence of that and other histories,
Hilton Obenzinger. When Politics meant something other than Brute Force,
Obenzinger was there, observing and making it happen, like one breath in,
another out. In deft, benign, deep and often hilarious prose, he has kept
the faith. - Bill Berkson

Hilton Obenzinger is an American original. His lost histories are acts of
legerdemain and cunning=96mixing truth and imagination in ways rarely seen
before. . . - Paul Auster

Busy Dying is so true and funny and unexpected and sweet and profound and
very deeply moving. As the clich=E9 goes: I laughed and I cried--for real! =
-
Luc Sante

-------------

Hilton Obenzinger, Busy Dying
(Chax, 2008)
Lu Chen, Brooklyn Rail, April 2008

"[He] takes a trip to heaven and talks with all sorts of dead people. It's
like some kind of travel book." In Busy Dying, a character's offhand commen=
t
on the mystic Emanuel Swedenborg's Spiritual Diary may as well describe
Obenzinger's fictional memoir itself: only in an apocalyptic 1968 could
heaven and hell converge. Life is rhythmically punctuated by death, just as
memory is punctuated by moments of revelation, in which the characters are
transformed by sudden glimpses of the world beyond knowledge or language. A
young handyman believes he sees the finger of God; a girl confined to bed b=
y
a nervous disorder feels blessed by the splendid visible and invisible
worlds; a college student dives out of his ninth-floor window to, after a
poem by Juan Ram=F3n Jim=E9nez, "catch the stars more quickly."

Obenzinger, like Conrad and Woolf, is attracted to the dark, unknown realm
of which our daily life is only a mirror image. The Columbia strike in 1968=
,
the centerpiece of the memoir, represents such an effort to reach the
beyond. The students fail to write poems during their occupation of the
president's office, realizing that the breach of social semantics needs "a
language no one had yet invented." For Obenzinger, in particular, the searc=
h
for a new language has tangible implications. The son of Polish Jewish
immigrants, he has lost Polish, his mother tongue, and Yiddish, his father'=
s
language. Haunted by his brother's untimely death as well as all the deaths
before and after, Obenzinger inherited his father's "survivor's guilt"
reminiscent of Lord Jim. With the Dada practice of inflicting the Biblical
ten plagues on Columbia campus, he was reenacting the history of his lost
ancestors.

The travel to the other world ultimately confirms life. The memoir starts
with the death of Obenzinger's mother, which, to the author's amazement,
transforms her back to a pretty young girl at peace. It ends with the
discovery of his father's youthful poems, where, alone in the strange New
World, the father recognizes himself in his son.

CA,

I grew up in rural upstate New York and things were similar there. If you
weren't one who'd love to go "mud boggin'" in your 4x4, if you didn't hunt,
if you weren't "local"... you didn't stand a chance. Bitter isn't a strong
enough word, but it's more accurate than what most politicians offer, saying
that timeless hogwash about rural America being the backbone of this
country. Who are they kidding?

Integrity is easy when there's nothing at stake. He's not going to
win Pennsylvania whatever he does.

I do admire his principled vote against the war, though, against all
the pressure there must have been on senators. Oh, wait--he didn't
get to vote against the war, since he wasn't in the senate.

I expect that Obama will get the nomination, and if he does I'll vote
for him for president, but I hope he's not the paragon he
presents--if he is, he'll be eaten alive in Washington.

How will teachers and reviewers function without this ability to
categorize poetry? What will happen to critics and blurbists? What of
Poetics? How to market and sell? One can certainly describe AND
transcend borders, yes?

<snip>
"neo" has used most by artists as in neo abstract expressionist, neo realist
etc
<snip>

The five writers known collectively as Luther Blissett and/or Wu Ming once
said of 'neoism', which they are sometimes said to represent, 'Neoism
doesn't exist. It's just a prefix teaming up with a suffix.'

Though it's better than 'Post avant', albeit only just.

Dear experimental music junkies-- Get your fix Tuesday. Musetry continues
its diving expedition into the deep waters of Steve Dalachinsky's poetry.
Jackson Moore's trio is gonna swing your body and tweak your mind. And
you'll be home before 11.


The Living Lab at the Living Theatre presents


Tuesday, April 15, 8pm


The Musetry Project:  Steve Dalachinsky, poet
Ellen Christi, voice / Ty Cumbie, guitar
James Ilgenfritz, bass / Eric Eigner & Greg Burrows, percussion


and


Jackson Moore Trio: Jackson Moore, alto sax
Eivind Opsvik, bass  / Eric McPherson,  drums


at the Living Theatre:
21 Clinton St. (bet. Houston & Stanton)
Info: www.livinglabny.org / tcumbie@nyc.rr.com
$10 / $5 students




The Musetry Project
Musetry, a fusion of music and poetry, is the brainchild of
guitarist/composer Ty Cumbie. While there is a long tradition —
stretching back to ancient times — of music and poetry blended, in almost
every case either poetry is simply set to music, music merely accompanies
and beautifies poetry, or the two forms exist simultaneously but in no
particularly interconnected way. Musetry seeks to secure itself as a
fusion form in which neither music nor poetry are any longer separate
from each other. Essentially, music moves toward poetry and poetry toward
music, neither being dominant or subordinate. This is achieved through a
variety of techniques developed by Cumbie, and through group
experimentation. The work has been performed publicly at the Bowery
Poetry Club, Zebulon, The Living Theatre and other venues in New York.


Jackson Moore Trio plays the original, forward-looking tunes by Moore,
who represents the purest amalgam I've seen in a while of all that makes
jazz interesting and alive. The music swings ferociously, thanks to the
superb rhythm section, but never in an expected way. Moore has carried
Ornette Coleman's harmolodic theory further than anybody I know of, plus
he's got the rest of the jazz continuum working. If you care about jazz
this trio will have something for you.

Equating all rural areas with food production is a bit reductive. And
certainly you wouldn't expect all country dwellers to start farms, would
you?

An Evening with
Carolee Schneemann

Mon Apr 21 | 8 pm
Jack H. Skirball Screening Series

This program is part of a series of screenings of the work of Carolee
Schneemann that takes place in Los Angeles April 20-25, 2008 at the
following venues: Los Angeles Filmforum (April  20) and UCLA Film &
Television Archive (April 25).

See listings below. Information: www.lafilmforum.org and
www.cinema.ucla.edu/public/calendar/calendar_f.html

Carolee Schneemann has never ceased to cross mediums and boundaries to make
work that resonates with raw poetic power. From her collaged war or diary
films and provocative performances to her photos, paintings and
installations, Schneemann's varied creations deconstruct our ingrained
preconceptions and everyday assumptions. In words, images and actions, her
art is deeply personal, sharply critical, intensely expressive, and always
innovative. This special evening with Schneemann features a collection of
some of the most highly charged political statements, erotic episodes and
domestic disturbances in American avant-garde cinema. The program includes
three beautifully restored 16mm films, Fuses (1965=967, 29 min., silent),
Viet-Flakes (1965, 11 min.), Plumb Line (1968=9671, 18 min.), and a recent
video, Devour (2003=964, 7:52 min.).

In person: Carolee Schneemann

"Prior to Schneemann, the female body in art was mute and functioned almost
exclusively as a mirror of masculine desire." Jan Avgikos, Artforum

"The magnitude of Schneemann's influence is undeniable=85 When she describe=
s
her body as a pleasurable weapon, a missile she sends into our repressive
culture to blow it apart, Madonna's in-your-face eroticism immediately come=
s
to mind." =96 Jane Harris, Plexus

Program at REDCAT

1964-67 Fuses
Film - 16mm, color, silent.
New restoration of original 16mm collaged print=96May 2007, 29:51 min.
Part of "Autobiographical Trilogy". Filming begun in 1964. This self-shot
erotic film remains a controversial classic. With awards at Cannes (1968),
the Yale Film Festival (1992), and showings at Museums and Universities
internationally, Fuses has nevertheless encountered censorship over the
years. "[A]notorious masterpiece, a silent celebration in color of
heterosexual love making, the film unifies erotic energies within a domesti=
c
environment through cutting, super-imposition and layering of abstract
impressions scratched into the celluloid itself... Fuses succeeds perhaps
more than any other film in objectifying the sexual streamings of the body'=
s
mind." - The Guardian

1965 Viet-Flakes
Film - 8mm printed to 16mm, b/w, toned. 11 minutes. Sound collage by James
Tenney.
Composed from an obsessive collection of Vietnam War atrocity images,
compiled over five years from foreign magazine and newspapers. Schneemann
uses the 8mm camera to "travel" within the photographs producing a volatile
animation. Broken rhythms and visual fractures are heightened by a sound
collage by James Tenney of Vietnamese religious chants, secular songs,
fragments of Bach, 60s pop hits. "One of the most effective indictments of
the Vietnam War ever made." =96 Robert Enright, Border Crossings.

1971 Plumb Line
Film - Super 8, step printed to 16mm, color, sound. 18 minutes, sound by C.
Schneemann.
Part II of "Autobiographical Trilogy". Filming begun in 1968. The
dissolution of a relationship unravels through visual and aural
equivalences. Schneemann splits and recomposes actions of the lovers in a
streaming montage of disruptive permutations: 8mm is printed as 16mm, movin=
g
images freeze, frames reoccur and dissolve until the film bursts into
flames, consuming it's own substance.

2003-04  Devour
Multi-channel color video projection with sound. (7:52 minutes)
"Devour" is a multi-channel video projection realized with support from a
Rockefeller Foundation Media Arts Grant and an Eyebeam Artist Residency.
Perceptual tensions drive a range of images edited to contrast evanescent,
fragile elements with violent, concussive, speeding fragments. Looped
sources of the imagery combine political disasters, domestic intimacy and
the ambiguous menace within enlarged details of gestures=97both human and
mechanical.

The history of Carolee Schneemann's work is characterized by research into
archaic visual traditions, pleasure wrested from suppressive taboos, the
body of the artist in dynamic relationship with the social body. Her work
questions the exclusivity of traditional western categories by creating a
space of complementarity, mutuality, and integration and she has transforme=
d
the very definition of art, especially with regard to discourses concerning
the body, sexuality, and technology.
         Born in Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, she received a B.A. from Bard
College and an M.F.A. from the University of Illinois. She began her art
career as a painter in the late 1950s. Her painting work began to adopt som=
e
of the characteristics of Neo-Dada art, as she used box structures coupled
with expressionist brushwork. In 1962, Schneemann and her then-husband
composer James Tenney moved to New York, where they became involved in the
art and music scene and met Claes Oldenberg, Merce Cunningham, John Cage,
Robert Rauschenberg, George Brecht, Malcolm Goldstein, Philip Glass, Terry
Riley and Steve Reich. Schneemann started working with the artists of the
Judson Church, and participated in works such as Oldenberg's Store Days
(1962) and Robert Morris's Site (1964) where she played a living version of
Edward Manet's Olympia. She began to use her nude body in works, feeling
that it needed to be seized back from the status of a cultural possession.
Production on her work Eye Body began in 1962. Schneemann created a "loft
environment" filled with broken mirrors, motorized umbrellas, and rhythmic
color units. To become a piece of the art herself, she covered herself in
various materials including grease, chalk, and plastic. In 1964, the
reworking of original film footage of three 1964 performances of Meat Joy i=
n
Paris, London and New York City ushered Schneemann into film and
video-making.
         The New Museum of Contemporary Art, NYC, featured a retrospective
of Schneemann's works entitled "Up To And Including Her Limits" in 1998  In
2007, a dual exhibit at CEPA Gallery, Buffalo NY & MOCCA Toronto featured
recent video installations. Electronic Arts Intermix NYC and Anthology Film
Archives NYC collaborated on presentations of newly restored and current
film & videos November 2007.  Her work has also been shown at such renowned
institutions as the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), the New
York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, the Museu=
m
of Contemporary Art, Chicago and the London National Film Theatre.
         She has been the recipient of Media Grants from the Rockefeller
Foundation, a Pollock-Krasner Fellowship, as well as grants from the
Gottlieb Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Andrea Frank Foundation
and the National Endowment for the Arts.
Schneemann has taught at several universities, including the California
Institute of the Arts, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Hunter
College and Rutgers University, where she was the first female art professo=
r
hired.
         MIT Press has just published Imaging Her Erotics - Essays,
Interviews, Projects. Editions of Schneemann's previous writing includes;
More Than Meat Joy: Complete Performance Works and Selected Writings (1979,
1997); Video Burn (1992); Early and Recent Work (1983); ABC - We Print
Anything - In The Cards (1977); Cezanne, She Was A Great Painter (1976); an=
d
Parts of a Body House Book (1972).  Correspondence Course, a selection of
her letters edited by Kristine Stiles is forthcoming from Duke University
Press.

 Part III of "Autobiographical Trilogy".
Schneemann's cat, Kitch, which was featured in works such as Fuses, was a
major figure in Schneemann's work for almost twenty years
The moving conclusion to the autobiographical trilogy was originally shot o=
n
Super-8. The film documents the routines of daily life whilst time passes, =
a
relationship winds down and death closes in: filming and recording stopped
when the elderly cat died.
The soundtrack mixes personal reminiscences with ambient sounds of the
household, and includes the original text used for Schneemann's 1975
performance Interior Scroll.
The preservation of Kitch's Last Meal was supported by the Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts and realized by the Anthology Film Archives.
Plus additional works to be announced.

New and Recent Videos by Carolee Schneemann
Schneemann will present a selection of recently released videos, including:
Duo (2008), which incorporates extracts from her earlier Infinity Kisses an=
d
completes her exploration of human and feline sensual communication;
Interior Scroll=97The Cave (1995), a performance in a vast underground cave=
 in
which Schneemann and seven nude women perform the ritualized actions of
"Interior Scroll"=97 reading the text as each woman slowly extracts a scrol=
l
from her vagina; Vesper's Stampede to My Holy Mouth (1992), in which
Victoria Vesna and Schneemann explore suppressed feminist issues of female
subjugation, the unconscious, the paranormal and goddess religions; Devour
(2003-04), a montage that Schneemann describes as contrasting "evanescent,
fragile elements with violent, concussive, speeding fragments... political
disasters, domestic intimacy, and ambiguous menace"; Mop-Mop--Improvisation
for Job at New York University (2007), which captures an interview for a
teaching position that Schneemann spontaneously transformed into a
performance; the newly reedited version of Americana I Ching Apple Pie
(2007), which documents the artist in front of a packed lecture hall as she
demonstrates, with hilarious and deadpan delivery, how to make the
quintessential American dessert=97apple pie; Body Collage (1967), in which
Schneemann paints her body with wallpaper paste and then rolls through a
floor covered in shredded paper, transforming herself into a constantly
changing, moving collage. (This film was preserved through the Avant-Garde
Masters program funded by The Film Foundation and administered by the
NFPF.); Meat Joy (1964), an erotic rite, a celebration of flesh as material
that could at any moment be sensual, comic, joyous, repellent.

Zoe Whittall is the author of the novel Bottle Rocket Hearts
(Cormorant, 2007) and two volumes of poetry, including the
recent Emily Valentine Poems (Snare, 2006) and The Best
Ten Minutes of Your Life (McGilligan, 2001). The Globe and Mail
recently called her, "the cockiest, brashest, funniest, toughest,
most life-affirming, elegant, scruffy, no-holds-barred writer to
emerge from Montreal since Mordecai Richler." Her stories
and poetry have been anthologized widely in books like Baby
Remember My Name edited by Michelle Tea, Red Light:
Superheroes, Saints & Sluts edited by Anna Camilleri, Brazen
Femme edited by Anna Camilleri and Chloe Brushwood-Rose,
With a Rough Tongue: Femmes Write Porn edited by Amber
Dawn and Trish Kelly, and Breathing Fire Two: Canada's New
Poets edited by Lorna Crozier and Patrick Lane. She was born
on a sheep farm in rural Quebec and has lived in Toronto
since 1997.

Over the last three decades Eileen Myles has written, produced,
and performed a multitude of poems, plays, articles, libretti. In
1992, she conducted an openly female "write in campaign" for
President of the United States. She has toured internationally
with Sister Spit's Rambling Road Show and is considered
"America's best known unofficial poet." In Sorry, Tree (Wave
Books, 2007), Myles describes "some nature" as well as the
transmigration of souls from the east coast to the west. She's
a "rock star of modern poetry" according to Bust magazine and
we're glad to have here back at SPT.

Please note special day for above event!

California Wasn't Good For Us,
A Benefit Reading for Reid G=F3mez

All OUT and All SKIN
California Wasn't Good For Us, a benefit reading for
San Francisco Native and Navajo writer Reid G=F3mez.
Featuring a landmark line up of queer American Indian
artists:  Jewelle Gomez, Kim Shuck, Reid G=F3mez and
Master of Ceremonies, L. Frank.  In the spirit of
radical feminism Jewelle Gomez, Kim Shuck and the
legendary L. Frank have joined co-host Small Press
Traffic in the first and only benefit for Reid G=F3mez
since her ill-fated and misdiagnosed ruptured
appendix in 2002.  Contrary to urban myth, Reid did
not die, but she remains permanently disabled after
nearly four years of hospitalizations and
reconstructive/reparative surgeries.  With no health
insurance, no state or federal financial support, Reid
continues to struggle to manage her physical therapy
regime (5 hours daily), and the ironic inability to
sit for long periods of time.  At this time her most
urgent need is the purchase of a new computer and data
recovery.  In this age even a writer who still writes,
ala Capote, prone and with pen and paper, requires
access to a computer to print and circulate work.  As
Reid is not able to hold a job, and does not qualify
for state or federal disability, her only means of
support is through her writing.

The benefit takes place on April 20, from 2-4, at

today someone said  if they had stayed with their spouse (i'm not being
specific for reasons obvious) they wouldn't have become an artist
anyone else have that problem ? wow i heard the word artist thrown around
so much today
"become"  is an interesting concept  like fowardly thinking backward
thoughts labels yes
i've been labeled many things including el cheapo (a true one) post age
rather than postage
these posts  are post yesterday and robert zamsky the emails i send you
are so freaky
they never rarely get thru do you have a second account
yer edu account either comes back or makes my machine think it's in the
stone age
well i never really felt like an artist or a poet or a collagist yet for
better or worse
with my rather large albeit at times mediocre output i sure haven't done
much of anything else in my life
oh besides get high (well that's over)  peddle on the street for too many
years
sing in the shower  and wish constantly to be loved by all
unconditionally
and to BE AVANTE_GARDE  like this Ma Rainey stuff on the radio   ok steve
go to sleep
tomorrow is ahead better be on yer guard

Actually, Marjorie Perloff has some really interesting things to say about
this assertion that the avant garde is part of modernism and that modernism
is "over" in her intro to 21st Century Poetics.  I don't know that I can do
justice to her argument at this point, as I'm just now reading this work and
haven't fully absorbed it all, so I will merely suggest looking into what
she has to say.

Steve,

Well, I suppose avant-garde is a modernist concept and now that modernism
Is a part of history, an anachronism as far as contemporary culture is
concerned, then its concepts can no longer apply to what is happening now,
in this post-postmodernist age of rampant pluralism. More later.

Aryanil Mukherjee of Kaurab journal wrote me some very interesting letters
re Ginsberg's legacy in Bengal--which gave an insight into the ways
Ginsberg's presence affected the community he lived in and the poets he met
with--and the ways they so greatly affected him--and how this changed
through time-from the Bengali point of view--i'm thankful to Aryanil for
giving the "other side of the story" so to speak--

Indian Journals (City Lights) is one of AG's finest works--

Ginsberg wrote a little intro for a collection of Bengali poets translated
for the (1963) City Lights Anthology Two

(which featured a Pound/Celine mini-selections of points of view pro and con
and an Italian interview, disputed by the editors, with Pound-)

At least when Obama says something that may hurt him politically, unlike
Clinton, he's telling the truth. That rural people are bitter at their
plight under Bush, especially that most of them voted for him, is true. That
rural people are into guns and religion (which, in America, are equivocal),
is also true. Hell, they're proud of it! The media acts like these people
were going to vote for Obama, as if he's losing votes. (Hillary, who also
attended an Ivy League college, is suddenly saying "Aw shucks," and keeps a
chaw in her purse.) Just like with race, the guy is trying to make Americans
face who they are. You can't change course without admitting to which course
you're on.

Of course politicians are always going to disappoint everyone on something,
as the art of politics is compromise. You just have to know where your core
values are, and there draw the line. This is Bush's strength. Unfortunately,
his line is drawn with the blood and tears of the poor.

Consider the smut Obama's had thrown at him by the Clinton gang. & consider his campaign which includes Howard Dean innovations with the best of Kerry rhetoric.

He needs to fight back when the swift boats attack during the General election. If he does that, he should win. On the other hand, he is a democrat, and they know too well how to lose.

the arguments that the notion of the avant garde is no longer relevant
always seem a bit fishy to me.

for instance, one argument is that the avant garde defines itself in
opposition to a mainstream, and 'since there no longer is a mainstream', the
avant garde no longer makes any sense, like hot without cold.

i'd have two or more objections to the above arg. no mainstream? follow the
money. the mainstream is mainstream by virtue mainly of money to propagate
the stream in prominent media. to say there is no mainstream is to deny the
role of money in dominating mass media. who does that?

also, it seems wrong-headed to think of the avant garde as simply the
non-mainstream part of a mainstream/non-mainstream binary. i think of the
avant garde as being strong in areas such as innovation, experimentation
and, yes, doing things that are not going to be popular, but doing them
anyway. not simply as an alt-mainstream.

the arguments against the mere existence or relevance of the avant garde
often smack to me of a heavy influence of corporatism. the notion that the
internet, say, levels the playing field to the point where everything gets
equal attention in media is preposterous. the internet helps me in many
ways, including getting my work out there, but i certainly don't have a mass
audience and that is just not the goal, for me; instead, i want my work to
be available to those who are interested in such innovation. and it is.

 =0AMembers of the group, set up to defend the 'beauty and precision' of th=
e English language, have turned their attention to contemporary poetry and =
poets, arguing that too often strings of words are being labelled as poems =
despite the fact they have no rhyme or metre. =0AThe campaigners say that t=
here should be a new definition of poetry, outlining the characteristics ne=
eded before a piece of work can be called a poem. =0A'A lot of people high =
up in poetry circles look down on rhyme and metre and think it is old-fashi=
oned,' said Bernard Lamb, president of the QES and an academic at Imperial =
College London. 'But what is the definition of poetry? I would say, if it d=
oesn't have rhyme or metre, then it is not poetry, it is just prose. You ca=
n have prose that is full of imagery, but it is still prose.' =0AThe campai=
gn is being spearheaded by Michael George Gibson, who said it was 'disgrace=
ful' that the Poetry Society had failed to respond properly to his demands =
for a definition. 'For centuries word-things, called poems, have been made =
according to primary and defining craft principles of, first, measure and, =
second, alliteration and rhyme,' said Gibson. 'Word-things not made accordi=
ng to those principles are not poems.' True poems, he said, gave the reader=
 or listener a 'special pleasure'. =0AGibson praised the work of Chaucer, S=
hakespeare, John Donne, Robert Graves and even Queen Elizabeth I, all of wh=
om he thought followed the rules of poetry. But he was critical of current =
writers, including Andrew Motion, the Poet Laureate. Gibson said that 'The =
Golden Rule', written by Motion to mark the Queen's 80th birthday, should n=
ot be called a poem. 'It has measure and refrain, but there is not another =
formal principle that would raise its status to that of a poem,' said Gibso=
n. =0AHe was also critical of the winners of The Poetry Society's National =
Poetry Competition, arguing that none of them was a poem. =0AGibson singled=
 out the work of one of the competition's judges, Michael Schmidt, a contem=
porary poet and academic who had been awarded an OBE. Schmidt's piece 'Pang=
ur B=C3=A0n' was not poetry, said Gibson. 'It is in pairs of lines and I wi=
ll assume they are measured out in a formal way, but beyond that there is n=
o other formal principle. It falls short of being a poem.' =0AThe Poetry So=
ciety has responded to the criticisms. One trustee told Gibson: 'There is p=
oetry in everything we say or do, and if something is presented to me as a =
poem by its creator, or by an observer, I accept that something as a poem.'=
 =0ARuth Padel, a prize-winning poet who used to be chair of trustees at Th=
e Poetry Society, added: 'As for "what poetry is": in The Use of Poetry TS =

=0AMotion described the 'rigidities' of the Queen's English Society as ridi=
culous. Schmidt, professor of poetry at the University of Glasgow, argued t=

nt in the US that has been labelled 'new formalism'. Followers of the movem=
ent set up a magazine that included any poem as long as it 'rhymed and scan=
ned'. 'But the bankruptcy of that has been recognised,' said Schmidt.

Honesty being the best policy, those who aspire to lead us should
make clear at the outset that their lives have nothing whatsoever to
do with the lives of almost everyone they hope will vote for them. It
helps also if a tone of contempt intrudes--honesty requires that a
politician reveal his or her darker side as often as possible. By no
means should a politician try to invent a more inclusive persona.

Politics is a graduate seminar, and the politician is the professor.

The problem is, particularly in music read jazz, that the avant garde took
your advice and followed the money. Look at Ornette hiring James 'Blood'
Ulmer into his unit, a move that was intended only so that Ornette could
earn some dough. Look at what had happened to Sun Ra beginning in the late
70s and continuing on for the rest of his career. Do you think 'Nuclear Was'
was intended for anything other than to earn some cash. And the Art Ensemble
of Chicago became a disgrace in the 1980s. Sadly, no one followed in that
direction leaving what was once the avant garde with no representation.
We never had to worry about being avant garde in poetry as there was never
any money to follow.

opposition to a mainstream, and 'since there no longer is a mainstream', the
avant garde no longer makes any sense, like hot without cold.

i'd have two or more objections to the above arg. no mainstream? follow the
money. the mainstream is mainstream by virtue mainly of money to propagate
the stream in prominent media. to say there is no mainstream is to deny the
role of money in dominating mass media. who does that?

also, it seems wrong-headed to think of the avant garde as simply the
non-mainstream part of a mainstream/non-mainstream binary. i think of the
avant garde as being strong in areas such as innovation, experimentation
and, yes, doing things that are not going to be popular, but doing them
anyway. not simply as an alt-mainstream.

the arguments against the mere existence or relevance of the avant garde
often smack to me of a heavy influence of corporatism. the notion that the
internet, say, levels the playing field to the point where everything gets
equal attention in media is preposterous. the internet helps me in many
ways, including getting my work out there, but i certainly don't have a mass
audience and that is just not the goal, for me; instead, i want my work to
be available to those who are interested in such innovation. and it is.

This article made me laugh so much when I read it this morning.
Especially Gibson's grimly grandiose diagnosis: 'It falls short of being a
poem'.

Hi everyone

Chax Press is sending an intern to the &Now festival at Chapman
University, this week, April 14-17, to represent us at the book fair
that is a part of that festival. We're asking for some help for her,
as we have little cash flow at this time. She thought she was going
to be staying with friends, but it turns out that her people are just
too far away. So we're hoping someone in the vicinity might have a
sofa or place for a floor pallet or even, maybe, an extra bed, for
the nights of April 14 through April 16. I'm reminded of when I was a
grad student and went to the Charles Olson Festival in 1978 in Iowa
City and people opened their houses & apartments to me & to others
who had traveled there. Any possibility of such help?

The festival is at Chapman University, which is in Orange,
California, between Irvine and Anaheim, near Santa Ana. We're a
little desperate for help, and I hope this works out.

Please email me at chax@theriver.com a.s.a.p.

In theatre/performance studies Richard Schechner has argued that there is no
longer an avant garde, only an historical avant garde--those whose work was
once avant garde but who have themselves, become accepted and embraced more
as another wing perhaps, of popular or official culture--Laurie Anderson
being one of the more readily available examples.  But of course the term
avant garde from discipline to discipline is fraught with all kinds of
freight and history and various meanings.

It seems to me (and I believe this is part of Perloff's argument, but I
won't be offended if anyone corrects me or adds to what I'm articulating
here) that the work of literary and poetic avant gardes remains largely
unfinished, only a very germ or beginning.  After all, it seems to be that
most poetry is still very much about "communicating" something rather than
being purely about experimenting with language and image and taking the
reader into realms that are purely imaginative.  My
friends/collaborators/cohorts and I refer to the search for a kind of
abstract expressionism of language, for example. It a world screaming for
imagination and constantly being fed more of the same, it seems to me that
avant garde values are more relevant than ever.  It doesn't necessarily, I
think, have to be what Robert Hughes calls "the shock of the new." I think
the overemphasis on constant new-ness is another way in which we get stuck
and start declaring the avant garde dead.  I have been interested for a very
long time in incomplete avant gardes, incomplete revolutions, where a thread
of something important was articulated but not followed up on, fell by the
wayside.

Furthermore, when I look at the values of an avant garde like Dadaism, I
don't necessarily believe that Dada belongs purely within the framework of
modernism.  It seems to me that Dada contained in it, in a very early time,
much of the postmodern and in that way, through Dada and Futurism, that
modernism and postmodernism went off on simultaneous trajectories for a
time.  Dada rejected, for example, all of the nationalistic tendencies that
has been so associated with historical modernity and while having some
exoticizing and orientalist tendencies, nonetheless embraced plurality and
multivocal aesthetics.  For me, the problematic aspect of "post" is that it
implies that what came before "post" is somehow over--therefore the need to
be post-postmodern.  When the reality is that there is still a lot of
modernism that is alive and well alongside postmodernism and that pomo may
very well rely on a certain strain of ongoing modernism for its own
survival.  That we don't have a post-postmodernism might be, at least I
wonder if it is, a consequence of the fact that we haven't really left
modernism behind -- artistically, as well as politically and historically --
and don't have the vision yet of the next stage.  And completely free
associating here--maybe that takes me back around to the incomplete
revolutions of some of the avant gardes.  Maybe when we break through
language and break through the known, what is already in front of us, then
we'll get a glimpse of the next phase.  At least, that's what I'm counting
on in my explorations.


Re: internet -- In one of the classes I've taught, Drama and the Media, we
ask students what medium they find the most democratic and of course they
always say the internet.  But a website or web presence (blog, you tube etc
etc) is not unlike a coffee shop reading or open mic.  It is democratic on
the surface and perhaps open to all, but doesn't guarantee you a readership
or audience if you don't have the name recognition (branding, if you want to
go completely corporate in language) or the advertising funds to draw in the
big crowds.


Then again, it's almost midnight and I could just be rambling.  But
hopefully, a purposeful rambling that might spark some idea out there
somewhere.  That's the point of my avant garde.

Cheers.

Fluffy

The great architect, Robert Venturi, had the best idea concerning modernism. He simply plugged into the vernacular. Admittedly, this ain't so easy when it comes to poetry. But literate people are too quick to dismiss much that's going on in pop lit. Certain pop authors, Stephen King and Dean Koontz, to name 2, are as gifted as their more high brow peers.

I just got wind of Obama's recent comments. How to win friends and influence voters. Beautiful. Maybe he and Hillary can duck gun fire in rural Penn. I mean, gosh, it worked for Hillary in Bosnia. Sweet baby Jesus pray for us. What would Machiavelli think? We have a lousy economy, an unpopular war, and still, McCain could win this thing. What an inept buch. Up till now, Obama had it going on. Now he's another
branded elitist. Of course, the elite label is simple minded sound bite bullshit, but it's the sort of thing that wins elections. It's absolute lunacy to be fully honest during a campaign. I guess there's always Nadar. Too insignificant to throw another election, or is he??...

Really, Obama should pick John Kerry as a running mate. Rent a limousine while cruising Appalachia during the general election.

Honesty being the best policy, those who aspire to lead us should
make clear at the outset that their lives have nothing whatsoever to
do with the lives of almost everyone they hope will vote for them. It
helps also if a tone of contempt intrudes--honesty requires that a
politician reveal his or her darker side as often as possible. By no
means should a politician try to invent a more inclusive persona.

Politics is a graduate seminar, and the politician is the professor.

If anyone's planning on going to MSA in the fall, Tom Orange and I are =
proposing a panel that might be of interest.

Language Poetry and the Mediation of Modernism

In its critique and/or expansion of referentiality, its engagement with =
critical theory and skepticism toward metanarratives, Language Poetry is =
obviously and often self-consciously postmodern. At the same time, =
Barrett Watten has claimed that Language Poetry is =93a species of =
modernism in the largest sense,=94 and it is clear that much of that =
work evokes and continues other modernist tendencies, especially those =
present in the texts of Stein, Zukofsky, and Khlebnikov.=20

This panel seeks to investigate the ways in which Language Poetry has =
interpreted, critiqued or reworked various modernist projects. Send =
abstracts and a brief CV to Bill Freind at freind@rowan.edu and Tom =
Orange at tmorange@gmail.com by May 1.

and it is really galling to hear wealthy Republicans elitists denounce Obama
for making exactly the links they've been running on since 1968 -- but Obama
did walk right into it -- there is no such thing as "casual remarks" on the
campaign trail anymore --

hate to blow my post quota so early in the morning -- but ---

this doesn't add up for me at all -- at the time Ulmer was added to the Coleman
Prime Time band, he would have brought no commercial value at all -- and
Coleman had already been playing in such a configuration, and playing pretty
much that kind of music, for some time --

If "Nuclear War" was intended to earn more cash, it didn't seem to have
significantly altered the Arkestra's viability as a touring unit in any
measurable way -- And if you listen across the entire recorded history of Sun
Ra's career, you do not see the supposed change indicated here --

One might accuse the Art Ensemble of a commercial move with ODWALLA, except
that they had recorded that composition many years before it got tied to juices
-- and it wasn't musicians who chose not to follow the Ensemble's example (fFOR
example the two younger guys who have now joined the ensemble!) so much as it
was the record and concert businesses -- but that simply means that today's
"out" musicians have to do what the AACM did, and what the poetic avant gardes
of mid-twentieth century did, and create their own venues and web-based
distribution modes -- exactly what several 20-something musicians I've heard in
recent months have been doing --

Here's the deal: Obama has to make a few idiotic blunders in order to justify a decision to run the super team: Obama/Hillary. It's the only thing that makes sense. Why else would Clinton claim to have faced gun fire in Bosnia? The whole bloody mess is a set up. Which sort of sickens me as I do think the right is indeed correct about the Clintons. They're scum.

Honesty being the best policy, those who aspire to lead us should
make clear at the outset that their lives have nothing whatsoever to
do with the lives of almost everyone they hope will vote for them. It
helps also if a tone of contempt intrudes--honesty requires that a
politician reveal his or her darker side as often as possible. By no
means should a politician try to invent a more inclusive persona.

Politics is a graduate seminar, and the politician is the professor.

Steve Ben Israel was once well known as a member/performer
in The Living Theater. Still lives in New York City, still
the activist.



 we want service


            it was another hot day in the big apple
            so upon entering the post on canal street
            I took a giant gulp of that sweet cool air
            and paid homage to ever invented the air conditioner
            I was greeted by this long, long line
            there were two windows working and seven closed
            and there was this one guy at one of the windows
            like what seemed forever and he was getting
            a lot of heat from everybody else on the line
            ten minutes I was six out of about twenty five, and
            everybody on the line was doing their waiting
            in line yoga which you learn after a life time of waiting
            there were those folks who were rocking back and forth
            back and forth and some were taping their feet taping
            and some who were sighing looking up high
            and those whom were lucky enough to have some reading
            material and they were constantly looking at their watches
            and for a split second it looked like an
            avant- garde theater company doing their
            warming up exercises
            now the room was cool but it was getting hot
            and just as the frustration started to peak
            I gently and playfully started to chant
            we want service, we want service, we want service
            and realized that I was about to make
            a complete fool of myself, when all of a sudden
            this couple to my left joined in chanting
            we want service then these three ladies joined in
            we want service and after about ten seconds of this
            the entire post office began chanting we ant service
            and then all of a sudden these two new windows
            shot up in synch and these two new tellers
            almost like a doo wop group, said, next in line
            well everybody started to crack up and laughed
            and gave themselves a round of applause

                                steve ben israel

I wonder and I would think there would be someone writing
a history connecting the great theatrical and music
collectives that gave the Sixties and Early 70's
a public/environmentally pervasive shape and sound.
In addition to The Living Theater, I vividly recall
(music) Sun Ra, The Chicago Arts Ensemble, Human Arts
 Ensemble. and (theater) Bread & Puppet, La Mama, the Sharks
(Berkeley - righ name), the Mime Troupe.  Whenever any
of these groups were in San Francisco the definition of a "stage"
was everywhere. It was magical and wonderful.
Now that gas is disappearing, maybe the streets -
their animation - will come back. Locally for me, I know,
Dolores Park, is wall with folks and entertainments.
Heah, maybe with the 'housing  crisis' rents in Cities will
fall and life for poets will not an endless series of
day jobs with squeak leftover to write and consider a
a larger world.

and of course malina, beck and resnikoff's own writings.
great performance films  they just did a series of them last week at the
theatre  a new version of a rare film  Paradise Now has just been
released on DVD
a recent film about the troupe's visit to iran shows regularly on
cableand is available
many items can be gotten directly rhru the theatre which gravely needs
funds
malina gave up everything to open the new space and their rent is
extraordinary
sadly judith's long time companion after julian beck, hanon resnikoff
had a major stroke last week
but still on april 19th the theatre will proceed with their yearly sedar
starting around 6 or so open to all
as is their yearly new years party
i've occasionally curating music events there
am reading there tomorrow as a matter of fact

there will be a great interview i and my pal jim feast conducted with
judith
in a forth coming book about jews and the lower east side
aside from tuli kupferberg (a dear friend and now semi - recluse )
judith is one of the oldest longest living anarchists i know of
never wavered from her course -

INTERPRETATIONS


THURSDAY APRIL 24, 2008 at 8PM
ROULETTE  20 Greene Street (between Canal and Grand)
$15 general admission $10 students, seniors, Harvestworks, DTW,
Roulette & Location One members free.
Reservations: 212-219-8242 / Information: 212-627-0990.
All concerts begin at 8pm
http://www.interpretations.info                 www.roulette.org
Interpretations presents Christian Wolff with an exceptional group of
experimental musicians, including members of Frog Peak Music (Larry
Polansky) and the Wandelweiser Ensemble (Jürg Frey, Craig Shepard).
Re-examining the fundamental aspects of melody and counterpoint in music,
the program includes a complete performance of Wolff's recent opus Micro
Exercises, and the New York premiere performance of les tréfonds
inexplorés des signes by Swiss composer and clarinetist Jürg Frey.


"In the 1950's, there was a group of composers who set the classical
world on edge. Like many trail-blazers before them, they were scorned and
only in later decades appreciated for their work. Though the group was
made up of distinct members, the need to group them as some kind of
'movement' led to them being called the New York School. Some of the
names you probably know - John Cage and Morton Feldman were among this
group. So was a younger man who had his own distinct ideas about
composition. Christian Wolff briefly studied under Cage but soon took up
his own charge to create intricate systems for his piecesŠ Indeed, he's
made some very bold statements about his ideas concerning music and
composition." - Jason Gross, Perfect Sound Forever


Featuring: Christian Wolff, Fender Rhodes electric piano, melodica; Jürg
Frey, clarinet; Larry Polansky, electric guitar; Craig Shepard, trombone;
Jeremy Lamb, cello; Marco Cappelli, guitar.
Curated by Dan Joseph

I feel, too, that this whole thing is based on the idea that "bitter" is a
judgment, rather than an observation. I cannot possibly say, even from my 10
years as a "rural person," that everyone is bitter, or fed up, or tired, or
looking for anything that gives them solace (guns, religion, drugs, rock n'
roll, QVC, etc). What I can say is that this is true a large amt. of people,
both in the rural areas and sub/urban areas as well. Obama's mistake wasn't
that he said this, it's that he singled out the countryside as being
different (even if it is). This is what got the goats of the faux populist
republicans....and the Clintons.

i agree aldon most moves to commerciality by avante gardist rarely amount
to a fortume
ornette has made more bread than most
but when he hired blood blood was almost entirely unknown a lp with john
patton maybe something
ornette put blood on the map
and blood's lp tales of capt black got blood's career on the move
and that early harmolodic stuff was so advanced and less commercial than
later stuff
ra art emsmle etc where ever they  ,moved
like roscoe into classical world  helped them but their commercial
success
ala even tim berne who played great last night never really happened
even when for brief seconds some were signed to major labels like
columbia
vision fes thas not crewsted a new venue yet but has emerged as major
independent fest for this music and survived
now 13 years   at tomorrows town hall meeting agai we will discuss among
other things
why this music doesn'rt reach a wider audience ala marsalis (uch)
the tradionalists always win out
and some avanters manage to become/reach the mainstream
we can name many tho even most of them never hit super commercial success
ayer tried it before he was killed
ornette played town hall last week
the tickets were too expensive
yert one way or the other he didn't sell out the theatee at 79
ok time to go to the post office been on this damned machine all day

Thanks, Steve,  for all that great docu/info on The Living Theater.

 Steve ben Israel is the cousin of a good friend of mine, Dan Leegant who forwarded me the poem. Dan's late mom was Edith in Kaddish - worked at Gimbels, and took care of AG when he was teen while his mom was all cracked up. I first met Dan in the Peace Corps at the Unviersity of Nigeria, Nssuka, Nigeria. We were room-mates. One of our 'jobs' was coaching the women's basketball team, on a clay court, no less. But that's another story.

 I love the  poem and the event around/within it!

Fluffy,

Thanks for that, I'll try and catch up with Marjorie Perloff (maybe she's a
closet modernist, trying to justify her ontological position, we shall see).
Personally I'm really into modernist architecture, but maybe that's just
like being a vintage car enthusiast, or a Beach Boys fan.  I look forward to
hearing more.

Obama's advantage (aside from central casting good looks) is that he
has almost no record and has had to make few compromises. But that's
not really good enough. Next time the pure-of-heart should have no
record whatsoever and suffer from vocal paralysis whenevr he's asked
to speak ex-temp.

Try to remember that politics is often a dirty business and involves
getting dirty hands. And that if Hillary somehow pulls it off you're
going to have to figure out how to vote for her, the alternative
being unthinkable. If you have a hard time noticing large
differences, when tempted by McCain remember these two words: Supreme Court.

Read the statement. He said that small town folks "cling to religion
and guns" out of bitterness. I happen to think that belief in an
afterlife is a product of desperation, and Obama apparently agrees,
at least when it comes to poor white folks. But I'd be pretty careful
where I said that, if only out of politeness. As a politician, I'd
have to be an idiot to say it. Same goes for guns. most gun violence
happens in big cities. I think guns should be much more strictly
regulated, even that hunting rifles should be locked up at the police
station and only reclaimed when a hunting trip's planned, because the
cities need that kind of rule. But it's not hard to understand why
rural folks would object.

Hi folks;
im super excited to announce the release of my latest book, CHAINS, a =
suite of lettraset visual poems.=20

Printed in an edition of 200 copies by Paper Kite Press, CHAINS (96 =
pgs., $15) is available directly from the press at:
http://www.wordpainting.com/shop.shtml

*
With chains, derek beaulieu once again turns his attention to how =
"language regards itself, stalks itself, begins, slowly, to eat itself" =
(Canadian Literature) in a series of graceful abstractions made entirely =
from antiquated dry-transfer lettering. In chains, letters gather in =
elegant arrangements, architectural constructions and sinews of meaning. =

*
derek beaulieu is the author of 4 books, (with wax, 2003; frogments from =
the frag pool, with Gary Barwin, 2005; fractal economies, 2006, and =
Flatland, 2007).  In 2005 he co-edited Shift & Switch: new Canadian =
poetry. Continuously pushing the boundaries and restrictions of the =
"regular life" of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet, beaulieu's =
work underscores the playfulness of language and challenges the way =
readers have come to expect letters to behave. Using techniques that =
combine graphic design, fine art and experimental writing, beaulieu =
opens up new ways of approaching and interpreting poetry. Author, =
editor, publisher, translator, illustrator and sessional instructor at =
the University of Calgary, derek beaulieu has been published and =
exhibited internationally.

In context though, i think it's pretty clear that he was talking
about the stuff that small town folks vote based on, and that they've
been manipulated by the republican party appealing to anti-gun
control and pro christian sentiments in order to get their votes in
the absence of real improvements to the way those folks live.

Thanks Mark. I've read it. But for those who haven't, here's the statement.

To wit:

*"You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and, like a lot of small
towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's
replaced them.And they fell through the Clinton Administration, and the Bush
Administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow
these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not." *

*"And it's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or
religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant
sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations." *
So, frustration is explained by way of clinging to guns or religion or
antipathy, etc. I agree. This is not a false statement. It is, therefore,
not what should be said during an election year. Cynically, and sadly, it
seems there's not much room for truth in politics.

Yes, do read the statement -- as poorly worried as it was, Obama was clearly
not saying that people adopt faith because of their bitterness over the economy
or, as more than one talking head as put it today, that they have guns and go
hunting because of that bitterness -- he was saying fairly plainly, though not
in a politic way, that this presumed bitterness leads to their clinging to
these issues as election motivations -- and, as I remarked yesterday, that's
pretty much been the Republican campaign strategy reaching back to Nixon's
Southern strategy --

Let me be real clear. Obama as a candidate lives by the word. His
ability to read an eloquent prepared speech and to participate in the
writing of it is a major reason he's been so successful. When he
screws up it has consequences, because he seems to be so careful with words.

Here's what he said: "You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania
and, like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been
gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And it's not
surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or
antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment
or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations." How
is it possible to read this as other than a discounting, not of
"their" suffering, but of their opinions and beliefs? How is this not
a cartoon? It's that presumed attitude that's been criticized, and it
appears apparently as of a piece with a frequent dismissiveness, as
if he finds the entire process of getting elected simply too silly for words.

But suppose it's just a slip, or he's really not that good on his
feet, etc. How many of these things do you think he could get away
with in the general election?

It should be obvious that I suspect, or maybe more accurately fear,
that Obama's an empty suit. The frequent invocation of Kennedy, who
was an empty suit for the most part, isn't reassuring.

I'd love to be proven wrong.

Hey, maybe he'll even honor his pledge to limit himself to public
financing. That could establish a standard that would really change
American politics.

If he's elected, and he probably will be, he's going to be up against
so many intractable, urgent problems that even an FDR would probably fail.

But Obama's very smart, and he'll probably learn.

Anyway, my opinion doesn't matter. I already got to vote.

Mark

THE ONLY WAR
THAT MATTERS
IS THE WAR
AGAINST THE
IMAGINATION

This is from a full page advertisement for Naropa's Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics in the latest issue of the Poetry Project Newsletter.
Page 7 to be exact, April-June, 2008 issue.

Let me say first that I have a tremendous amount of respect for that school,
considering I have little to NO respect for most schools these days.  But I
really don't know what to do with this statement, which is displayed in such
a way that it's meant to be of significance, meaning that, reading from left
to right, as we do here, it's catches the eye FIRST when seeing the page.
It's made to look like a sign you would carry at a protest, or a banner you
would hang on a wall.

I of course understand the basic premise, it's just not sitting well with
me, being a tax payer like I am, paying for bullets like I am for a war that
VERY MUCH DOES MATTER in Iraq (especially if you're Iraqi!)!

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, or out of it, or around it?  But then
there's THIS statement as well, right below the first one, also made to look
like a sign or banner:

Poetry is
The Rival
Government

"is" is underlined 3 times.  It reminds me a little of:

Poetry IS
Independent
Media

The bottom one a quote from my friend Frank Sherlock, which I open my book
Deviant Propulsion with.

But, I can GET BEHIND Poetry IS Independent Media, but The Rival Government?
Poetry as Government?

Once again, I get it, meaning I GET what they're getting at, meaning that
Poetry is a power that we should get behind rather than this nightmarish
machine we have ruling us, but, the word Government?  Really?

Both of these statements feel OK at first glance, and at the first glance
you get the tone being conveyed, I'm just not jiving with the language at
all.  I'm not agreeing with either one.

To me, IF poetry is the Rival Government, then it needs to get us out of the
war in Iraq before it can start claiming that "the only war that matters is
the war against the imagination," frankly!

I don't read this as a dismissal at all. I read this as a failed appeal
based on the idea that, "hey, I'm like you." Bush gets away with this all
the time. This is the design behind "my fellow Americans." The fact that
Obama didn't (or doesn't) says to me that his eloquence and ability to speak
make him "elistist" and "snobby."

Because we can't have a president who speak good. No way.

Bring on those C students.

And this is why I posted the article from CBN, because the writer latches on
to "clings to," which seems the most unfortunate choice of a word if there
ever were one. But this whole "scandal" is slow-news-week-itis. It's "wag
the dog." It shows just how susceptible a lot of people are to the media,
which is like a hangover: ignore it and it's still there.

Jason, I agree completely. But if you deconstruct this a bit, it's a
little confusing as to whether he actually wants their votes :)

NEXT week!  NEXT Wednesday, 8pm
St. Mark's Poetry Project in NYC

Larry Kearney's poems make me happy, and getting to read with him is
exciting!  This is an old buddy of Spicer's and Brautigan's and Broughton's
and Kaufman's, and ALL THESE poets helped change poetry forever!  If you
haven't yet read his book STREAMING, it's a must!  Thom Donovan turned me
onto that book, and it's really TERRIFIC!

David Meltzer says "Kearney is one of those unsung cats who has been
producing intelligent thoughtful snarly deeply musical poetry, deeply felt
wryly wrought astute poetry of the first rank for decades for a select
few=97you're in for a rare treat."

Sorry to bother folks here, I'm from Kingston PA which is pretty rural. I
had a friend from Jermyn, ruraler, five kids in her brother's senior class
killed themselves their senior year - at least one for being gay, and he
blew himself away with his father's gun on the 50-yard-line. This was just
a few years ago. Bitter doesn't cover it. Hazelton which has been trying
to pin down Latino immigrants is just down the road from us. When I was in
school there Obama would have been run out of town. Today the area's
pretty defeated in spite of local colleges. It was a hell of a place to
grow up. - Alan

To me, it says that if politicians and those who support their policies of
aggression had more imagination there wouldn't be wars.
As in John Lennon's famous song. But, like Obama's misspeak, it means well,
but is not well said, because it states that war is okay, as long as it's my
war. My war is "the only war that matters."

Maybe something like: WHERE IMAGINATION REIGNS, WAR DOESN'T, is more to what
they are trying to say? Although Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, and the
others, imagined that peace would follow their "shock and awe." However,
maybe this isn't imagination, but the arrogance of self-deception.

Dear CAConrad,
=20
Interesting. =20
=20
I went to a reading at Naropa a few weeks back.  We arrived a little early,=
 opened the closed door, and were somewhat assaulted by the reading room cu=
rator.  My initial response had something to do with the meanest Buddhist I=
 ever met. =20
=20
Of course this likely has more to do with me than with Naropa.  But it's af=
fluent in Boulder, where there's a term, "Granola Nazi" (also used in Berke=
ley).  I moved last year from Buffalo to Fort Collins, where food productio=
n and the environment drive activism, and affluence breeds a love of good l=
aw and order.  There's a peculiar sensation to being so utterly landlocked,=
 physically removed from what lies over the sea, 60 miles from the evangeli=
cal capitol of the world.  =20

Subject:      YOUTUBE "Bond Girl" Comes Out for 9/11 "WEEK OF TRUTH" CAMPAIGN
              =?ISO-8859-1?Q?=96_?= April 16 to 22

YOUTUBE "Bond Girl" Comes Out for 9/11 "WEEK OF TRUTH" CAMPAIGN –
April 16 to 22nd

Lana Wood, actress/activist, recently not only came public on 9/11
truth, but helped produce a very creative youtube video that can
reach many. Spread it widely, let's get it up on the youtube
rankings. And engage more in the Week of Truth (Starts THIS WED.)
www.WeekofTruth.org

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zafkleeNvvU

It's a great video because it starts off in a very "youtube-ey
quirky" play on her roll as Plenty O'Toole in "Diamonds are
Forever," but THEN very quickly delves into the seriousness of the
9/11 issue, and Lana's impassioned plea for all of us to get
educated on 9/11, and do all we can to launch the first Week of
Truth campaign occurring April 16 to 22nd.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zafkleeNvvU

In the above video she extols everyone to get involved in the "Week
of Truth" April 16 to 22nd, www.WeekofTruth.org and to spread the
word wide, far, and fast.


Other news. About 12,000 media were contacted about the week of
truth effort and about Jesse Ventura's recent question of "How can
two planes, bring down THREE buildings?"

You'll be happy to learn that Professor Steven Jones made an
announcement at the San Diego 9/11 Truth Event about the
coming "Week of Truth" and informed them how to get involved.

Week of Truth made headline news at the major progressive news blog
OpEdNews, in an article about the UN Official calling for a study
into neocon involvement in 9/11. Headlines there get A LOT of
traffic, and its not just 9/11 choir traffic. See/Comment at:
http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_bill_dou_080412_ny_sun_report
s_on_u_.htm
[comments and views can help keep it [and its Week of Truth info, a
headline longer]

SO, A COUPLE OF REMINDERS/ACTION ITEMS YOU CAN HELP TO SPREAD THE
WORD WITH:

Steve's doing as much media as he can get, and has put several
thousand dollars on the line to promote the book in various ways.


• PLEASE EMAIL ALL YOUR CONTACT & SUBSCRIBER LISTS, on this
Wednesday, April 16th, to urge them to buy in before April 22nd, and
to spread the word on the Week of Truth. Tell them about Lana's
great youtube video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zafkleeNvvU
• IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BANNER FOR "WEEK OF TRUTH" ON YOUR
WEBSITE, you can get one at www.WeekofTruth.org. Many major well
trafficked sites that number in the hundreds of thousands of weekly
visitors collectively now have it up on the top of their HOMEPAGE.
• Please continue networking with all you can, and let your
contacts and theirs know that they can call-in to mainstream media
and recommend "The Shell Game" during the Week of Truth National Buy-
In. You can email out the below suggestion sheet w/ the call in
shows:

USING THE RADIO AIR WAVES FOR 9/11 TRUTH
While gaining air time on major radio talk shows is difficult, if we
as a movement target certain shows we can bring our message to
millions of listeners for FREE!
KEYS TO CALLING IN:
A. Know who you are calling.
Most talk shows are conservative. Do NOT attempt to convert the
host, simply state your message with enthusiasm:
WRITE DOWN AND READ THE MESSAGE:
Sell THE SHELL GAME as a must-read novel that convinced YOU, that
there will be another 911 event soon!
"Hey, Rush, long time listener. There's a book you absolutely must
read, it's called The SHELL GAME by Steve Alten, a NY Times best
selling author. Rush, I read this book in two sittings. It's about
the end of oil and the next 911 event that will launch the war in
Iran, and it scared the hell out of me. It made me realize that the
911 commission kept things out of the investigation, and frankly…I'm
mad."
Do NOT get into details on a conservative talk show. Just tell his
listeners to buy the book!

The Animal Within

                                                   Homage to Sir =20
Thomas Browne


We, who supposedly contain all Africa and her prodigies,
are revealed for what we are only in the dying
when this flesh, once apostrophized as too too solid,
has proven renderable as any carcass and in the process
manufactured hollows where hillocks of cheeks once smiled,
then weeded out the overgrowth of hair to uncover
a tenderness-evoking curve of skull,
                        a property we had thought
                        only of the newly born.

The mirror reflects no longer a unique face but the template
of the race: uncles, aunts, cousins far removed, some ancestor
who left no trace in family history yet surfaces now like
a species long thought extinct hauled up from the ocean=92s depths
and when that dissolves what is left
                        but the animal within
                        which we made so much of.

APRIL 4, 2008
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
    Cleveland poetry publishing house vanZeno Press (www.vanzenopress.com) has released The Black Book, featuring the lyrics of Cleveland songwriter Cletus Black.   vanZeno has published the work of poets such as Roger Craik, Claire McMahon, J.E. Stanley and Mary Turzillo, but The Black Book is the first in the Lyric Series, which places the focus on the poetry of words put to music.
 
     The book gathers all Cletus’ original lyrics from the seven CD’s  released since 1996.  They are organized alphabetically by song title, as well as by first line. As a lyricist, Black stands out as he eschews the confessional and self-centered style favored by so many of his contemporaries, and instead creates songs that read like short stories.  Character and mood are pre-eminent as Black creates vignettes that seem to have more in common with film noir.  “Jesus just told me to move to Virginia Beach…”. “You’re a hellhound sniffing on a cold dark trail…”   “Working Homicide down in FLA...”  Whether in a lyrical or narrative style, Black is a master at the compact diss and sparely stated scenario.
 
     Cletus Black will hold a book signing for The Black Book on Sunday, May 4th at the John Christ Winery from 2:00 to 5:00p.m. John Christ Winery is located at 32421 Walker Rd. in Avon Lake, Oh.   The author will perform pieces from the book, as well as songs from his soon to be released CD “That’s The Story .”

I link that slogan with Wilde's observation in De Profundis that "the only
crime is lack of imagination". Which I reckon is more or less right, because
lack of imagination is what makes certain things possible, such as the
contemporary bureaucratic evil that promulgates a war.

I suppose you could argue about what _kind_ of imagination.

All best

Alison

Roy,

Have you read "Learning From Las Vegas?" Robert Venturi's great inconoclastic Classic. Amazing book. I became less dogmatic in my entire approach to, well, pretty much everything after reading it. As for the avant-garde, it seems to me that we're living post history. In which case, I'll stick to Led Zep, Frank Zapp, and direct my longing gaze towards that vintage Jaguar I spotted in my neighborhood the other day.

Fluffy,

Thanks for that, I'll try and catch up with Marjorie Perloff (maybe she's a
closet modernist, trying to justify her ontological position, we shall see).
Personally I'm really into modernist architecture, but maybe that's just
like being a vintage car enthusiast, or a Beach Boys fan.  I look forward to
hearing more.

Tom Clark needs your help. He is stranded with no salary and no
medical insurance to cover costs due to a recent stroke. He also
needs funds for medications to aid in the recovery of his wife,
Angelica Clark, from recent surgery and other related health problems.

After 25 years on the faculty of the New College of California's
Poetics Program, payment on his salary and his insurance was abruptly
stopped when the school came under scrutiny of federal and state
auditors last fall.

Tom Clark has been an important voice in postwar American poetry
since the 1960s. For a decade he was poetry editor for The Paris
Review. His many books appeared with Black Sparrow for nearly thirty
years, and his biographies of Jack Kerouac, Charles Olson, and Edward
Dorn have provided essential perspectives on the lives of these New
American authors.

Clark is a passionate and devoted teacher who deserves far greater
recognition for his services to American poetry communities.

He needs help now.

There will be a Tom Clark benefit reading in Austin, Texas, on
Saturday, April 26, at 7 pm.

I am collecting donations as well from those of you outside of Austin
who are willing to contribute. Please send what you can immediately
to:

I really do think we're post history. Consider: The Stones are still touring. Soon, their clones will take center stage. And not long after that, the Stones will perform to a stadium of cheering, rowdy clones.
Hell's Angels clones will police the crowd on their choppers. Since modernism went post, and while pluralism runs rampant, why not give our artificial kin some play?

Fluffy,

Thanks for that, I'll try and catch up with Marjorie Perloff (maybe she's a
closet modernist, trying to justify her ontological position, we shall see).
Personally I'm really into modernist architecture, but maybe that's just
like being a vintage car enthusiast, or a Beach Boys fan.  I look forward to
hearing more.

As for the first of these statements, what they seem to want to say is that
the war against the imagination causes the other, physical wars.  BUT that
is not what they say, and I think you're right to point that out.

As for the second, if poetry's the govt, who's the president of poetry?
Who's the mayor? Who's on the city council of poetry?

Steve,

Thanks for the memory (as that old song goes) and thanks for the pun
'Jaguar... spotted', as for the sounds, I'm more of a Beefheart / Grateful
Dead man myself (despite risking the 'Dead-head' label).  I'll try and get
hold of Venturi's book - he was a renowned postmodernist of course, like
Michael Graves, Denise Scott Brown, Hans Hollein, et al - so could be the
sort of iconoclasm that I enjoy. Mark C. Taylor's 'Altarity' is a good read
also, and I would recommend that to anyone alongside Anthony Vidler's
writings.

Roy.

CA,

in a blog entry Jan 21, 2008, I was thinking about war and the imagination (and the texts from which emerge "the only war that matters is the war against imagination":

I've been thinking about the imagination lately. Apparently, the C.I.A./M.I. guys told the yokel M.P.s at Abu Ghraib to "use your imagination." That terrifies me, to think that the imagination can be harnessed as a force for absolute evil. In this poem, "Rant," DiPrima evokes William Blake's notion that all war is a failure of the imagination. Is imagination a "daimon," a power without necessarily being good or bad? Or is the imagination always a creative force, the opposite of war's decreations?...

In essence, C.A., it seems to me that there is a kind of productive reductivism to DiPrima's (and Blake's) quote here--which is to say, that wars come out of imagination's failure.  Yet I wanted also to suggest here that human imagination is not free from its own violences...

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Perhaps it's true that we live in a time when rudeness rules, but this
book, which the author loudly proclaims to be a modern Dunciad, lacks
the three necessary ingredients that make satire effective: wit,
insight, and craft.  The problem begins with the form that Johnson
chooses for his sallies: the epigram.  Johnson is clearly beyond his
depth here and the limits of his command of the English language,
including vocabulary and the rudiments of grammar are immediately
apparent.  To write a successful epigram is to craft a verbal artifact
that exhibits crisp intelligence in the handling of language, and
carries a "sting."  Rhyme, and in particular the rhyming couplet is
the poet's form of choice for this.  Satirical, free-verse, epigrams
are difficult to pull off for the best of writers, and we're clearly
not in that territory here.  Johnson's "epigrams" are wordy,
amorphous in form (a definite no-no!) groping in diction and sometimes
even lose their way before they end, leaving us to wonder what exactly
was the point besides an obvious attempt to bait, belittle, or strike a
posture.  Yes, he waxes warm and cozy when he addresses some of his
subjects--primarily experimental poets that figured prominently on the
Buffalo Poetics List c. 1999--2000, but for others he withholds the
puffs and brings out his brickbats of choice.  Distressingly, many of
his subjects for "satire" are women and minorities, and with them
Johnson "transcends" the limits of his craft in two ways: a liberal
use of scatological language, and direct unadulterated rudeness--and
even, in one case a threat of physical violence.  He attacks many
well-respected writers in this manner.  However, showing far more
cleverness in the pagination of this tome than in the writing of it,
Johnson buries such specimens of pathology in the last quarter of the
total pages.  What puzzles me is that this book does appear to have its
fans, but then again so does pit bull and cock fighting.

I also believe that anyone who tries to turn a buck selling stuff that
hurts feelings in the baldest and stupidest manner and makes no
apologies for it is just as deserving of contempt as the writer.

and it's important to read not just the two sentences being circulated here
and elsewhere, but the WHOLE statement, which can be found in a few places:

<http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/4/15/84747/8734/305/495985>
<http://blogs.courant.com/colin_mcenroe_to_wit/>
<
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mayhill-fowler/obama-no-surprise-that-ha_b_96188.html
>

in context, it's clear that obama is speaking to a crowd of supporters and
offering them ways to think and talk against the prevailing narrative of
class politics as it has been successfully constructed in this country for
decades, one that shifts the focus elsewhere. his point is that 30 years of
neolib social policy has given the working class little in government to
feel enthusiastic about. furthermore, the washington political consensus has
been to ignore class issues, or rather divert attention away from them by
promoting wedge issues like gun control, immigration, abortion, family
values and the like in their place.

that's obama's argument, as the FULL context makes clear: a challenge to
wedge issue politics in which the working class has no economic issues or
policies to vote on.

Dear CA and Philip--

During Mai '68 in Paris a famous slogan graffitied on the walls was
"l'imagination au pouvoir."

("Imagination in power"--that is, imagination as the driving--and guiding--
force of society.)

A different idea of the imagination was involved than that of Naropa's to be
sure

One might say that a play on the "power of imagination" is the "imagination
of power."

When Heinrich von Kleist presented an MS for Goethe to read, the great
Goethe threw the young writer's work into the fire, condemning it.

That is one form of poetic imagination judging another and destroying it for
the purposes of the "good."

(Not in terms of the aesthetic "good,"  but as a "dangerous" work in terms
of the imagination.)

Perhaps the Naropa ad has somewhere in the background the saying of Shelley
that "poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world."

Of course the imagination can be used for evil, just as it can for good.  As
Foucault writes of Power at the end of the first section of Discipline and
Punish--for al the terrible things that power constructs in its ruthless
drive to control, it also creates, and in this way I think is productive of
the very things which can, with imagination be used against control.
(Burroughs' concept of writing is to undo the Control of language, a word
virus brought from elsewhere.)

The imagination confounds efforts to separate needs from desires.  The
imagination creates a myriad plays on the cop and the criminal, including
the criminal cop.  That is to say, for every imagination of a way to control
persons, there will always be ways of imagining how to subvert that control.

Is it any surprise then that a great many writers have not also been
criminals?  Or that a criminal (Vidocq) also created the modern police
force? (The French Surete.) Vidocq is the originator of the phrase, "it
takes a thief to catch a thief," and  the inspiration for the character of
the arch criminal Vautrin in Balzac's work.  And also himself wrote novels
of "detection".  As did Pinkerton in the USA, who created the privatized
version of a detective-police force later used to put down labor strikes.
Dashiell Hammett began his career working for Pinkerton, including during
the vicious putting down of a labor strike, the source of much of his first
novel, Red Harvest.

The imagination on display at Abu Ghraib was "paltry" and "tawdry" compared
to that of such other prisons as Guantanamo or Gaza, let alone the myriad
secret ones throughout the world of which many will never be known to
anyone, nor what happened in them and to whom.

War is not a failure of the imagination.  The failure of the imagination in
that sense would be peace. There is not enough imagining of Peace.  And to
make sure of that, the messengers of peace are often assassinated, tortured,
imprisoned, silenced.

There is far more profit in war--hence the fulfillment of Orwell's endless
war in 1984 in the "War on Terror"--a War without End--as Sen. McCain says,
--a hundred years--or more--in Iraq--may not be long enough.  For God's
sake, after all, it's a regular cash cow for Haliburton and Blackwater and
others, so why stop milking it?!

In the Elizabethan playwrights/poets one finds  "dramatically" presented the
struggle among conflicting forces of imagination-especially in the works of
Marlowe, an atheist.  In the struggle involving the imagination is the
confrontation with evil--as in Shakespeare's Richard the Third, in
Lautreamont's Maldoror, Baudelaire's Flowers of Evil, Moby Dick, Bolano's
Distant Star and thousands of other works through (human) time and across
(global) space.

The ancient myths, epics, poetries are filled with the confrontations with
monsters, in which the imagination of good confronts in a violent conflict
the imagination of evil.

The "Age of Reason" produced among other things the Terror, the State
Terrorism of the French Revolution."  "Purity and Terror" are the Twin
Towers of the Revolutionary State for Robespierre.  The birth of the Secret
Police, the machinations of Homeland Security.  This form of Terror gave
birth less than a century later to Terrorism in Russia against the Czar, and
the Bloody Week of the French Commune, in which in one week more people were
killed than in the whole time of the Terror. And the people killed were
branded as monsters who ignited fires and toppled such sacred things as the
Vendome Column. The frightening figures of the "petroleuse" and the enraged
"scum" (among them the painter Courbet as a Minister of Arts, Education, and
Verlaine in a minor role).  In Marx's work on the Commune one finds the
first defense of the "terrorist" faced with State Terror, in which the
Communards are victims not only of mass murder, but of a media portrayal
which still exists today and has been seen as so effective as to be used to
blanket all manner of uprisings ever since.

These are the Monsters of the Dream of Reason that Goya is painting during
Blake's time. "The Disasters of War" (which ends with "Peace and
Toil")--culminating in the unfinished Proverbs and other works in
between---show in a new way the imagination of the artist confronting the
imagination of evil as an aspect of Reason itself, a prophecy of the last
two hundred years, up to today's "Democracy and Freedom" confronting "Evil"
by using the imaginative  forces of Technological Reason to out bomb, out
torture, out Shock and Awe what it sees as the forces of Unreason, the
Irrational, Evil and "Terrorism," the child of State Terror.

The power of the imagination one might say is to be able to examine things
as they are and to conceive of an alternative.

What the alternative is, whom it benefits and/or enlightens--these things
are the choices and/or conformities of persons, as well as the things that
some persons impose on others.

(In a George Jones song, the singer observes "little children drawing
pictures" and wonders "which one of them might become a killer's hand?")

The Hope that exists in imagination is that in it is the drive to rebel
against the strictures placed upon it, whether for "good," or for "evil."
It can be Prometheus, it can be Satan.

So Goethe, in his role as an unacknowledged legislator, tossed Kleist's MS
into the fire.

Yet not even such a great legislator as Goethe could prevent the imagination
of von Kleist, a writer who went on writing until he chose his own end for
himself  and his writing in a double suicide with a woman he hardly knew.

(And in that way surpassed as it were, the Sorrows of Young Werther?)

Without the power of imagination harnessing the power of electricity, would
any one be writing here along with others?  And without the power of
imagination, would it be possible not also be having any such exchange at
any given time by almost anyone being under surveillance?

The Naropa Institute, like any good Institute, is simply offering their own
legislated brand of the imagination.  In this they aren't any different from
any other Institute offering instruction in the uses of the imagination.

There are Institutes with sections for Poetics and Creative Writing, just as
there are Institutes such as the now renamed School of the Americas--its new
name is the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation--in which
instruction was and is is given in the arts of torture, counter-insurgency,
and the like to generations of Central and South American "allies."  Many
such Institutes exist quite profitably throughout the "Free World" as well
as those "training camps" for insurgents scattered about the globe.

And that's why reading the Naropa Institute's ad immediately to one's own
imagination come the lines from the song "Hey, Joe"--"ain't no hangmen gonna
put a noose around me."  It is not that it is Naropa's specifically, but the
sense that one has as with any such "campaign" that the imagination is
encouraged--as long as it stays within certain bounds, which are "good for
one."

(One wonders what bounds the imagination is to be kept within at the Western
Institute for Security Cooperation ?)

For better or worse, some part of the imagination in someone somewhere is
going to say--"I refuse.  There's got to be more to this . . . "  and start
asking questions . . . (For--perhaps there is more than one is being allowed
to know--)

Like Smokey Robinson and the Miracles--"It's just my imagination/runnin away
with me . . . "

I believe this line comes from an old Diane Di Prima poem (isn't she on this
list somewhere?), and the next line says that "all other wars are subsumed
in it."  It's a pretty bold claim, but it is true that the people who
appointed Dana Gioia to head the NEA are the same people who orchestrated
the invasion of Iraq.

As for the first of these statements, what they seem to want to say is that
the war against the imagination causes the other, physical wars.  BUT that
is not what they say, and I think you're right to point that out.

As for the second, if poetry's the govt, who's the president of poetry?
Who's the mayor? Who's on the city council of poetry?

Although I'm not from Pennsylvania or any small town, my intuition tells me Obama was right when he spoke about "some" (my word and quotation marks, not his) of the people who live in these places.  Their lives may be hard but where is life not hard?  As for Ralph Nader, he's just a distraction and a spoiler, regardless of how many good things he has said and done over the years in now what must be the fairly distant past.  And the possibility that he might contribute to a win for McCain this time around is monstrous.

CA Conrad <caconrad13@GMAIL.COM> wrote:  Having grown up in rural Pennsylvania I can promise you that Obama's
assessments are correct about many of these people being bitter and clinging

torture they put me through for being queer, for not wanting to kill deer,
pheasants, rabbits, and instead planting and tending flowers, vines, and
other boys.

What's MOST IMPRESSIVE is Obama's ability to take his statements and STAND
BEHIND THEM saying, "YES, OF COURSE THEY ARE BITTER," and listing why they
Should be.

He's right of course. What's terrible though is that the harsh world of
rural Pennsylvania (harsh as in trying to actually survive when the
factories and industry disappear DUE in large part to the Clintons!), like
most places where life is very hard, scapegoating is the major pastime.
It's bottomless, the racism, homophobia, sexism, and I can't see HOW anyone
will ever be able to break through it. These things make me very sad,
mostly because there are many people where I grew up who I got to know as
intelligent and talented, until they found out I was queer, which of course
put an end to communications with me.

But many of the people where I come from will NEVER vote for a white woman
for president anymore than they will vote for a black man for president.
And if ANY candidate ever dares say ANYTHING positive about homosexuals,
well, THAT'S IT, THEY'RE OUT! Abortion is also a hot button, of course.
Oy, I'm exhausted thinking about the wicked things I know they're saying in
the bars and beauty parlors, at the mills and diners.

But Obama is correct in every way. And he's amazing that he remains so
focused and on topic, even if the topic is about something he himself said
that might hurt his campaign. He has integrity I thought IMPOSSIBLE for
Democrats! He has my support! (Part of me is SO AFRAID he's another Bill
Clinton though! I heard Clinton's one speech at a gay rights rally in DC
when he was first running for president, and I BOUGHT IT, bought every lying
word of it!)

But if Obama doesn't win the nomination I'm voting for Ralph Nader again.
Nader was just in Philadelphia and gave an amazing speech! Nader is the
sexiest LIVING MIND!

Would like to second Mark Weiss's sentiments (see his post below).
Folks must definitely notice the differences here between Anybody Other
than McCain and the senile fool himself, who's so "power-mad" and caught
up by deeply psychological "ambition," the kind that's evidence of deep
character flaw, the kind that only a wiseman would recognise as madness,
the kind of deep insecurity about his life and the meaning of same that
would cause him to do exactly what he is doing - going over to the dark
side of humanity regardless he would never prove himself such a puny,
cowardly, freak clone for Cheney/Bush were he not caught up in the worst
nightmare his unexplored psyche could possibly wreak upon him (and
everybody else).  Shoot, he could become an even worse monster than the
retarded sack of emptiness and insanity who's been there these past 8
years.  =20

=20

And it's more than the Supreme Court (though that's enough right there).

=20

It IS a great priviledge to be "a Progressive."  Surely most everybody
on the List here would call themselves "progressives." =20

(It's almost synonomous with "avant-garde," except it references the
"political" realm...)

=20

But it will take a lot more than "being a progressive" to heal the world
after the destruction set in motion by the past eight years of
Cheney/Bush and company.  All progressives will have to abandon juvenile
"perfectionism" and adolescent "idealism" and=20

compromise some staunch progressive causes and ideals at times and
simply "win the 'war'" against the ultra-right forces that wish to
destroy the planet entirely.  I.e., progressives will need to truly
distinguish themselves from our ultra-right antagonists - doing so means
NOT being "extreme" and perfectionistic.  The ultra-right's chief value,
strength, and Weakness may be that they are inflexible and narrow and
uncompromising.  I should think that defeating that value means
broadening our range of compatriots, including "old-fashioned"
"liberals" like Hillary and Bill, and, further, "conservatives," too,
especially those that don't go along with the Warren Jeffs and the Jack
Abramoffs.  I really think that there's a paradigm thing going on here -
take, for example, reports about the TOP FIVE STATE EXECUTIONERS (China,
Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United States).  Yeah, we're one
of just 24 nations on the planet still maintaining this barbaric
practice.  Gosh, we're in great company, aren't we?  Five of the most
powerful, aggressive, arrogant, and masculine countries still indulging
in the same old shit.  Vote for McCain/McSame/McLame?  You'd have to be
out of your mind, or extremely "immature," and all for Ego ("I'm a
Progressive" and I'm not compromising and voting "Republican-lite").
Hmmm, I know that has been my own immature perspective sometimes in the
past...

=20

Personally, I would be inclined to think that Obama is at least
partially right.  I live in western New York, which is very similar to
rural, small town Pennsylvania, I think.  I work in a factory alongside
scores of gun owners and hunters, NASCAR enthusiasts and bigots, "good
old boys" and good old boys' types of "girls."  I interact every day
with neighbors and co-workers and even family members who are thoroughly
indoctrinated by FOX News and who will likely vote "republican" even
though a lot of them hate what Bush has done. But that's a contradiction
of what Obama believes, in and of itself, isn't it?  In other words, NO,
they are not clinging "to guns or religion or antipathy to people who
aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as
a way to explain their [economic] frustrations."  If they were, then
McCain would be toast, right?  The Republicans would be voted out of
office, right?  It just doesn't seem that simple.  One of the chief
movers and shakers here, and a multimillionaire completely tight with
the company's Bush-supporting owner is "gay," but he's still Republican.
So where is his "antipathy to people who aren't like him?"  Dozens of
co-workers here are "evangelical christians" and they're suffering the
economic malaise as much as anyone else, but they're not coming over to
the Democrats' tent in droves, either.  There are all kinds of gun
owners and hunters, and the place is almost empty every first day of
deer season in fall, and most all of these folks are definitely
"suffering just as much as anyone else"; in fact, take away their
hunting and they would lose a big hunk of income to the necessity of
feeding their families with more meat from the grocery stores.
Religion, there are plenty of folks who are NOT ridiculously religious
and even ridicule the comparatively fanatical "evangelicals" some times,
but they're not Democrats, either, and they continue to vote republican.
We've got more than a few "immigrants," here, and none in management
positions (again, yeah, this place is VERY "white"), but they are not
alienated here at all; in fact, they are welcomed, perhaps because the
wages are low and they're more than glad to have "secure," albeit lower
paying, employment. =20

=20

Maybe THAT - Security - is the bottom line.  Financial security,
spiritual security, emotional and psychological security...  The world
and "Reality" are evolving and changing at terrifying, exponentially
rapid rates.  These folks, largely "illiterate" by our "Progressive" and
"Avant-Garde" standards, must be petrified.  (The best "educated" in a
place like this are the engineers with their bachelor's degree in
"Engineering" and the CEO with his MBA - for the most part no
literature, humanities, social sciences, philosophy, at all; i.e.,
essentially it's Illiteracy-ville here.)  They cannot in any way have
the "intellectual" or "cosmopolitan" worldviews needed to accept and
process such change the way we "elitist," broadly educated folks can.
No wonder they stay with the Republicans!  The Republicans and, by
definition, "Conservatism" couch all of Reality in illusions of
"security."     =20

=20

Shoot, they're clinging to their guns and religion and antipathy to
people who aren't like them because that is, quite simply, who they are
and what they are.  Maybe Barack and Hillary are the ones clinging to
antipathy to people who aren't like them -- priviledged-class graduates
of the most elite universities in the world.  Fucking idiots!  What did
they ever do for these people?  Yeah, sure, a whole bunch, in the
general sense, but these folks don't understand that!  They understand
the Republican owner who built a very successful manufacturing plant
with hard work and intelligence and the sweat and sacrifice of small
town folks who weren't going to see better opportunities for secure
work, secure life, secure opportunities to raise families from the
Obamas or Clintons of the world.  Hence, your prototypical "self-made"
billionaire Republican conservative who exemplifies "independence" and
hard work and frugality - NOT a George Bush Republican at all, but not
one to vote against Bush or allow unions or encourage long-haired hippy,
literate "progressives" like me, either...  Half the folks complain that
they've been nickeled and dimed for generations, but few leave this kind
of secure employment that doesn't require college degrees, that respects
loyalty and seniority, that provides modest but definite retirement
monies radically post-modern corporations like Global Crossing steal
from their longest term and most loyal employees... =20

=20

Shoot, BOTH Obama and Hillary are as stupid as can be some days, aren't
they?  The freaking idiots!  They should be bending over backwards to
work together to figure how to appeal to the real victims of post-modern
America -- the burgeoning lower middle class and the environment.  As
for the rest of America, whether Democrat or Republican, I think they'll
all do just fucking fine, whether they were born and raised in Mexico,
Pakistan, India, Chicago, or Seattle.  Once they get to that top 10%
where Obama and Hillary will be for the rest of their lives, there is
really no Insecurity whatsoever, give or take a terrorist attack or
hurricane every now and then.  =20

I suppose this is how it works. If one lives in a rural area, you're folk. You're folksy. Small town folk, etc.
It's a polite way, I guess, of saying the Great unwashed.

But why mince words? Didn't the discussion begin on a note of intolerance? Why be so polite? It's unnecessary.

I understand his point (I think Maureen Dowd does, too), and I read
the whole statement. It's a crude analysis that has some truth (and a
lot that's just dumb--hunters don't hunt, for instance, because
they're angry, and if Obama doesn't cling to religion because he's
bitter neither do most of those he's talking about), but it's still
elitist and politically incredibly stupid. He maybe doesn't realize
that he's living in a glass house? Everything he says is heard and
processed. Maybe he should save lectures for the classroom. And think
a little more about what he's saying.

I can't wait til he starts explaining the dynamics of Russian history to Putin.

Jesse,

There are a lot of things I think are wrong with your dismissal of =
=93Epigramititis.=94 One is that your definition of the epigram hasn=92t =
been updated since the death of Alexander Pope. It=92s 2008 =96 I think =
we can bend the rules a little. (Speaking of which, did you really call =
Kent a =93jack-a-napes=94 on your blog?)

But your central points seems to be that

1. Kent=92s epigrams are rude and even vicious.=20
2. That has no place in poetry.=20

You=92re right about the first and spectacularly wrong about the second. =
The history of poetry is filled with attack poems that make no attempt =
to be witty: Catullus (who=92s the obvious model for =
=93Epigramititis=94) and Byron are the most obvious examples but there =
are plenty of others. Cheap shots, sniping, gossip and inexplicable =
rivalries are a part of almost every art movement. On more than one =
occasion, Breton et. al. called Cocteau=92s mother in the middle of the =
night and told her that her son had been killed in a car crash. Makes =
=93Epigramititis=94 seem pretty tame, right?=20

And while we=92re on the subject of cheap shots, it looks like you took =
one at Geoffrey Gatza. The idea that anyone would publish a book of =
poetry just =93to turn a buck=94 is ridiculous =96 and you should know =
that.

Perhaps it's true that we live in a time when rudeness rules, but this
book, which the author loudly proclaims to be a modern Dunciad, lacks
the three necessary ingredients that make satire effective: wit,
insight, and craft.  The problem begins with the form that Johnson
chooses for his sallies: the epigram.  Johnson is clearly beyond his
depth here and the limits of his command of the English language,
including vocabulary and the rudiments of grammar are immediately
apparent.  To write a successful epigram is to craft a verbal artifact
that exhibits crisp intelligence in the handling of language, and
carries a "sting."  Rhyme, and in particular the rhyming couplet is
the poet's form of choice for this.  Satirical, free-verse, epigrams
are difficult to pull off for the best of writers, and we're clearly
not in that territory here.  Johnson's "epigrams" are wordy,
amorphous in form (a definite no-no!) groping in diction and sometimes
even lose their way before they end, leaving us to wonder what exactly
was the point besides an obvious attempt to bait, belittle, or strike a
posture.  Yes, he waxes warm and cozy when he addresses some of his
subjects--primarily experimental poets that figured prominently on the
Buffalo Poetics List c. 1999--2000, but for others he withholds the
puffs and brings out his brickbats of choice.  Distressingly, many of
his subjects for "satire" are women and minorities, and with them
Johnson "transcends" the limits of his craft in two ways: a liberal
use of scatological language, and direct unadulterated rudeness--and
even, in one case a threat of physical violence.  He attacks many
well-respected writers in this manner.  However, showing far more
cleverness in the pagination of this tome than in the writing of it,
Johnson buries such specimens of pathology in the last quarter of the
total pages.  What puzzles me is that this book does appear to have its
fans, but then again so does pit bull and cock fighting.

I also believe that anyone who tries to turn a buck selling stuff that
hurts feelings in the baldest and stupidest manner and makes no
apologies for it is just as deserving of contempt as the writer.

I believe this line comes from an old Diane Di Prima poem (isn't she on this
list somewhere?), and the next line says that "all other wars are subsumed
in it."  It's a pretty bold claim, but it is true that the people who
appointed Dana Gioia to head the NEA are the same people who orchestrated
the invasion of Iraq.

As for the first of these statements, what they seem to want to say is that
the war against the imagination causes the other, physical wars.  BUT that
is not what they say, and I think you're right to point that out.

As for the second, if poetry's the govt, who's the president of poetry?
Who's the mayor? Who's on the city council of poetry?

Philip Metres gives the Diane DiPrima poem in full on his blog, the link at
the foot of his post above. It _would_ be interesting to hear DiPrima's
response. True, the deadening of empathy, required to make a torturer, has
to be accomplished by banishing the imagination. But "THE ONLY WAR THAT
MATTERS..." seems alarmingly reductive.
A propos, I just came home from a reading at which two different people--one
from the podium and one in conversation afterward--rhapsodized about "poet
warriors," a phrase I hadn't heard before. Probably it's too much to hope
that I never hear it again...

A quick quote from Cecily Mackworth's book, 'Guillaume Apollinaire and the
Cubist Life' - "At about this time (1905) more and more young writers and
artists were coming to live there (Montmartre). Roland Dorgeles and Francis
Carcot had joined Pierre Mac Orlan; all three have become famous novelists
but were then struggling poets"  sound familiar, a century on?

        larger every year. ... [He] is the ultimate 'hyphenated' poet:
        critic - anthropologist - editor  - anthologist - performer -
        teacher - translator, to each of which he brings an *unbridled
        exuberance* and an innovator's *insistence on **transforming* a
        given state of affairs." - Charles Bernstein

By Astrid Wendlandt

PARIS (Reuters) - French Caribbean poet Aime Cesaire,founding father of the "negritude" movement that celebrated blackconsciousness, died in his native Martinique, France'sMinistry of Culture said on Thursday.

Cesaire, 94, who was mayor of the island's main city Fort-de-France for morethan half a century, was admitted to hospital last week suffering from heartand other problems.

His writings offered insight into how France imposedits culture on its citizens of different origins in the early part of the 20thCentury.

The theme still resonates in French politics today, as thecountry continues to struggle to integrate many of its residents of African andNorth African origin.

In 2005, Cesaire refused to meet then French InteriorMinister Nicolas Sarkozy (now French president) over concerns that Sarkozy'sconservative UMP party had pushed for a law which proposed to recognise thepositive legacy of French colonial rule. The law was eventually repealed.

Cesaire and African intellectual Leopold Senghor -- laterpresident of Senegal-- founded "The Black Student" in 1934, a journal that encouragedpeople to develop black identity.

ANTI-COLONIAL VOICE IN THE 1960s

The Caribbean writer rose to fame with his "Notebook ofa Return to the Native Land", written inthe late 1930s, in which he says "my negritude is neither tower norcathedral, it plunges into the red flesh of the soil."

His poems expressed the degradation of black people in the Caribbean and describe the rediscovery of an Africansense of self. In his "Discourse on Colonialism", first published in1950, Cesaire compared the relationship between the coloniser and colonisedwith the Nazis and their victims.

He was a mentor to fellow Martinican author Frantz Fanon,and their anti-colonial writings were a major influence in the headyintellectual climate of the 1960s and 1970s in France.

The negritude movement was a counterpart to the Black Pridemovement in the United States,though it has been criticised for not being radical enough.

Cesaire was also a friend of the French surrealist poetAndre Breton who had encouraged him to become a major voice of Surrealism.

Cesaire's anti-colonial rhetoric did not prevent him from havinga long-lasting political career.

After becoming mayor of Fort-de-France in 1945 at the age of 32, hewas elected deputy of parliament a year later, a post he held until the early1990s.

A graduate of the prestigious French Ecole NormaleSuperieure -- unusual for a black Martinican in the 1930s -- he remained amember of the French communist party until the Soviet Hungarian repression of1956.

Cesaire was born in 1913 in the small town of Basse-Pointe in Martinique.He married Suzanne Roussi in 1937, a gifted writer in her own right, with whomhe had six children.

erview=0A=0A=0AAim=E9 C=E9saire: I=92ve always had the feeling that I was o=
n a quest to reconquer something, my name, my country or myself.=0AThat is =
why my approach has in essence always been poetic.=0A=0A=0ABecause it seems=
 to me that in a way that=92s what poetry is.=0A=0A=0AThe reconquest of the=
 self by the self=85.=0A=0A=0AI think it was Heidegger who said that words =
are the abode of being.=0AThere are many such quotations. I believe it was =
Rene Char, in his=0Asurrealist days, who said that words know much more abo=
ut us than we=0Aknow about them.=0A=0A=0AI too believe that words have a re=
vealing as well as a creative function=85=0A=0A=0AThe Abbe Gregoire(1), Vic=
tor Schoelcher(2) and all those who spoke=0Aout and still speak out, who ca=
mpaigned for human rights without=0Adistinction of race and against discrim=
ination, these were my guides in=0Alife. They stand forever as representati=
ves of the West=92s great=0Aoutpouring of magnanimity and solidarity, an es=
sential contribution to=0Athe advancement of the ideas of practical univers=
ality and human=0Avalues, ideas without which the world of today would not =
be able to see=0Aits way forward. I am forever a brother to them, at one wi=
th them in=0Atheir combat and in their hopes=85=0A=0A=0AI really do believe=
 in human beings. I find. something of myself in=0Aall cultures, in that ex=
traordinary effort that all people, everywhere,=0Ahave made - and for what =
purpose?=0A=0A=0AQuite simply to make life livable!=0A=0A=0AIt is no easy m=
atter to put up with life and face up to death.=0A=0A=0AAnd this is what is=
 so moving.=0A=0A=0AWe are all taking part in the same great adventure.=0A=
=0A=0AThat is what is meant by cultures, cultures that come together at som=
e meeting-point=85.=0A=0A=0AI think it was in a passage in Hegel emphasizin=
g the master-slave=0Adialectic that we found this idea about specificity. H=
e points out that=0Athe particular and the universal are not to be seen as =
opposites, that=0Athe universal is not the negation of the particular but i=
s reached by a=0Adeeper exploration of the particular.=0A=0A=0AThe West tol=
d us that in order to be universal we had to start by=0Adenying that we wer=
e black. I, on the contrary, said to myself that the=0Amore we were black, =
the more universal we would be.=0A=0A=0AIt was a totally different approach=
. It was not a choice between alternatives, but an effort at reconciliation=
.=0A=0A=0ANot a cold reconciliation, but reconciliation in the heat of the =
fire, an alchemical reconciliation if you like.=0A=0A=0AThe identity in que=
stion was an identity reconciled with the=0Auniversal. For me there can nev=
er be any imprisonment within an=0Aidentity.=0A=0A=0AIdentity means having =
roots, but it is also a transition, a transition to the universal=85.=0A=0A=
=0AWe are far removed from that romantic idyll beneath the calm sea.These a=
re angry, exasperated lands, lands that spit and spew, thatvomit forth life=
.=0A=0A=0AThat is what we must live up to. We must draw upon the creativity=
 of=0Athis plot of land! We must keep it going and not sink into a slumber =
of=0Aacceptance and resignation. It is a kind of summons to us from history=
=0Aand from nature=85.=0A=0A=0AAnd so I have tried to reconcile those two w=
orlds, because that was=0Awhat had to be done. On the other hand, I feel ju=
st as relaxed about=0Aclaiming kinship with the African griot and the Afric=
an epic as about=0Aclaiming kinship with Rimbaud and Lautreamont - and thro=
ugh them with=0ASophocles and Aeschylus! =85=0A=0A=0AI have never harboured=
 any illusions about the risks of history, be=0Ait in Africa, in Martinique=
, in the Americas or anywhere else. History=0Ais always dangerous, the worl=
d of history is a risky world; but it is=0Aup to us at any given moment to =
establish and readjust the hierarchy of=0Adangers. =85=0A=0A=0AAt any rate,=
 it is for me the fundamental mode of expression, and=0Athe world=92s salva=
tion depends on its ability to heed that voice. It is=0Aobvious that the vo=
ice of poetry has been less and less heeded during=0Athe century we have li=
ved through, but it will come to be realized more=0Aand more that it is the=
 only voice that can still be life-giving and=0Athat can provide a basis on=
 which to build and reconstruct=85.=0A=0A=0A* And yet this century has not =
been one where ethics has triumphed, has it?=0A=0A=0AA.C.: Certainly not, b=
ut one must speak out, whether one is heeded=0Aor not; we hold certain thin=
gs to be fundamental, things that we cling=0Ato. Even if it means swimming =
against the tide, they must be upheld.=0A=0A=0AIn other words, poetry is fo=
r me a searching after truth and=0Asincerity, sincerity outside of the worl=
d, outside of alien times. We=0Aseek it deep within ourselves, often despit=
e ourselves, despite what we=0Aseem to be, within our innermost selves.=0A=
=0A=0APoetry wells up from the depths, with explosive force.=0A=0A=0AThe vo=

This reminds me of the problem I used to have, years ago, now, with the term "folk music".  Since most of the people then creating and performing this music were definitely from the middle class, I just wondered who the "folk" really were.  Of course, the traditional songs this music was based upon from an earlier era were probably another matter.  Regards, Tom Savage

It's a polite way, I guess, of saying the Great unwashed.

But why mince words? Didn't the discussion begin on a note of intolerance? Why be so polite? It's unnecessary.

Would this be better if it said: "The war that matters most is the war against the imagination."  Of course, badly used imagination has figured in the war in Iraq, mostly employed by George Bush, as in "mission accomplished", "weapons of mass destruction"  and his many false statements about conditions on the ground there improving as a result of our army's continued presence there, etc. Somehow a war that kills living human beings is important, whether it is a war on the imagination also or not, however.

Fanny Howe “This is a superb and important contribution to philosophy,
theology, psychology, and the science of knowing. To have the selection
here now, to be able to see the whole trajectory in one volume, is to
experience a revolutionary moment.”

Robert Creeley: “…this work is not apart from its thinking and/or
composition... I find the whole work to be a deeply engaging
preoccupation with, and articulation of, what life might be said,
factually, to be. But not as a defined subject, nor even a defining
one—but as one being one. That is an heroic undertaking, or rather,
place in which to work/write/live. Its formal authority is as brilliant
as any I know.”

Charles Bernstein: “Leslie Scalapino’s poems probe politics, perception,
and desire, creating hypnotically shifting coherences that take us
beyond any dislocating devices into a realm of newly emerging
consciousness. This work, which defies categorization, is essential for
contemporary poetry.”

Thank you for posting the link to Di Prima's wonderful poem.  Within the context of that poem, the line makes sense, although given that our stupid politicians are also engaged in a very "real" war in which many thousands have died, the line is still a bit shocking.  Taken out of context, however, it is still at the very least an overstatement.  There is something very real about the deaths of real human beings.  We can't imagine those deaths away.  However, if what was meant by that ad is contained in Di Prima's poem, it makes a difference to have the whole poem available.  I too respect Naropa Institute very much, having virtually begun my American poetic journey there thirty years ago.  Still, there was no shooting war on, then.  I wonder if there was one when Di Prima wrote this poem.  Regards, Tom Savage

whatever turns out to be the "true story" of this image--
the story of its "detection" via print documents and the constellation of
personages involved opens as it were new horizons into the past which lies
inside the arrangements made by words around images--
so than an image becomes as it were a living being preserved in amber as the
literal embodiment of a collective idea--
a "leaf" of a "tree of knowledge" previously only (perhaps) hinted at--
though one wonders if there were not through the eons of time "accidental"
such images made by the forces of nature--serendipiities of the collusions
of light and chemicals produced without any human agency involved--

like those markings found on rocks which it is very difficult to ascertain
if made by humans--or simply the action of chemicals, light, winds,
rains--and time--

Barry,

It is interesting how these very early photographs (photograms) are of
objects, things (leaf, urn), pointing to magic, possession of an essential
power, relating to the original photographic impulse. Placing an object
against an almost alchemical substance (e,g. silver nitrate solution) in the
presence of light is not that different from the ingesting of wafers during
Mass. In Daguerreotypes one way subjects chose to place themselves in front
of the lens was by pressing their hands against each other, in the form of
prayer. That's why, I think, hands are always so important in a photographic
images, outside eyes, and along with the nape, the most resonant parts of
the human body.

There is something funny how a process, a gesture so mysterious is attempted
to be placed withing an economic structure.

Ciao,

Murat

Jim,

Thank you for *The Mandrake Vehicles*. I liked, particularly, the first
installation.

It is very interesting that the basic text, its language, is based on an
animist sensibility. Is this coincidental? In some other occasion I suggest
that the poetry in our time will be forced to explore a animist sensibility
to be able to say anything.

In #4 of the First Installation, I noticed a very Poundian tone? Is that
accidental? Phrases like "nine sutured noose," etal, remind me of "The
Seafarer."

Affectionately,

Murat

As some of you know, I'm leaving Stockton at the end of this semester to
take up a job at UCLA. So there's an opening at Stockton. They want to hire
a poet with digital humanities experience, rather than a new media
specialist, given the relatively few new media people who actually can teach
literature. Here's the advert... it's a fun place to teach! You pretty much
create your own classes, with no hassles from the administration -- this
semester, I taught Video Game Narrative Studies, Experimental Writing
Workshop and Indie Films and Filmmakers (for their General Studies
Department).

RON SILLIMAN is a contemporary American poet. He has written and
edited 32 books to date. Between 1979 and 2004, Silliman wrote a
single poem, entitled The Alphabet. He has now begun writing a new
poem entitled Universe, the first section of which appears to be
called Revelator. Silliman sees his poetry as being part of a single
poem or lifework, which he calls Ketjak. Ketjak is also the name of
the first poem of The Age of Huts. If and when completed, the entire
work will consist of The Age of Huts (1974-1980), Tjanting
(1979-1981), The Alphabet (1979-2004), and Universe (2005 - present).
Ron Silliman's fame and notoriety have grown considerably since 2002,
due in large part to his popular and controversial web blog:
Silliman's Blog. Debuting on August 29, 2002 to little fanfare and
without expectations of an audience, it is now arguably the most
influential English-language blog on the web that is devoted to
contemporary poetry and poetics.



CHARLES ALEXANDER is an American poet, publisher, and book artist. He
is the director and editor-in-chief of Chax Press, one of the only
independent presses which specializes in innovative poetry and the
book arts. Alexander also served as the Director of the Minnesota
Center for the Book Arts from 1993 until 1995 and as book artist
there through 1996. Alexander lives in Tucson, AZ with his wife, the
visual artist, Cynthia Miller. He is the recipient of the 2006
Arizona Arts Award and his books of poetry include Hopeful Buildings
(Chax Press, 1990), arc of light | dark matter (Segue Books, 1992),
Pushing Water: parts one through six (Standing Stones Press, Morris,
MN, 1998), Four Ninety Eight to Seven (Meow Press, 1996) and Certain
Slants (Junction Press, 2007). Since 1997 Alexander has been working
on a long serial poem entitled Pushing Water which is still in
process. He has also performed poetry in galleries and art centers,
has collaborated with musicians and dancers and generally brings to
poetry a broad sense of artistic and collaborative possibility.



JAMES CHENG TING FEI moved to the US in 1992 to pursue a degree in
electrical engineering. He has since been active as a composer,

A sample from the title poem of this excellent book:

your beautiful planet
escapes into
the night sky
of heavenly bodies
a sweeping portrayal
of diction where I stand
petrified
and moonlit
your dark mood
has me plunged
into waters
of broad dissatisfaction
I crept through
the blackness
on my hands and knees
belittled by ghosts
and dodging anthems
of mercurial words
you always say no
when I most need
your inevitability
who is paramount
to you but me
who has been judged a factor
in this amnesty
where elusive waters
and warmth of
paranoia cast aside
its glow in the
amber light of
your speechless
advocate--

About Blert:

The bright, taut, explosive poems in Jordan Scott=92s Blert represent a =20=

spelunk into the mouth of the stutterer. Through the unique symptoms =20
of the stutterer (Scott, like fifty million others, has always =20
stuttered), language becomes a rolling gait of words hidden within =20
words, leading to different rhythms and textures, all addressed by =20
the mouth=92s slight erosions.

In Scott=92s lexicon, to blert is to stutter, to disturb the breath of =20=

speaking. The stutter quivers in all that we do, from a skip on a cd =20
to a slip of the tongue. These experiences are often dismissed as =20
aberrant, but in Blert, such fragmented milliseconds are embraced and =20=

mined as language. Often aimed full-bore at words that are especially =20=

difficult for the stutterer, Scott=92s poems don=92t just discuss, they =20=

replicate the act of stuttering, the =91blort, jam and rejoice=92 =20
involved in grappling with the granular texture of words.

=91Jordan Scott=92s Blert is the most original poetic project I have =
read =20
in years. Undertaking a =93poetics of stutter,=94 the book is not =20
primarily a mimetic representation of stuttering, or the reproduction =20=

of stammered speech, but rather an investigation into how the stutter =20=

originates.=92 =96 Craig Dworkin, PMLA

=20
PARIS (Reuters) - French Caribbean poet Aime Cesaire,founding father of =
the "negritude" movement that celebrated blackconsciousness, died in his =
native Martinique, France'sMinistry of Culture said on Thursday.
=20
Cesaire, 94, who was mayor of the island's main city Fort-de-France for =
morethan half a century, was admitted to hospital last week suffering from =
heartand other problems.
=20
His writings offered insight into how France imposedits culture on its =
citizens of different origins in the early part of the 20thCentury.
=20
The theme still resonates in French politics today, as thecountry =
continues to struggle to integrate many of its residents of African =
andNorth African origin.
=20
In 2005, Cesaire refused to meet then French InteriorMinister Nicolas =
Sarkozy (now French president) over concerns that Sarkozy'sconservative =
UMP party had pushed for a law which proposed to recognise thepositive =
legacy of French colonial rule. The law was eventually repealed.
=20
Cesaire and African intellectual Leopold Senghor -- laterpresident of =
Senegal-- founded "The Black Student" in 1934, a journal that encouragedpeo=
ple to develop black identity.
=20
ANTI-COLONIAL VOICE IN THE 1960s
=20
The Caribbean writer rose to fame with his "Notebook ofa Return to the =
Native Land", written inthe late 1930s, in which he says "my negritude is =
neither tower norcathedral, it plunges into the red flesh of the soil."
=20
His poems expressed the degradation of black people in the Caribbean and =
describe the rediscovery of an Africansense of self. In his "Discourse on =
Colonialism", first published in1950, Cesaire compared the relationship =
between the coloniser and colonisedwith the Nazis and their victims.
=20
He was a mentor to fellow Martinican author Frantz Fanon,and their =
anti-colonial writings were a major influence in the headyintellectual =
climate of the 1960s and 1970s in France.
=20
The negritude movement was a counterpart to the Black Pridemovement in the =
United States,though it has been criticised for not being radical enough.
=20
Cesaire was also a friend of the French surrealist poetAndre Breton who =
had encouraged him to become a major voice of Surrealism.
=20
Cesaire's anti-colonial rhetoric did not prevent him from havinga =
long-lasting political career.
=20
After becoming mayor of Fort-de-France in 1945 at the age of 32, hewas =
elected deputy of parliament a year later, a post he held until the =
early1990s.
=20
A graduate of the prestigious French Ecole NormaleSuperieure -- unusual =
for a black Martinican in the 1930s -- he remained amember of the French =
communist party until the Soviet Hungarian repression of1956.
=20
Cesaire was born in 1913 in the small town of Basse-Pointe in Martinique.He=
 married Suzanne Roussi in 1937, a gifted writer in her own right, with =
whomhe had six children.

Tributaries & Text-Fed StreamsThe Capilano Review, a long-running (print)
literary periodical from Vancouver Canada, recently published an issue
titled "Artifice and Intelligence". It featured essays relating to digital
writing by a number of Canadian artists such as David Jhave Johnston, Kate
Armstrong, Darren Werschler Henry, myself, and others. To my knowledge, this
is the first of the long-running literary periodicals of western Canada to
do anything whatsoever concerning digital writing. The issue was
guest-edited by Andrew Klobucar, who teaches at Capilano College.

Below is a  press release about a project, just published, concerning that
issue of the Capilano Review.

My essay, "The <body> of Net Art", which is in both these projects, is at
http://tributaries.thecapilanoreview.ca/2008/04/15/the-body-of-net-art  . It
looks at some of the architectural possibilities for works of net art.

_________________________________



We are writing to announce "Tributaries & Text-Fed Streams", a new net art
project by J.R. Carpenter. The piece was commissioned by the TCR (The
Capilano Review), based in Vancouver, and is a "personal, experimental and
playful rereading of and response to” the essays you produced for the
"Artifice and Intelligence" edition, issue 2.50, published one year ago.

The work explores the formal and functional properties of RSS, using
blogging, tagging and other online tools to mark up and interlink essays and
to insert additional meta-layers of commentary in order to play with,
expose, expand upon, and subvert formal structures of writing, literature,
and literary criticism.

Over a period of time the twelve essays are distilled into fragments, which
are then annotated, marked-up, tagged and posted. Fed into an RSS stream,
the fragments are re-read, reordered, and reblogged in an iterative process
of distribution that opens up new readings of the essays and reveals new
interrelationships between them. The result of this process-based approach
is part blog, part archive - at once an online repository for the artifacts
of re-reading and a stage for the performance of live archiving.

Streams are both literally and metaphorically the central image of the work.
Streams of consciousness, data, and rivers flow through the interface and
through the texts. Through this process of re-reading and responding, this
textual tributary feeds a larger stream while paying tribute to the original
sources.

The work is located at http://tributaries.thecapilanoreview.ca.

Upon the conclusion of its active phase in May 2008, the project will be
launched at an event sponsored by TCR in Vancouver and released on
Turbulence.org.

We invite you to check it out, and perhaps to respond in comments, bringing
the process full circle.

=46rom The liberating power of words - interview with poet Aime Cesaire -=
 Interview


Aim=E9 C=E9saire: I=92ve always had the feeling that I was on a quest to =
reconquer something,=20
my name, my country or myself.
That is why my approach has in essence always been poetic.


Because it seems to me that in a way that=92s what poetry is.


The reconquest of the self by the self=85.


I think it was Heidegger who said that words are the abode of being.
There are many such quotations. I believe it was Rene Char, in his
surrealist days, who said that words know much more about us than we
know about them.


I too believe that words have a revealing as well as a creative function=85=



The Abbe Gregoire(1), Victor Schoelcher(2) and all those who spoke
out and still speak out, who campaigned for human rights without
distinction of race and against discrimination, these were my guides in
life. They stand forever as representatives of the West=92s great
outpouring of magnanimity and solidarity, an essential contribution to
the advancement of the ideas of practical universality and human
values, ideas without which the world of today would not be able to see
its way forward. I am forever a brother to them, at one with them in
their combat and in their hopes=85


I really do believe in human beings. I find. something of myself in
all cultures, in that extraordinary effort that all people, everywhere,
have made - and for what purpose?


Quite simply to make life livable!


It is no easy matter to put up with life and face up to death.


And this is what is so moving.


We are all taking part in the same great adventure.


That is what is meant by cultures, cultures that come together at some me=
eting-point=85.


I think it was in a passage in Hegel emphasizing the master-slave
dialectic that we found this idea about specificity. He points out that
the particular and the universal are not to be seen as opposites, that
the universal is not the negation of the particular but is reached by a
deeper exploration of the particular.


The West told us that in order to be universal we had to start by
denying that we were black. I, on the contrary, said to myself that the
more we were black, the more universal we would be.


It was a totally different approach. It was not a choice between alternat=
ives, but an effort=20
at reconciliation.


Not a cold reconciliation, but reconciliation in the heat of the fire, an=
 alchemical=20
reconciliation if you like.


The identity in question was an identity reconciled with the
universal. For me there can never be any imprisonment within an
identity.


Identity means having roots, but it is also a transition, a transition to=
 the universal=85.


We are far removed from that romantic idyll beneath the calm sea.These ar=
e angry,=20
exasperated lands, lands that spit and spew, thatvomit forth life.


That is what we must live up to. We must draw upon the creativity of
this plot of land! We must keep it going and not sink into a slumber of
acceptance and resignation. It is a kind of summons to us from history
and from nature=85.


And so I have tried to reconcile those two worlds, because that was
what had to be done. On the other hand, I feel just as relaxed about
claiming kinship with the African griot and the African epic as about
claiming kinship with Rimbaud and Lautreamont - and through them with
Sophocles and Aeschylus! =85


I have never harboured any illusions about the risks of history, be
it in Africa, in Martinique, in the Americas or anywhere else. History
is always dangerous, the world of history is a risky world; but it is
up to us at any given moment to establish and readjust the hierarchy of
dangers. =85


At any rate, it is for me the fundamental mode of expression, and
the world=92s salvation depends on its ability to heed that voice. It is
obvious that the voice of poetry has been less and less heeded during
the century we have lived through, but it will come to be realized more
and more that it is the only voice that can still be life-giving and
that can provide a basis on which to build and reconstruct=85.


* And yet this century has not been one where ethics has triumphed, has i=
t?


A.C.: Certainly not, but one must speak out, whether one is heeded
or not; we hold certain things to be fundamental, things that we cling
to. Even if it means swimming against the tide, they must be upheld.


In other words, poetry is for me a searching after truth and
sincerity, sincerity outside of the world, outside of alien times. We
seek it deep within ourselves, often despite ourselves, despite what we
seem to be, within our innermost selves.


Poetry wells up from the depths, with explosive force.


The volcano again.


No doubt I have reached the moment of crossing the great divide but
I face it imperturbably in the knowledge of having put forward what I
see as essential, in the knowledge, if you like, of having called out
ahead of me and proclaimed the future aloud.


That is what I believe I have done; somewhat disoriented though I am
to find the seasons going backwards, as it were, that is how it is and
that is what I believe to be my vocation.


No resentments, none at all, no ill feelings but the inescapable
solitude of the human condition. That is the most important thing.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/andrew-crozier-poet-and-poets-champion-809561.html
At just 20 years old, the poet Andrew Crozier began to nurture and revitalise ? through his small-press publishing ? a rich terrain of first American, then British, modernist poetry. This had a rapid effect for his peers, principally those associated with the Cambridge School. Crozier disseminated, circulated and, with what became an increasingly anonymous generosity, encouraged and stimulated countless writers and visual artists. If he partly achieved this as an editor, archivist, publisher and teacher, it was quietly reflective of his precise gift as a poet.

Please consider posting this. Earlier notice of the death of Andrew Crozier was quite truncated.  This one, by poet Nicholas Johnson (etruscan press), goes much further.  --Martha King

What's been overlooked in the discussion of Obama's remarks is that he isn't
saying that people hunt and go to church because they are bitter. He is
saying that working class Americans are bitter and as a result get conned
into voting against their own interests by the Republicans, who throw around
nonsense issues like gun control and gay marriage to frighten them.

This sounds like a good description of my family, who live in Chicago. And
some of my neighbors here in New Orleans. It's not a small town issue, it's
class issue. I've lived in working class communities my whole life, and I
knew immediately what Obama was talking about. It's not elitism, it's just
the truth. People in the US have been voting away their rights and economic
welfare for years.

Dear Buffalo Poetics Listserv:

Could you please post the following cfp for a panel I'm organizing on poetr=
y and recorded sound for next novemvber's Modernist Studies Assoication con=
ference? Here's the info:

Disembodied Voices: Poetry, Sound, and the Rise of Recording Media

A small yet steady flow of critical materials treating the relationship of =
poetry to sonic media has continued to appear in the related fields of poet=
ics and modernist studies. However, a sufficient understanding of the full =
impact of the emergence of sound recording media on=20
poetic practice has yet to be attained.

From its inception, Edison and other innovators in sound recording conceive=
d of their new medium as having the capacity to record and preserve the voi=
ces of statesmen, opera singers, and poets long after their deaths. From th=
is beginning, sound recording is quickly taken=20
up by the nascent culture industry as a form of entertainment. By the 1930s=
, however, sound recording media are once again in use as a means of preser=
ving the voices of poets, as the rich store of audio files the Pennsound on=
line archive contains will attest. Beginning in the=20
1950s, the widespread availability of inexpensive tape recorders ensures th=
at the individual poet will be able to record and document the poem=E2=80=
=99s aural qualities, a development related both to the proliferation of li=
ve readings and performance-based poetry continuing into=20
the present and a renewed and rigorous attention to the ability of the voic=
e to produce nonsemantic sounds in the form of the audio poem. The history =
of early recorded sound as a sort of ghostly double of modernist poetry and=
 the concurrent development of these related=20
media throughout the twentieth century is an emerging field of inquiry that=
 will yield new understandings of poetry=E2=80=99s relationship to popular =
media as they were configured and gained prominence throughout the modernis=
t period.

Critical approaches may include, but are not limited to, the co-optation of=
 radio broadcast by poets, the relationship of poetry to recordings of popu=
lar music, the analogy between poetry and devices for transcribing sound, s=
ound recording=E2=80=99s ability to render vocal features as=20
auditory cues of race and social status in poetry, and the correlation betw=
een the early development of sound/performance-based poetry and recording t=
echnology.

Please send a 250-word abstract and a brief scholarly bio to jparks4@buffal=
o.edu by May 5, 2008.

Thanks!

what a ridiculous bunch of out of context garbage. note that all the studies are conducted in 2004, and the framing is a complete bait and switch. the data quoted confirms the values voter image that won bush the election in 2004, and to try to twist that data to say otherwise is patent nonsense.

For Edna Andrade

I=E2=80=99ve been scanning pdfs=20
Of women=E2=80=99s arts catalogues
For her entries.  One might think,
There is no connection
Between her and me,

But we shared these Philadelphia streets,
That same academy,=20
Galleries in locks,
Prints at the Art Alliance,
Our membership in the caucus.

Her optical paintings always reminded=20
Me of light boxes, distilled in space.
I stared at them at the ICA
Unable to plot out her methods,
The factors prime and discrete.

I envisioned a mobius,=20
Stripped through the canvas,=20
Manifold In knot theories,=20
Her objects defied topology,
Now she enters her own algorithms.

Dear Murat--

In another note I sent rgerading this, i wonder often if natural processes
may well not have at some or many points in time produced "photograms"--

as a child I used to think of St Paul of Tarsus as having undergone a
photographic "development process as his Conversion experience of
Illumination--

that is, he was made blind--a dark room, a "negative"--and when so, the
Light of God enetered in and created the new Being of the Illuminated Paul
(formerly Saul)--

whose being was now, when he regained sight, so imprinted with the Image of
God, Light of God--that from then on of course that is what he both
witnesses to--and is a witness of--and a living image/being of--

(Poe's Dupin in The Purloined Letter remarks on his method of shrouding
himself in a dark room, eyes closed, there to see what will be found "hidden
in plain sight" in the light of day--

the photographic development of St Paul, taking place in the darkroom of
blindness, brings him to see again with other eyes, in which what was before
hidden in plain sight, is now everywhere visible--

in his own words:  "The world as we see it is passing"--

mysterious enigmatic statement at once of fact and prophecy--

(Basho:  The basis of art is change in the universe.)

anything mysterious or not can be inserted into the economic framework--
(Jesus' rage at the money lenders in the Temple--Luther's rage against the
Church etc etc)--)

"when shit is worth money, the poor will be born without assholes" is a
Brazilian Proverb--

and if they are not quick enough about being born in such a manner, there
are no doubt going to be developed always methods by which they will indeed
be born without assholes--

from photomania to pyromania--i was just reading of Knut Hamsun's obsession
with light--he could never gulp in enough light as it were--driving him to
some experiments with pyromania--

remember the Hawthorne family--Nathaniel and one of his sister's--obsession
with watching fires?--

and how this leads Nathaniel to become the first novelist to have as a major
character a daguerreotypist, in The House of Seven Gables--

"Let there be light"--the first "photo" event!--

and the Apocalypse as a conflagration in which the photo-event and
subsequent photo-manias have led to ever greater pyromanias!! and "finally"
to the Non Plus Ultra Illumination of the Final Judgement, in which all is
to revealed--

but then Lucifer--is also a Being of Light--and Prometheus--and again the
figures of Imagination as forms of light--Rimbaud's Illuminations for
example--and his later experiments with photography as a possible source of
income in Abyssinia, to accompany with photos the writings he began
publishing and as usual abruptly stopped--in French Journals along the lines
of National geographic--for explorers/exploiters to come--

(among the few images of Rimbaud are his self-portraits done during this
later period, when he had indeed become an "I is an other"--become "somebody
else"--)

and images created by Atomic Light--the Shadows in Walls of Hiroshima--

an Enlightment and Illumination--meeting of the Ages of these in the
photo-image, photo-gram--an Enlightment by technical Reason and at the same
time having the character of a mystical Illumination, a sacred experience
via Light--emerging from a darkness--"dark rooms" and "negatives"--

" . . . and said goodbye for now to the city, to Kristiania, where the
windows shone with such brightness."

(last lines of Hamsun's Hunger--)

If anyone might be interested in exchanging their apt. in New York for mine=
 in San Francisco from early June to early August (somewhat flexible on tim=

Murat,

Impressive. You read it. I hadn't, went back to it.

I like the idea of poems hidden in poems hidden in poems, poems emerging
from poems emerging from poems.

Interesting read at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrake_(plant) , which
includes some of the lore of the mandrake such as:

"According to the legend, when the root is dug up it screams and kills all
who hear it."

Which is useful to know in reading the first installation. As, it seems, is
quite a lot of the lore of the mandrake. The poem doesn't make much sense
without it; the lore is assumed knowledge in the poem.

ja

Erroll Morris continues his use of reenactments to examine the "truth" of
photography--

not "seeing is believing"--but "believing is seeing"--

i.e. --seek and ye shall find--what you want to see--
turning the "camera" or "eye" into a "projector" --
and rather than "finding out"--
projecting a priori what it is that is seen at the scene onto the scene --
before even arriving at the scene--

the photograph then becomes a "confirmation"--
rather than a "document open to question"--

"closing off" the seen from being seen--
or any opening into "seeing what is there"
before defining it--as it SHALL be seen--

photography as a further means to to "cover up" what is hidden in plain
sight--

if a photo is in a sense "staged"--
then the re-enactment becomes a method for the re-direction of the eye--what
it  focuses on--what discrepancies may be observed--
a burrowing and excavating within the time and space frame of the image--

to find the "cracks" within the smooth surfaces of "appearances"-

neither "opaque" nor "transparent"--

"beneath every level of reality--
there lies another"--
Sufi saying

Please find new signs at the end of the series.  The news that Cheney,
Rumsfeld, Powell,
Rice, and Ashcroft, sat around at the White House pondering torture
techniques got the
blogger going this week, along with McCain's notion that the empire must
last at least
100 years.

ire - Interview=0A=0A=0AAim=E9 C=E9saire: I=92ve always had the feeling tha=
t I was on a quest to reconquer something, =0Amy name, my country or myself=
.=0AThat is why my approach has in essence always been poetic.=0A=0A=0ABeca=
use it seems to me that in a way that=92s what poetry is.=0A=0A=0AThe recon=
quest of the self by the self=85.=0A=0A=0AI think it was Heidegger who said=
 that words are the abode of being.=0AThere are many such quotations. I bel=
ieve it was Rene Char, in his=0Asurrealist days, who said that words know m=
uch more about us than we=0Aknow about them.=0A=0A=0AI too believe that wor=
ds have a revealing as well as a creative function=85=0A=0A=0AThe Abbe Greg=
oire(1), Victor Schoelcher(2) and all those who spoke=0Aout and still speak=
 out, who campaigned for human rights without=0Adistinction of race and aga=
inst discrimination, these were my guides in=0Alife. They stand forever as =
representatives of the West=92s great=0Aoutpouring of magnanimity and solid=
arity, an essential contribution to=0Athe advancement of the ideas of pract=
ical universality and human=0Avalues, ideas without which the world of toda=
y would not be able to see=0Aits way forward. I am forever a brother to the=
m, at one with them in=0Atheir combat and in their hopes=85=0A=0A=0AI reall=
y do believe in human beings. I find. something of myself in=0Aall cultures=
, in that extraordinary effort that all people, everywhere,=0Ahave made - a=
nd for what purpose?=0A=0A=0AQuite simply to make life livable!=0A=0A=0AIt =
is no easy matter to put up with life and face up to death.=0A=0A=0AAnd thi=
s is what is so moving.=0A=0A=0AWe are all taking part in the same great ad=
venture.=0A=0A=0AThat is what is meant by cultures, cultures that come toge=
ther at some meeting-point=85.=0A=0A=0AI think it was in a passage in Hegel=
 emphasizing the master-slave=0Adialectic that we found this idea about spe=
cificity. He points out that=0Athe particular and the universal are not to =
be seen as opposites, that=0Athe universal is not the negation of the parti=
cular but is reached by a=0Adeeper exploration of the particular.=0A=0A=0AT=
he West told us that in order to be universal we had to start by=0Adenying =
that we were black. I, on the contrary, said to myself that the=0Amore we w=
ere black, the more universal we would be.=0A=0A=0AIt was a totally differe=
nt approach. It was not a choice between alternatives, but an effort =0Aat =
reconciliation.=0A=0A=0ANot a cold reconciliation, but reconciliation in th=
e heat of the fire, an alchemical =0Areconciliation if you like.=0A=0A=0ATh=
e identity in question was an identity reconciled with the=0Auniversal. For=
 me there can never be any imprisonment within an=0Aidentity.=0A=0A=0AIdent=
ity means having roots, but it is also a transition, a transition to the un=
iversal=85.=0A=0A=0AWe are far removed from that romantic idyll beneath the=
 calm sea.These are angry, =0Aexasperated lands, lands that spit and spew, =
thatvomit forth life.=0A=0A=0AThat is what we must live up to. We must draw=
 upon the creativity of=0Athis plot of land! We must keep it going and not =
sink into a slumber of=0Aacceptance and resignation. It is a kind of summon=
s to us from history=0Aand from nature=85.=0A=0A=0AAnd so I have tried to r=
econcile those two worlds, because that was=0Awhat had to be done. On the o=
ther hand, I feel just as relaxed about=0Aclaiming kinship with the African=
 griot and the African epic as about=0Aclaiming kinship with Rimbaud and La=
utreamont - and through them with=0ASophocles and Aeschylus! =85=0A=0A=0AI =
have never harboured any illusions about the risks of history, be=0Ait in A=
frica, in Martinique, in the Americas or anywhere else. History=0Ais always=
 dangerous, the world of history is a risky world; but it is=0Aup to us at =
any given moment to establish and readjust the hierarchy of=0Adangers. =85=
=0A=0A=0AAt any rate, it is for me the fundamental mode of expression, and=
=0Athe world=92s salvation depends on its ability to heed that voice. It is=
=0Aobvious that the voice of poetry has been less and less heeded during=0A=
the century we have lived through, but it will come to be realized more=0Aa=
nd more that it is the only voice that can still be life-giving and=0Athat =
can provide a basis on which to build and reconstruct=85.=0A=0A=0A* And yet=
 this century has not been one where ethics has triumphed, has it?=0A=0A=0A=
A.C.: Certainly not, but one must speak out, whether one is heeded=0Aor not=
; we hold certain things to be fundamental, things that we cling=0Ato. Even=
 if it means swimming against the tide, they must be upheld.=0A=0A=0AIn oth=
er words, poetry is for me a searching after truth and=0Asincerity, sinceri=
ty outside of the world, outside of alien times. We=0Aseek it deep within o=

Hi.  I'd like to know if anybody else on the list has seen the new Meryl Streep movie "Dark Matter" in which a brilliant, possibly great movie was ruined by a cheap, trashy, prejudicial ending.  In my humble opinion, it isn't the brilliant kids in universities who become the mass killers we all hear about about twice a year now.  It's the sadly deluded, violent fools who go on a rampage when their stupid, little desires are frustrated.  It may be possible to feel compassion for them on some level, but to saddle the  beautiful,sympathetic character of this up to then wonderful movie  with a senseless killing seems to me to be an aesthetic crime.  Regards, Tom Savage'

David,

Sounds like the architectural "restoration" of Brady Street in
Milwaukee. It seems both older and newer than I remembered it as a kid
:)

Greetings!

I'm hoping that some one of you can help me identify a
poetic trope.

A good example of it comes in Matthea Harvey's "Pity
the Bathtub Its Forced Embrace of the Human" from her
2000 book with the same title:

"For improvement within try a soap dish that allows
for/ Slippage is inevitable as is difference in the
size of/ The subject may hoard his or her bubbles. .
."

Here two nouns--"slippage" & "the subject"--function
twice grammatically both in the sentences they end &
the sentences they begin.

Is there a name for this simultaneity?  I've been
searching rhetorical tropes & haven't found anything
close yet.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Peter

ALL:

Micah Robbins -- a young &  _extraordinary_ bookmaker in San Marcos, Texas -- sent the attached msg out appealing to others for help re Tom Clark.

_all_ the proceeds from the sale of David Hadbawnik's Ovid in Exile will go straight to Clark. the book is one of the finest i have on my shelves -- board covers, five signatures attached to one another thru a lovely Coptic stitch. the book price is $15.00. unbelievable considering the labor invested.

In an effort to help Tom Clark, Interbirth Books will be donating 100% of proceeds from David Hadbawnik's Ovid in Exile earned throughout April to Mr. Clark.

Hey everyone -

I have a small manuscript of 10 love poems - I'm collaborating with an
artist who will write them out long-hand.  We're looking for a publisher who
will print these as images but in fine quality (not photocopies). It will
total about 15-20 standard trade-sized pages.  Before she begins her work,
we need to settle matters such as trim size, ink, etc.  Before we can do
that, I think, we need to find a publisher who will take on the project. If
you have any leads, I'd love to hear them.  Fine quality is more important
than large print-run or wide distribution.

My first "normal" book came out from BlazeVOX and the second is forthcoming
from Persea Books.

Let me know via email - aaron@belz.net

Merci,
Aaron

not really.

but now that i have your attention, let us note that the situation is
excellent.

poet tried for killing judge, seducing wife of judge.

it's a plot situation i heard on the radio today. from a new novel by
william deverel.

ne'er do well poet is tried for killing judge. presumably not tried for
seducing the judge's wife.

that's sort of what poets do. kill the judge. figuratively speaking.

and seduce the wife.

perhaps it is a novel of poetics!

ha.

not likely, but you know what i mean, being yerself not so far removed from
the current situation.

A request!
 I am leading a "Walking & Writing" Class on the University of San Francisco Campus. We have upcoming 'writing' visits in the Library's Rare Book room and a Sculpture workshop. Does one have any 'favorite' work which sites itself in a Library or in an Art Workshop?? (This one is actually for 'sculpture' students).

 Some eons ago, frequently lit mags would have a poem (or story) that would take place in a bookshop. (I think those situations between the speaker and the romantic 'sought' among the stacks have been replaced by eHarmony or comparable date making sites! Or maybe the NYRB).  Not to rule out the romantic in any of these situations,  but I welcome any kind of poem with this kind of specific location.  (I often suffer from 'aphasia' when it comes to remembering specific poems)

 (I have not read Larkin in a long time, but he must have something of the Library, yes?)
 Your suggestions much appreciated.

 I suggest checking out this link - an unusual text/audiovisual doc that outs those omnipresent 'Retired Generals' on Fox. CNN, MSNBC on how they have taken their talking points direct from the Pentagon. It's not unexpected but wow.

 Then the movie The Counterfeiters - there in the Nazi prison camps with the omnipresent attack dogs do echo up Abu Graib. And the connections one can make with the resumption of torture to Rumsfeld & Co.

 It is nice that the NY Times has finally begin to fully lay out the cards on Bush &Co.  Wish Hillary and Obama can get full up to speed on this - if real change is going to come.

Bebe Barron (1925 - 2008)

=93It is with great sadness that I report the death of Bebe Barron on =20=

April 20, 2008 at the age of 82, of natural causes. Bebe was the last =20=

of the pioneering composers of classical studio electronic music. She =20=

was a close friend, an enthusiastic colleague, and a most gracious lady.

Bebe Barron was born Charlotte Wind in Minneapolis, on June 16, 1925. =20=

She received an MA in political science from the University of =20
Minnesota, where she studied composition with Roque Cordero, and she =20
also spent a year studying composition and ethnomusicology at the =20
University of Mexico. In 1947 she moved to New York and, while working =20=

as a researcher for Time-Life, studied composition with Wallingford =20
Reigger and Henry Cowell. That same year, she met and married Louis =20
Barron (1920 - 1989). Shortly thereafter, the Barrons began their =20
experiments with the recording and manipulation of sound material by =20
means of a tape recorder that they received as a wedding gift. They =20
created a private studio in New York and, in 1955, composed the first =20=

electronic music score for a commercial film, Forbidden Planet. In =20
1962 the Barrons moved to Los Angeles; they divorced in 1970. In 1973, =20=

Bebe married Leonard Neubauer, a screen writer. Bebe became the first =20=

Secretary of the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United =20
States (SEAMUS) in 1985, and also served on the Board of Directors. In =20=

1997 Bebe was presented the SEAMUS Award for the Barrons life work in =20=

the field of electro-acoustic music. She is survived by her husband, =20
Leonard, and her son, Adam.

Bebe=92s last public appearance was on January 12, 2008, at an event =20
held at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, celebrating the work of her =20=

good friend, Anais Nin. Bebe was too ill to speak in public at this =20
point, but she agreed to be interviewed for a video piece that was =20
shown at the event. This is her final interview, and you can see it on =20=

YouTube.

Bebe=92s final composition, Mixed Emotions (2000) was composed in the =20=

CREATE studios of the University of California at Santa Barbara. I=92ll =20=

be putting this work up on the Downloads 2 page of my website, along =20
with some photos of Bebe and myself taken in 2005 at her home on the =20
Photos page within the next week.

I first met Bebe Barron in the middle 1970s; I don=92t remember exactly =20=

when, but I think it was around 1975. I had asked Bebe and her former =20=

husband and composing partner Louis to attend a showing of Forbidden =20
Planet that I had arranged as part of a class at CalArts. They agreed =20=

to do it, and I quickly became good friends with Bebe and we remained =20=

close over the years.

In writing about Bebe Barron, it=92s impossible not to focus on the =20
pioneering work that she and Louis did in electronic music. They began =20=

their experiments in 1948, shortly after they were married. This early =20=

work was done using a tape recorder, preceding the work of Luening and =20=

Ussachevsky and the switch from disks to tape by Pierre Schaeffer and =20=

the GRM. But, to my knowledge, the Barrons=92 early experiments did not =20=

result in any completed works, a state of affairs not uncommon with =20
early pioneers in the field. In 1949 they set up one of the earliest =20
private electro-acoustic music studios and began their experiments =20
with electronically generated sounds. They built their own circuits =20
which they viewed as cybernetic organisms, having been influenced by =20
Norbert Weiner=92s work on cybernetics. The circuits, built with vacuum =20=

tubes, would exhibit characteristic qualities of pitch, timbre, and =20
rhythm, and had a sort of life cycle from their beginnings until they =20=

burned out. The Barrons recorded the sounds from the amplification of =20=

these circuits and this formed the basis of their working library. =20
They also employed tape manipulation techniques as part of their =20
compositional procedures. The sound qualities of these various =20
amplified tube circuits and the tape manipulations that they underwent =20=

formed the musical language that the Barrons created in their studio. =20=

Unlike some of the work being done elsewhere, the Barrons=92 music =20
reveals long phrases, often stated in tape-delayed rhythms, with the =20
stark finesse of the tube circuit timbres. They created a style that =20
was uniquely their own yet married to the technology they were using.

The Barrons earliest finished work, Heavenly Menagerie (1951) does not =20=

seem to have survived in a complete form. But their score for Ian =20
Hugo=92s film Bells of Atlantis (1952), based on a poem by Anais Nin, =20=

who appears on screen, does exist on the film sound track. This may be =20=

the earliest extant work of the Barrons and presages what was to come =20=

with Forbidden Planet, the music for which was composed in 1955, the =20
film being released the next year.

The music for Forbidden Planet is truly a landmark in electro-acoustic =20=

music. This was the first commercial film to use only electronic =20
music, and the score for the movie displays an attitude towards film =20
scoring that was different from anything that had happened before. In =20=

Forbidden Planet, while there are themes for characters and events in =20=

the film, as was traditional in the scoring of that day, the themes =20
are composed and perceived as gestalts, rather than as melodies in =20
traditional movie music. Even more important is the fact that the =20
scoring of Forbidden Planet breaks down the traditional line between =20
music and sound effects since the Barrons=92 electronic material is used =
=20
for both. This not only creates a new type of unity in the film sound =20=

world, but also allows for a continuum between these two areas that =20
the Barrons exploit in various ways. At some points it=92s actually =20
impossible to say whether or not what you=92re hearing is music, sound =20=

effect, or both. In doing this, they foreshadowed by decades the now =20
common role of the sound designer in modern film and video.

The Barrons composed many other works for tape, film, and the theater =20=

in the 1950s. Their studio became the home for John Cage=92s Project of =20=

Music for Magnetic Tape, and they assisted in the creation of Cage=92s =20=

first chance piece Williams Mix (1951-52), as well as works by other =20
members of the group such as Earle Brown and Morton Feldman. As a =20
studio for the creation of their own and other composers=92 works, the =20=

Barrons=92 studio served as a functioning center for electro-acoustic =20=

music at a time when there was no institutional support of the medium =20=

in the United States. It=92s curious, then, that, for many years, the =20=

Barrons, their studio, and their works were largely overlooked by =20
composers and historians in the field. Fortunately, that injustice has =20=

since been corrected, and, in 1997, it was my great honor to present =20
to Bebe and, posthumously, to Louis, the SEAMUS Lifetime Achievement =20
Award. Bebe was involved with SEAMUS from the very beginning of the =20
organization. She was one of the ten original members who responded to =20=

my organizational call and met at CalArts in November of 1984 to form =20=

the group, and she was SEAMUS=92s first secretary. There may have been a =
=20
little strong-arming on my part to get her to be involved so actively, =20=

but Bebe was always ready to support the cause of electro-acoustic =20
music in whatever way she could.

Bebe created a firm legacy in her music. If the importance of one=92s =20=

work is to be judged in any regard by it=92s influence, acceptance, =20
longevity, and innovative qualities, then the score for Forbidden =20
Planet is an enormous success. It remains the most widely known =20
electro-acoustic music work on this planet. For me, Bebe Barron will =20
always be the First Lady of electronic music.=94

Hi Peter,

    In class I call it a "pivot" line or a "hinge" line, but I don't recall
ever hearing or reading a codified name for it. Of course, that doesn't mean
there isn't one!

JUDGE DISMISSES MAIL FRAUD CASE AGAINST BIO-ARTIST KURTZ

Buffalo, NY=97A process that has taken nearly four years may be coming =20=

to an end. On Monday, April 21, Federal Judge Richard J. Arcara ruled =20=

to dismiss the indictment against University at Buffalo Professor of =20
Visual Studies Dr. Steven Kurtz.

In June 2004, Professor Kurtz was charged with two counts of mail =20
fraud and two counts of wire fraud stemming from an exchange of $256 =20
worth of harmless bacteria with Dr. Robert Ferrell, Professor of Human =20=

Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public =20
Health.

Dr. Kurtz planned to use the bacteria in an educational art exhibit =20
about biotechnology with his award-winning art and theater collective, =20=

Critical Art Ensemble.

Professor Kurtz=92 lawyer, Paul Cambria, said that his client was =20
=93pleased and relieved that this ordeal may be coming to an end.=94

The prosecution has the right to appeal this dismissal. How the =20
prosecution will proceed is unknown at this time. If an appeal were =20
undertaken the case would move to the New York Second Circuit Court of =20=

Appeals in New York City.

Lucia Sommer, Coordinator of the CAE Defense Fund, which raises funds =20=

for Kurtz=92 legal defense, said, =93We are all grateful that after =20
reviewing this case, Judge Arcara took appropriate action.=94 She added =20=

that =93this decision is further testament to our original statements =20=

that Dr. Kurtz is completely innocent and never should have been =20
charged in the first place.=94

BACKGROUND ON DR. STEVEN KURTZ AND CRITICAL ART ENSEMBLE

Critical Art Ensemble (which Kurtz co-founded in 1987 with Steven =20
Barnes) has won numerous awards for its bio-art, including the =20
prestigious 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of =20
Artistic Expression Grant, honoring more than two decades of =20
distinguished work. The group has been commissioned to exhibit and =20
perform in many of the world's cultural institutions=97including the =20
London Museum of Natural History; The ICA, London; the Whitney Museum =20=

and the New Museum in NYC; the Corcoran Museum of Art in Washington, =20
DC; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Mus=E9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de =20=

There are two terms:

Liddell and Scott [I describe it and discuss it at some length passim in

I hope one or more of these will help you. (Can you tell that I love to do =
research?). An asterisk means I can provide you will full text if you send =
me an email.

A) POEMS IN/ABOUT LIBRARIES--

"In the Reading Room" by Franz Wright*
"In the Library" by Charles Simic* (it's possible that the "Miss Jones" men=
tioned briefly in this poem is a romantic interest, but that far-fetched in=
ference of mine is based only on a description of her in Simic's other poem=
 "Have You Met Miss Jones?")

Also, the full text of 50 poems about/in libraries are easily located by do=
ing a "library" keyword search on the "Poetry Tool" of poetryfoundation.org=
. For example--

"Episode in a Library" By Zbigniew Herbert

"Girl in a Library" By Gail Mazur=20

B) POEMS IN/ABOUT SCULPTURE STUDIOS/CLASSES--

There are lots of poems about sculptures. Poems about sculptors in studios =
 are a bit harder to find. Maybe these two older poems provide are what you=
 want--

=E2=80=9CThe Tireless Sculptor=E2=80=9D by Henrietta Ray

=E2=80=9CTo May Howard Jackson, Sculptor=E2=80=9D by Georgia Johnson

C) POEMS IN/ABOUT OTHER KINDS OF ART CLASSES/STUDIOS--

These are not exactly what you want but may be close--

1) "Your Art History" by Jason Gray* (painting class)

2) "The Studio" by Terri Witek* (villanelle of portrait studio)

3)  "At the Glass Factory in Cavan Town"by Eavan Boland* (watching a glass =
blower work)

4) "In the Marble Quarry" by James Dickey (marble for public buildings, not=
 sculptures)--full text on poetryfoundation.org

"Language helps us learn novel categories, and it licenses our unusual
ability to operate on an abstract plane, Dr. Lupyan said. The problem is
that after a category has been learned, it can distort the memory of
specific objects, getting between us and the rest of the nonabstract world."
(concluding lines from this article)

"It giveth with one hand, and taketh away with the other," as an abstract
"virtual" world (or "Platonic") world "appears," it causes aspects of the
non-virtual non-abstract, "non-Platonic" world to disappear or become
distorted.  In turn this means that "projections" (as categories, as
defense-mechanisms)--will limit and/or distort the "seeing" of specific
things, creating as it were "blind spots" or "gaps" and "getting between us
and the rest of the nonabstract world."

To control, limit, distort via language the realms of perception becomes an
aesthetics of disappearances and substitutions.
Trained and disciplined by specialized discourses, persons may be developed
into language-thinking beings who are blind to the things they are not meant
to see, or are no longer capable of seeing.  Or, in another way, what
becomes a "taboo" to seeing those things proscribed by language

To fill in the gaps and holes, the blind spots, language produces a
"projection," and becomes a form of  territorialization, "occupation," and
the displacement of persons, things, events by abstractions, labels and
"new" or re-names.

One may even imagine language as a plague of locusts, eating its way through
the visible world and creating in its wake a series of "namings,"
categories, abstract concepts to be imposed on the vanished objects of
perception and imposing a "dictatorship of language" on vanished and/or
distorted "specific things." and so "getting between 'us' and the rest of
the nonabstract world" via abstract categories and/or their attendant
projections, functioning like invisible walls, barriers to a more "open"
understanding by the imposition of "things not there" among things which
are.

http://www.myspace.com/kathyzimmer

Born and raised in rural Nebraska, Kathy grew up singing "wash tub
bass"-style folk music with her family=97think accordions and out-of-tune
farmhouse pianos, plus lots of voices singing harmony at the tops of their
lungs.  She learned guitar at an early age and accompanied herself as she
sang for church services and various small town gigs, including rodeos,
parades, and county fairs.

Kathy attended the University of Nebraska as a music major and quickly fell
in love with the genre of classical art song.  She continued to pursue her
musical development by completing a Master of Music degree at Ohio's
Cleveland Institute of Music.

Absorbing all of these musical influences as well as the sights and sounds
of her newest home, New York City, Kathy now creates music that is
sophisticated and na=EFve, polished and quirky; her sound is at once fresh =
and
new while at the same time vintage and refined.

  **Kristianne Meal

Kristianne Meal retired at an early age to ponder whether language is a
separate entity inhabiting its host body, or a complicated system of
contrived utterances elaborated by mankind in the material age. She has
evolved into a Used Book CEO, Rust Belt Books, Inc., in Buffalo, N.Y. She
has been doing readings and performance art since 1998. Her book TwentyTwo:

Stephen,

You might look at Adrienne Rich's "Poetry: I," in Your Native Land, Your Li=
fe.  Bob Perelman's "The Library," the third in the "Fake Dreams" sequence =
in The Future of Memory.  I'm thinking too of Susan Howe's meditations on t=
he library in The Birth-Mark, and of parts of "Melville's Marginalia," but =
those might be a bit too oblique for the particular context you're describi=
ng.

Peter,

I think the term you're looking for is apo koinu, though in my understandin=
g that's generally used to refer to a clause (rather than a word) that serv=
es a double, forward-looking and backward-looking, grammatical function.  T=
here's various examples in Dickinson.  In "There's a certain slant of light=
":

We can find no scar,
But internal difference,
Where the Meanings, are--

None may teach it, Any--=20

The third line there can be read as referring back to the previous line, as=
 the site where the "internal difference" is occurring, or forward ("none m=
ay teach where the meanings are").

Audre Lorde used to use it a fair bit too.

JUDGE DISMISSES MAIL FRAUD CASE AGAINST BIO-ARTIST KURTZ

Buffalo, NY=97A process that has taken nearly four years may be coming =20=

to an end. On Monday, April 21, Federal Judge Richard J. Arcara ruled =20=

to dismiss the indictment against University at Buffalo Professor of =20
Visual Studies Dr. Steven Kurtz.

In June 2004, Professor Kurtz was charged with two counts of mail =20
fraud and two counts of wire fraud stemming from an exchange of $256 =20
worth of harmless bacteria with Dr. Robert Ferrell, Professor of Human =20=

Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public =20
Health.

Dr. Kurtz planned to use the bacteria in an educational art exhibit =20
about biotechnology with his award-winning art and theater collective, =20=

Critical Art Ensemble.

Professor Kurtz=92 lawyer, Paul Cambria, said that his client was =20
=93pleased and relieved that this ordeal may be coming to an end.=94

The prosecution has the right to appeal this dismissal. How the =20
prosecution will proceed is unknown at this time. If an appeal were =20
undertaken the case would move to the New York Second Circuit Court of =20=

Appeals in New York City.

Lucia Sommer, Coordinator of the CAE Defense Fund, which raises funds =20=

for Kurtz=92 legal defense, said, =93We are all grateful that after =20
reviewing this case, Judge Arcara took appropriate action.=94 She added =20=

that =93this decision is further testament to our original statements =20=

that Dr. Kurtz is completely innocent and never should have been =20
charged in the first place.=94

Barnes) has won numerous awards for its bio-art, including the =20

There are two terms:
Greek apo koinu ("shared," "a sharing," "with sharing" -- not that it t

Liddell and Scott [I describe it and discuss it at some length passim in

Subject: what's this called?

Greetings!

I'm hoping that some one of you can help me identify a
poetic trope.

A good example of it comes in Matthea Harvey's "Pity
the Bathtub Its Forced Embrace of the Human" from her
2000 book with the same title:

"For improvement within try a soap dish that allows
for/ Slippage is inevitable as is difference in the
size of/ The subject may hoard his or her bubbles. .
."

Here two nouns--"slippage" & "the subject"--function
twice grammatically both in the sentences they end &
the sentences they begin.

Is there a name for this simultaneity?  I've been
searching rhetorical tropes & haven't found anything
close yet.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Peter

as the result of a lawsuit initiated by the extreme-right politician K. Ple=

 block its enforcement in order to ensure the protection of freedom of expr=

selection of works by South Asian, East Asian, Middle Eastern, and =
Central Asian poets as well as poets living in the Diaspora. Some, such =
as Bei Dao, Mahmoud Darwish, Michael Ondaatje, and Naomi Shihab Nye are =
acclaimed worldwide, but many more will be new to the reader. The =
collection includes over 400 unique voices - political and apolitical, =
monastic and erotic, established and emerging - that represent a wider =
artistic movement that challenges thousand-year-old traditions, =
broadening our notion of contemporary literature.

Language for a New Century has already attracted the attention of a =
numberof eminent writers and thinkers, including Howard Zinn, Yusef =
Komunyakaa and Nobel Prize winning author Nadine Gordimer, who writes, =
"This extraordinary, library-in-one volume: what a resource! The editors =
have boldly envisaged and compiled a beautiful achievement for world =

  UBUWEB :: Spring 2008
----------------------------

--- RECENT FEATURES ---

Tellus Audio Cassettes (1983-1993)
http://www.ubu.com/sound/tellus.html

UbuWeb is pleased to present the entire run of the legendary New York-based=
 Tellus audio cassette magazine. Originally a subscription-based bimonthly =
publication, the series took full advantage of the popular cassette medium =
to promote cutting edge music, documenting the New York scene and advanced =
US composers of the time. Highlight issues include: All Guitars! (1985), Th=
e Sound of Radio (1985), Just Intonation (1986), Audio By Visual Artists (1=
988), The Voice of Paul Bowles (1989) and Flux Tellus (1990). Featuring hun=
dreds of artists including Marcel Duchamp, Alison Knowles, Sonic Youth, Joa=
n Jonas, George Brecht, Pauline Oliveros, John Zorn, Richard Prince, Glenn =
Branca, Harry Partch and Mike Kelley. Tellus cassettes were edited by Josep=
h Nechvatal, Claudia Gould and Carole Parkinson. This UbuWeb feature is pre=
sented in conjuction with Continuo's Weblog. Produced for UbuWeb by Steve M=
cLaughlin.


Dada Magazine, Issues 1, 2, 3 (1917-1918)
http://www.ubu.com/historical/dada/index.html

Attempting to promulgate Dada ideas throughout Europe, Tristan Tzara launch=
ed the art and literature review Dada. Appearing in July 1917, the first is=
sue of Dada, subtitled Miscellany of Art and Literature, featured contribut=
ions from members of avant-garde groups throughout Europe, including Giorgi=
o de Chirico, Robert Delaunay, and Wassily Kandinsky. Marking the magazine'=
s debut, Tzara wrote in the Zurich Chronicle, "Mysterious creation! Magic R=
evolver! The Dada Movement is Launched." Issue 2 appeared in December of 19=
18. Issue number 3 violated all the rules and conventions in typography and=
 layout and undermined established notions of order and logic. Printed in n=
ewspaper format in both French and German editions, it embodies Dada's cele=
bration of nonsense and chaos with an explosive mixture of manifestos, poet=
ry, and advertisements - all typeset in randomly ordered lettering. Include=
d is Tzara's "Dada Manifesto of 1918," which was read at Meise Hall
 in Zurich on July 23, 1918, and is perhaps the most important of the Dadai=
st manifestos. See also Helmut Herbst's film Deutschland Dada (1969), Hans =
Richter's films and Tristan Tzara's sound poems in UbuWeb Sound which is st=
rewn with historical and rare recordings from dozens of Dadaists.


Dinner With Henry Miller (1979)=20
http://www.ubu.com/film/miller_dinner.html

Dinner With Henry is a rare, 30-minute documentary about Henry Miller. It i=
s exactly what the title implies: footage of Henry having dinner. With him =
at the table is the film crew, and actress/model Brenda Venus, to whom Henr=
y was enamoured in the final years of life. Henry - at age 87 - spends the =
majority of his time speaking on a number of subjects, the most persistent =
of which is Blaise Cendrars. Occasionally, he complains about the food. Tha=
t is all: a curious "slice of life" for any Miller fan who likes to imagine=
 being at the table with him.


David Cronenberg on Andy Warhol (2006)=20
http://www.ubu.com/sound/warhol.html

A guided tour of the "Andy Warhol / Supernova: Stars Death and Disasters, 1=
962-1964" exhibit at the Art Gallery of Ontario, conceived and narrated by =
renowned filmmaker David Cronenberg. Cronenberg says, "Andy was making unde=
rground films when I was making underground films. And I was more inspired =
by him than by Hollywood. He created himself: He was an outsider, a Slovaki=
an, Catholic, gay, an artist, poor; an outsider in his own family, a triple=
 outsider like Kafka, with his nose pressed against the New York window. An=
d, he became the ultimate insider, the center of his own world, and drew pe=
ople to him. He became a huge example of the invention of an identity." Com=
mentary by David Cronenberg, Mary-Lou Green, Dennis Hopper, David Moos, Jam=
es Rosenquist and Amy Taubin.


Sam Taylor-Wood: Video Works (1998 - 2003)=20
http://www.ubu.com/film/tw.html

Sam Taylor-Wood makes photographs and films that examine, through highly ch=
arged scenarios, our shared social and psychological conditions. Taylor-Woo=
d's work examines the split between being and appearance, often placing her=
 human subjects - either singly or in groups - in situations where the line=
 between interior and external sense of self is in conflict. Films here inc=
lude: Brontosaurus (1995), Knackered (1996), Method in Madness (1998), Hyst=
eria (1999), A Little Death (2002), Breach (2001) Mute (2001), Piet=E0 (200=
1), Still Life (2001) and Ascension (2003). Presented in partnership with A=
rt Torrents.


All Avant-Garde All The Time - UbuWeb Podcast #3: The Sound of Aspen Magazi=
ne
http://www.poetryfoundation.org/audio/AspenTheMultimediaMagazineinaBox.mp3

Produced by The Poetry Foundation, UbuWeb is pleased to announce the latest=
 in its podcast series, focusing on Ubu's hidden treasures. This podcast gi=
ves a guided tour of UbuWeb's collection of audio featured on Aspen Magazin=
e: the Multimedia Magazine in a Box, published between 1965 and 1971. Artis=
ts featured include Samuel Beckett, William S. Burroughs, John Cage, John C=
ale and The Velvet Underground, Marcel Duchamp, John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Jack=
son Mac Low, Morton Feldman, Gordon Mumma and Angus Maclise.=20


Alan Licht - Conceptual Soundworks (2003-2004)=20
http://www.ubu.com/sound/licht.html

Four previously unavailable compositions. Includes "Rashomon" where the fil=
m Rashomon by Akira Kurosawa was shown with the sound turned down. The audi=
ence was asked to read the subtitles aloud, together; "Twilight of the Idol=
s," in which the audio levels of Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album are m=
anipulated; and two outtakes from his A New York Minute CD, "Bridget O'Rile=
y," a mashup of Blondie and The Who's "We Won't Get Fooled Again" and "A Ne=
w York Minute," the original uncut version, consisting of a month's worth o=
f weather reports from a New York AM radio station. You can also read three=
 of Alan Licht's conceptual written works [PDF] in UbuWeb's Publishing the =
Unpublishable series.


The Western Round Table on Modern Art (1949)
http://www.ubu.com/historical/wrtma/index.html

Rare proceedings and documentation from this important conference that took=
 place in San Francisco in April of 1949. Participants included Marcel Duch=
amp, Frank Lloyd Wright, Arnold Schoenburg, Mark Tobey, Darius Milhaud, Alf=
red Frankenstein, Gregory Bateson, Kenneth Burke, Robert Goldwater and Andr=
ew C. Richie. Documentation includes over 9 hours of audio tape, transcript=
ions and photographs. Organizer Douglas MacAgy writes, "The object of the R=
ound Table was to bring a representation of the best informed opinion of th=
e time to bear on questions about art today (1949). A set of neat conclusio=
ns, as to the outcome of the conference, was neither expected nor desired. =
Rather, it was hoped that progress would be made in the exposure of hidden =
assumptions, in the uprooting of obsolete ideas, and in the framing of new =
questions." Curated for UbuWeb by Colby Ford.


Five Rare Books From the 1960s by Bern Porter
http://www.ubu.com/historical/porter/porter_5books.html

Several of Porter's books from the 1960s are gathered here on UbuWeb, three=
 of them for the first time anywhere, with an essay by Porter's collaborato=
r and literary executor, Mark Melnicove. Titles include: Aphasia (1961), cu=
t and assembled commercial and soft news language into a found poetry that =
is still original and fresh; Scandinavian Summer (1961), where Porter cut o=
ut pages from Scandinavian, Russian, and American newspaper archives at ran=
dom, bound them together, and called the result a book; 468B Thy Future (19=
66), a book written entirely in computer code; The Wastemaker (1926-1961) w=
here texts are divorced from their sources and disguised in a new tone, not=
 intended by the original author; and Dieresis (1969) where the photographs=
 in the book are the modern equivalents of ancient ideograms, capable of be=
ing read as texts. Melnicove writes in his introduction: "As reproduced her=
e on UbuWeb, you can all but touch the books. What was prohibitively
 expensive almost fifty years ago for Porter -- the full-color reproduction=
 of his pages -- is today's electronic commonplace. You can view his titles=
 as a series of double-page spreads, not so foreign from the experience of =
holding and turning a Bern Porter book with your 'real' hands." See also Po=
rter's UbuWeb Sound page and Porter's page in our Historical section.


All Avant-Garde All The Time - UbuWeb Podcast #2: The World of Outsiders
http://poetryfoundation.org/audio/TheWorldofOutsiders.mp3

Produced by The Poetry Foundation, UbuWeb is pleased to announce the latest=
 in its podcast series, focusing on Ubu's hidden treasures. As the site has=
 grown so large, these occasional audio guides might shed some light on thi=
ngs you may have overlooked, forgotten about or simply never knew about. Th=
is podcast gives a guided tour of UbuWeb's collection of outsider audio. Ar=
tists include Antonin Artaud, Jim Roche, Bern Porter, Francis E. Dec, Benja=
min Weismann and Sean Landers amongst others. You can subscribe to our podc=
ast here.


Julian Schnabel - Every Silver Lining Has A Cloud (1995)
http://www.ubu.com/sound/schnabel.html

With the Oscars just around the corner, it's nice to remind ourselves that =
not everything Julian Schnabel touches turns to gold. This record was made =
between his art star days and his current Hollywood reign with such great p=
layers as Funkadelic keyboardist Bernie Worrell, Golden Palomino drummer An=
ton Fier, and jazz arranger Henry Threadgill, but was universally panned up=
on its release in 1995. As one reviewer put it, "Schnabel can be described =
as a cross between Michael Bolton and Leonard Cohen, but unfortunately he w=
rites songs like Bolton and sings like Cohen instead of the other way aroun=
d... a combination of treacly sentiment, pretentious poesy, tuneless croaki=
ng, and minimalist melodies."

Harun Farocki - Selected Works (1967-2001)
http://www.ubu.com/film/farocki.html
=20
Born in 1944, Farocki has made close to 90 films, including three feature f=
ilms, essay films and documentaries. He has worked in collaboration with ot=
her filmmakers as a scriptwriter, actor and producer. Featured here are ten=
 of Farocki's films: Die Worte Des Vorsitzenden (1967), Inextinguishable Fi=
re (1969), Wie man sieht (As You See) (1986), Leben-BRD [How to Live in the=
 German Federal Republic] (1989), Images Of The World And The Inscription O=
f War (1989), Schnittstelle/interface (1995), Arbeiter verlassen die Fabrik=
 [Workers leaving the Factory] (1995), Stilleben (Still Life) (1997), I Tho=
ught I Was Seeing Convicts (2001) and The Creator of Shopping Worlds (2001)=
. Also featured in Jill Godmilow's What Farocki Taught (1998), a remake of =
Farocki's Inextinguishable Fire. A collaborative film with Helke Sander Bre=
ak the Power of the Manipulators (1967/68) is also featured. You can watch =
a documentary about Farocki Dokumentarisch Arbeiten Modell/Realit=E4t
 - C.H=FCbner im Gespr=E4ch mit H. Farocki (2004). This UbuWeb resource is =
a collaboration with UbuWeb's partner Art Torrents.


Henri Chopin (1922-2008)=20
http://www.ubu.com/sound/chopin.html

UbuWeb mourns the loss of the great pioneer sound poet, who passed away on =
January 3, 2008 at his home in England. You can hear his audio, watch video=
s of him or read his 1967 manifesto "Why I Am The Author of Sound Poetry an=
d Free Poetry." He will be missed.


Publishing the Unpublishable, First Series (001-032)
http://www.ubu.com/ubu/unpub.html
=20
What constitutes an unpublishable work? It could be many things: too long, =
too experimental, too dull; too exciting; it could be a work of juvenilia o=
r a style you've long since discarded; it could be a work that falls far ou=
tside the range of what you're best known for; it could be a guilty pleasur=
e or it could simply be that the world judges it to be awful, but you think=
 it's quite good. We've all got a folder full of things that would otherwis=
e never see the light of day. Invited authors were invited to ponder to tha=
t question. The works found here are their responses, ranging from an 1018-=
page manuscript (unpublishable due to its length) to a volume of romantic h=
igh school poems written by a now-respected innovative poet. The web is a p=
erfect place to test the limits of unpublishability. With no printing, desi=
gn or distribution costs, we are free to explore that which would never hav=
e been feasible, economically and aesthetically. While this exercise
 began as an exploration and provocation, the resultant texts are unusually=
 rich; what we once considered to be our trash may, after all, turn out to =
be our greatest treasure.

Six Videos by Pierre Huyghe (1999-2004)=20
http://www.ubu.com/film/huyghe.html

Pierre Huyghe explores the territory of reality and fiction, creating a sit=
e of convergence for interpretation, representation, and transformation. Hi=
s work incorporates film, objects, and staged events such as celebrations, =
puppet shows, and musicals to address how we construct and translate experi=
ence. Although the final artwork often takes the form of a projected image,=
 Huyghe's primary interest lies in the production of situations. Videos inc=
lude: A Journey That Wasn't (2005), Les Grands Ensembles (2001), One Millio=
n Kingdoms (2001), Streamside Day Follies (2003) and This Is Not A Time For=
 Dreaming (2004). Presented in collaboration with UbuWeb's new partner Art =
Torrents.=20

last week I received FIRE magazine, double issue, nos. 29/30 in the mail.

what an impressive accomplishment by jeremy hilton.

This double issue is the International Issue coming in at a whopping 392
pages!

from the back cover:
Special International Issue featuring Poets and Translators from around the
world.

Daisy Abey (Sri Lanka / UK) , Dawyth Agar (South Africa / UK) , Shafi U.
Ahmed (Bangladesh), Ilse Aichinger (Austria), Muniam Alfaker (Iraq), Nadia
Anjoman (Afghanistan), Eugenio de Andrade (Portugal), Jose Luis Arango
(Colombia), Jean Paul Auxemery (France), Kaifi Azmi (India)...

And those are just the Letter A=B9s!



From the Introduction;

[this issue] its gestation goes back a long way, right back to my early
twenties when the book I carried with me everywhere and found true poetic
delights on many pages was =B3The Penguin Book of Modern Verse Translation=B2,
edited by George Steiner which came out in 1966 when I was 21.

TINY BOOKS OF POETRY FEEDING THE WORLD=E2=80=A6LITERALLY!

Meritage Press (MP) is pleased to announce the first =E2=80=9CTiny Book=E2=
=80=9D release for 2008, following on five releases in 2007.=C2=A0 MP=E2=80=
=99s "Tiny Books" are structured to align poetry with fair trade and economi=
c development issues affecting Third World countries.=C2=A0 The first 2008 r=
elease is

from =E2=80=9CThe Tradition=E2=80=9D=20
by Juliana Spahr

Juliana Spahr is a poet, editor, and scholar. Her most recent book of poetry=
 is This Connection of Everyone with Lungs (University of California, 2005),=
 a collection of poems that she wrote from November 30, 2002 to March 30, 20=
03 that chronicled the buildup to the latest U.Ss invasion of Iraq. Atelos a=
lso recently published the Transformation (2007), a book of prose which tell=
s the story of three people who move between Hawai=E2=80=98i and New York in=
 order to talk about cultural geography, ecology, anticolonialism, queer the=
ory, language politics, the academy, and recent wars.

MP's =E2=80=9CTiny Books=E2=80=9D utilize small books (1 3/4" x 1 3/4") made=
 in Nepal by artisans paid fair wages, as sourced by Baksheesh, a fair trade=
 retailer. Photos of a sample "Tiny Book" are available at http://www.flickr=
.com/photos/lolabola/1618955048/in/photostream/=C2=A0 and http://scorecard.t=
ypepad.com/crag_hills_poetry_score/haynaku/index.html .=C2=A0 An illustrated=
 review by Geof Huth is also available at http://dbqp.blogspot.com/2008/02/o=
ne-2-free-for-5ve-sex-sever-ache.html .=20

All profits from book sales will be donated to Heifer International (http://=
www.heifer.org/), an organization devoted to reducing world hunger by promot=
ing sustainable sources of food and income. This project reflects MP's belie=
f that "Poetry feeds the world" in non-metaphorical ways. The =E2=80=9CTiny=20=
Books=E2=80=9D create demand for fair trade workers' products while also sou=
rcing donations for easing poverty in poorer areas of the world. Note, too,=20=
that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has awarded a $2.5 Million Matching=
 Grant to Heifer, which means every dollar donated (e.g. through "Tiny Books=
") can be doubled!

Each =E2=80=9CTiny Book=E2=80=9D costs $10 plus $1.00 shipping/handling in t=
he U.S. (email us first for non-U.S. orders). To purchase the =E2=80=9CTiny=20=

FUNDAISING UPDATE:
In addition to providing livestock, Heifer International also provides trees=
.=C2=A0 In, 2007, Meritage Press' Tiny Books program sold enough "Tiny Books=
" to finance the donation equivalent of more than seven sets of tree-gifts.=
=C2=A0 Here's what Heifer has to say about trees:

"One of Heifer International=E2=80=99s most important commitments is to care=
 for the earth. We believe development must be sustainable =E2=80=94 that pr=
ojects should be long-term investments in the future of people and the plane=
t.That=E2=80=99s why in addition to livestock, Heifer often provides familie=
s with trees. On a steep Tanzanian hillside, Heifer International helped a f=
amily learn to plant trees and elephant grass to keep the soil in place. Tod=
ay, they have flourishing rows of leucaena trees and corn.Through training,=20=
families learn how to keep their small plots of land healthy and renew the s=
oil for future generations by planting trees, using natural fertilizer, and=20=
limiting grazing.By helping families raise their animals in harmony with nat=
ure, you can fight poverty and hunger while ensuring a healthy, productive f=
uture for us all."

Then of course there are the chickens, goats, water buffalos, pigs, ducks, h=
oneybees, llamas....all of which can help ease hunger around the world.=C2=
=A0 Meritage Press thanks you in advance for your support and hopes you enjo=
y "Tiny Books" -- small enough to become jewelry, but with poems big enough=20=
to resonate worldwide

Dear POETICS List,

I thought some of you might be interested in this interview with Geraldine
Monk, now up at http://volumespoetry.blogspot.com

Here's a taste:

'I don't think of myself as a writer. When I write I'm a writer. When I cook
or garden or play my violin or shop or clean my teeth I'm not a writer. When
I read I'm not a cooking. I'd be quite happy not to call myself anything but
we have to so 'Writer' is necessary for passports, tax forms etc but I tell
my hairdresser I'm a housewife even though I'm not. I think that's why I
prefer to go to the dentist rather than the hairdressers.' Geraldine Monk.


Yours, Colin.

EFFING PRESS is proud to announce the publication of BE SOMEBODY by Lester.=
=20

A handsome, oversized edition with fine printed covers wrapped around 64 pa=
ges of inexplicable poetics. Melts in your mouth and not in your hands.=20

http://www.effingpress.com/lester.htm

LESTER is a ventroloquist's dummy, or call him oracle, or sockpuppet, or wh=
at you will. Don't call him PATRICK HERRON, of Carborro, North Carolina, of=
 Duke University, author of _The American Godwar Complex_  (Blazevox) and f=
ounder of The Carborro Poetry Festival, husband, father of two, righteous f=
ellow, among other honorable mentionables.

Of BE SOMEBODY some bright minds among us have said such things as

[T]he approach of ventriloquism goes one giant step further in the form of =
Lester, sock puppet extraordinaire & alleged author of the booklength manus=
cript, Be Somebody. Lester, obviously, is in the tradition of other wisecra=
cking dummies from Charlie McCarthy to Triumph the Insult Dog, but also Arm=
and Schwerner, Art Language & just possibly the aforementioned Mr. Bernstei=
n & David Antin, &, dare I say, Spicer too falls on this side of the line, =
certainly in Language & Book of Magazine Verse. [...] Be Somebody [...] pok=
es a very hard finger into the chest of Western literary assumptions. [...]=
 Like somebody who understands that what makes Moby Dick great is all that =
stuff about whales, Be Somebody is difficult in the way the very best books=
 are,  it challenges our desire for the familiar (and nothing is more famil=
iar than my pronoun, not even my name) & holds on like a pit bull with lock=
jaw for the entire trip, in this instance 58 pages. [...] Someday, someone =
is going to publish this book & then we will all have to deal with Lester's=
 intimate striptease of the self. Until then, it will remain, like the full=
-length version of Mark Peters. Men . one of the great rumors of contempora=
ry poetry [...] you have to read the book. =20

- Ron Silliman

A few years ago, the unschooled shepherd poet Alberto Caeiro flew into our =
millenium with a rocket pack on his back, calling himself Lester. He spoke =
in the most simple and transparent syllogisms, though only a few (their han=
ds cupped to ears) were present to hear. He landed, he spoke, he fired his =
rockets, shot up, landed over there, spoke, fired his rockets, etc. Then he=
 went away... Thankfully, and somewhat miraculously, his parables have been=
 transcribed by the faithful handful and are gathered here in one place for=
 the first time.

May I suggest that all the hip Flarf poets get down on their knees and urge=
ntly pray.

- Kent Johnson

Lester is a smart-mouth puppet who wants to ruin the sacred truths to fable=
 and old song. Actually, he wants to ruin the fable and old song, too. Are =
we an important poet? Lester seems to want us to think we have no opinions =
on the matter, even the ones he has laid out for us. It's no good hating Le=
ster; this is what we get for asking goat questions and giving sheep answer=
s. Be Somebody raises a serendipitous lake cup atop the strata of radiant s=
team whose luminous degeneracy we have ascertained, and then lets it fall a=
way like a silken robe. This isn't fair. If you see this book on the road, =
kill it. Unless it's already too late, and you're reading this, which means=
 it has somehow found you first, and you have not read this after all, thou=
gh you are rightfully convinced you have. Lester is not Patrick Herron. Thi=
s is not a blurb.=20

Certainly the bookish Borges. I don't have any Borgess in my personal library anymore, but I know that he has either a poem, story or essay that would meet your requirments. And it wouldn't be hard to google.

Subject: Library &/or Art Class poem(s) ??

A request!
I am leading a "Walking & Writing" Class on the University of San Francisco Campus. We have upcoming 'writing' visits in the Library's Rare Book room and a Sculpture workshop. Does one have any 'favorite' work which sites itself in a Library or in an Art Workshop?? (This one is actually for 'sculpture' students).

Some eons ago, frequently lit mags would have a poem (or story) that would take place in a bookshop. (I think those situations between the speaker and the romantic 'sought' among the stacks have been replaced by eHarmony or comparable date making sites! Or maybe the NYRB).  Not to rule out the romantic in any of these situations,  but I welcome any kind of poem with this kind of specific location.  (I often suffer from 'aphasia' when it comes to remembering specific poems)

(I have not read Larkin in a long time, but he must have something of the Library, yes?)
Your suggestions much appreciated.

The Vanderbilt University Writing Studio presents

TEXT + MOVEMENT
a collaboration with Bruce Andrews and Sally Silvers

Friday April 25th
5:00 - 6:00pm CDT
Alumni Hall Ballroom
West End Ave and 23rd Ave, Nashville TN

Andrews is the author of over 30 books of poetry and performance scores and
was co-editor of *L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E* Magazine; he teaches Political Science at
Fordham University. An East Tennessee native, Silvers is a New York-based
dancer and choreographer who has been awarded fellowships with the National
Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.

"Andrews's works often look like successful attempts to transcribe all the
language overheard in a subway car crowded with diverse groups of people."
-- Juliana Spahr, *Everybody's Autonomy: Connective Reading and Collective
Identity*

"Ms. Silvers has been moving to her own drumbeat for 25 years now. Her
dances are often dense and gnomic. But they repay the close attention they
demand with continual small, surprising revelations: some slyly funny, some
tender, and all springing from the unruliest of imaginations." -- Jennifer
Dunning, *New York Times*


*** Also, just added ***

Bruce Andrews joins host Tom Orange
for a special edition of Destination Out!

The Segue Reading Series Presents:

Thomas Fink and Elizabeth Willis

Saturday, April 26, 2008 ** 4PM SHARP**
at the Bowery Poetry Club (308 Bowery, just north of Houston)
$6 admission goes to support the readers

hosted by erica kaufman & Tim Peterson

Thomas Fink is the author of five books of poetry, including Clarity and Ot=
her Poems. He is the author of two books of criticism, most recently A Diff=
erent Sense of Power, and he is the co-editor of Burning Interiors: David S=
hapiro's Poetry and Poetics. His paintings hang in various collections. Fin=
k is Professor of English at CUNY-LaGuardia.

from "Deconstricted Sestina 5"

Dialogue will swerve repeatedly before it survives
patriarchy. Thanks for not smoking inside. I
trust you to profit from any experiment
that respects the survival of those not

yet as fit. Reach into my pocket
and husband what's left. My husband assumes
immortality, but one attentive scribe is becoming
my sole access to recommencing dialogue, into

which labors or equalization should
be poured. My thanks are
colored by suspicion of vested

recollection. Lately, many fund Plato's
experiment; mine could take several

millennia to breed a profit.

Elizabeth Willis' most recent book is Meteoric Flowers. Other works include=
 Turneresque, The Human Abstract, and Second Law. Formerly poet-in-residenc=
e at Mills College, she now teaches at Wesleyan University and lives in cen=
tral Massachusetts.

"Her Mossy Couch"

I stain lengthwise all I touch. The world is so touching, seen this
way, in fleshtones, aggrieved, gleaming as the lights go out, look-
ing into the crease of relativity. We've seen this before, why? Tri-
umph arches over us like bad emotion. We were supposed to feel
more connected to it, we were supposed to feel humanly moved
by imaginary strings. All the words in the world are moving pic-
tures to the dizzy ear, fleas, inadequate deceptions of nocturnal
hair, pushing buttons, pushing papers, pushing pedals up the
long hill. Who could get over the blatant radiance of a name like
Doris Day, throwing your finest features into political relief, a
warehouse in the shadow of apples and streams?=

There has been an awesome silence emanating from 'UB Poetics' since Tuesday,
either there has been a technical glitch or something catastrophic has
befallen the poetic community of the Eastern Seaboard, here's hoping it's

Fishy. Organic. Others are Hip-Hop lettristic in a Kandinskian digital kind
of way. The first one, for instance, after I looked at it a few times, I saw
that it could be construed as initials. My initials. Whereas there was no
such intent on my part. But when you explore curves in a particular space
(the monitor in this case), the curves can quite easily become lettristic;
and then I realized that's one way to look at Hip-Hop lettrism: it is as
much concerned with working the curve through the space in a kind of
generative process of discovery as it is with writing something in
particular.

Happy Birthday to Wm Shakespeareand Thanks!

for the limitless depths & show-of persons--beings-actions-events
& terror & delight that burst the bounds of words
(and esp for Richard Third!)
the observer observing his own shadows and reflections sent to act by his
(Inner) reflections:


("Dive, thoughts, down to my soul--")

causes of murder and war, treachery and deceit--

"Why I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant to my own deformity . . . .

But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass."

" . . . the world is grown so bad
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch."

lays bare the monsters posing as the saviours, protectors, leaders,
murderers who act in twisting words of slaughter into self-defense--
sophistries of the self-righteous

"But then I sigh, and with a piece of Scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil;
And thus I clothe my naked villainy
With odd old ends stolen of holy writ.
And seem a saint when most I play the devil."

shadows that be observed even in dreams--

" . . . Then came wand'ring by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood, and he shrieked aloud--"

"All the world's a stage--"
(the Globe, no less)--
looking at the world on his birthday, one finds an immense drama being
staged--
actors?--or shadows and reflections of actors--reflecting on their
reflections and shadows as being both their roles and their persons playing
at being a player--and behind them all, the actor-playwright-part theatre
owner poet--
Shakespeare of the bounded and unbounded globe

Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi all,

Here's two readings of possible interest to the list.

Celebrate National Poetry Month with the 9th annual Poetry Fest, a free
festival of poetry readings, workshops, performances and discussions, all
under one roof, beginning with a Poetry Wheel, taking place from 10:30-12
noon today in the Video Theatre on the lower level, Harold Washington
Library Center, 400 S. State Street. Charles Simic reads at noon.

Discover new voices, share new work, and see diverse Chicago poetry styles
on display. The Poetry Cram is an open mic event where every attempt will be
made to “cram” as many poets into one performance as possible. Published
poets from several local presses will also read their works, including
myself, reading from I Am Spam (Fractal Edge Press). Advance registration is
recommended at the ChicagoPoetry.com exhibitor table in the Grand Lobby or
in the Lower Level Reception Hall twenty–five minutes before the start of
the program. Each poet will be allowed to read for three minutes or less.

More info: http://www.chipublib.org/events/details/id/6112/

Next Friday is Looptopia. I'm hosting a reading, featuring a dozen
contemporary Chicago poets, revealing a variety of styles, schools,
perspectives, and emotions, beginning at 1:00 AM (actually, May 3rd).
Scheduled readers include Vito Carli, Larry O. Dean, Chris Gallinari, David
Gecic, David Hargarten, Todd Heldt, Rachel Javellana, Wayne Jones, C. J.
Laity, Charlie Newman, Cecilia Pinto, and Bob Rashkow.

Looptopia, the nation's first dusk until dawn artistic celebration,
transforms and illuminates the Loop. Inspired by "White Night" events in
cities like Rome, Paris and Madrid, Looptopia made its wildly successful
debut as the first American event of its kind last year.

Looptopia turns the city on its head Friday, May 2 as the Loop is
transformed into a sensory playground celebrating arts, culture,
architecture and insomniacs alike. This all night extravaganza paints the
Loop as an urban wonderland - it's trippy, it's ethereal & it's all Chicago.
300 artists. 100 venues. 14 hours. More than 100,000 people. A night you'll
never forget.

For more information, please see http://www.looptopia.com/index.php

Hope some of you can make it out to one or both of these events.

Best,
Larry

There are a few openings left for:

Writing Experiments Workshop
Dodie Bellamy

My summer workshop will meet 11 Tuesday evenings, from 7 to 10 p.m.
The dates:  May 20 through August 29.  No class:  June 3 & 10, July
8, August 19.  Cost: $350, with a $100 deposit due by May 13.

Most weeks students will be assigned a short take-home writing
experiment which they will share with the class the following week.
Assignments will range from cut ups to exploring bodily sensations.
Assignments are geared towards the class dynamic, so they may
eventually drop away or they may continue for the duration of the
class.

Each week we will also critique longer pieces by two to five
students.  Students may bring in anything they want (up to 20 pages)
for the longer critiques.  Depending on the length, these longer
pieces will be read aloud in class or handed out a week ahead of
time.  Though this class will have a prose focus, it is cross-genre,
and poets are welcome.  The class is limited to 10 students.  Lots
and lots of personal attention.  It takes place in San Francisco, in
my South of Market apartment, which comes complete with snacks and
cats.

This is a good class for poets wanting to play around with narrative
or prose writers wanting to open up their prose.

About me:  Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and
memoiresque essays, was published in 2004 by San Francisco's Suspect
Thoughts Press.  My vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was
reprinted by University of Wisconsin Press, also in 2004. Academonia,
a book of essays was published by Krupskaya in 2006.  I'm the author
of 3 other books and I teach creative writing at SF State, CCA and
Antioch Los Angeles.  I've also taught at CalArts, Naropa summer
session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute. I've
received the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the
Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc.  Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them.  If you're interested do contact me promptly.
Preference given to those not currently enrolled in a grad writing
program.

Jenn McCreary lives in Philadelphia where she co-edits ixnay press & works
for the Mural Arts Program.  Her new collection, :ab ovo:, is now available
from Dusie Press. Rachel Blau DuPlessis writes about :ab ovo:  "from the
beginning-an articulate, touching, moving work about the experience of
pregnancy and motherhood-from the lyric quiverings to the reality check;
from the image-filled meditations to the swamped ATTY-tude; from the
fondness for the idea of parenthood to the gritty, witty actuality. Trying
to account for all the changes after those two dots, twin dots (that colon,
and more) are put into play, the work arcs from magical yearning to an even
more magical reality. A book of awe and charm from the inside out."

Monica Fauble has a MA in English and Poetics from the University of Maine.
She is currently interested in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Brenda Coultas is the author of* The Marvelous Bones of Time,* and,* A
Handmade Museum,* (both from Coffee House Press) An Indiana native, Coultas
now lives in New York where she is on the faculty at Touro College and
teaches in the Bowery Poetry Club's Study Abroad on the Bowery program. A
2006 New York Foundation for the Arts Fellow, Coultas has also served as
series curator at the Poetry Project and as a frequent instructor at Naropa
University's Summer Writing Program.

 It looks or is a double punch week for Aram Saroyan and Ugly Duckling Press with both the WCW Award via Ron Silliman and the National attention in NYT's Book Review (actually, a smart, readable review not saturated with the usual dose of saccharine 'placation' & platitude pillars that appear to justify, apologize for and/or anchor most of NYT's poetry reviews - as if poetry as a practice, etc. were - at best - on some national and desperate form of 'life support.' ).

 It's interesting "as one who was there" to see the current plethora of attention to late 60's and early '70's lit and political phenomena. Yesterday a lovely Centurion birthday recollection of George Oppen at the SF Public Library - one among many - and most of the conversation revolved around Oppen as a towering 'elder' figure in the Bay Area of the time; next Saturday Phillip Whalen.

 Suspect some of this just the natural re-coup and memory of a generation now looking back (or being looked back upon) and giving account to what was then, and what has been realized from those roots - whether NY School, Beats, Minimalism, Pop, etc.

 Curious, as I Sunday morning ramble here, to revisit the Saroyan making of poems that were practically blips but seemed then so much on target  - the kind of authenticity that one could hear in "cricket / cricket" that so stood out in such a singular away against the War, the political rhetorics, that could, for example. drive Senator Jesse Helms into a tirade against the NEA, etc.  As Ron S pointed out, as well, Clark Coolidge's & Grenier's focus - that sense of the specific was entirely refreshing .
 Yet, curious, the way Saroyan lost interesting in sustaining the exploration - going in the direction of narrative, oddly celebrating the work of Rod McKuen at one point. Maybe he found it just hard to go that minimal 'edge' and sustain it or expand it to live within a larger horizon (say in the way of Walter Demaria's singular poles multiplied out in the Lightning Field.

already acclaimed as modern classics--such as Erin Mour=E9's O =
Cidad=E1n, Lisa Robertson's Debbie: An Epic, and Karen Mac Cormack's =
Implexures--to the equally remarkable work of Susan Clark, Catriona =
Strang, Lissa Wolsak, Christine Stewart, Deanna Ferguson, Lise Downe, =
Nancy Shaw, a. rawlings, Marie Annharte Baker and others. The essays are =
complemented by brief selections of poems, interviews and poetics =
statements.=20

David,

Yesterday I was at The Film Forum in New York, where Standard Operating
Procedure is being shown. I chose to see Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly, and an
companion United Artists movie whose title escapes me now which I even liked
better than the Aldrich movie. It looks like I made the right choice.

It looks like in Erroll Morris's movie Abu Grab has gone Hollywood and, even
worse, art movie. It reminds me of Celan's question, is poetry possible
after Auschwitz? The aestheticizing of unspeakable horror always implies to
me that the maker considers himself/herself more important than his/her
material, a dogma crucial to modernism (Picasso's "this is not a fish, this
is a painting"). A question: how "this is not a fish, this is a painting" is
different from another dogma, "art for art's sake"?

At the end of Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly, the woman fatale opens up the oddly
archaic looking leather insulated box with buckle straps (almost like a
valise from Westchester, an incredible visual detail) and opens the
radio-active magma and her body catches fire, an amazing fusion of Aldrich's
apocalyptic and Film Noire's misogynistic instincts. Wow! Still, the
juiciest bit in the movie for me is Mike Hammer's secretary, with whom,
contrary to Film Noire tradition, Hammer has sexual relations, tells Hammer
in a moment of anger that he should keep away from the window because
"someone may blow him a kiss."

Ciao,

Murat

The true world


"true," "world" without capitalization, small, backgrounding. "true world"
without - connectivity, a tiny, almost insignificant phrase, completion
phase emptying itself out.

the true world is skeining, inscribing, quantum, cohering, inhering; the
true world is image imaginary; the true world is aggregative, confluence;
the true world is emptiness unemptied; the true world is emanent, real
virtual, virtual real; the true world is unreading, is scribbling, is
inscribing under erasure; the true world is the immensity of the true
world; the true world is deferring; the true world is always, is always
already; the true world is catastrophe theory catastrophic; the true world
is analog abject, fissured, indiscrete, analog intrusions, discrete extru-
sions; the true world is imaginary carapace; the true world is neither
this nor that, not both this and that; the true world is unaccountable,
unaccounted-for, of no account; the true world the true world the true
world.

This panel will provide context for and insight into the work of the artist=
s performing throughout the Poet=E2=80=99s Theater festival. Panelists will=
 examine such questions as: What is Poet's Theater, and is it its own genre=
, a hybrid genre, or a way of resisting genres? How have poetry and perform=
ance influenced one another over the past century? How does the idea of Poe=

Collapsible Poetics Theater=20
Reminiscent of Commedia Dell'Arte in its traveling, portable, rapid-set up =
qualities, this performance assembles itself within a given 72 hour period =
of each performance. Working with resident poets, experienced actors, non-a=
ctors, the persistent question asked by the performers is, Can the poem be =
tested any further?

A collaboratively written and performed melodrama, Wild West show, politica=
l thriller, pageant, and farce. With song, dance, projections, sound effect=
s, and mimicry of preposterous acts, visions and revisions of characters, m=
edia, genres and events will change, interrupt, and harmonize with each oth=
er. =20

Louis Zukofsky's Rudens and Fiona Templeton=E2=80=99s Bluebeard (excerpt)
Templeton directs two plays: Rudens is a very seldom performed work, based =
on The Rope by the Roman comic playwright T. Maccius Plautus. It combines a=
 number of strategies of textual conversion, and is translated to English p=
honetically by using the sound of the original language.  Bluebeard is abou=
t two people imagining how each other think, what each other fears or desir=
es, and what each fears or desires of the other. It is a ventriloquial work=
, in which the onstage action or even speaker may belie the subject of the =
speech.

*PROGRAM FOUR: Carla Harryman
Collaborators:  Pam Osbey, Jennifer Scappettone, David Trinidad=20
Friday & Saturday, May 23 & 24, 8pm
Sunday, May 25, 7pm

Five New Works
Carla Harryman is known for her genre-disrupting prose, poetry, and perform=
ance works. Recent performance works have emphasized polyvocal text, biling=
ualism, choral speaking voices, and music improvisation. This program infus=
es improvisational electronic sound, choral and sound-based performance wri=
ting, and Poet=E2=80=99s Theater in five new works: Sue, Adorno=E2=80=99s N=
oise, and Mirror Play by Carla Harryman, Bad History by Barrett Watten, and=

Greetings,

Boog City is once again looking for a small press to pinch-hit in our "d.=
a.
levy lives: celebrating the renegade press" series here in nyc for a pres=
s
that unfortunately had to bow out last minute. The event is on Tues. May=20=

27, 2008 at 6:00 p.m.

Below this note is our invite letter, which spells everything out.

Please backchannel any inquiries or suggestions.

Thanks,
David

Hi,
=20
David Kirschenbaum here. I'm the editor and publisher of Boog City, a New=

York City-based small press and community newspaper now in its 17th year.=

I'd like to invite your press to be considered to take part in year five =
of
our "d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press" series.

The series is held at Chelsea's ACA Galleries (http://acagalleries.com/),=

which is owned by the son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik.
It's a nice space, and we fit 100 people, including a nine-piece jazz fla=
sh
orchestra, in it for Chax Press's event, with plenty of room to spare. Th=
e
gallery provides wine and other beverages, and cheese and crackers and
hummus and chips.

Once a month I have a different non-NYC press host and feature three or m=
ore
of their authors to read (we've had as many as 10 for one press and usual=
ly
have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a musical act perform two 15=
-20
minute sets. If the visiting press is able to book a musical act that's
preferred, so it's truly their night, if not I can book one that I think
will work well with the night. (Also, once a year we play host to our NYC=

brethren.)

The series is held on the last Tuesday of each month, with the open date
being Tues. May 27, 2008.

We started the series in August 2003. In our first four-plus seasons we'v=
e
hosted (or will host by season's end in July):

Early this year, Shanghai Century Publishing of Beijing, China, published
Selected Poems of Post-Beat Poets, which I edited. The poems were translated
into Chinese by Wen Chu-an, Limin Lei and Zhang Ziqing. The anthology
includes work by:





Lawrence Carradini

Steve Dalachinsky

Enid Dame

Jack Foley

           Vernon Frazer

Kirpal Gordon

           Bob Holman

Schuyler Hoffman

Mikhail Horowitz


Arthur Winfield Knight

Kit Knight

Donald Lev

Lyn Lifshin

Dan Nielsen

Michael Rothenberg

Leslye Layne Russell

Ravi Shankar

Meg Smith

Cheryl A. Townsend

Janine Pommy Vega

Anne Waldman

Barry Wallenstein

Don Webb



I'm especially pleased, since this marks my first publication by a large
publisher. However, American readers who might be interested in reading the
anthology won't be able to, unless they can read Chinese. I'm hoping to find
a U.S. publisher interested in publishing the manuscript in English and will
entertain suggestions from readers and editors. Please feel free to
backchannel. If I don't find a publisher, I'll probably bring the book out
as a print-on-demand, but I don't have a timetable as yet.

and a much-deserving topic...

Antiphonies is a primer on some of the most exciting work in =
contemporary Canadian poetry. These essays deal with the period from the =
1980s to the present, and discuss a wide range of work, from books =
already acclaimed as modern classics - such as Erin Mour=E9's O =
Cidad=E1n, Lisa Robertson's Debbie: An Epic, and Karen Mac Cormack's =
Implexures - to the equally remarkable work of Susan Clark, Catriona =
Strang, Lissa Wolsak, Christine Stewart, Deanna Ferguson, Lise Downe, =
Nancy Shaw, a. rawlings, Marie Annharte Baker and others. The essays are =
complemented by brief selections of poems and poetics statements.

Join us for an exciting Festival first -- a program of literary short films and documentaries curated by Ram Devineni and copresented by Rattapallax. The roster of films includes an animated version of Sylvia Plath's classic poem "Mirror Talk," Sherman Alexie's "49?," a tribute to writer/composer Paul Bowles, selections of literary films from Brazilian musician and poet Arnaldo Antunes, and interpretations of Gertrude Stein poems by hip-hop artists Jean Grae and DJ Spooky. The evening will conclude with a screening of Antonello Faretta's "Nine Poems in Basilicata" and an onstage conversation between Faretta and the subject of the film, Beat poet John Giorno, who was also the subject of Andy Warhol's 1963 film Sleep.

Tuesday, April 29, 2008 from 6-9pm at Goethe-Institut, 1014 Fifth Ave., New York City. FREE. [ more info ]

Sponsored by Rattapallax and PEN World Voices: The New York Festival of International Literature. This event was funded in part by Experimental Television Center, New York State Council on the Arts, and Poets & Writers, Inc. through public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.

PEN WORLD VOICES is a festival of international literature featuring 170 writers, 51 countries, and 82 events coming to venues across New York City, April 29-May 4th, 2008. Don't miss six days of exciting literary exchange with conversations, panel discussions, readings, film screenings, a translation slam and a cabaret night! For a complete schedule of events, go to: http://www.pen.org/festival

John Giorno's book You Got to Burn to Shine, poems, and deeply personal memoirs include stories of his relationship with Andy Warhol (Giorno was the star of Warhol's first film, Sleep, in 1963), of being a Tibetan Buddhist, and of his understanding of death in the age of AIDS. Giorno Poetry Systems, begun in 1965, innovated the use of technology in poetry, working with electronic and multimedia, creating new venues, and connecting poetry with new audiences.

Antonello Faretta is a photographer, director, and film producer who has collaborated with such directors as Abbas Kiarostami, Marco Bellocchio, Saverio Costanzo, and Babak Payami. He has directed numerous films, including Lei lo Sa, Da Dove Vengono le Storie?, Silenced Thoughts, and Just Say NO to Family Values. In 2004, he founded the Atelier del Cinema di Potenza and the Potenza International Film Festival, which he also directs, and for which, in 2006, he received the prestigious Targa per Meriti Culturali from the Italian President, Giorgio Napolitano.

Matana Roberts Solo Works for Sean Bell
Please note: This performance will take place at the Clemente Soto Velez
LES Gallery at 107 Suffolk Street.
Matana Roberts – Alto Saxophone, spoken words


Matana (mah-tah-nah) Roberts is a dynamic saxophonist, composer and
improviser, who tries to expose in her music the mystical roots and
spiritual traditions of African American creative expression.  Inspired
by the solo ruminations of Anthony Braxton, Roscoe Mitchell, Evan Parker
and Steve Lacy, Brooklyn based altoist Matana Roberts extends this
lineage by exploring soundscapes dedicated to the memory of a senseless
life lost in the somewhat conflicted city she now calls home.


"Matana Roberts, a fearless and charismatic Chicago-born saxophonist who
can reconcile all sorts of saxophone languages" - Ben Ratliff, NY Times


"Matana is definitely nondescriptive. She's not a lady, she's not a man;
she's just a being…" - Jazz Times


"She has become an eloquent, dramatic tone-warping free-jazz artist,
right out of Ayler's anti-bebop tradition." - London Guardian


"A lyrical spiritual essence that recalls the voices of reed players
Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, Eric Dolphy, and others—one of profound
soulfulness, passion and purity. Yet the embodiment of Roberts is devoid
of mimicry or pretense, because she possesses her own identity..." - All
About Jazz

LINKS HALL PRESENTS
Returning from  One Place to Another: A Poet=92s Theater Showcase
Curated by John Beer, Links Hall Artistic Associate
May 2-25, 2008

The works featured in Returning from  One Place to Another come out of a
tradition which seeks to use theatrical space as a medium for poetic
composition. While this description fits some major figures of the
theatrical avant-garde, such as Antonin Artaud or Richard Foreman, the
artists that are central to this work view the theater as an extension of=

their writing practice. Drawing inspiration from the operas of Gertrude
Stein or the plays of Frank O=92Hara, each program consists of a set of w=
orks
for performance that retain a focus on language and structure while
potentially abandoning traditional elements of narrative or staging. In e=
ach
program, a visiting artist is working with local collaborators for the fi=
rst
time to create a novel theatrical evening.
=20
It=92s only recently that the idea of a Poet=92s Theater could be anythin=
g but
redundant. What, after all, were Sophocles, Shakespeare, or Moliere up to=
?
The last two hundred years saw a divorce between primarily realistic mode=
s
of theater and a lyric poetry rooted in subjective experience.  The work
presented here seeks a reconciliation that creates new possibilities for
both poetry and performance. =96 John Beer, Curator
=20
ABOUT THE CURATOR
John Beer=92s poems and essays have appeared in numerous periodicals,
including  Barrow Street , the Canary, Chicago Review, the Chicago Tribun=
e,
Crowd, the Hat, Milk, MiPoesias, the Review of Contemporary Fiction, and
Verse.  He has written about theater for the Brooklyn Rail, Newcity, Time=

Out Chicago, and the Village Voice.  He is a Ph.D. candidate in philosoph=
y
and social thought at the  University of  Chicago .

rid
genre, or a way of resisting genres? How have poetry and performance
influenced one another over the past century? How does the idea of Poet's=

Theater relate to larger questions about the avant-garde? What is the fut=
ure
for Poet's Theater? The panel will include poets, performers, and critics=

Louis Zukofsky's Rudens and Fiona Templeton=92s Bluebeard (excerpt)
Templeton directs two plays: Rudens is a very seldom performed work, base=

on The Rope by the Roman comic playwright T. Maccius Plautus. It combines=
 a
number of strategies of textual conversion, and is translated to English
phonetically by using the sound of the original language.
Bluebeard is about two people imagining how each other think, what each
other fears or desires, and what each fears or desires of the other. It i=
s a
ventriloquial work, in which the onstage action or even speaker may belie=

the subject of the speech.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Content-Disposition: inline

I'm sorry that so many people have written me here on the List, and in
private (including Diane DiPrima) about my post, and that I haven't been
able to respond.  The couple of posts I smacked up here since were with
coffee shop computers while I was waiting for my computer to be fixed.  Now
it's finally fixed.

Yes.  Yes to all the conversation.  And let me add too that my biggest
problem with this war in Iraq is that there really is NOT enough Real Time
in our lives for it.

ENDING this war should be a priority, but it's not.  ENDING this war needs
awake beings, but we're not, at least not always.  I'm NOT always!  I feel
the NOT feeling it!  I FEEL THAT, you know what I mean?  And when I DO
remember the war, it smarts!  I cannot, WE CANNOT escape what we continue to
do!

I was born January 1st, 1966.  Eleven days after I was born president
Johnson said in his State of the Union Address, "Yet, finally, war is always
the same. It is young men dying in the fullness of their promise. It is
trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to
hate...therefore, to know war is to know that there is still madness in this
world."

To all you having babies right now, the MANY THOUSANDS OF YOU, your babies
are born while your country, our country, is at war.  Will you tell them
that?  Will you tell them what year of the occupation they were born into?
"You were born in the 5th year of our occupation honey.  See the map?  This
country, called Iraq, it belonged to us, and the oil was the best in the
world."

I'm so sick of this war.  I don't mean as a complaining kind of sick, I
mean, I feel sick, sick with it, helpless NOT TO VOMIT with it!  Yet there
is little we can do to stop it.  For years, from the beginning, FROM BEFORE
the invasion even, marches, protests, miles and miles of it.  Amy Goodman
shot footage of police SLAMMING young women and men's heads into the
sidewalks of NY, DC, Philadelphia, and every other city in this country.
Unarmed except for our signs, and words.

Call me a literalist when wanting to discuss IMAGINATION, whatever, I'm
still exhausted some days, despite you, me, the war is exhausting.  But as
exhausting as it is for me I have NO IDEA what horrors the innocent people
of Iraq endure, every, single, day of their lives.

We'll never be able to make it up to them.  So much suffering, a web of
suffering, the wounded, the dying, the survivors of the dead.  Homeless,
jobless, hungry.  They didn't deserve this.  They didn't deserve what we
did, and continue to do.

I hope when it's over they BLAME us, ALL OF US, for not stopping it, BLAME
US for paying our taxes like the cowards we are!  FUCK expecting congress to
stop funding the war, WE PAY OUR TAXES, we allow it all to happen!  We're
the worst people alive some days!  I'm disgusted with us!  What pigs we have
turned out to be!

I wish the European nations would bring sanctions against us.  I wish all
the nations of the world would unite against us and stop all trade with us,
freeze us out.  Make us pull out.  Throw us out.  SOMETHING!
