stephen,

what you are describing, poems that include
text and image or images containing words, letters,
text is usually known as visual poetry or vis-po
if you must.

see craig hills' site, scorecard, he is doing an issue
on ekphrasis poetry. its a clunky word, i don't like
it all and the two art forms feel very different to me.

Anybody with an interest in ekphrastic literature might enjoy taking a look
at my mini-anthology, Painting with Words, where I've paired some ekphrastic
works with images of the artworks that inspired them:

http://www.people.virginia.edu/~djr4r/anthology.html

It's really just a little sampler, not a proper anthology, tho it may become
one someday. Oh, and the poet Jan Theuninck recently sent me a link to a
nice page of "Kunst en Gedichten" from the Netherlands:

You are cordially invited
to a performance demonstration of
Carla Harryman's *Mirror Play*

Sunday, August 14, 3:00 PM
Susanne Hilberry Gallery
700 Livernois (north of 8 Mile)
Ferndale, Michigan

The piece will be rehearsed for six days and presented as a performance
demonstration with choral speaking voices and music. The performance is
free and open to the public, as are open rehearsals on August 10, 11, 12,
13, from 10:30 to 1:30 PM at the gallery.

www.performingobjects.com/mp

*****

*Mirror Play* is a performance collaboration between San Francisco Bay Area
and Metro Detroit musicians and performers, with music by Jon Olson (Wolf
Eyes, Detroit) and Jon Raskin (Rova, San Francisco) on jaw harps,
electronics, and saxophones; and performances by Abbas Bazzi, Mary Byrnes,
Elana Elyce, Walonda Lewis (Detroit), and Roham Shaikhani (San Francisco).
Directed by Jim Cave (San Francisco) in collaboration with Carla Harryman,
Jon Raskin, John Olson and the ensemble, in consultation with Michael Peter
(sound design, Detroit) and Danielle Aubert (visual design, Detroit).

Both farce and lament, *Mirror Play* imagines that all of us can fit into
one room and that we can all come and go from this room: the door is always
open. In the environs of this sound and language experiment, the room
mysteriously has been cut away from the rest of the house. Sometimes some
of us wonder about or look for the rest of the house and find ourselves in
a tomb . . .

from The Foundation for Contemporary Performing Arts (New York).

INFRAPICS, Xerolage's 35th issue, presents twenty-five visual poems by
Irving Weiss, a self-proclaimed "postmodern avant la lettre cultural
composite." Weiss's verbo-visual INFRAPICS are a variety of textual
and visual poems, detourned cartoons and drawings, each hemmed by a
black frame. The resulting visuo-semantic spaces between content,
frame, and title in these pieces calls for a close reading into
Weiss's ideas on proximity. In "I/T" we see an imposing frame
squeezing the title (or reckless content?) out of the poem at large,
letter-by-letter. Another piece plays off the formal conventions of
the crossword puzzle to engender for a title the list of Across/Down
hints that correspond to the puzzle's empty content. Some of the
INFRAPICS are pictographic puns and redundancies while others disorder
the supposed purpose of framing and naming by placing both
conventional title-language AND lettriste fragments in the space of
the title-function via the blade of the frame's cutting. What emerges
in reading Weiss's INFRAPICS is not merely language or images that
emphasize their verbo-visuality but rather a bird's eye meta-visual, a
theoretic play of schism-gap-and-presence, a seeming lightness that
serves as transparency of depth. Check it out. - jUStin!katKO

"Infrapics ultimately derive from the presentation of any image, icon,
or text with identifying or explanatory words. Historically, the
infrapic goes back to the emblem poem of the 16th century whose text
referred to the picture above it. More immediately, the infrapic is my
version of the modern single-panel cartoon or news photograph with
legend (now called caption), quote, explanation, or identification
below. I keep to the basic form of the single panel but the content or
relation of content to form may be inverted, subverted or involuted.
In addition, I consider the infrapic to be a visual poem in the way
light verse or parody in verse is a poem." - Irving Weiss,
introduction to INFRAPICS, Xerolage 35

most say the first ekphrastic poem is not about a painting, but about a
Greek shield

there are many visual poems which are not mixes of painting and words,
like my powerpoint poems in their page incarnation, "In Medias Res" in
DaDaDa - there are loads of others, including David Byre's (later!) I
love powerpoint... I imagine art school bands calling themselves "The
Beatles" and "Talking Heads"....

the visual OuLiPonians have all sorts of names

while there are a great many visual artists using words as a medium -
Claudine Dixon at the UCLA Hammer has curated quite a lot of them, but
she's totally unaware of artists coming from the "words" side -
something my long-discontinued reading series there was an attempt to
cure; there is a "writerly" quality to many writers' visual art, and
vice versa, but these qualities aren't generally well-named critically

the "Legendary" section of Da3 has quite a few poems about female visual
artists, and many of them are about individual artworks by those
artists, although many are also collages of biographical and critical
material as well

All best,
Catherine Daly

Thanks for this, Catherine. (I think you mean, "David Byrne", right? He's
got an interesting blog, too.)
An interesting turn on the artist approach to the use of language in their
work - versus poets such as yourself letting their work emerge and take form
within the limits and possibilities of pictorial space(s) - is the work of
Richard Tuttle. Which does nor use words as material at all for the most
part, but - either as sculpture or drawing - is amazingly 'writerly.' I just
saw his retrospective at San Francisco's MOMA yesterday and - if interested
- my 'review' is posted up on my blog.
Similar to Tuttle I think many improvisatory jazz musicians are often quite
'writerly' as well. I probably have neither the time nor the full critical
smarts to say what distinguishes the character of marks (whether they be by
artist or musician) that makes those marks 'writerly' and different from
other kinds of artistic expression and/or objects given to structural design
and/or use. Say in the way one looks at a Joseph Albers and does not
associate it with scripture of any sort except its color and tone. Or a
Noguchi sculpture. Where the work is essentially responding to the history
and vocabulary of its own medium.

I think ekphrasis is a very useful term, because it illuminates the problem of
description/depiction -- how words create pictures and pictures create words, especially in how to
communicate the beauty/meaning/presence etc. of what is seen to someone who isn't there to see it.

Perhaps one of the greatest "ekphrastic" poems has to be Neruda's Canto
General which--as Hugo Mendez-Ramirez competently argues, in the (amply
illustrated) Neruda's Ekphrastic Experience: Mural Art and Canto
General--can be read as inspired by and modeled after the midcentury work of
the great Mexican muralists (Rivera, Siquieros, Orozco).  It is a big mural
of the Americas . . . in words.

Call For Submissions: Partner Abuse in Activist Communities Zine

Have you experienced partner abuse/ domestic violence within an
activist community? Want to break the silence and change our
communities forever? The Revolution Starts At Home Collective is
creating a zine to break the long-held silence about partner abuse in
activist communities, building on the groundbreaking work of INCITE/
Women of Color Against Violence.

We are a collective of Asian and South Asian activists and writers,
women and genderqueer, who believe that it's time to create
communities that are true safe zones, where abusers are held
accountable and survivors can live without fear.

Many conscious folks believe that abuse "doesn't happen here", that
people who are fighting oppression just don't hit their partners. But
unfortunately, abusers do live and work inside our communities. Even
more unfortunately, too many times survivors aren't believed or
listened to, and are left to struggle on our own to figure out how to
be safe, especially when we feel that going to the cops isn't an
option.

 >From prison justice to trans/genderqueer circles, from hiphop / spoken
word scenes to queer women of color land to disability culture: what
have your experiences been like?  Were you able to successfully kick
an abuser out of your group? Was your abusive girlfriend's best friend
working on the DV hotline? Did your anti-police brutality group fear
retaliation if you went to the cops? Was the "healing circle" a bunch
of bullshit?

We want to hear about what worked and what didn't, what you learned,
what you wish folks had done, what you never want to have happen
again. We want to hear about folks' experiences confronting abusers,
both by using the cops and courts and by using methods outside the
criminal justice system. We want to hear from everyone, but we are
prioritizing the stories of people of color and Native folks, queer
and trans folks, disabled folks, and stories from many generations.

Please send submissions and a short bio both attached and cut and
pasted to revolutionathome@riseup.net by October 15, 2005. Writing,
poems, visual artwork, sticker designs and stencils are welcome.
Please include contact info: name, email and print address. We promise
your words will be held in confidence. Anonymous contributions and
those using a pseudonym are fine, but please include a name we can
reach you under. Both survivors and supporters are welcome to
contribute.

Peace,

new BOOKS from FLOOD EDITIONS [http://www.floodeditions.com/]


Merrill Gilfillan, Undanceable

With exuberance and economy, Merrill Gilfillan's Undanceable evokes the
landscape of the American West through the geographic word. Place names, the
texture of speech, and a certain aroma of nature permeate these pages.
Ever alert to unforeseen connections, Gilfillan follows both eye and ear,
his poems unfolding at the pace of consciousness.

A faint breeze

in the old swallow dens. A man
mounts a mare. And the roughlegs,
maculate riders, imperial

boreal tilt
and tack, wiser than owls,
drift disdainfully south.

--


Ronald Johnson, Radi os

First published in 1977, Ronald Johnson's Radi os revises the first four
books of Paradise Lost by excising words, discovering a modern and visionary
poem within the seventeenth-century text. As the author explains, "To etch
is 'to cut away,' and each page, as in Blake's concept of a book, is a
single picture." With God and Satan crossed out, Radi os reduces Milton's
Baroque poem to elemental forces. In this retelling of the Fall, song
precipitates from chaos, sight from fire: "in the shape / as of / above the
/ rose / through / rose / rising / the radiant sun."

In his afterword, Guy Davenport comments: "Radi os is a meditation, first of
all, on grace. It finds in Milton's poems those clusters of words which were
originally a molecular intuition of the complex harmony of nature whereby
eyesight loops back to its source in the sun, the earth, the tree, our
cousin animals, the spiralling galaxies, and mysteriously to the inhuman
black of empty space."


--

Jennifer Moxley, Often Capital

First published as two separate chapbooks in 1995 and 1996, Often Capital
explores the tensions between political commitment and personal desire.
Moxley draws in part on the love letters of the Polish radical Rosa
Luxemburg in searching out a habitable space for resistance. As she writes
in an afterword to this volume, "In my researches I mistook my title, Often
Capital - a banal dictionary designation - as a description of, to use
William Godwin's phrase, 'things as they are.' Yes, often capital I thought,
but thankfully not always."

Moxley employs techniques of collage and juxtaposition as well as narration
to sound her subject. Yet the lean, sonorous lines that result leap out of
any categorical dichotomies: "our imagined finish line / is the end of
reason, the irresistible tantalization / of presence, lips pressed together
open / to eat..."

Dear Poetics List,

Peek inside the book and sample the sounds of Jonathan Skinner's =
Political Cactus Poems at
www.palmpress.org

and then buy the book!

From the website: "Little Dictionary of Sounds: poems written as echoes =
to recorded sounds, embedded as media (QuickTime) files in this PDF. =
Open in Acrobat 6 and click on the title of each poem to hear the =
echoing sound."

It's fun.=20

Here's what Robert Grenier had to say about the experience:

"This is Very Good (that's WHY I used it when I taught at Mills, his =
Little Dictionary Of Sounds--I played the Tape Of The Sounds & GAVE THEM =
THE POEMS he had written!--I didn't have to TEACH!!) -- 'VOCABULARY' + =
'STUDY' (somehow) Evidences THE WORLD AT LARGE in ManyWritten =
Poems--BRAVO!!"

If you're interested in receiving review copies, please write to us at =
presspalm@hotmail.org

Enjoy! (And feel free to forward this invitation far and wide.)

Subject:      Re: Ekphrasis
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

I spent some time thinking about ekphrasis a few years back and have
remained ambivalent about it ever since.  I=B9m glad to hear that Crag Hill
and others are attempting to recast it.

An important feature of ekphrasis over the centuries has been the way it=B9s
allowed the so-called visual and verbal arts to be compared and,
consequently, valued for their different, but supposedly complementary
capabilities.  This seems benign until you consider a secondary effect of
such comparisons: a reinforcement of the categories and hierarchies of art
that have largely been in place since the Renaissance.

Ekphrasis allows Lessing to argue in Laokoon, for example, that "poetry
equals art in the description of beauty in an [...] important way: it
transforms beauty into attraction.  Attraction is beauty in motion [...].
The painter can leave movement only guessed at; indeed his figures are
without movement [...].  But in poetry, it remains what it is: a transitory
beauty that we want to see repeated.  It comes and goes; and there we can b=
e
reminded of movement all the more easily and with more liveliness than bare
forms or colors: so attraction must put us in touch with the same condition=
s
more strongly than beauty."

This argument benefits poetry, since it argues for poetry=B9s superiority ove=
r
other arts, but I think it also arrests poetry=B9s development.  It suggests
that poetry should stick to what it does well and not venture into "beauty"
or the domains of other aesthetic categories.  If you think that poetry
should be given a wider reign, it=B9s not clear that ekphrasis, as the term
has traditionally been used, advances the cause of poetry.  If ekphrasis
becomes a synonym for a type of visual poetry, the problem=B9s solved.

INTERACTIVE FUTURES 06: Audio Visions
Victoria Independent Film and Video Festival - http://www.vifvf.com
Co-sponsored by Open Space Artist-Run Centre - http://www.openspace.ca
Parallel event – Digital Art Weeks, Summer 2006, Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology – http://www.jg.inf.ethz.ch/Group/Front
Conference hotel - Laurel Point Inn - http://www.laurelpoint.com
Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, Thurs Jan. 26 - Sun. Jan. 29, 2006.

CALL FOR PAPERS, PANELS, PERFORMANCES, & INSTALLATIONS

INTERACTIVE FUTURES is a forum for showing recent tendencies in new media
art as well as a conference for exploring issues related to technology. The
theme of this year's event is Audio Visions. IF06 will explore new forms of
audio-based media art from a diverse body of artists, theorists, and sound
practitioners. Sound poetry, web-based audio and multimedia, mobile audio
performance, new forms of music theatre, synaesthetic performance, hybrid
forms, sound-based installation, video and sound, and environmental sound
are all of interest to Audio Visions.

The proliferation of audio technologies, audio-visual collaboration, and
hybrid forms of live performance in the new millennium is striking. Audio
artists are exploring the areas of mobility, virtuality, performance, and
audience interaction from an experimental point-of-view. Audio Visions
invites scholars, sound-artists, and performers of all stripes to submit
paper, panel, performance or installation proposals in one of the three
following categories.

1. "Sound and Vision" lecture and panel series - Scholars, artists, and
practitioners working in audio or audio-visual-based new media are
encouraged to submit proposals for IF06. We are interested in a broad range
of audio including: computational, interactive or generative audio; the
creation of digital audio tools; synchronization between sound and visuals;
performative art that explores language, voice and body; streaming radio and
mobile sound works. Presentations should be, in part, demonstrative. We
recognize that sound art is evolving and that categories have become
increasingly irrelevant - we encourage proposals that push the boundaries of
the traditional conference paper.

2. "Earshot" performance series – "Earshot" is seeking experimental
audio-based performances that challenge assumptions about audio forms and
performance conventions. Avant-garde, post-avant-garde, techno,
electro-acoustic, synaesthetic production, liminal art and hybrid
performance are all within our desired range. "Earshot" is primarily
interested in new types of electronic audio-visual performance as well as
models for audience participation in sound works. "Earshot" will run
performances at Open Space for each night of IF06.

3. "Tangible Frequencies" installations – We are interested in audio
installation works that consider site, space, vision, volume and perception
and how physical location 'matters' to the reception of audio frequencies.
IF06 has identified areas within Open Space Gallery to function as
controlled locations for sound installations.* We welcome proposals that
respond to the particular characteristics of these locations through their
acknowledgement of private and/or public space and use. Installations may
provide audio continuity to the existing locations, or respond as
intervention and critique.

INTERACTIVE FUTURES is part of the Victoria Independent Film and Video
Festival and applicants are encouraged to check the Festival website for
more information on the broader program.

I enjoy Big Bridge very much and hadn't visited for awhile.  When I did --
both yesterday and today -- I found this message:  "This site has been

Buffalo, NY

WHAT:  Low-budget mag made very regularly out of materials "acquired"=20
entirely from workplace.

DUE:     September 15, 2005 (but continuing on for as long as we can gather=
=20
materials, hoping eventually to make a nice yearbook based on the results=20
of the gathering of these materials.

Here is the call for our New Magazine WIG:

PLEASE SEND WORK!
_________________________________________________________

W A N T E D :
Do you write on the job?
Are you worried about
getting caught?  Does
your worry about get-
ting caught affect the
form of your writing?
Does your job affect
your poetry=92s content?
Has poetry, on your
job, influenced your
job, your coworkers,
or even your field?
Have you used your
poetic sense to imple-
ment changes in the
workplace, labor rel-
ations, etc.? Have you
ever chosen a job be-
cause you knew you
would get good poetry
out of it?  Would you
consider employing
your present job for a
poetic good?

In 1930, in the New Masses, Michael Gold proposed the following:

"...that every writer in the group attach himself to one of the=20
industries.  That he spend the next few years in and out of this industry,=
=20
studying it from every angle, making himself an expert in it, so that when=
=20
he writes of it he will write like an insider, not like a bourgeois=20
intellectual observer."

Though we have no proposed =93group=94 in mind, nor any fixed idea what this=
=20
project might yield, we find Gold=92s basic idea as compelling today as it=
=20
must have been then.  Rather than necessarily =93studying=94 work, however,=
 we=20
encourage poets to re-appropriate work as an engine of poetic=20
in(ter)vention.  We are not necessarily motivating people toward any=20
particular political end (though we don=92t, of course, rule that out); nor=
=20
do we ask poets to address work necessarily in a Marxian framework, if=20
perchance you should have other inclinations.  We simply hope to =93exploit,=
=94=20
or rather mobilize, the poetic labor of what Gold terms insiders.  Is it=20
time to think of our selves as secret agents?  We are happy to let you=20
decide for yourself the form your assignment takes.

WANTED, Have you
considered working as
a collections agent at,
say, the Harry Fox
Agency, busting kids
& rappers for fair use
of music samples?
Are you interested in
doing poetic research
on the music industry
as it fights to cling to
its money-base as
(ostensibly) a bunch
of teenagers work to
circumvent their efforts?
Do you believe one is
implicated in the larger,
indirect, moral and ethi-
cal effects of what one
does for a living?  Can
poetic intervention sub-
vert that?

In Acts of Resistance: Against the Tyranny of the Market, Pierre Bourdieu,=
=20
speaking of what he calls =93the insecurity-inducing strategies=94 of=20
transnational corporations, argues that we must reframe our demands=20
regarding labor.  We must =93break away from the logic of past struggles,=94=
 he=20
writes, =93which, being based on the demand for work and for better pay for=
=20
work, trap [us] within work and within the exploitation (or flexploitation)=
=20
which accompanies it=94 (86).  Darwin believed flexibility in the face of=20
chance and constant change was the key to survival. How can we, through=20
poetic actions, bend the laboring society to our own needs, so that we=20
survive not only as poets but as citizens?  How can poetry help us rethink=
=20
work=92s place in our society and our lives?

During the 1930s, writers like Gold made an effort to put poetry and the=20
workplace in dialogue.  We often hear comparisons made today between the=20
presidency of Herbert Hoover and George W. Bush.  Not since Hoover has a=20
president had a worse job creation record.  How might we translate Gold=92s=
=20
revolutionary ambitions to our current postindustrial, panoptic milieu? Can=
=20
the formal inventiveness of poetry help us re-think work?  We find=20
antecedents in the writings of Williams and Stevens, Reznikoff and=20
Niedecker, and more recently Kit Robinson, Rodrigo Toscano, and Juliana=20
Spahr, to name but a few.  As poets, how do we respond at the daily level=20
to the globalization of what Hannah Arendt calls =93the laboring society=94?

Wanted, Operations.
Are you plugged into a
system that works on
your brain all day as if
you are typing and re-
sponding to the same
codes over and over?
Do you some-times feel
as if your job is nothing
but "filling out forms"?
How does this effect
the wiring of your brain?
How does this effect
your writing? Can making
non-sense words out of
the codes exercise the
brain in opposition to
fixity? If you have ex-
perienced relief through
non-sense, please call.

Another venue where the worker-writer faces many challenges, making open=20
poetic interventions to the assumed work-place discourse every day, is in=20
Academic English Departments!  Ever since Plato kicked the worker-writers=20
out of the city, contemporary writers have faced a range of difficulties in=
=20
attempting to employ their historically well-honed abilities to=20
teach.  When Plato said =93Poets have ideas like an aviary has birds,=94 he=
=20
wasn=92t putting down their poetry; he was attempting to discredit them in=
=20
their positions as instructors.  Before Plato, all poets were teachers; it=
=20
was their role and it was revered.  More than that, poets had recognized=20
authority to weave traditional, familiar pieces of the community=92s=
 language=20
with events and questions of the contemporary.  This made poets not merely=
=20
transmitters of tradition, but powerful analysts of the=20
contemporary.  Plato tried to end the authority of the contemporary.

These Platonic forms of writing, like taking the same photograph over and=20
over in homage of the first photograph, make all other images of writing=20
=93outside=94 (see:  outskirts of republic).  All language becomes=20

=20
to get published in =93juried journals.=94  =93Juried journals=94 refers to=
 a major=20
obstacle in landing adequate compensation for teaching.  As a=20
worker-writer, have you submitted to juried journals?  If you have been=20
rejected, what reasons were you given?  [My experience=AD=93lacks and=
 argument=94=20
every time.]  Have the =93forms=94 the academy requires you to =93fill out=

become a patenting of the very process of thinking?  As worker-writers of=20
the contemporary, how can we intervene in this?

We are soliciting only new work.  Submissions can come in whatever form you=

situation.  Submissions may come in many possible forms:  1) poems created=

Since I have gotten a few concerned calls this morning, I want to let
everyone know that I am not, "Steven Vincent", the free-lance journalist
(and I believe once an art reviewer & critic) who was killed yesterday in
Iraq. Formally, I am a "Stephen". This morning I am writing safely under the
cool protective summer fog in San Francisco.
Ironically, in terms of names, my politics on the war in Iraq - were 180
degrees in the opposite direction from Steven Vincent.
Rest his soul,

I'm really intrigued by the visual element in poetry and by the interaction of the visual (and performing) arts in conjunction/collaboration with poetry. Cole Swensen had a great essay in the special feature of American Letters & Commentary #13 (2001), "To Writewithize," where she says that "word and image are working at 'right angles.' They're conceptually perpendicular to each other, and thereby set up a kind of three-dimensionality: we see two dimensions and think three. Another way to state this is to say that the mental and physical worlds do not match; we're forced to undergo two different interpretive practices simultaneously, and their degree of off-set sets up a reverberation. Energy arcs over that gap, and it's practically audible. And it requires an adaptation if not of our senes, at least of our perceptive capacity. In this way, it's the art that's working on us."

While my first instinct is to want there to be a productive, mutually-exploring/-expanding--you might even say erotic--relation between the visual and literary texts, which I think also precisely produces a "third dimemsion," I think this "right angle" relation gets equally (or more so) to the strictly ethical in poetry and art (if the erotic ad ethical can even be "srictly" demarcAted...). Maybe? If poetry works on our openness to Otherness at all (which I sometimes like to think it does to keep myself from feeling like a totally self-indulgent ass for embarking on a life-long project of writing and reading and teaching it), does the interaction of seemingly unrelated visual and literary texts open that space? Swensen mentions Berssenbrugge's Spericity as one example I recall offhand, and I would also add Lyn Hejinian and Emily Clark's The Lake and their The Traveler and the Hill; and the Hill. Or Barbara Guest and Laurie Reid's Symbiosis. The relation between the art and th
e words
 in these works have so far seemed wholly opaque to me and, in some cases, the art "simply decorative" (if that's legitimate category...). Looking again at the Swensen essay, I want to go back and try to better see them, to see this third dimension. I wonder, though, if that space can arise out of the mere co-presence of the two parts, or whether there has to be some point of "sameness" for there to be any relation at all? Maybe this just forces you to look harder to find it? Or demands that you suspend your need to recuperate the radically Other into your field of reference/relation, even if only provisionally? What's the relation of two people stuck in an elevator overnight who don't speak a word of one another's language? Is that even a remotely apt analogy?

At any rate, the Swensen article is interesting for me, but, as she goes on to elide the difference between visual poetry (e.g. Drucker) and even visual artists who incorporate text into their work, placing them all under a revised and broadened definition of the word ekphrasis, it doesn't answer the question of whether ekphrasis only applies to written responses to other art forms (I would include performing arts, as well, personally) or to all intersections of visual and verbal. For my two cents, I feel that ekphrasis should retain a narrower use; it feels as though there's a different process or stake involved in a writer responding to a visual text irrespective of the artist, on the one hand, and two artists working in conjunction/collaboration/collusion/collision on the the other. Maybe this is not always true. Maybe some art and poetry books are simply ekphrastic works (in the narrower, traditional sense) that include images of the artwork, which themselves happen to be
 by a
 living artist. I suppose the next question would be whether you could tell the difference as a reader-viewer and what, then, the implications are for this issue. The one thing I feel totally comfortable asserting is that, at the limit, the discrete divisions and individual integrity of all such categories erode and even dissipate altogether.

The question of the function of this "third dimension"--and whether or not poetry can create this on its own--I find much more interesting. So please respond with your thoughts, as I'm newly thinking through this (and giving three weeks of my freshman poetry workshop, which I'm teaching for the first time in the fall, to exploring its various aspects).

Thanks, and all best,

Ward Tietz <tietz@MDO.NET> wrote:
I spent some time thinking about ekphrasis a few years back and have
remained ambivalent about it ever since. I¹m glad to hear that Crag Hill
and others are attempting to recast it.

An important feature of ekphrasis over the centuries has been the way it¹s
allowed the so-called visual and verbal arts to be compared and,
consequently, valued for their different, but supposedly complementary
capabilities. This seems benign until you consider a secondary effect of
such comparisons: a reinforcement of the categories and hierarchies of art
that have largely been in place since the Renaissance.

Ekphrasis allows Lessing to argue in Laokoon, for example, that "poetry
equals art in the description of beauty in an [...] important way: it
transforms beauty into attraction. Attraction is beauty in motion [...].
The painter can leave movement only guessed at; indeed his figures are
without movement [...]. But in poetry, it remains what it is: a transitory
beauty that we want to see repeated. It comes and goes; and there we can be
reminded of movement all the more easily and with more liveliness than bare
forms or colors: so attraction must put us in touch with the same conditions
more strongly than beauty."

This argument benefits poetry, since it argues for poetry¹s superiority over
other arts, but I think it also arrests poetry¹s development. It suggests
that poetry should stick to what it does well and not venture into "beauty"
or the domains of other aesthetic categories. If you think that poetry
should be given a wider reign, it¹s not clear that ekphrasis, as the term
has traditionally been used, advances the cause of poetry. If ekphrasis
becomes a synonym for a type of visual poetry, the problem¹s solved.

Ward Tietz


There's the mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding.

Would anyone be interested (or knows anyone who would) in interviewing the Irish poet Medbh McGuckian for The Argotist Online? She has agreed to the interview but the original interviewer has had to pull.

About the writers:

Eileen Myles has been living in SD for three years, teaching writing at
UCSD. She is a part time New Yorker as well. Her most recent books are
Skies and on my way, both poetry, 2001 and Cool for You, a novel, 2000.
Lately she's been working on a new book of poems and a novel, The
Inferno, as well as getting ready for a extended run of Hell, an opera
composed by Michael Webster for which she wrote the libretto.



Alistair McCartney's writing has appeared in numerous journals and
anthologies, including Fence, The James White Review, Wonderlands (U.W.
Press), Aroused (ed. Karen Finley), Mirage #4 Periodical (eds. Dodie
Bellamy and Kevin Killian) and others. His first book, an experimental
novel-encyclopedia called The End of the World Book is forthcoming from
the University of Wisconsin Press (06-07). He received his MFA from
Antioch University LA, where he now teaches creative writing and
literature as adjunct faculty in the BA Program. Originally from
Australia, he has lived in Los Angeles for the past ten years with his
partner Tim Miller.



Christopher Russell is an artist and writer who lives and works in Los
Angeles. He publishes Bedwetter magazine and has spoken about his work
at a number of universities and art colleges. Christopher's visual work
has appeared in several American and European exhibitions, including
solo shows at the Van Harrison Gallery in Chicago and Acuna Hansen in
Los Angeles. He was included in the Harper Collins photo book,Voyeur,
read his fiction at the UCLA Hammer Museum and has been collected by the
RISD Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. He currently
has work on display at Cirrus Gallery in Los Angeles, and a book of
subversive photographs titled Landscape will be available in the fall of
2006.



Alene Terzian was born in Beirut, Lebanon but was forced to leave her
homeland due to war. She immigrated to Canada where her parents owned
and operated a gourmet restaurant; thankfully, they impressed upon her
the art of cooking. However, no matter how hard she tries, her chicken
is never as good as her father's. In 1984, she moved to California where
she received an M.A. and an M.F.A. in creative writing. Currently, she
is an Associate Professor of English at College of the Canyons. She
recently published her first collection of poems called Deep as City's
Ache which focuses on the cultural pull of Beirut and the devastating
effects of war on both humanity and the natural environment. Her poems
have appeared in The Northridge Review, From the Web, and Nerve. She
resides in Pasadena, California.

Telling Them Apart, my second collection of poetry, is available as a free
e-book at http://www.lulu.com/content/146768 . The theme focuses on the
mystical and the heart of engaging in the world of the unseen.

Thanks.

When I looked in the New York Times today and saw a picture of the journalist Stephen Vincent who died in Iraq, I realized that I knew this man!  He lived on the same street where I live in New York City.  I also remembered him from art gallery openings years ago.  I used to work in co-op art galleries and would see him at the openings.  Anyway, not long ago I ran into him in a store called Superior Copy where I went to get my copies because they gave me free copies if I read them a new poem of mine.  The day in question, Mr. Vincent or his wife, I'm not sure which though I think it was him, was saying how he couldn't wait to go back to Iraq.  Apparently, if I remember correctly, people were trying to talk him out of his determination, apparently without success.  I never knew his name.  He was someone I noticed in the neighborhood, however, because I remembered him from the art world.  I'm sorry nobody succeeded in dissuading him from his recent objective, however, since it
lead to
 his untimely death.  For what it's worth, Superior Copy closed down for lack of business, which they blamed on the post-9/11 business slowdown.  So here I am at a computer where I can make my own copies.  But no copy can be made of Steven Vincent, however, even though there is a poet who shares the same name.  Regards, Tom Savage

They is wrong! The man who was killed penned his name as "Steven".

Historically, I have never looked at when or where "ph" could become a "v".
My own "Stephen" was, perhaps, related to the fact that part of my mother's
lineage is Swedish - so, "Steph" was a more prevalent sound and name. I
don't think my parents - though educated -  were thinking of "Stephen
Vincent Benet", a poet, still popular in the forties, who was actually born
in the San Francisco Bay Area.
But, in this age of the Internet search, unless one has "Search"
sophistication, someone looking for me is often confronted with an endless
number of URL's connected to work by Stephen Vincent Benet! (There is also a
gay folk singer of my name, a soil scientist, and, an actually very good,
affordable "Stephen Vincent" series of wines - particular the Merlot, which
I enjoy bringing to poet parties; albeit I would be the last person in the
world to own a winery - I think folks enjoy the confusion or, is it,
"fusion"!

As to Mr. Google and the late "Steven Vincent" my blog received about 4,500
hits yesterday. That's a lot of people looking for a dead body, I think. I
was tempted to exploit the situation - other than saying "I was not killed
in Iraq today" - I thought of using Photoshop to create an image of myself
lying naked and dead with fresh poems sticking out of my ribs suggesting to
visitors that they might slowly partake of the poems. Talk about "gothic
narcissism"! - I let go of that possibility. In fact I did not feel
comfortable at all about opportunistically taking advantage of the
situation.

But, I must say, it has been very weird to be confused with somebody now
dead - particularly a person identified once with the arts as a reviewer,
and, as a journalist for the National Review, among others, and writing from
a conservative position in support of the war in Iraq - one totally contrary
to my own. And the way his identity and my own gets twisted together through
the engines of the Internet. Bizarre.

Who knows - on a positive note - maybe some of those visitors stuck around
to read my blog and engage my own commentary on the war, poetry, and the
arts.

HN, I can only assume the G. Bush, D. Cheney, D. Rumsfeld, A. Gonzales, G.
Miller and their colleagues have regular sessions with their equally radical
Jihadist counterparts during which they celebrate their opposing and
mutually devastating "accomplishments". At meetings, anytime, and it's
frequent, that anybody says the word "transgressive" they all stand up and
shout with joy. These sessions, I understand, are called "blood fondlers"
and "torture ticklers." Unfortunately Dante was born to early too encage and
visualize the meeting practices and locate them down in one the very low
levels of Hell.  But Harry, I am sure you can imagine the boys at work. I
frankly do not know if Condi Rice shows up - whip in hand - and plays the
grand piano to help rev things up.

HN - I am sorry - I am sure you are aware of this information and I am sorry
that it has to fill both of us with terror. May each of us plot and do
something to make the world a little better today.

Be well,

Ian,
Please consider the following for your call:

__________________________________________
Geclyft
consumed on this barren cleft
this chink
this fault
this trust of balance
on this cantilevered equilibrium
this howling detritovore
our species bloomed
the discarded of us
our heterotrophes
exponentially bloomed
flushed the heat of
our discarded our cleft
our splayed and broken
our beheaded our disemboweled
our raped our tortured
our layers
yes again
our layers


_________________________________________________

Permission
ryder at the stern yearning
chugging the atlantic steamer
moon stabbing brushed cumulous
vertically developed aggregate
states of water
crystal vapor ache
gazing outward
siegfried the aesthetic
right in front of everyone
desire of swiftly placing hands on the railing
one quite elegant movement
necktie forming a question mark
over the shoulder
both heels together
over the edge
into the ocean
hearts craning
for the last look eddy
airlock waterlung
cumulous moon churn
in broad daylight
rushing to the pinioned stern
cirrus as if it were a liaison
of rhine maidens
rail to the wind
then at the staten island ferry stern
unlike him not to leave something

Subscriptions: $25/1 year.

Please note that as of August 1, 2005 the subscription rate will be increased
by five dollars. This reflects the additional cost of my latest endeavor: CARVE
Editions, a line of chapbooks featuring the kinds of poets you would expect to
see in CARVE. Current plans are to replace the fall issue of the magazine with
two of these chapbooks, beginning this year with two offerings from CARVE
contributors: Jess Mynes' birds for example, and Christopher Rizzo's Zing. Each
chapbook will cost $5 and be available through the usual channels. I'm very
excited about this new development, and look forward to bringing you these
excellent poems by these excellent poets.

Jim-- One of the interests in moving from site on the street to my own site
in digital space is to complement any "set in stone" qualities of the
piece, to release it into the virtual. (A good urban site that does this
here is Lowell Boileau's *Fabulous Ruins of Detroit*). But this seems, as
well, the task of the site-specific artist--to de-monumentalize (in that
the form of the monument--religious, historical, or necrological--is going
to be an element of any site-specific work). The relation of the work to
the site is where the play of perspectives might develop. Here, the street
itself was doing its work--particularly in the form of a very aggressive
meter tender who had everyone on the street scurrying for their quarters
and trying to figure out the new, high-tech ticket dispenser. At another
hour there might be theater-goes passing over the plaques without noticing,
as I've mentioned. And there are time-based amendments to the "set in
stone" quality, particularly the Berkeley Public Works Department, who
seemed to be digging up the street almost everywhere (what looked like
graffiti was in fact their markings for pipes, cables, or what not). That
said, I wondered if the plaques themselves would last more than ten to
twenty years. Like Smithson's Spiral Jetty, they may need a future moment
of recovery. In any event, it does feel like a live, and potential if not
virtual, installation.

I just wanted to add that the wording on that missive is not my own: I
merely forwarded text from the NION (Not In Our Name) call to action.

I'm not sure I like the address of it, either (nor have I considered much of
the rather strident NION rhetoric to be particularly effective), but "our"
would presume too much as well--not everyone on this list is a U.S. citizen.
Though perhaps this is simply a call to U.S. citizens, or at least to the
so-called "coalition of the willing."

And, yes, of course I'd agree (how could I not) that our so-called
"environment" may be the greatest casualty of the "war on terror"; while the
human price is terrible, and forever, from the standpoint of each
individual, the long-term damage is being wrought as we speak--in a series
of upper-court rollbacks of environmental protections put in place over the
past thirty years.  (Indeed, this is the truest sense in which the "world"
CAN'T wait three, even one, more year.)  Not to speak of carte blanche for
biocidal military construction and operations like active sonar or the
militarization of space, in the name of "national security."  Or general
indifference and acceleration of a suicidal pattern of consumption, as the
global warming needle dips into the red.  And along with this, the
privatization of basic resources such as clean water, clean air, arable soil
and (most insidious of all) genetic heritage.

But I thought the following sentence, in some respects, covers this:

"Your government suppresses the science that doesn't fit its religious,
political and economic agenda, forcing present and future generations to pay
a terrible price."

More generally, I am interested in the hypothetical question: *what if*
everyone--anyone--disgusted by the overt criminality of the current
administration (or just afraid of what the future holds in store for their
children) simply left work, or their blog or whatever they are doing, and
went into the streets on a given day . . . and refused to return to work, or
their blog or whatever they normally do, until *some kind* of national
debate began to form about the validity of continuing in the current
fashion.

(*Of course* covert criminality of U.S. gov't goes way back: the point being
that, for once, offenses are so patent there might be broader support than
usual for this sort of work strike.)

*What if* everyone--anyone--disgusted by the overt criminality of the
current administration (or just afraid of what the future holds in store for
their children) stopped paying war taxes?

*What if* everyone--anyone--disgusted by the overt criminality of the
current administration (or just afraid of what the future holds in store for
their children) refused to drive or buy more gas until the price went *up*?
Far enough to reflect the real costs (say, at least $6 a gallon) . . .

Or, to shift focus beyond the U.S., *what if* every--any--Londoner joined
together, across the Muslim-Christian and brown to white spectrum, and
marched into the streets to say enough is enough! no more bombs, no more
shots to the head.

But perhaps the collective everyone--anyone--no longer exists . . . perhaps,
in the face of a lack of assurance of strength in numbers, the isolated
everyone--anyone--would rather stay home, and safe, for the short term, and
read about, and blog on, the current rise to fascism (or whatever you want
to call the new authoritarianism).

Happy (60th) Hiroshima Day . . .

Actually, attention to my blog - which has now brought over 6,000 visits in
the last three days (on account of the misidentification of my name with
that of the Steven Vincent, the journalist assassinated in Iraq) - has
caused me to re-acknowledge my life as a journalist in opposition to the War
in Iraq. Ironically, unlike my own position as a journalist, my
understanding  is that "Steven Vincent" was very much an early enthusiast,
indeed a journalistic crusader for the Neocon aim to remove Saddam Hussein
and instantly democratize Iraq - though, I believe his recent accounts were
beginning to adjust his views into a more realistic focus.

Consequently - besieged as my blog is by strangers looking for the remains
of a dead man  - and where I am still very much against the War, even more
so, in view of the grief it has given so many - to serve these folks I am
currently using the blog to revive pieces from the morgue of the Gothics
News Service. Currently, pieces include:

Viet Nam Memorial Wrapped in Protest
Tony Blair and George Bush - New Site Sculpture Work Planned for Salt Lake
Burning Man Festival Site in Protest Ritual

(If you are interested in process, these pieces, by the way, were built as
contemporary re-creations of the work and process of various site-specific
sculptors).

In the spirit of poetry - where the news stays news - I have given the
pieces current dates of appearance. I mean, on one level or another, I
believe they do they remain true!

As always, you remain welcome to visit.

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS - THRESHOLDS 31 - 'EPHEMERA'

thresholds, the bi-annual critical journal of architecture, art and media
culture of the department of architecture at MIT invites submissions for
issue 31 'ephemera'

DUE:   31 October 2005
(please see details for submissions below)


THRESHOLDS 31 - 'EPHEMERA'

We have accelerated into an age in which information is as fleeting as our
response to it, and the capacity for its processing the new world currency.
The relevance of the moment has become eclipsed by that of its own passage,
and absolute position has become an easy sacrifice for the velocity on
offer.  We have been at last swept by the flux of our times into a time
defined by its own flux.  Time has become both the axis and the function.

thresholds 31 seeks to explore this condition through identifying,
suggesting, tracing and questioning the notion of ephemera* through time and
cultural relevance.  What role does ephemera play within current cultural
practice and thought?  What are its historical traces and its cultural
import?  What are the projects in which it has become manifest –
deliberately, or not – and why?  Are we longing for a future or a past, or
neither?

Contributions from all fields including, but not limited to, scholarly works
are welcome. thresholds 31 will be the first issue to accept both text and
time-based media submissions.  Time-based media submissions might include
but are not limited to, video, sound, animation, etc. and will be published
in digital format.

*  ephemera, n., transf. and fig. One who or something which has a
transitory existence. [Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition 1989]

Hello POETICS
aome people don;t hate 'timeless age' and gave me praises which were too=20
much for me. if
someone feels pleasure when read 'timeless age', and if the one reads the
whole text contains timeless age, i bet he would feel far much pleasure. my
works are not so good, but let's say 'timeless age' is a good work, then th=
e
whole text would be much better.
yet, timeless age is the only part that is translated. would someone
translated 'the last of text' (which is written in korean) into english? i
would be grateful for him.

Howdy Vacation House Goers,

THE SUMMER IS ALMOST OVER.  Leases are coming up on rentals in the
Hamptons, and for pleibians like you and me, the time has come for
the
final installment of the best reading series in NYC that has *ever*
operated on five days lead time.

If the good lord's willing and the creeks don't rise, this will be
our
wildest show yet.  Here's a wee taste from the poets/performers
themselves:

"Tim and Jack will be reading from their recent collaborations which
are kind
of post-Foucauldian wallflower-meets-gaybar anamorphoses. Jack will
also be
reading from his new project, Geoffrey Hell."

That's right folks.  We're don't know either, and that's why we're
so
excited.  But seriously, Tim and Jack are great poets, so come for
Nick and Alex's last poetic happy hour.  Details and bios below:


WHEN: This Tuesday 8/9 @ 6 pm
WHERE: Bowery Poetry Club on Bowery between Bleeker and Houston
WHAT: Poetry and 2/1 drinks like you've never seen
MOMENT OF ZEN: "Victory light is deregulated/So's sex pez"--Jordan
Davis

BIOS:

Jack Kimball is publisher of Faux Press books and the
fauxpress.com/e
series. He writes on poetics at <pantaloons.blogspot.com>, and has
critical
pieces in Sagetrieb, Jacket, Verse, and the Poetry Project
Newsletter for
which he now reports on Boston-area poetry events. His books in
print
include Frosted from Potes and Poets and Art in America from
Portable Press
at Yo Yo Labs.

Tim Peterson, now beginning to learn the regional argot since moving
to New
York, has a first book forthcoming from Chax Press this fall. He
edits
EOAGH: A Journal of the Arts (the next issue of which will feature a
tribute
to Jackson Mac Low) and is guest-editor for a forthcoming issue of
Leonardo
Electronic Almanac devoted to "New Media Poetry and Poetics." His
poetry and
criticism have appeared or are forthcoming in Antennae, artsMEDIA,
The
Poker, Transgender Tapestry, Five Fingers Review, Harvard Review,
and VeRT

composed by Alex Young, c/o Nick Bredie

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Hi Matthew,

You don't know me but I actually know some of your work via your sister who teaches at the University of the Pacific-Stockton. I met her a couple of years ago when I was out visiting a colleague/friend who also teaches at the UOP-Stockton. Congratulations too on editing the new CR.

Thanks Rodney, this is just kiddingm, not writings.
 N
 someone says to me bellow :
 (p.s. -- I don't think it's a good idea to send poems to the Poetics
List. They recently started a policy of " no poems" -- just
announcements and discussion... although your poems were kind of
crazy and interesting, you might get in trouble for posting them
there.)
=20
 so I can;t keep posting here.
 N did you read my another works? in www.xqqqx.com <http://www.xqqqx.com/>
Timeless age is my 'only' works, only translates works. it;s my Ideal.
   anyway, thanks

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Poetics list,

I've begun a blog-esque production whose primary emphasis will be on
minimalist concrete poetry. I'm not so much interested in a succinct
effective definition of it as making a sort of Poincare map that plots
areas where it might be. Not so much interested in nailing it down as
tying a string to it and tossing up and running and seeing if it
flies.

The most current entry one I'm willing to "launch" with, and is an
overview of a good portion of work by the poet endwar (Andrew Russ),
some of which certainly is minimalist concrete poetry, some of which
may not be, all of which I found something delightful breathing
inside.

Lastly, I invite anyone with anything even remotely related (but still
somehow related) to the concept of minimalist concrete poetry to
contact me for possible inclusion, coverage, review, reference,
etc. Please also forward this invitation to anyone you think who might
be interested.

Enjoy,
Dan

Your = Our...
by default or otherwise.

Gerald S.

Your government, on the basis of outrageous lies, is waging a murderous and
utterly illegitimate war in Iraq, with other countries in their sights.

Your government is openly torturing people, and justifying it.

Your government puts people in jail on the merest suspicion, refusing them
lawyers, and either holding them indefinitely or deporting them in the dead
of night

Your government is moving each day closer to a theocracy, where a narrow
and hateful brand of Christian fundamentalism will rule.

Your government suppresses the science that doesn¹t fit its religious,
political and economic agenda, forcing present and future generations to pay
a terrible price.

Your government is moving to deny women here, and all over the world, the
right to birth control and abortion.

Your government enforces a culture of greed, bigotry, intolerance and
ignorance.

On November 2, the first anniversary of Bush's "re-election", we are
organizing a truly massive day of resistance all over this country.  People
everywhere will walk out of school, they will take off work, they will come
to the downtowns and town squares and set out from there, going through the
streets and calling on many more to JOIN US.  They will repudiate this
criminal regime, making a powerful statement: "NO!  THIS REGIME DOES NOT
REPRESENT US!  AND WE WILL DRIVE IT OUT!"

What people say about Linh:

There are two kinds of readers in English, those
who are passionate fans of the poetry of Linh
Dinh and those who have yet to read his writing
[…]. Linh Dinh looks at the world with the
clearest eyes imaginable, a walking example of
the role of the real at the heart of the surreal.
— Ron Silliman

+

Reading Linh Dinh is a tonic and a revelation.
His poems might have taken off the top of
Dickinson’s head, and then some. Linh Dinh raids
and reinvents the language with an ardor bordering
on delirium.
— Rachel Loden

IN OTHER EFFING NEWS

Red Juice by Hoa Nguyen is on the verge of its second printing.  For those who have backordered this book it should only be another couple of weeks.  This second printing will be as beautiful as the first, if not more so.

Also in a couple of weeks, by the grace of g-o-d, we'll see the release of Tony Tost's much awaited effing chapbook World Jelly.

It's also a good time to announce that after only 3 issues effing magazine no longer ceases to be. Time and resources will now go toward the publication of more chapbooks and larger book projects.   Letters will go out in the mail soon to those who have submitted work in the last several months.  Apologies to everyone whose poetry and artwork have been tied up on the effing desk -  I certainly hope and encourage you to send your work elsewhere.  Thanks to everyone who sent poems and artwork over the last year and a half.  I enjoyed it immensely.

Thanks for the eyes.

I guess this is something like what I had in mind, when I asked "*what if*
everyone--anyone--disgusted by the overt criminality of the current
administration (or just afraid of what the future holds in store for their
children) simply left work, or their blog or whatever they are doing, and
went into the streets on a given day . . . and refused to return to work, or
their blog or whatever they normally do, until *some kind* of national
debate began to form about the validity of continuing in the current
fashion?"

Of the Many Deaths in Iraq, One Mother's Loss Becomes a Problem for the
President

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/08/politics/08crawford.html?

"Ms. Sheehan has vowed to camp out on the spot until Mr. Bush agrees to meet
with her, even if it means spending all of August under a broiling sun by
the dusty road. Early on Sunday afternoon, 25 hours after she was turned
back as she approached Mr. Bush's ranch, Prairie Chapel, Ms. Sheehan stood
red-faced from the heat at the makeshift campsite that she says will be her
home until the president relents or leaves to go back to Washington. A
reporter from The Associated Press had just finished interviewing her. CBS
was taping a segment on her. She had already appeared on CNN, and was
scheduled to appear live on ABC on Monday morning. Reporters from across the
country were calling her cellphone.

'It's just snowballed,' Ms. Sheehan said beside a small stand of trees and a
patch of shade that contained a sleeping bag, some candles, a jar of nuts
and a few other supplies. 'We have opened up a debate in the country.'

Seeking to head off exactly the situation that now seems to be unfolding,
the administration sent two senior officials out from the ranch on Saturday
afternoon to meet with her. But Ms. Sheehan said after talking to the
officials--Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, and Joe Hagin,
a deputy White House chief of staff--that she would not back down in her
demand to see the president."


Now fold poetry into *that* . . .

Cindy is the mother of Army Specialist Casey Sheehan, KIA at Sadr City on
April 4, 2004, and a co-founder of Gold Star Families for Peace. Cindy is at
the gates of Bush's ranch in Crawford Texas to demand that he explain to her
"face to face" why Casey had to die. Bush is refusing to come out. Cindy
says she's staying until Bush talks to her or leaves Texas (see NY Times,
Chicago Tribune, Washington Post, UK Guardian and The Lone Star Iconoclast,
Bush's "home-town paper").

We can help Cindy Sheehan turn the heat up on Bush.

1-Email the White House. Send a simple three-word message, "Talk to Cindy!"
The address is simply comments@whitehouse.gov

2-Call the White House comment line (202) 456-1111 (9-5, M-F EST), and/or
send a postcard to George Bush, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
NW, Washington, DC 20500 with the same three words.

3-Spread the word! Send this appeal to your friends, to email lists, to
blogs. Post it on websites. Let's swamp the White House with our simple
three word demand: TALK TO CINDY!

Dear Dan Waber,

Since you are in touch with both Bob Grumman and Geof Huth, someone must
have come up with smallest minimal concrete poem, which is

                                            l

the vertical line which can be glossed almost unendingly and at its most
explicit if followed by three more pages of Roman numerals, all concrete.

An adjacent extension of your idea can be found in my Visual Voices (Runawa=
y
Spoon Press), where I look at Herrick=B9s =B3Delight in Disorder=B2 as a poem in
profile:

I
I
I
I
Etc.

all fourteen lines of the poem seen  as in profile.  Visual Voices has a
number of other minimalizings of more or less the same kind. I can send you
a copy if this way of looking at your subject seems worth considering.

There is another way of considering concrete minimalizing, emphasizing the
truly concrete as in writing the word blood in blood. The centerpiece of my
Number Poems contains several examples but I=B9ll have to send you the page a=
s
an attachment backchannel since I still don=B9t know how to get a web page
other than my own, which someone else keeps current for me.

All.....a new creation that needs a home, needs space
to forecast people's death.  Any ideas for fixing,
adjusting or places for it to call a living space for
a while are so very much desired.

"this is how you will die" A slot machine for death.

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed

One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving

As a  continuation of  Skald's exploration of borders and boundaries in
poetry, identity, and nationhood, the next issue will feature work that
explores relationships between the visual and the verbal. We would welcome
any approach to this area, from poetry which emphasises the visual to
visual art which incorporates or suggests text.

There are physical limitations. Skald, edited by  Ian Davidson and Zoe
Skoulding,  is an A5, 32 pp
publication in black and white. Photographs are possible but, while every
care is taken, high quality reproduction cannot be guaranteed. Sample copies

Bridge, Anglesey LL59 5AG.

Please send work to this address or by email to submissions@skald.org by
September 10 2005.

Subject:      Semezdin Mehmedinovic on Lyric Poetry after Auschwitz
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Below is an exchange between Ammiel Alcalay and Semezdin Mehmedinovic (Bosn=
ian poet, author of Sarajevo Blues; 1998, City Lights; Nine Alexandrias, 20=
03, City Lights; and numerous other books in Bosnian) about Kent Johnson's =
Lyric Poetry After Auschwitz; the text was translated from Bosnian into Eng=
lish by Ammiel Alcalay.




Ammiel,                                    Mon. 08 August

I got the copy of Kent's book that you sent today?  I read it immediately a=
nd was really struck by it: beautiful, humorous, very painful and intellige=
nt. I haven't read anything this fresh in a long time: my hope would be tha=
t this poetry has some kind of serious effect or, barring that, that it at =
least bring back some primary faith in poetry. I'm happy that you're in som=
e way present here; I had the feeling while I was reading the book that it =
was the direct result of your public work over the past ten years...

Sem



sem,

i'm going to ask you if I can quote you on this because there is a controve=
rsy raging on various poetry blogs now about kent's book and what you wrote=
 here would be perfect...



Ammiel:

That would make me very happy - by all means quote me if you think that it =
is well enough articulated; I think that Kent's book needs to be talked abo=
ut as much as possible precisely because it is unsettling; it's unsettling =
to the less talented and less courageous (and that, unfortunately, includes=
 about 90% of the poets in America). I was reading somewhere, that one of t=
he mindless assertions (but today typical) written on one of the blogs is t=
hat the war in Iraq (the one Kent's book is dealing with) is 'old news.' We=
ll, that's a terrifying phrase, not just because the war is ongoing and eve=
n more horrendous measures are in preparation but because, let's say, Hiros=
hima then is old news and poetry shouldn't try to deal with it, as if poetr=
y were some prime time TV show. What must be most unnerving for poets here =
is the freshness of Kent's book on all levels - on the formal and every oth=
er level, because it's alive, it's speaking of reality, while most American=
 poets would still rather go on writing about anything and everything excep=
t themselves in the world they're in, and certainly not about things that a=
re so unsettling; what's more, they've been writing about nothing so long, =
that they're not in any position to write about anything concrete; the fres=
hness of Kent's book completely overshadows most of what's being written no=
w and it doesn't at all surprise me that there would be negative reactions =
among "the poets." But this actually really saddens me. Because the book op=
ens a dialog with serious problems
that all of us on this planet are living with, while a reaction like that m=
akes it seem as if all that is at stake here is cleansing relations between=
 poets and their conscience. But now I'm telling you things you know a lot =
more about and better than I do. So, that's it, I just want to say that I'm=
 not at all indifferent to what is going on, that the whole thing hits very=
 close to home for me.

|||Dear Dan Waber,
|||
|||Since you are in touch with both Bob Grumman and Geof Huth, someone =
must
|||have come up with smallest minimal concrete poem, which is
|||
|||                                            l
|||
|||the vertical line which can be glossed almost unendingly and at its =
most
|||explicit if followed by three more pages of Roman numerals, all =
concrete.
|||
|||An adjacent extension of your idea can be found in my Visual Voices
|||(Runaway
|||Spoon Press), where I look at Herrick=B9s =B3Delight in Disorder=B2 =
as a poem
|||in
|||profile:
|||
|||I
|||I
|||I
|||I
|||Etc.
|||
|||all fourteen lines of the poem seen  as in profile.  Visual Voices =
has a
|||number of other minimalizings of more or less the same kind. I can =
send
|||you
|||a copy if this way of looking at your subject seems worth =
considering.
|||
|||There is another way of considering concrete minimalizing, =
emphasizing
|||the
|||truly concrete as in writing the word blood in blood. The centerpiece =
of
|||my
|||Number Poems contains several examples but I=B9ll have to send you =
the page
|||as
|||an attachment backchannel since I still don=B9t know how to get a web =
page
|||other than my own, which someone else keeps current for me.
|||
|||In any case, your blog page is full of marvelous poemlets.
|||
|||
|||All to the Good,

hi all,

i don't know anything about this, jim barely returns my calls anymore, but
he asked me to post it and if you buy it he just might take off the blue wig
he's taken to wearing at readings so you don't pay attention to what he's

As George Quasha comments:
If I were to argue at this late date of post-culture the view that "poets
are born, not made", Lissa Wolsak would be my preferred instance, along
with, say, Emily Dickinson or HD - poets through and through, for whom
poetry is not so much choice as life-sustaining access to its own
intelligible current. Such poets are often outsiders in the sense that their
work by its nature is without precedent. That her extraordinary ear for
actual speech nuance (however idiolectual) bespeaks the values of a living
poetics in the historical context of unconsciously suicidal public
discourse; its freshness and always surprising invention of her own
revelatory process has no near neighbors. And if she calls a new thinking
into play, it is so utterly without dogma and so sensitive to the free
movement of mind that its humanness and compassionate nature stand forward.
Therein lies her actual politics, alive in the action of what she calls
"co-mercy". A hard act to co-opt.


More information, including extracts from and images of the chapbooks, can
be found by clicking the links at www.wildhoneypress.com

Since literature is the best currency, swaps are welcome.

O Kominos,


What a si(gh)te! May the One and the Many, the flea and the elephant, lie
down together in the popoetic(s) night !  I have just got a Mac Panther and
can finally begin to see what I know you/ve been Doing and Undoing.  If
Minimal goes to Maximal in one direction, what about Minimal to Redundancy
in the other? I=B9ll have to backchannel alas my example.

Marjorie Perloff's speech was the most familiar to me since I live in
Europe, as a matter of fact in South Tryol, being North Tyrol,
Austria.

Re.: Franz Joseph, he was a great Emperor, history says, I don't think
it was that difficult to love him, and Maria Theresia his mother, an
incredibly enlightened lady who introduced compulsory education
(1740-1780).

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list
has about 1200 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number
of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site
(see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in
mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these
options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if they are
not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or following
our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial function as a
defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts
that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for
details.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.



2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We
strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal
entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubcribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.



4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and not
receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to the
list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics nomail.
Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of email
service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you
can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or
in HTML format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index --or--
 set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics messages
as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.



5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the
Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then
resubscribe with your new email address.



6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes
racial slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather
than their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a
person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions
of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of
the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the subscription roll.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept HTML-
formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50
or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

in 1973,  there is a selection of Whalen poems. I don't have this book =
and can't find it except on line at very high price. I would really like =
to know the titles of the poems in that anthology. Please write me with =
titles if you happen to own a copy. Thanks for continued help.

would be nice to know which information has changed, if any.

Is your message being posted because someone breached the etiquette of the
list? It would be nice to know which kind of message was in error.

Is your message being posted as a gentle reminder of the lists policies
only? It would be nice to know that you were simply reminding us.

>
>
> 1. About the Poetics List
>
> With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
> Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the list
> has about 1200 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial number
> of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web site
> (see archive URL above).
>
> The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
> for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
> those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
> renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
> questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
> otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
> While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
> exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep in
> mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect our
> decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
> support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
> modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
> what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.
>
> Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
> format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
> specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
> in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
> list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
> editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
> calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
> to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
> spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these
> options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if they are
> not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or following
> our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial function as a
> defining element of the Poetics List.
>
> Please also note that this is a private list and information about this
> list should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The
> idea is to keep the list membership to those with specific rather than
> general interests, and also to keep the scale of the list relatively
> small and the volume manageable. The current limits of the list are
> generally 50 messages per day, and one or two messages per subscriber
> per day; but these limits are subject to change withouth notice.
>
> In addition to being archived at through the EPC
> (http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
> http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
> Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
> also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
> events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts
> that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for
> details.
>
> Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
> the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
> EPC.
>
>
>
> 2. Posting to the List
>
> The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
> editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
> Welcome Message (see section 1).
>
> Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
> discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
> political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We
> strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
> links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
> and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
> they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
> list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
> digital) are always welcome.
>
> We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
> discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
> venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal
> entries.
>
> Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
> discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
> subscribers.
>
> Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
> to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.
>
>
> 3. Subscriptions
>
> *For all subscription requests go to
> http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.
>
> *To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
> Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
> that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
> your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
> Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
> automatic deletion from the subscription roll.
>
> *To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
> subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
> Corner."
>
> Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
> registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
> whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy, should
> be addressed to this same administrative address.
>
> PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
> remains absolutely confidential.
>
> All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
> If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
> the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
> bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
> will be unsubcribed form the list.
>
> The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
> your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
> messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
> automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
> generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
> bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
> process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
> future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the web.
>
>
>
> 4. Subscription Options
>
> We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the

>
>
>
> 6. Cautions
>
> "Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
> define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
> personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes
> racial slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the person rather
> than their work is attacked; in other words while critique of a
> person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main functions
> of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of
> the person.
>
> The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
> discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
> listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the subscription roll.
>
> For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
> subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
> sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept HTML-
> formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
> individual posts to 1,000 words or less.
>
> Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
> the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for
> all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from
> this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's
> permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of
> published materials.
>
> All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
> before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
> you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
> permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
> appeared originally on the Poetics List
> (http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
> Used by permission of the author.
>
> As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day
> from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
> (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50
> or fewer messages per day.
>
> Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
> message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see
> if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not
> posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to
> contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

hi everybody,

new book of poems by me. actually, my first 'trade' book: If Language
(BookThug 2005). 56 perfect anagrams strung along a bead of possible
languages. not available in bookstores yet, excepting the publisher at
bookthug.ca

if you follow the bookthug links, you will end up at this rather
inelegant url:
http://www.bookthug.ca/miva/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=BookThug&Product_Code=1026&Category_Code=AA

here's the hype thus far:

If Language was a short-listed finalist for Rhode Island's Spineless
Books Fitzpatrick O’Dinn Award for constraint based writing in 2004.

and blurbs:

‘If language can be nihilistic in its wit, if language can be simplistic
in its fun – then this book truly uncovers all the ‘abracadabras’ hidden
deep a million ages ago within even the most unmagical of all
grammatical limitations... Even the most philistine critics admit that
this feat appears impossible -- still its delights persist.’
– Christian Bök.

'If Language is not only a unique way of telling but a unique way of
listening, as delicate as it is obsessive. Betts disassembles each word
gently, with a sensitive and tender ear, listening to the sound of a
single paragraph, to the space in it that is both occupied and
unoccupied, for omissions and possibilities... While authorship and
voice, even meaning and form itself, are uncertain in If Language, these
56 discrete but intimately connected children are entirely original, and
entirely essential.'
- JC Bellringer.


ISBN 0-9737181-6-1; 107pp; perfectbound.


a few examples below....

over and out,
gregory betts

--
"Literature is news that stays news."
-- Ezra Pound

--
"Everything is screwed up.
  Wrap yourself in black. Listen to the Cure."
-- Better than Ezra


If Language (excerpts)
27.











He scans the headlines of the morning newspaper for anagrams. He can’t
accept their topology and flips back to a more inhibited reading. His
pen in hand crosses out all subtle words, adds letters and re-punctuates
every telling. With scissors he inserts deletions, insisting all the
while it

is no violent act, but for his frank type of truth. He turns to the
television, forgets the objectivity of [if] language

inhibited by its lush sensuality of images. A magical, illogical lump of
cartoon authorizes artificiality. He laughs at comic falls, gaming up to
logic with implicit affirmation.

His climactic sublime disappears,
a lunch coffee fouled.



28.











A basement leak, the rodents bristle, insects surge compass wire, old
men thru puddles passing cautious candle-like glisten. Refractory tho
incantatory pass thru puddles difficult hallway, Lascaullion etchings
shift in motion cave history, filthier gloom. Threatening to catch bare
moon divide the finer flames and sanctuary as that of hell. Strange
bohemian figures wait among ochre outlines, signal the whole chamber
music in doubting plea. Fighting its
fiery feet, guide gazer: it is written violence; it is for poems. Fifty
ill felines echo utopia, pout in photoic jails, as if this flash against
biblical caves spoilt philosophic tact.

33.











The night is video deposits, what we mine of callous clowns in the july
concretion. Sibilance embraces the skittish imposition of august.

You curtsy Canada’s sallow cities, find an ineffable geologic. Flags
fallow, a populace postures to right thoughtless child-thief; enough to
appeal a sigh.

This flimsily pulsating passion, faithful cities tremble in their
transom, mightily uplifted. A delicate maze floods the mechanical,
arboreal fluids: a soft pastiche.

Here thinking its past is total, static.

In another convergence, if empirical bodies harm cultures, vagrants or
tilt virgin understanding: the fine layer, the merry dance of ribbons.

SPOKEN ARTS RADIO

Just Buffalo and  WBFO 88.7 FM are pleased to announce the (re)premier of o=
ur
original series, Spoken Arts Radio. New host and producer Sarah Campbell wi=
ll
conduct a year-long series of interviews with poets and authors. The series=
 is proudly
sponsored by First Niagara Bank, a full service community-oriented bank.

Spoken Arts Radio premiers this Sunday and  Monday, August 14/15. It will a=
ir
Sundays during Weekend Edition at 8:35 A.M. and during Morning Edition, Mon=
days
at 6:35 A.M. and 8:35 A.M.

As a program that integrates literature into the mainstream of the NPR news=
 format,
Spoken Arts Radio is distinctive within the realm of National Public Radio=

programming.  Consequently, the program reaches far more people in Western =
New
York than other arts-related radio programs, including nationally syndicate=
d segments
such as Fresh Air and Selected Shorts.

August Programs

August 14/15 - Literary Buffalo, Part I

The launch of a new website www.literarybuffalo.org, a clearinghouse guide =
to all of
Buffalo's literary events, prompts this reflection upon the city's literary=
 history and roots,
spanning the first 19th century poetry anthologies that collected regional =
writing to the
local impact of University at Buffalo's nationally renowned English departm=
ent of the
1960s into the present.

August 28/29 - Literary Buffalo, Part II

Spotlights the mission of www.literarybuffalo.org, the first online gatheri=
ng of all of the
city's literary organizations and created by a consortium of members from M=
edaille
College, University at Buffalo, Just Buffalo, Rust Belt Books, and Talking =
Leaves
Books, among others.  The site features information on readings, conference=
s,
workshops, and authors--emphasizing the ongoing vitality of a community in =
which
literary events occur daily. In Part II, residents reveal that for them, re=
ading figures
prominently as a private activity which in turn forges communal bonds at bo=
ok fairs,
book clubs, and public readings.

For info on the rest of the fall line-up, visit http://www.justbuffalo.org/=
events/sar.shtml

About the Host and producer:  Sarah Campbell is a writer and sound artist w=
hose
recent work has appeared in the Golden Handcuffs Review and Kiosk, which in=
cluded
a CD of the audio piece, =22HAP.=22  She founded and edits the journal P-Qu=
eue, which
publishes hybrid and innovative poetry and prose.  Ms. Campbell teaches wri=
ting and

The Eggcorn Database - v. 0.5
This site collects unusual spellings of a particular kind, which have
come to be called eggcorns. Typical examples include free reign (instead
of free rein) or hone in on (instead of home in on), and many more or
less common reshapings of words and expressions: a word or part of a
word is semantically reanalyzed, and the spelling reflects the new
interpretation. The About page offers more information on the history of
the term and of this collection.

The Eggcorn Database went public on February 15, 2005. New entries and

Watch your language

UK station cancels Keillor feature over questionable content

By Jamie Gumbrecht

HERALD-LEADER CULTURE WRITER


A few weeks after The Boston Globe called The Writer's Almanac radio
program "a confection of poetry and history wrapped in the down
comforter voice of producer and host Garrison Keillor," WUKY-91.3 FM
canceled the daily featurette for what it considered offensive
content.

The five-minute segments aired on the University of Kentucky's public
radio station at 11 a.m. until Aug. 1. It opened with soft piano music
and the voice of A Prairie Home Companion's Keillor remembering major
moments in writing history. It was a break for history between news
broadcasts and pop music, each day ending with a poem and the wish to
"be well, do good work and keep in touch."

But in a time of Federal Communications Commission crackdowns on radio
content, WUKY officials say, the poems Keillor read were too risque
for airplay.

"I don't question the artistic merit, but I have to question the
language," WUKY General Manager Tom Godell said. "It's not that he's
behaving like Howard Stern, but the FCC has been so inconsistent, we
don't know where we stand. We could no longer risk a fine."

Reaction to the cancellation has been minimal so far, Godell said.
WUKY managers decided to stop carrying the Almanac after a recent
spate of language advisories, although they were tracking the content
for about a year, Godell said.

The warnings, issued by the program's production company, came about
Curse of the Cat Woman by Edward Field, which contained violent themes
and the word "breast"; Thinking About the Past by Donald Justice,
which also used the word "breast"; and Reunion by Amber Coverdale,
which contained the phrase "get high." The poems were scheduled for
broadcast between July 23 and Aug. 12.

WUKY never heard complaints about The Writer's Almanac because the
station always edited potentially offensive language, Godell said.
Prairie Home Productions and American Public Media, the segment's
producer and distributor, do not edit or select the content.

"It's not a terrible burden to edit, but my concern is that something
slips through," Godell said. "We have certain standards of decency,
and I expect our national producers to do the same thing."

The station vigilantly checks song lyrics for offensive content,
Godell said, and broadcasts with language advisories are carefully
considered. If offensive language clarifies a story, it will be
broadcast, especially when listeners can be warned first. But an FCC
sanction would be an embarrassment to the station and the university,
Godell said.

Keillor, who will perform Feb. 21 at Centre College's Norton Center
for the Arts, said in an e-mail that stations are within their rights
to cancel the Almanac but he's proud of the poems he reads.

"There isn't one of them I would hesitate to offer to any high school
English class," Keillor wrote. "The fact that someone is troubled by
hearing the word 'breast' is interesting, but what are we supposed to
do with A Visit >From St. Nicholas and the 'breast of the new fallen
snow'? Should it become a shoulder or an elbow? I don't think so."

Public broadcasters have long had to edit gratuitous language, but
meaningful language is worth a fight, said O. Leonard Press, the
retired founding director of Kentucky Educational Television. If
stations censor themselves, they might as well become jukeboxes, he
said.

"The purpose of public broadcasting is not to be safe, but to be
useful, good, to give people something to think about, something to
grow on," Press said. "Survival is not more important than being
useful."

Press, an ardent fan of Keillor's writing and performing, called the
cancellation an overreaction.

"If Garrison Keillor is less desirable on the airwaves than Desperate
Housewives," he said, "we've gone a far piece."

Notes from new Palestine: revolutionary suicidal tendencies

it has been 6 years since the martyredome of anthony james dawson and
the silence remains by all who thought they once meant something to
activism as they lay cozy in union jobs. all the deaf, dumb and blind
and coopted media run by the sycophants of can west mediocrity, be it
the mainstream facist press to the sellout alternia-rags sold out to
arrogant bigots with tunnel vision, no imagination and with axes to
grind, still hold no sense to know the question – what time is it?



notes from new palestine: revolutionary suicidal tendencies
(the war brought home)

“so how do we save ourselves? we must first admit we are at war, admit
who our enemies are and act accordingly.” --junious ricardo stanton

"resistance is legitimate at all levels be it religious, intellectual
and so on,"—seyyad muqtada as sadr

in these times immersed in the absurdity of systemic acts of cruelty and
double standards in this messy area , some call the west , which is now
embedded in the midst of a treacherous performance piece -- it is only
logical that in an illogical world run by bullys, abusers, simpletons
and usurpers -- that frustrated valid bruthas will invoke acts of will
to power and make you feel the pain they feel.

it has been 6 years since the martyredome of anthonay james dawson and
the silence remains by all who thought they once meant something to
activism as they lay cozy in union jobs. all the deaf, dumb and blind
and coopted media run by the sycophants of can west mediocrity, be it
the mainstream facist press to the sellout alternia-rags sold out to
arrogant bigots with tunnel vision, no imagination and with axes to
grind, still hold no sense to know the question – what time is it?

when gil scott heron checked the medium to the message he was saying it
would be of the mind, of the will to power in an movement of peoples
who, having grown into consciousness, hold no respect for the cult
lacking in personality who have usurped postions of priviledge on the
left in order to parley them into a money scheme using peoples tragedies
to do so. that, instead, it would done via the samizdat of urban, rural
and street logic. that the people, who are under represented , whose
lives are devalued - whose lives are toyed with and told that they they
don not mean anything - those flexes and spits and hollas whose
“intention is to disrupt the empire, to incapacitate it, to put pressure
on the cracks, to make it hard to carry out its bloody functioning
against the people” (w.u. prairie) fire will send communiqués out to
each other in an underground 411 –

“stop sweet-talking him. tell him how you feel. tell him how -- what
kind of hell you've been catching, and let him know that if he's ready
to clean his house up, if he's not ready to clean his house up, he
shouldn't have a house. it should catch on fire and burn down. “-- al
hajj malik shabaaz

…and so boom we get surprised at the sudden acts of spontaneous resistance.

randoms acts of revolution are the key to change be they controlling
your world via controlling resources --your world -- to creating your
own media to beating human breathes into boxes to flexes and sonics --
this is the revolutionary medicine to cure the sickness of eurocentrick
arrogance. this is what will confound the closed sets and minds of the
bakraw under qualified of the mainstream media-hypo - crity.

“if we want to obtain the man who produces knowledge, we must know what
others produce and not on the mere basis of being consumers. if we do
not learn about all that is produced by others, we can never reach our
aim. nonetheless, we should not simply receive others’ thoughts and fill
our minds blindly with it, ...following this logic, i have always
advised our youth not to let their aim be their success in their schools
and colleges, but rather to build the basis that enable them to be
creative.”—ayatollah fadlallah

let those of us who still think of Freedome Justice Equality remember
those hidden away in the ghettoes on faux multiculturalism, all for the
sake of maintaining the orthodoxy of egomaniacal supremacists, who are
the last generation of cavemen (fronting as the civilized) who will run
things on this planet – let us born the clearity in remembrance of
anthony james dawson and all those brushed under the door matt of
kkkanadian inactivity.

…and with that power of clearity -- no bombs are needed to destroy the
power centres stuffed with the dead men/unconscious cave men and women
set on pimping their glossy propaganda as reality.

"hear me: an unconscious people, an indoctrinated people, a people fed
only partisan information and opinion that confirm their own bias, a
people made morbidly obese in mind and spirit by the junk food of
propaganda is less inclined to put up a fight, ask questions and be
skeptical. and just as a democracy can die of too many lies, that kind
of orthodoxy can kill us, too."

perhaps this has become a war/a battle for our self esteem—a collective
esteem held in our hearts that everyday is a struggle to maintain a
principle in the purity of lost lives in everyland which holds a truth.
The truth is still with those who have experienced the taunting, the
violence, the disrespect, the rapes, the harassment, the murders -- the
lies and manipulations. Those who have fallen and have had
compadres/conferes/comrades/bruhs and homies lost to the callousness of
the system and to the sociopaths what serve it and it’s ministry of
social engineering who will try and beat us all down into an
unconsciousness of passivity, of comformity and mental death.

What of death? is it the blessing? What of it? What of it if comes when
you least expect it and were in a condition of forgetfulness because
breathing clay is very forgetful? What if it becomes a mental state?
This is unforgivable and requires war—mental warfare -- Some griots say
they are ‘ready2die’ b.u.t. death or martyrDOME should be a moment of
clearity

“go and work as hard as you can,” he said to thunderous applause. “wake
up howard university, udc (university of the district of columbia) and
the black students of georgetown (university). go to the hustler,
prostitute and pimp. tell them we’ve come to untie you. the master has
need of a pimp, gangbanger and a young brain warrior. i’m counting on
you....“the umbrella of the nation of islam will always be there for our
brothers and sisters who struggle for the liberation of our people.”--
nisa islam muhammad – on hon mins farrakhan’s youth address “who cares
for the young and the masses?”

this is for the valid bruthas who are martyred for the “cause of justice
and light’. we can only hope that their will and resistance will
continue our culture and not only be overstood b.u.t. heard, felt and
transformed to make change to this campaign of oppression and abuse of
power.

Julie, one of my favorites:

Freihofer Jazz
By Julie Lomoe

=93When will you get your braces off?=94
Thus spake the great Miles Davis, Prince of Darkness,
Studying my sixteen-year-old mouth in old Milwaukee.
He snubbed his fans, the legend says,
And spoke to nearly no one. But they=92re wrong =96
At least on three occasions, he favored me with that
Deep and throaty croak I used to find so sexy.
That night, my heart leapt as I fantasized the subtext =96
=93You=92ll be a beauty soon, and then I=92ll want you.=94
=93Next year,=94 I said, and then he tromped my dreams
By telling me his father was a dentist. That was that.

Now, well past sixty, sprawling on the lawn at Saratoga,
Baking my aging body in the sun,
I remember Miles and other esoteric jazzmen
Who awakened unfamiliar cravings.
(My classmates lusted after Elvis, but I was far too hip.)
Most are long gone now, deified as legends.
Musicians less than half my age invoke their names
In reverential tones, play anthems to their memories
In styles that still have power to shock the young, =A0
But me, I measure deja vue in decades.=A0

I baked a Birthday Cake for Dizzy,
Atop the chocolate icing, forty mini marshmallows,
One per year, configured like his trademark crooked trumpet.
Forty seemed far too old, said Diz, and I agreed.

The Coltrane legacy looms large this blistering summer day.
Young tenor men spew forth impassioned volleys
We once called sheets of sound. One echoes =93Lonely Woman=94
By Ornette. That=92s me today. I=92m lonely in this crowd
Of thousands. No one knows my stories. Still,
The music wraps me tightly in its winding sheets
And keeps me company. =A0

John Tuschen, city's longtime poet laureate, dies

By Ron McCrea
August 8, 2005

http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/index.php?ntid=49786

John Tuschen, a kindly spirit and busy poet, died Friday at his State
Street apartment at the age of 56 after an illness.

Suni Caylor, a close friend with whom he had a son, Jordan Caylor, 28,
said today that former Mayor Paul Soglin will lead a funeral service
for Tuschen Thursday at 6 p.m. at the Gunderson Funeral Home, 5203
Monona Drive. In 1977 Soglin named Tuschen Madison's poet laureate, a
title he enjoyed for 23 years.

An hour visitation will begin at 5 p.m. before the service, and the
service may go on for some time as Andrea Musher and other area poets
read in honor of Tuschen, Caylor said. Anyone is welcome to join in,
she said, and there will be refreshments afterward.

Tuschen most recently published the Free State Street Poetry Sheet,
which Rod Clark, publisher of the Rockdale-based literary magazine
Rosebud, described today as "the most beautiful, concise and efficient
literary publication in the United States. One page, yet so rich. A
perfect publication of its kind."
Advertisement:

The sheet consisted of one poem - by Tuschen, or by another local poet,
with an advertisement on the back.

Tuschen, a native of Chicago, was one of the insurgent artistic figures
who emerged amid Madison's political and cultural ferment of the 1960s.

Clark said, "The 'revolution' in Madison back then wasn't just about
politics, it was about art consciousness and the idea that in each one
of us there is a wellspring of creativity."

Tuschen's passing comes just weeks after that of another major figure,
Broom Street Theater founder Joel Gersmann, who died June 24 at age 62.
In the late '60s Tuschen edited The Broom Street Magazine, a poetry
magazine associated with the theater.

Soglin said today, "When Joel died, Tuschen said there was no one who
did more to protect the rights of free speech than Joel. But John
probably did more in the last 30 years for the right to public
expression - all the little incidents that happened with him when he
tried to hand out his poetry sheet."

Tuschen published several books of poetry of his own and, with grants
from the city and the Dane County Cultural Affairs Commission, held
poetry sessions in public schools and found other ways to promote
poetry and local poets, including a series of jazz and poetry
performances at the Madison Art Center.

In 1982 he brought together Beat Generation poets Allen Ginsberg,
Gregory Corso and William Burroughs for a program called "The Reunion,"
which was held at the Nitty Gritty restaurant.

Soglin said, "I once asked John why in this modern day we didn't see
more poets like we did 150 years ago in terms of publishing and
children reading modern poetry in schools. And he said to me, 'That's
'cause they're all writing rock and roll.'

"The point he was making was, people are always writing great poetry.
You just have to know where to find it."

(http://www.coppercanyonpress.org/catalog/dsp_bookDetail.cfm?Book_ID=1218)


(NOTE:  below I've spliced together a few review-blurbs, parts of a  letter
from Jonathan Williams, as well as three poems to get us up and  celebrating,
wherever we are!  and please forward this e-mail to anyone  else you know who
cares about poetry.  --CAConrad, _http://PhillySound.blogspot.com_

"IF YOU CAN'T CONJOIN THEM, CONFOUND THEM!"
--Jonathan Williams



"Of all the Black Mountain poets (teachers and disciples alike), Jonathan
Williams is the wittiest, the least constrained, the most joyous."
--The New York Times

(With the release of his New & Selected Poems:  JUBILANT THICKET,  Jonathan
Williams sent around a letter in which he wrote, "Anyway, many of my  readers
have died -- just like that.  I don't know the hundreds of new  names and they
clearly don't know mine.  Do they know Jack Spicer, or  Ronald Johnson or
Russell Edson?  Or, for that matter, Robert Duncan,  Charles Olson, Louis
Zukofsky, Basil Bunting?  If these are not odd times,  can you think of odder?

....  What I am proposing is that everyone organize a little drinks  party
for 10-15 enthusiasts or 15-20 enthusiasts if you live in a lively  spot.  Give
them decent wine and beer.  And have someone read from  JUBILANT THICKET for
10 or 15 minutes.  Ask the guests to spread the  word.  I think we cannot count
much on the magazines and newspapers.   I live too far from the coteries.
What we need are copies in hands of  people who will take a personal interest.
I am counting on these few to be  alive and kicking.  I remember many
political occasions like this in New  York State in, say, 1948 and 1949.  You would go
to someone's house in  Nyack.  Write a check, and wait for someone like
W.E.B. DuBois to  arrive.  Let me end with a few lines of Pound from 'Tenzone':

I beg you my friendly critics,
Do not set about to procure me an audience.
I mate with my free kind up on the crag...

Cheers,
Jonathan Williams aka LORD NOSE aka J. JEETER SWAMPWATER aka......."

ASK YOUR LOCAL BOOKSTORE TO STOCK JUBILANT THICKET!  (In other words,  plant
a nice surprise for careful and eager bookshelf browsers.)

"This work is a necessary addition to any serious poetry collection."

A VULNERARY
for Robert Duncan

one comes to language from afar, the ear
fears for its sound-barriers --

but one "comes"; the language "comes" for
The Beckoning Fair One

plant you now, dig you
later, the plaint stirs winter
earth...

air in a hornet's nest
over the water makes a
solid, six-sided music...

a few utterly quiet scenes, things
are very far away -- "form
is emptiness"

comely, comely, love trembles

and the sweet-shrub


"Williams is first and foremost an American poet....  For those who  take the
time to listen, his is a voice firm enough to scratch, clear enough to
shine, and deep enough to vibrate in your mind long after the reading."
--The Arts Journal

JONATHAN WILLIAMS was born in Asheville, North Carolina in 1929.  He  has
been a poet, essayist, photographer, book designer, and hiker of many long
distances.  He founded The Jargon Society in 1951 -- a press dedicated to  poetry,
experimental fiction, photography, and visionary folk art -- and has  long
championed the underdog, maverick, and outsider in the arts.  Visit  him online
at _http://www.jargonbooks.com_ (http://www.jargonbooks.com/)

(Forward this e-mail, buy his new book (also check out his other new-ish
book A PALPABLE ELYSIUM _http://jargonbooks.com/pe_note.html_
(http://jargonbooks.com/pe_note.html) ),  have your bookstores and libraries stock it.  Now,
let's end this  celebratory message for JUBILANT THICKET with Jonathan Williams
taking  on fascist senator prick Jesse Helms!)


POEM BEGINNING WITH FIVE WORDS BY

glory be to god
for jesse helms jesse
hates fags jesse hates
niggers jesse hates modern
art now that one
thinks about it jesse's
just like most people
in north carolina and
everywhere else what jesse
likes is beauty and
beauty's what bites you
on the butt and
don't leave a hickey
on monday morning we
must be kind to
jesse helms you must
brake for senior republican
senators from north carolina
he has the law
on his sidewinder snake
in the grass that
he is whether he
will brake for us
poets and artsnakes is
another matter thank you
jesus thanks a bunch

and remember to die

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Dear Editors of Poetry Journals--

I am teaching Creative Writing / Poetry at Saint Louis U. this fall, and instead
of using a textbook or anthology, I would like to teach from poetry mags.
Ideally each of my 15 students will have a stack of (the same) four or five
journals to read and discuss throughout the semester.  I want to use current
practice as a foundatoin for talking about older poetry and forms. Intriguing,
eh?!   Well if you think so, please email me and we'll see what we can do about
using your journal. If you'd like to donate 15 copies, that would be great-- a
bit of publicity here, I suppose. If you'd like to sell them, that might work
too --

Email me ASAP,

Aaron

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

"Gottes" not "Wohthaten" (?) would be the
modifier. But "Wohthaten" doesn't seem right
to me. Sure about the spelling?

the word is probably "wohltaten" or in  older spelling "wohlthaten" =20
i.e. "wohl=3Dgood" "taten/thaten=3Ddeeds, acts" -- Pierre

http://print.google.com should be of interest to those with a double
interest in print and the internet, regardless of whether you think it is
wise for publishers, libraries et all to participate at all or participate
by google's rules etc.

there's been a little discussion of this matter on rhizome (a media arts
list out of new york); the following urls discussing the above came from
rhizome subscribers:

http://newsgrist.typepad.com/underbelly/2005/08/google_print_au.html

my own take on it is that market meltdown needn't be in the cards, depending
on what google is proposing.

for instance, let us suppose that a text is entirely searchable online but
that you can only view bitmaps of the text via google. and the whole text is
there in bitmaps, but you can only view a specified few of them or something
like that. Etc. There are plainly ways to do it in such a way that the
book's value is protected and you end up with more sales, not less.

i don't think there is a better market for books than those who use the
internet regularly. but you have to show them enough of the goods that they
deem it worthwhile to purchase. it has to go beyond tease but stop short of
the full experience. it has to be generous but not foolhardy.

For your amusement, here is a little essay I wrote back in 1995 called
"Libraries and Publishing" when I was just contemplating making a Web site:
http://vispo.com/writings/essays/lanhamb.htm . Interesting that many of the
issues raised have still not really been resolved.

However, the print.google.com venture would seem to be a major step in these
issues.

thanks everyone for the quick responses...  the text was a german=20
translation of mi'kmaq prayers from the 1880s so I think Pierre was=20
right to say that it was an old form of the word. (and plus in my=20
dyslexia I spelled it wrong... it should have been "Wohlthaten"...)

Masha Zavialova citing Monika Moyrer:
I would say something like: "First lesson (or class, instruction) about

I promise not to announce the new issue of Rock Heals every week -- but
this one is special to me and many.

Kevin Thurston was one of the true treasures of the Charm City (that's
Bal'more) scene bringing poetry meets performance meets DAMN! that was
an inspiration for me and many.

No he's not dead! But he did desert us to return to Buffalo for all
kinds of good reasons. We may never forgive, but we will miss him.

And heads up Buffalo, he fucking rocks and will be up to all kinds of
good things that you'll start hearing about. Believe you me.

This week's Rock Heals features work dedicated, about, or concerning the
man, the myth that is Kevin Thurston, including:
Buck Downs
Ric Royer
Michael Ball, and
Justin Sirois.

PS don't forget submissions -- we want to continue to spread our wings
to work from other locales. Save yourself a personal email that contains
begging and grovelling, and save some of my dignity at the same time!
submissions at rockheals dot com

PPS I'll try to only post monthly notices on what's going on over at
Rock Heals, I don't want them to become a weekly nuisance

Google says that it has put its program of scanning and posting
searchable texts of books on hiatus until November. However, Google
already has scanned in many volumes, mostly of books published by
university presses. This includes both critical and creative texts.

If you have any concern about this and its impact on the distribution
of your work, you should link over to http://print.google.com/ and do
a search on your own name. You might then want to look at your
contract(s) with your publisher(s) and see if you have already signed
away permission for such use. If not, a discussion with your editor
might be in order.

Dear Buffalo Listers:

This is an open call from Chicagopostmodernpoetry.com for Negative or
Critical reviews. We have been dismayed that so many of the reviews
submitted to the site have been nauseatingly positive, even positive on
books that we all know are crap- so I am sending out an open call if there
is book of poetry or criticism that you want to write a critical or negative
review and it is well written and within our guidelines (No Racism,
Homophobia, Antisemitic, or Religious Hatred) please do send it to us at
editor@chicagopostmodernpoetry.com .

Regards

Raymond L Bianchi

I think he said "unanimous"--he wants us to dump on those

Here is some unusually good generative visual art available for viewing on
the Net: http://www.complexification.net/gallery . This is work by Jared
Tarbell of New Mexico. I find this work quite exciting.

What I like about it is the fusion of algorithm and art. Of course there is
much generative algorithmic visual art, but this work is rather
distinguished in its particular fusion.

For instance, Box.Fitting.Img is both quite beautiful visually and, also,
the work grows from an algorithm that one may easily infer from watching the
piece. It starts with 5 boxes. The color of the boxes is determined by the
color of the pixel of an underlying, invisible image. Though as the piece
grows, one gets other indications of the underlying image. In any case, a
box grows until it touches another box. Then it stops growing and other
boxes start growing in the interstices remaining.

Very simple algorithm. Plain to see. But brilliantly so, really, and unusual
in its visual results.

And much of his work is this way: the algorithms are evident if you watch
closely. Though another wonderful part of the work is that all the source
code is available to view, also. It's all done in a language called
Processing invented not too long ago by Casey Reas and Ben Fry. Java based.

So here we see the strong abstract quality of generative computer visuals.
Strong abstract and dynamic properties/mode/process/aesthetic. Also we see
the value of the source code to the artist-programmer community.

yes, he is, and i agree that it also is terrific. a larger and more diverse
project. but http://complexification.net is, urm, of a body, more unified as
a project, and the algorithms are of a style more perceptibly, possibly more
strongly, than in levitated.net, which is an earlier project, isn't it? it's
flash, i think, also, isn't it (ie all of it), whereas complexification is
in a language that provides better granular control down to the pixel and a
faster framerate, so wider possibilities, in some regards.

His sense of color and shape is finely drawn. No clumsy grab bag goin on
here. The sense of composition is fascinating. Composition within a
pseudo-random generative process. Also, the algorithms in
complexification.net are often a stronger part of the concept. There is a
sense of course in which the visuals grow out of the idea, idea as
generative engine, in any generative visual work. But there is even a simple
but strong style of approach to the algorithm in the complexification.net
pieces.

=20
Mehmet  Tarhan=E2=80=99s statement at his trial
Sivas, 4  August 2005

By  declaring my conscientous objection on October 27 2001, I stated that I=20
would  not perform military service, that I would not take part in any army=20=
or=20
similar  hierarchical organization and that I would not serve in the=20
dissemination of  militarist culture into social life.

Since  that date, especially taking into consideration the war frenzy that=20
the world  has been swept into since September 11, I become more confident w=
ith=20
each  passing day that I have made a right decision. Because the terror =20
attacks and the ongoing atrocious wars everywhere in the world, including th=
e  land=20
we live in, demonstrate that a way of life that excludes violence in its =20
entirety is the only humane solution.

Since  armies are the tools for using legitimized violence, they are one of=20
the most  important obstacles before a world devoid of violence. This is=20
because  militaries owe their existence, their power and sustainability to w=
ars and=20
to  the probability of wars. And militaries are, by nature, institutions tha=
t =20
produce wars.

For  the military, there is no such thing as a state of peace. The periods=20
where  there is no armed conflict, are merely intervals where they try to=20
universalize  the tyranny they impose onto the society, that is, a time peri=
od=20
devoted to  preparation for war and fighting against the implementation of =20=
peace.

As  the ruling classes=E2=80=99 apparatus of violence, the military diffuses=
 the=20
culture of  obedience through military service. The individual who becomes=20
accustomed to  taking orders and obeying without questions, not only loses h=
er/his=20
independence  but becomes an enemy to the idea of independence. What=20
differentiates a human  being from a machine or a well-trained dog is that h=
er/his acts=20
stem from  his/her individual will. So obeying without asking any questions,=
 is=20
far from  being humane, to say the least. Expecting unconditional obedience=20
from someone  is equivalent to asking her/him to abandon his/her humanity.

Because  I find it important to lead a humane life and as an indispensible=20
precondition  of this I feel that all humans should lead a humane life, I=20
declare once again  that I will never take orders and I will never give orde=
rs. I=20
believe that  discrimination and violence are crimes of humanity and in the=20=
name=20
of avoiding  to commit this crime, I am determined to not be a part of the=20
military which is  an apparatus of violence based on hierarchy that imposes=20=
such=20
hierarchical  constructions  over the society, I  am determined to disobey,=20
and refuse to be transformed into a murder machine by  taking a training of=20
dying and killing.

I  find it tragicomical and protest that, in this building that is placed=20
inside a  military barracks, persons who carry military ranks see themselves=
 as=20
having the  right to make statements regarding my destiny according to laws=20
that bind them  alone. I want the restriction on my freedom to end immediate=
ly.=20

Dichiarazione di Mehmet Tarhan al suo  processo
Sivas, 4 agosto 2005

Il 27 ottobre 2001, dichiarandomi obiettore di  coscienza, ho affermato che=20
non avrei fatto il servizio militare, che non avrei  partecipato a nessuna=20
organizzazione militare o gerarchica di tipo analogo, e  che non avrei colla=
borato=20
con la disseminazione della cultura militare nella  vita sociale. =20

Da quella data, specialmente prendendo in considerazione la  frenesia=20
guerrafondaia che ha invaso il mondo dall=E2=80=9911 settembre, ogni giorno=20=
che  passa=20
divento sempre pi=C3=B9 convinto di aver preso la decisione giusta, perch=
=C3=A9 gli  attacchi=20

compreso il paese in cui viviamo, dimostrano che un modo di vita che esclude=
 la =20
violenza nel suo complesso =C3=A8 l=E2=80=99unica soluzione umana.

Dato che sono gli strumenti per usare violenza  legittimata, gli eserciti=20
sono uno degli ostacoli pi=C3=B9 importanti sulla strada di  un mondo senza=20=
violenza. =20
I militari  devono la loro esistenza, il loro potere e la loro sostenibilit=
=C3=A0=20
alle guerre e  alla probabilit=C3=A0 delle guerre.  E i  militari sono, per=20=
natura,=20
istituzioni che producono guerra. =20

Per i militari una cosa come uno stato di pace non  esiste.  I periodi in cu=
i=20
non ci  sono conflitti armati sono semplicemente degli intervalli dove i=20
militari  tentano di universalizzare la tirannia che impongono sulla societ=
=C3=A0, sono=20

In quanto apparato di violenza delle classi dominanti, i  militari diffondon=

.  Quello=20
che differenzia un essere umano  da una macchina o un cane ben addestrato=20=
=C3=A8=20
che le sue azioni derivano dalla sua  volont=C3=A0 individuale.  Per cui  ob=

senza fare domande =C3=A8 =E2=80=93 a dir poco -  ben lungi da essere una ca=

e a=20
chiederle/gli di abbandonare la sua  umanit=C3=A0. =20

Dato che ritengo importante vivere una vita umana e che,  come precondizione=
=20
indispensabile, penso che tutti gli esseri umani dovrebbero  vivere una vita=
=20
umana, dichiaro ancora una volta che non prender=C3=B2 mai ordini e  non dar=
=C3=B2 mai=20
ordini.  Credo che la  discriminazione e la violenza siano crimini dell=E2=
=80=99umanit=C3=A0=20
e, per evitare di  commettere tale crimine, sono deciso a non entrare a far=20

I'm in Beijing, China and wonder if anyone might be
able to recommend a graduate program Stateside,
multii-disciplinary and non MFA. Also, where's the
'hotspot' for creative convergence, let me say, in
North America. I'll be returning in December after 7
years away and you should reckon I'm gonna feel lost.

Alex,
Great questions!  Great lyrics!!  To whom should you turn for the music? =
 Hmmmmmmmm, well, if your political leanings favor the right, consider =
the S.E. schools, several of the south Western facilities, and most of =
the western entities in AZ, NM, UT, ID, WY, MT, and both eastern Oregon =
and eastern Washington.  There are still some question about the CA =
facilities, and the mix in that state is totally confusing. =20

The most liberal facilities are in the North East (with the possible =
exception of southern Maine, some of these folks still think they are =
Tories fighting whigs...go figure).

The most middle of the road, broadly tolerant sites are in the northern =
midwest of Wisconsin, Minnesota, south central Iowa, portions of =
Indiana, and of course western Oregon and Western Washington. (notice =
I've ignored some of the civil war border states...that's because they =
continue to border, and the likes of Kansas and both the Dakotas =
continue to confuse even their own voters...although, it is true, Kansas =
favors preaching...ooops, my error, teaching creationism, as does our =
president.)=20

Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the eastern seaboard coastal states down to the =
Carolinas remain perplexed themselves about their leanings...your guess =
will be as good as theirs in most cases.  Although I suspect with the =
latest Ohio governor's news that state is due for a major political =
leaning shift...a paradigm of policies, if you will.  Could be a great =
place to seek education in the near future.=20

Apart from the political spectrum, two points need to be made:
1. all the U's in the nation are worthy of your approval.
2. the tendency of the U faculty to favor left-leaning directions has =
been overshadowed in the past 10 years by an ever increasing right-wing =
student body criticism that has been drawing wide news coverage. (Of =
course, this is in truth part of the media's own "guilt complex" of =
favoring the left as criticized by the right, and the media need to over =
come that feeling of guilt, quickly.)  =20

As I read your lyrics, I make only this recommendation...stay the hell =
out of Texas!
Alex
P.S. unless of course Kinky Friedman wins his bid to  be elected =
governor, in which case, that will be the best place to go finish your =

  able to recommend a graduate program Stateside,
  multii-disciplinary and non MFA. Also, where's the

An Apéritif of Fotbal Lads

A beneficent Oscar Wilde
XY was pretty as an adolescent girl.
He’d modeled in Paris, or so
he said, and made his night
by making others. A daft little priss
he was, prone to wordiness
and the occasional gibe--
throaty as those sown by (Tom) Eliot.
My life’s a gentlemen’s society
XY’d say. Are you a top, or a bottom?

And another question. How do you feel the quotes

grammar problems, I think?). Apologize for being a bit

Oh....well said, and beautifully asked!!!

But you dance the minuet.

North America is listening to the waltz. =20

Worse, there are no pick-up trucks in your lyrics
real dirty beer drinkers must have pick-up trucks.=20

Again, avoid Texas, only add to that list Oklahoma
and Arkansas, unless of course you can sing sweet
Jesus songs along with the radio.  =20

Tom,

  Not everyone lives in whatever town you do, nor has everyone on this list
been here forever.  Your instructions as to where the reading is to take
place is of absolutely no use to anyone other than those who have been here
long enough to be aware of your location.  Additionally, when posting a
message about a new entry on your blog, it would be nice to include a URL,
so that we of the uninitiated persuasion will know where to look.

JMichael

jm,

this happens on the list all the time, people leaving off cities or links,
especially with people like tom who're new to posting. when i see something
like that take place, i backchannel the post's author a note so they can
correct their post to poetics or whatever list i'm on. and if a reading
interests me i'll do a quick google for it if i have to. tom's message said
"howl festival garden reading." if you google howl festival their site
comes up
first, so within a few seconds you know the reading is in nyc.

hope this finds you well.

as ever,
david

As a nonprofit press, its staff, editors, and contributors bring readers of the journal some of the most exciting offerings of independent literature. From the postmodern to the traditional, Fourteen Hills is a testimony to the fact that independent, innovative and experimental literature is alive and thriving.

Typo and The Burning Chair Readings Present

Winters in August
Jonah Winter & Max Winter
Sunday, August 28th, 8PM
@ The Cloister Café
238 East 9th Street
Between 2nd & 3rd Avenues
New York City

Jonah Winter’s second book of poetry, Amnesia, won the
Field Poetry Prize from Oberlin College Press.  His
first book of poetry, Maine, was published by Slope
Editions in 2003.  Jonah is the author of two books
about baseball, Fair Ball!: 14 Great Stars from
Baseball's Negro Leagues and Beisbol! Latino Baseball
Pioneers and Legends. He is also the author of Diego,
a biography of Diego Rivera, and Frida, about artist
Frida Kahlo, which was hailed as "a grand
accomplishment, worth celebrating" by the New York
Times Book Review and named a 2002 Parents' Choice
Gold Medal winner.  A poet and a painter, Mr. Winter
lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

David Young, Editor of Field and author of Six
Modernist Moments in Poetry :

"Jonah's poems combine great delicacy with great
strength. Readers will delight in the inventiveness
and wit of these poems, assent to their dark and
melancholy hues, and experience wonder at the ways
they remind us of the size and variety of the universe
we inhabit."

Mark Doty, author of Source:

"Jonah Winter resides in the Hotel Amnesia, the Hotel
of Stars--and though he's a comedian, his room is one
along the corridor of the wistful, urbane dreamers:
Joseph Cornell, Jean Cocteau. Anais Nin, Charles
Simic. At the heart of his method is the list, almost
verbless: his marvelous catalogues place unlikely
things side by side, creating within the frame of the
poem the tantalizing windows of the city of dream."

in Slope:
http://www.slope.org/archive/issue18/index.php?file=poetry_winter.htm
& Typo: http://www.typomag.com/issue02/000028.html


Max Winter, winner of the Fifth Annual Boston Review
Poetry Contest, has poems  appearing recently in
Ploughshares, The Paris Review, Colorado Review, Volt,
The Yale Review, The Canary, Denver Quarterly, First
Intensity, GutCult, and New Young American Poets
(Southern Illinois, 2000). He has published reviews in
The Washington Post, The San Francisco Chronicle,
Newsday, and BOMB.  He is a Poetry Editor of Fence.

James Tate, author of Return to the City of White
Donkeys, on Max Winter’s poems:

Max Winter's poems operate in unpredictable ways. They
sound as if controlled by some prevailing logic, and
yet the reader is hurled forward, line by line, into
unknown and unexpected worlds as the poems progress.
They mutate seamlessly; they are awash in metaphor.
Bold statements melt into one another, constantly
changing their terms of play. A reader is tempted to
ask, Is it a madman speaking? But no; upon closer
examination, we see the reasoning process, however
bizarre—the horseshoe turns, the breakaway ride from
idea to idea. And yet nothing detracts from the wonder
of it all. These are poems of great adventure and
discovery, and not just for the reader, I suspect, but
for the poet as well.

Wow! Wishing I could be there for that one!
From the time I first met up with him (during his
high-lonesome stint with Ed's Redeeming Qualities)
through his books for us kids and his poetry I
always knew Jonah could crack that 'lil blue cup
in one fell-swooping!

Best of the best wishes for this reading.

And hoping for reports, and later recordings...

Apologies for the multiple posting attemts, but Mick could not get the message to post...:


We're pleased to announce the availability of two new chapbooks from Katalanche Press:


LETTERS BY WHICH SISTERS WILL KNOW BROTHERS
by Laura Solomon
$5

From the chapbook:

The new blue thing is not like the old red thing
I know few things and they are not
the great and happy things I'd hoped
Cars overheat in steep desert air
Couples agree or argue over how much
or not they love each other
The perfect sky is blue
The perfect sky is black with stiff specks
of faraway tombstones flicker hello
I'm still here don't shut your eyes
why don't any more you love me
so look at me why don't you don't is why
A perfect sky buries its dead
A perfect feeling knows no edge
but the atmosphere
from which feeling is finite
conditional to the history of blue and red things



FILM POEMS
by Mark Lamoureux
$6

From the introduction:
"These poems were written in the darkened theater...and attempt to mimetically simulate the experience of viewing the films, as the film unfolds for the first time, so does the poem; consequently each poem's destination is uncertain."


STAN VANDERBEEK – "EUCLIDEAN ILLUSIONS"

Tom, I'm a little confused. Can you give me precise Longitude/Latitude loca=
tion for the Howl Festival? My spaceship doesn't have the geo-agro translat=
or function and the last time I tried to get to NYC by 'winging it' I nearl=
y slammed into the statue of Liberty. So much for technology!

Kudos, Tom,

Chris

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

From Meritage Press:

A NEW RELEASE SPECIAL: THE OBEDIENT DOOR by SEAN TUMOANA FINNEY

Title: The Obedient Door
Author: Sean Tumoana Finney
Cover: PAPERBACK
Pub Date: 01 Sept 2005
Publisher: Meritage Press (www.meritagepress.com)
ISBN: 0-9709179-4-5
Price: $14.95
Pages: 80

Meritage Press is pleased to announce a release special on Sean Tumoana
Finney's debut poetry collection.  _The Obedient Door_, with original drawings by
San Francisco illustrator Ward Schumaker, is available at a significant
discount through September 31. Early orders qualify for free shipping, $3 dollars off
the cover price, and a guarantee that you'll receive a limited first edition
by a writer John Ashbery calls a rule breaker who makes it work.

_The Obedient Door_ is an argument for awareness, for seeing and feeling
those volumes of our experience not trodden by the shortcuts of social nicety.
Finney's first book is also his loneliest, where he speed dates verse in attempts
to make lasting combinations. His influences include the New York School,
Beckett, Lorca, and Chinese, Japanese, and Islamic poetry. _The Obedient Door_
issues from a desire to know the past and its languages, to find alternatives,
new lexicons, other people's boundaries to force words between.

Finney's collection has received the following advance praise from John
Ashbery:

"Sean Finney's cheerfully slipshod poems recycle urban moments that don't
quite add up to a time, moods that may be part of a relationship, or not,
unclassifiable afternoon afterthoughts and changes in temperature: 'which song brings
stone's rise and water's fall / into the bending of wrists and ankles / and
broken corners for dust to change light.'  These are lines from his poem 'What
the Leopards Reject.'  We would be wise to reject the leopards' whims and
feast on the scraps he has so eloquently assembled for us, which are in fact those
of life itself."


BIOS
Sean Finney is a poet, journalist and copywriter living in San Francisco. He
was born farther west, in Hawaii, but he likes to claim that Rome, where he
lived as a teenager, is his spiritual home. This is his first book.  His website
is www.sfinney.com

Ward Schumaker is a San Francisco based illustrator who has illustrated two
books for the acclaimed Yolla Bolly Press: _Paris France_ by Gertrude Stein,
and _Two Kitchens in Provence_ by M.F.K. Fisher. His website is www.warddraw.com



RELEASE OFFER
Through Meritage Press' release offer, you can obtain The Obedient Door at a
20% discount plus receive free shipping & handling (normally a $3.00 value at
Media Rate) if you are a U.S. resident.  For each book, please send $12

We're excited about publishing poems from contemporary Vietnamese poet
(under 30 no less) Bui Chat, translated from Vietnamese by Linh Dinh.

Bui Chat is part of a group of Vietnamese poets called Mo Mieng
[roughly, "Open Mouth"] who are bringing the coarse language of daily
life and capture "life's natural colors" in contrast to a somewhat
traditional Vietnamese poetic culture.

They've been publishing in xerox / samizdat formats mostly to date and
have managed to get themselves thrown in jail, had their readings
cancelled by the Man, and so on.

Come check it out -- yeah this is a culture story and poetic strategy
we've witnessed before, but it is about the poems. And these from Bui
Chat are worth your time. Don't sleep on it!

http://www.rockheals.com

PS. Treats for Lauren Bender this week, too.
PPS. I know I said I wouldn't announce RH weekly, but when you gotta you
gotta. I'll prob. have no poetry next week and won't post here about it!

Hello. This is an email to let you know that that new issue of SleepingFish
is now available for public consumption.

It features a variety of text, art and sometimes strange or unclassifiable
literary nonsense by the likes of:

   Petra Backonja,   James Wagner,   Michael Boyko,   Amy White,
David-Baptiste Chirot,
   Mike Topp,   Peter Conners,   Eileen Tabios,   Chad Davidson & John Poch,
Daryl Scroggins,
   Alison Hawthorne Deming,   Selah & Noah Saterstrom,   Chris Fritton,
Kristin Prevallet,
   Michael Peters,   Geof Huth,   Christian Peet,   Cheryl Pallant,   Sheila
E. Murphy,   James Grinwis,
   Claudio Parentela,   Henry Mescaline/Henri d'Mescan,   Amy Pence,
Michael Kimball,
   Kevin Sampsell,   Rebecca Gopoian,   Davis Schneiderman,   Jessica Fanzo,
George Sich,
   Joshua Cohen,   Steve Timm,   Chris Casamassima,   Sean Mclain Brown,
mIEKAL aND,
   Stephen Hopkins,   Kevin White,   George Belden (as recovered by Norman
Lock)

& also a special selection of Mexican Visual poetry including   Juan Diaz
Infante,   Federico Martinez,
   Damian Walsdorf,   Katnira Bello,   Victor Sulser   with an introduction
by Brian Whitener.

It has 128 pages. It has an ISBN number. You can look at the cover of this
thing called SleepingFish and check out a few samples from the issue by
going to www.sleepingfish.net.

You can buy it there too for $11. Or you can wait a week or so until it hits
places like Powell's.

It is published by Calamari Press. There was an article in last week's NY
Press about other stuff that Calamari Press has done or will be doing. You
can read it here:
http://nypress.com/18/32/books/michaelcboyko.cfm

If you don't want to buy this SleepingFish, or even if you do, there's some
additional freebie webbed stuff posted online like:

   6 images by Carlos Luis from the forthcoming ma(I)ze Tassel Retrazos
   10 color rubBEings by David-Baptiste Chirot not included in the issue
   some additional rabbit drawings by Victor Sulser that didn't make it to
print
   a few galleries loaded with pictures of street memes & TEXTures from NYC
& Mexico

Hope it does something for you.

To the water,

We're looking for a housesitter to enjoy our place, feed our cat and
water our plants. This would be from September 3 through 30th. Our
house is in Rhinebeck, NY (1 1/2 hours north of NYC by train, and the
train is five minutes away). It's a two-story 19th C. house with two
bedrooms and two office/libraries (second one with double bed/couch),
LR, DR, big kitchen, 2 bathrooms, wrap-around porch, small front and
big back yard. Not fancy at all at all, but really nice. We're on a
quiet block in the village of Rhinebeck, a couple minutes' walk from
the stores, restaurants, library etc. 10 minutes from Bard.

Amenities: tons of books and CDs, TV w/cable/DVD and VCR, stereo, AC,
high-speed Internet.

One bedroom is set up for a toddler, with a double futon, toys and
books etc. The backyard also has kids' stuff. Baby gates for stairs etc.

So, if someone wants to feed our sweet, slightly nutty but totally easy
old cat Eartha Kitty, and water our many (maybe 15, quite basic)
plants, we would charge only for utilities and such...

Rhinebeck: Very beautiful and easy, great movie theater, good
bookstore, 5 or 6 good restaurants, yoga studio, organic farmers, etc.
etc.

We'll charge a small amount to cover utilities/phone/various house
expenese.

The only drawback is we need someone for the entire time, not just a
week or two...

Email me at bluesequin@earthlink.net if you're interested...

Dear Friends,

Remember after the elections when you were wondering
how to make a difference? Here's your chance to be
heard! Be a part of an artistic and political presence
at this summer's Howl Festival.

This Saturday, August 27th in New York City, join Acts
of Art www.actart.org and protest against the Patriot
Act at the Howl Festival parade www.howlfestival.org.
We will be meeting at 11am in the triangular park near
the Cooper Union Building, just South-East of Aster
Place. Look for the smashing purple and blue banner.
The parade will begin at 12noon and proceed to Tompkin
Square Park where the Howl Festival will be in full
swing. The procession will be fairly short and the
weather's looking good! If you need directions, call
917-903-3383. Acts of Art, is a new group of artists
committed to political activism. At the Howl parade we
hope to bring attention to the Patriot Acts'
infringements on our Constitutional rights. We will
have many wonderful, expressive signs for you to
carry, but feel free to bring your own creations.

Teachers are welcome to bring students! The Howl
Parade will be getting a lot of press this year, so
let's get together and make our voices heard!

Best,
Ram Devineni

The Company of Poets daily digest, incredibly enough, is now online.

The digest is a single Company of Poets e-mail that condenses all of the
last day's Company of Poets e-mails. It appears to have picked 1:15pm EDT as the
end of its day, but there we go.

If you would like to unsubscribe from the regular Company of Poets list,  and
instead subscribe to the digest, send a message to
_majordomo@unlikelystories.org_ (mailto:majordomo@unlikelystories.org) .

Use no subject header, and place in the body:

"unsubscribe companyofpoets"
"subscribe companyofpoets-digest"

without the quotation marks.

USE OF HTML FORMATTING IN COMPANY OF POETS MESSAGES SCREWS UP THE DIGEST.
The first digest is about half-gibberish as a result. If the digest is to work,
it is imperative that members of this list stop sending messages in HTML
formatting.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions.


Thanks,

Friends-

Tonight from 7-8 pm CST on http://www.kdhx.org (or FM 88.1 if you're near
St. Louis), I'll be discussing the 2005-06 "Readings @" poetry series
(http://belz.net/readings/). We'll talk live to our Sept 1 reader Geraldine
Kim, winner of the 2005 Fence Modern Poets Series, listen to a jazzy
recording of K. Curtis Lyle, hear a recording of Cole Swensen's 11/4/04
reading from _Goest_, and much more.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi everyone,

It is my distinct pleasure to announce the publication of
the latest Combo Book,

ALSO WITH MY THROAT I SHALL SWALLOW TEN
THOUSAND SWORDS: ARAKI YASUSADA'S LETTERS
IN ENGLISH.

Written under the pseudonym (or hypernym) Tosa
Motokiyu, edited by Kent Johnson and Javier Alvarez,
beautifully and painstakingly designed by Christian
Palino and Prototype Syndicate, perfectbound with a
gorgeous cover involving UV spot-lamination and other
things I don't understand, you must get your hands on
this book!

It will be available momentarily from Small Press
Distribution http://www.spdbooks.org but you can also
order it (and put significantly more dough in the Combo
Books coffers!) by sending cash or check to:

Combo Books
c/o Michael Magee
7 Old West Wrentham Rd.
Cumberland, RI 02864

The price of the book is 12 dollars.

Here are some examples of advance praise for the
book and/or the Yasusada project generally:

"(The Yasusada Author) has done a brilliant job in
inventing a world at once ritualized and yet startlingly
modern, timeless yet documentary, archaized yet au
courant -- a poetic world that satisfies out hunger for the
authentic, even though that autentic world is a perfect
simulacrum...Like Pound's Homage to Sextus
Propertius, the Yasusada notebooks force us to go
back to the 'originals' so as to see what they really were
and how they have been transformed."

--Marjorie Perloff

"These pidgin English fantasies of poetic mastery are
awful and incredible.  Like Frank O'Hara's 'poem in
blackface' they give us pause by giving delight. The
delight, dear reader, is a ruse.It's the pause that
constitutes their gift."

--Ben Friedlander

"Here in America, where even our best experimental
writers seem to be constructing gigantic monuments to
their own talents and are eager to lie beside
Wordsworth in some canonical garden, (the Yasusada)
project, whatever it ultimately is or ends up having
been, strikes me as either the most moving, unsettling
and important thing going on right now, or as the most
egregious and dangerous self-delusion in American
letters."

--Tony Tost

"Joyce and Stein gave us an idea of how the ego talked,
Mallarme and Proust the superego. Now, for the first
time in our era, an unearthing of Araki Yasusada's
shattering letters and sublime
poem-fragments...shows us how ego and superego
would talk to each other, if only they spoke the same
language."

--David Rosenberg

My own hope is that the book will provoke the intense
conversation I think it deserves.  Please forward this
announcement to other lists and, if you don't mind, post
it on you blogs.

Yours,

Michael Magee

Dear List Folks,

I'm finishing a draft of my Robert Duncan biography and am looking for an intern to do some fact-checking, additional research for me.  This would be a good job for an undergrad--  could possibly arrange this as an independent study for credit.   roughly 5 hours per week.  mostly internet research.    I can be reached at jarnot@earthlink.net

thanks very much,
Lisa Jarnot

The problem with democracy and, I would argue, the
egalitarian sense of community, is that everyone's
given, which is nice, their piece! And so, like the
internet, how many pieces of literary waste and shit
must I churn through before someone shows me they give
a damn. When someone does something important, then
please, please send me an e-mail. Before then--FO.

"Now is the time for us to come together with one another, to organize,
to speak out and speak up on behalf of each other. There is no time to
waste, while we debate, define, and discuss; the enemy continues his
genocidal plan. We need to bear in mind the Ashanti proverb: 'Two men in
a burning house must not stop to argue.' " - Dr. Mutulu Shakur

The problem with democracy and, I would argue, the
egalitarian sense of community, is that everyone's
given, which is nice, their piece! And so, like the
internet, how many pieces of literary waste and shit
must I churn through before someone shows me they give
a damn. When someone does something important, then
please, please send me an e-mail. Before then--FO.

Below is a letter Eli Goldblatt is circulating,
CAConrad
_http://PhillySound.blogspot.com_ (http://phillysound.blogspot.com/)=20
=20
-------------
=20
Dear Friends,

I have been involved with Chax Press, a literary and =20
book arts press, as one of its authors and an interested=20
friend of its  various projects. I give my own time and=20
money to Chax Press because I care  deeply about=20
what they do.=20

Currently, Chax Pres is experiencing a  deep and=20
immediate need for transitional funding. I wouldn=E2=80=99t ask=20
you to  help if I did not consider it an urgent matter; you=20
can rest assured that  your money will be well spent,=20
and that this press will continue to do  wonderful work. I=20
am only asking people who I know can help, and who I =20
can trust with my own deep care for Chax Press. Chax=20
Press has been  around for twenty years, and feel sure=20
they will be here for a good while to  come.

For those twenty years, Chax Press has published=20
literature  that crosses boundaries, holds no ground=20
sacred, transgresses =E2=80=94 poetry that,  as Emily Dickinson=20
put it, takes one=E2=80=99s head off.  These books  obliterate=20
distinctions between poetry and prose, language and=20
art,  literature and life.  The effort Chax has put into=20
support of Gil Ott's  work is particularly dear to me.  In=20
addition to their fine edition of  Traffic and their part in=20
the tribute volume The Form of Our Uncertainty, =20
Charles Alexander and I will be editing a posthumous=20
selected writing to  be published by Chax sometime in=20
2007.

Chax Press receives support  from national and local=20
arts agencies, but the greatest part of its budget  comes=20
from individual donors.  I ask for your tax-deductible =20
donation of $30 or more, to help the press through a=20
time of need. I  urge you to make this contribution=20
immediately =E2=80=93 write a check and put it in  today=E2=80=99s or=20
tomorrow=E2=80=99s mail, please. Charles Alexander is offering=20
all  who help a significant discount on any of four new or=20
forthcoming books from  Chax Press.

Thank you for helping to make words and the art made=20
from  words matter.  Please see the attached form below=20
for more information  on new books and how you can=20
send a donation to  Chax.

Sincerely,

Eli

Fuck a buncha useless detractors, this thing looks like it is straight
up gorgeous.

That said, is it in the works for it to come to Bridgestreet books? As
you can imagine, I try to keep my buying local to keep my local from
going the way of the Barnes & Noble squeeze play that is on in DC,
Baltimore and everywhere else.

Otherwise, I'll go for the buying online... or convince Rod that he
needs to be getting a couple copies in stock...

Camille,

Distressed about you, Bill, etc. Want you to know you can stay with me. =
My
numbers are 337-684-3657 (home) and 337-482-5491.

Unfortunately I didn't have your phone # at home and found it on e-mail =
when
I got to the office. =20

Now I can't call until I get home again (this system is impossible for =
me
without a calling card . . . maybe that's what I'll do).

Seriously, even DAYSSSSS. And room for others as well. We can be a bit
uncomfortable and shove in 6-8 with pets.=20

Hope this gets to you. =20

I'm going out to get a card and call you and Bill.

'On Lionel Kearns' is up at http://computerfinearts.com/collection/andrews
(New York). This is a 2004 project published also on my site vispo.com
(Victoria) and turbulence.org (New York). computerfinearts.com is Doron
Golan's site that features quite a good collection of net art archived by
The Cornell University Library.

'On Lionel Kearns' is a binary meditation on the work of Vancouver poet
Lionel Kearns who did some prescient work in the sixties-through-eighties
relevant to contemporary digital poetics. Requires Shockwave and Quicktime.

Esquivalience

Esquivalience, according to the August 29, 2005 New Yorker article,=20
"Ink: Not a Word" by Henry Alford , is a fake entry in the New Oxford=20
American Dictionary designed and included to protect copyright of the=20
publication. It was leaked that the dictionary had put in a fake word=20
in the "e" section and a private investigator set out to find the word.=20=

It was discovered after review of a short list by several experts. When=20=

the editor, Erin McKean, was contacted she admitted that it was indeed=20=

a fake word and had been in since the first edition, in order to=20
protect the copyright of the cdrom edition.

The word is defined to mean: "the willful avoidance of one's official=20
responsibilities."
[edit]

Other Cases

Deliberately false articles included in encyclopedias, whether intended=20=

as copyright traps or for humorous effect, are called Nihilartikels,=20
from a German word. The practice dates back at least to the 1880s.

The New Yorker article points out that this type of practice is not=20
unheard of with both dictionaries and encyclopedias. For example; in=20
the 1975 edition of the New Columbia Encyclopedia there is an entry for=20=

Lillian Virginia Mountweazel, who is described as a former fountain=20
designer and photographer, tragically killed in an explosion while on a=20=

photo shoot for the magazine "Combustables".

Richard Steins, an editor of the volume was quoted, saying: "It was an=20=

old tradition in encyclopedias to put in a fake entry to protect your=20
copyright. If someone copied Lillian, then we'd know they stolen from=20
us."

editors,=20
said the other day. =93If someone copied Lillian, then we=92d know =
they=92d=20

So when word leaked out that the recently published second edition of=20
the New Oxford American Dictionary contains a made-up word that starts=20=

with the letter =93e,=94 an independent investigator set himself the =
task=20
of sifting through NOAD=92s thirty-one hundred and twenty-eight =93e=94=20=

entries in search of the phony. The investigator first removed from=20
contention any word that was easily recognized or that appears in=20
Webster=92s Third New International; the remaining three hundred and=20
sixty words were then vetted with a battery of references.

Six potential Mountweazels emerged. They were:

earth loop=97n. Electrical British term for GROUND LOOP.
EGD=97n. a technology or system that integrates a computer display with =

The six words and their definitions were e-mailed to nine=20
lexicographical authorities. Anne Soukhanov, the U.S. General Editor of=20=

Encarta Webster=92s, was the first to weigh in. =93Ess-kwa-val-ee-ohnce=97=

Thanks Jamie for the encouraging feedback. I probably should have mentioned
before, it anyone is interested in actually reading it and reviewing it, let
me know directly and I can provide a review copy.

As for Bridgestreet books, where are they, DC? If this Rod guy is willing to
work directly with the likes of me (I have no distribution), I'll see if I
can get them to carry some. I tried atomic books in maryland, but haven't
heard back. Surely you will never find sleepingfish in any place like b&n or
amazon. The bookstores at the moment that carry sleepingfish (or will very
soon) are listed here http://www.calamaripress.com/directorder.htm. If
anyone knows of others that might, please let me know.

Thanks,

Fuck a buncha useless detractors, this thing looks like it is straight
up gorgeous.

That said, is it in the works for it to come to Bridgestreet books? As
you can imagine, I try to keep my buying local to keep my local from
going the way of the Barnes & Noble squeeze play that is on in DC,
Baltimore and everywhere else.

Otherwise, I'll go for the buying online... or convince Rod that he
needs to be getting a couple copies in stock...

 Jerome Rothenberg's Experimental Poetry and Jewish Tradition

By Christine A. Meilicke

=20

Published by Lehigh University Press

Associated University Presses=20

ISBN 0-934223-76-9=20

$59.50

=20

This book examines the Jewish writing of the contemporary experimental =
poet Jerome

Rothenberg. Exploring the interplay of American poetry and American =
Judaism, it

demonstrates ways in which he contributes to the creation of an American =
Jewish avantgarde

poetry and a contemporary Jewish diaspora identity.

=20

The two main parts of this book examine Rothenberg's reappropriation of =
Jewish

tradition with reference to religion and history. The theme of loss and =
recovery provides

the overall framework for the different chapters. While the first three =
chapters deal with

the poet's reappropriation of Jewish mysticism, ritual, and magic, the =
last three examine

his evasion of nostalgia in Poland/1931 and his confrontation with the =
Holocaust in

Khurbn and "14 Stations."

=20

Embracing postmodern experimentation and drawing on heterodox Jewish =
sources,

Rothenberg constructs a contemporary American Jewish identity that does =
not rely on

institutionalized Judaism. His poetry invigorates the American and the =
American Jewish

poetry scene.

=20

About the Author: Christine A. Meilicke has studied history and English =
literature at the

University of T=FCbingen, Jewish studies at Oxford, and American and =
comparative literature

at the University of Mainz. She has published several articles about =
Jewish-Christian

relations, kabbalistic poetry, and the Jewish counterculture.

What are those red strings around the wrists of Madonna, Ashton Kutcher,
Stella McCartney, Annie Leibovitz and Stephen Hawking?  In London?s Kabbalah
Center, a band of celebrities meets to worship and to lead the hedonistic
lifestyle their fame guarantees them.  They give their children kooky
names?Rumour, Scout, Tallulah, Gwyneth, Apple and Rocco.  It?s all good.  Only
one problem?across the street a rival band of celebrities wearing green
strings has taken up residence, determined to halt Kabbalah?s domination.  The
celebrities of the Green Party?Susan Sarandon, Betty Ford, Lindsay Lohan, Ed
Ruscha, and San Francisco?s own Barry Bonds and Matt Gonzalez?believe in a
strict program of social justice, economic sustainability and sexual
abstinence.  And naming your children ordinary names like Tom and Michael and
Cathy.  It?s the war of the worlds all right, and who?s at the center of
things, as usual, famed theorist and cultural critic Susan Sontag, whose body
in afterlife becomes a contested site of two major religions.  Among others,
The Red and the Green stars Cliff Hengst as Betty Ford, Tanya Hollis as Nicole
Richie, Scott Hewicker as Guy Ritchie, Gerald Corbin as Barry Bonds, Rex Ray
as Ed Ruscha, Laurie Reid as Sandra Bernhard, Tanya Milosevich as Stella
McCartney, Wayne Smith as Stephen Hawking, Kota Ezawa as Ashton Kutcher,
Jocelyn Saidenberg as Lindsay Lohan, John Koch as Annie Leibovitz, and Craig
Goodman as Will, Will from Will and Grace.  Join us in celebrating Madonna?s
27th birthday, in London, where ordinary people from the USA try to sound more
British than the British?bloody posh, mate.

New Experiments: Catherine Wagner on Prelapsarian Poetics

Catherine Wagner writes: "Recent works by two poets from the astonishing
generation previous to mine -- Leslie Scalapino and Alice Notley --
demonstrate equally radical versions of a prelapsarian poetics: both assert a
Fall that their poetry seeks to counter or pre-empt. What are the risks and
benefits of a prelapsarian poetics, and what can politically minded younger
poets learn from it?"

Catherine Wagner is the author of Macular Hole (Fence, 2004), Miss America
(Fence, 2001), and many chapbooks. Rae Armantrout calls her work "really
strong and brave." Wagner's latest poems are in recent issues of Black Clock,
The Hat, American Letters & Commentary, and Shearsman. She gave readings this
summer at The Cork International Poetry Festival in Ireland and at England's
Sheffield Poetry International. She teaches at Boise State University in
Idaho, where she lives with her husband and two-year-old son.

Camille Martin is staying with her parents in Lafayette, LA, but is =
worried
about losing her "library" in her 3rd floor attic apartment.

Bill Lavender and his companion Nancy Dixon were going to "ride it out," =
but
I've been unable to contact him since right before the storm got really =
bad.
He thought he was safe, up off the ground on what south Louisianans call =
a
ridge.

I hear Alex Rawls was out of town with companion.

I got a hold of David Brinks' mother, who was going to ride it out on =
her
arc (she has a zoo), but she's on the north side of the lake. David and =
girl
friend had already left (Sun. evening).

I don't know about many.

John Gery?

Joel Dailey?

Roger Kamenetz and wife?

Andrei Codrescu?

Anyone know? I'll post as I might hear.

I know nothing more than Martin, Brinks, and Rawls (all apparently safe if I

more are there, like Joy Lahey, Andy Young, Ralph Adamo, Kalamu ya Salaam .

Hey, Skip--I'm trying to find some close friends who gut stuck. I think two friends went to Mississippi, but I'm not sure if they went far enough. I have two friends who each just bought houses in Holy Cross where the houses were submerged to the roofs. They've surely lost everything. I can't believe this. What were Bill and Nance thinking "riding it out"?! If you hear anything about them--or Joel or Alex or anyone--please forward to me. Thanks!

(apologies if you've seen this before, I couldn't resist)

European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English
will be the official language of the European Union rather than German,
which was the other possibility

As part of the negotiations, the British Government conceded that
English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a
5-year phase-in plan that would become known as "Euro-English".

In the first year, "s" will replace the soft "c". Sertainly, this will
make the sivil servants jump with joy.

The hard "c" will be dropped in favour of "k". This should klear up
konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the
troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f". This will make words like
fotograf 20% shorter.

In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted
to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible.

Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have
always ben a deterent to akurate speling.

Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent "e" in the languag
is disgrasful and it should go away.

By the 4th yer people wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing "th"
with "z" and "w" with "v".

Camille Martin here. Thanks to all who emailed me with their concerns, and
especially to Skip Fox for his messages about the whereabouts of some of
the poets who live in New Orleans. Skip has also been very generous to me
since I arrived in Lafayette, Louisiana, to take refuge from the hurricane
and its aftermath.

I decided to reproduce a narrative that I composed and sent a few hours ago
to Carla Harryman and post it to the list, to let people know my experience
and to express some of the gravity of the situation, which is, as I write,
worsening as levees continue to be breached, flooding the city of New
Orleans even more.

It has been a stressful few days! New Orleans is facing an incredible
catastrophe. The reality of the situation and all the implications for me
and many, many others is only now starting to sink in. The irony for my
situation is that I am now two weeks from a planned move to Toronto. A
couple of weeks ago, I officially "landed" in Canada, becoming a permanent
resident, and secured an apartment in Toronto. Since then, I've been making
preparations to move, and before Katrina arrived, I had started to pack
boxes of my book collection and was close to finishing the poetry section.
There's no question about a move at this point, at least until I find out
what happened to my apartment. Here's what happened with me during the
Katrina catastrophe:

Saturday night, I had decided that I was going to stay in New Orleans and
ride out the storm. But when Mayor Nagin announced a mandatory evacuation
of the city on Sunday morning at 9 am, a little less than 24 hours before
landfall was expected, I decided to get the hell out. I wanted to stick
around so that i could put buckets in place if the roof started leaking,
but then I started thinking about things like the roof blowing off in 150
mph winds, or even the building collapsing in the high winds and
floodwaters, & who would help me in that situation in the middle of a
severe hurricane? I had to remember that people have died thinking they
could ride out the storm. Remember Hurricanes Betsy and Camille! Even
though I knew I was possibly saving my life by leaving, it was very
stressful to imagine that I might lose almost everything that I own.

I went outside and found my landlord Richard boarding up the windows on my
third floor apartment. I was concerned that the plywood only covered a
portion of the windows, but was grateful that he was doing something,
anything, before he, too, left the city. Richard very kindly lent me two
large tarps.

At that point, I had already packed about 50 boxes of books for my move to
Toronto, almost all of the poetry, so I piled many of them on the bed and
got the rest off the floor, reassembling bookcases that I had started to
take apart for the move. I covered the bed and my desk and computer with
the tarps that my landlord lent me. Sadly, I had to leave all of my books
and my artwork behind.

Then I hunted down Joshu, the cat that I've been taking care of for John
Clark, my ex-husband, while he's in Dharamsala, put him in a cardboard cat
carrier that a neighbor lent me, grabbed my hard drive, and threw a few
essentials in a suitcase. Just before I left, John called me from
Dharamsala in response to the urgent emails I had sent him. He didn't seem
to quite realize the seriousness of the situation, and was surprised when I
offered to go to his house and save his hard drive. Skip Fox, the poet who
lives in Lafayette, LA, also called and very generously offered to let me
take refuge in his house. Then, around 1:00 pm, I started driving toward
Lafayette, about 130 miles to the west, where my parents live. The streets
of the city were eerily empty. Very few cars remained parked on the
streets, but many were parked on the more elevated "neutral grounds"
(medians of the large boulevards).

Lafayette is normally less than 3 hours away, but with a city of half a
million under evacuation orders, it took me 8 hours of crawl-&-stop traffic
to get there. The state had put in effect a "contraflow" system, so that
both east and west lanes of I-10 were going in one direction - out of
Dodge. Nonetheless, the interstate was more like a parking lot. When
traffic halted for long periods of time, people got out, played music, and
watched the waves of the swamplands west of New Orleans become stronger,
and the feeder bands of storm clouds from the approaching enormous
hurricane arrive in advance.

I'm afraid there might be many deaths in the city. Some people with no
transportation are going to stay in their homes, which is very dangerous,
instead of going to the Superdome, the official place of refuge for the
city. They could not only drown, but after the storm is over, if they are
stuck in their attics trying to escape the high waters, and neglected to
bring an axe to chop a hole in their roofs, they could dehydrate and die in
the extreme heat. Skip has informed me that the poet Bill Lavender & his
wife stayed in their home, and as of the time immediately after the
hurricane hit land, were doing ok. Like my apartment, their house is
located on a ridge (which is not saying a lot in this below-sea-level bowl
of a city). I've heard that around 100,000 people remained in a city that
now has no services, no communications system, no electricity, and no
drinkable water.

It's now Tuesday afternoon. I've been watching the tv reports obsessively,
and for a long time, during the height of the hurricane, New Orleans was a
black hole. No reports coming out of the city. As of Monday afternoon, it
was still too dangerous to fly helicopters. Then on Monday evening, after
the winds had died down, tv stations finally got some aerial shots from a
helicopter. Incredible devastation! Major flooding and damage almost
everywhere. The levee was breached in at least two or three places,
spilling water into the city from Lake Pontchartrain and from a large
canal. I haven't heard whether the levee of the Mississippi River was
breached. Hundreds of people stranded on rooftops. 80% of the city
underwater. Whole suburbs flooded to rooftops. It's very sad. It's going to
take a very long time for the city to recover from this. It won't ever be
the same. No word yet on the death toll in the city. There are unconfirmed
reports of bodies floating in the floodwaters.

Somewhere in the city, a building was on fire, and firemen were watching
helplessly with flat hoses, since there was no water pressure.

I have no way of knowing what happened to my apartment. It's on the third
floor, so it couldn't have flooded from the rising waters. The building is
probably still standing. but there could be water damage from roof leakage.
I won't be able to re-enter the city for several days, possibly weeks. And
the power will almost certainly not be restored for weeks. The water supply
has been breached, so there's a mandatory boiling order in New Orleans and
some of the surrounding parishes. The roads are completely impassable. In
short, the city is virtually uninhabitable.

On a personal level, I don't know what this will do to my plans to move to
Toronto. It's very ironic . . . I knew that there was a possibility of this
happening, and every couple of days i had been checking the National
Hurricane Center to see if any hurricanes were on the way that might
interfere with my plans . . . I was trying to beat the clock to escape this
very thing, but I had no way of knowing that the inevitable "big one," the
one people have been talking about for decades that would devastate New
Orleans, was on the horizon . . . Another irony: if my books are a loss, my
problem of fitting everything in my smallish Toronto apartment has been
solved (grim smile).

For some reason, one rather surreal phrase from a report has stuck with me:
"little islands of red ants floated in the gasoline-fouled waters through
downtown."

I hope to know more in the coming days. The difficult thing has been
waiting and not knowing . . . I'm emotionally drained.

Reading Camille's sad, anxious report... and thinking about
all our others throughout New Orleans, the surrounds and everywhere
else along Katrina's path, I was struck by an almost overwhelming
urge to Do Something.

And, knowing how much many of us are our libraries, I thought
that as the waters (somehow, sometime) receed and loss is assesed,
maybe those of us who are able will help (as mush as can ever be
possible) to rebuld or restore in some way those collections.

All my thoughts and wishes to all, especially to nancy, Camille, David,
Bill and on nd on...

I Realize that we are all over the world/country but I think it would be a
great thing if we as poets would consider
After all this disaster is past- to donate books to poets in New Orleans and
Miss that have list their libraries. I know that if I lost mine I would be
inconsolable. If anyone is interested in doing this, and the idea just came
to me this morning, send me an email and let see if we can do it as this
would be a way to help to heal our community in a small way.

     Hi,

     New on Adam Fieled's blog (www.artrecess.blogspot.com)...

    1) An essay, "Learning from Bukowski". Inspired by architect Robert Venturi's "Learning From Las Vegas", which made the argument that sometimes, in art, low is high & high is low.

    2) A review of Jennifer Moxley's "Imagination Verses". This is a follow-up to the mixed review of "Often Capital" I posted. This one I embrace more roundly..

   3) A short review of Mary Walker Graham's poems in September '05 "Poetry". This is MOR at its' best; meet the "anti-epiphanic I".

   4) Two more from the BEAM series. I encourage feedback as I'm trying to decide if I should go on with these.

    OK peoples. See ya in blog-land.

My CD version (OED2[3]) seems (at least this is what shows in the font label
if you load it into Word) to be Plantin OUP.  Font size varies from 18
(headword) to 10 (for the citations).

But that may not be the font for the hard copy.

Might be something anent this on the OED site -- haven't looked.

Haas may be right, but I don't think so.  The only mention of typeface in
the prefatory pages to the OED is to the explanatory paragraphs following
the articles, and that is in Small Clarendon.  The rest of the text looks
very similar only larger.  I'd wager that it's probably Clarendon Book.

Camille Martin knew that Joel Daily and wife were in Houston.

Haven't heard any more. I tried to call Bill Lavender again last night =
and
actually got a answering matching, into which I dumped my numbers, not
realizing he's probably out of juice and unable to get out to anyone
(especially as I may have drained the last of his juice, if that's the =
way
these things work).

My last conversation with Bill was so ordinary under the circumstances =
that
I'm still surprised. He made me feel like an alarmist without saying a =
word.
He was completely calm, slow and amused in delivery, like always, and =
always
ready to laugh. I knew there was nothing to do at this point, the storm =
just
beginning to get damned bad, so we talked and joked. He told me he =
thought
the swamps were underestimated by the experts for slowing down a storm, =
that
he was on a ridge (I know how that sounds to many north of here) and =
that
his house was several feet off the street level. He was talking to Nancy
about cracking the windows "so they don't break," and a dog was barking
which he told me belonged to Alex Rawls who was with his companion up =
north,
and he spoke to the dog as well. I told him he could always eat it and =
he
laughed. Then to take care of himself and Nancy, and we said goodbye.

Haven't heard of anyone else.

Friends-



Thursday night at 8 pm is the kickoff reading for this season's "Readings @"
series, held this year in the picturesque Club Room of the Schlafly Tap Room
at 2100 Locust.  It is FREE and there will be a cash bar available during
the reading. The series program is available at http://belz.net/readings/



This month's readers are poets Geraldine Kim, 2005 Fence Modern Poets Series
winner, and Stephanie Schlaifer, editor of Delmar.



If you'd like more info about the "Readings @" series, look for a feature in
this Thursday's St. Louis Post-Dispatch ("Get Out") or email me,

My heart hurts.  I earned my Masters and Ph.D at Tulane University.  I met my wife in New Orleans.  Those wonderful memories are now, perhaps, as reflexive as the latest inscrutable poem.  Do they reference what is no longer there?

One of the torments of aging:  one's life sliced off, section by section.  For me it was the Twin Towers -- and now this.

I pray to God, or the void, or whatever occupies the center, that everyone down south who has been affected by this unfathomable tragedy may recover, may reattach those lost lives to what remains.

Best, Bill

Camille,

Stay safe. You're in my thoughts.  It was good to hear from you. Thanks.

Take care,

Camille Martin here. Thanks to all who emailed me with their concerns, and
especially to Skip Fox for his messages about the whereabouts of some of
the poets who live in New Orleans. Skip has also been very generous to me
since I arrived in Lafayette, Louisiana, to take refuge from the hurricane
and its aftermath.

I decided to reproduce a narrative that I composed and sent a few hours ago
to Carla Harryman and post it to the list, to let people know my experience
and to express some of the gravity of the situation, which is, as I write,
worsening as levees continue to be breached, flooding the city of New
Orleans even more.

It has been a stressful few days! New Orleans is facing an incredible
catastrophe. The reality of the situation and all the implications for me
and many, many others is only now starting to sink in. The irony for my
situation is that I am now two weeks from a planned move to Toronto. A
couple of weeks ago, I officially "landed" in Canada, becoming a permanent
resident, and secured an apartment in Toronto. Since then, I've been making
preparations to move, and before Katrina arrived, I had started to pack
boxes of my book collection and was close to finishing the poetry section.
There's no question about a move at this point, at least until I find out
what happened to my apartment. Here's what happened with me during the
Katrina catastrophe:

Saturday night, I had decided that I was going to stay in New Orleans and
ride out the storm. But when Mayor Nagin announced a mandatory evacuation
of the city on Sunday morning at 9 am, a little less than 24 hours before
landfall was expected, I decided to get the hell out. I wanted to stick
around so that i could put buckets in place if the roof started leaking,
but then I started thinking about things like the roof blowing off in 150
mph winds, or even the building collapsing in the high winds and
floodwaters, & who would help me in that situation in the middle of a
severe hurricane? I had to remember that people have died thinking they
could ride out the storm. Remember Hurricanes Betsy and Camille! Even
though I knew I was possibly saving my life by leaving, it was very
stressful to imagine that I might lose almost everything that I own.

I went outside and found my landlord Richard boarding up the windows on my
third floor apartment. I was concerned that the plywood only covered a
portion of the windows, but was grateful that he was doing something,
anything, before he, too, left the city. Richard very kindly lent me two
large tarps.

At that point, I had already packed about 50 boxes of books for my move to
Toronto, almost all of the poetry, so I piled many of them on the bed and
got the rest off the floor, reassembling bookcases that I had started to
take apart for the move. I covered the bed and my desk and computer with
the tarps that my landlord lent me. Sadly, I had to leave all of my books
and my artwork behind.

Then I hunted down Joshu, the cat that I've been taking care of for John
Clark, my ex-husband, while he's in Dharamsala, put him in a cardboard cat
carrier that a neighbor lent me, grabbed my hard drive, and threw a few
essentials in a suitcase. Just before I left, John called me from
Dharamsala in response to the urgent emails I had sent him. He didn't seem
to quite realize the seriousness of the situation, and was surprised when I
offered to go to his house and save his hard drive. Skip Fox, the poet who
lives in Lafayette, LA, also called and very generously offered to let me
take refuge in his house. Then, around 1:00 pm, I started driving toward
Lafayette, about 130 miles to the west, where my parents live. The streets
of the city were eerily empty. Very few cars remained parked on the
streets, but many were parked on the more elevated "neutral grounds"
(medians of the large boulevards).

Lafayette is normally less than 3 hours away, but with a city of half a
million under evacuation orders, it took me 8 hours of crawl-&-stop traffic
to get there. The state had put in effect a "contraflow" system, so that
both east and west lanes of I-10 were going in one direction - out of
Dodge. Nonetheless, the interstate was more like a parking lot. When
traffic halted for long periods of time, people got out, played music, and
watched the waves of the swamplands west of New Orleans become stronger,
and the feeder bands of storm clouds from the approaching enormous
hurricane arrive in advance.

I'm afraid there might be many deaths in the city. Some people with no
transportation are going to stay in their homes, which is very dangerous,
instead of going to the Superdome, the official place of refuge for the
city. They could not only drown, but after the storm is over, if they are
stuck in their attics trying to escape the high waters, and neglected to
bring an axe to chop a hole in their roofs, they could dehydrate and die in
the extreme heat. Skip has informed me that the poet Bill Lavender & his
wife stayed in their home, and as of the time immediately after the
hurricane hit land, were doing ok. Like my apartment, their house is
located on a ridge (which is not saying a lot in this below-sea-level bowl
of a city). I've heard that around 100,000 people remained in a city that
now has no services, no communications system, no electricity, and no
drinkable water.

It's now Tuesday afternoon. I've been watching the tv reports obsessively,
and for a long time, during the height of the hurricane, New Orleans was a
black hole. No reports coming out of the city. As of Monday afternoon, it
was still too dangerous to fly helicopters. Then on Monday evening, after
the winds had died down, tv stations finally got some aerial shots from a
helicopter. Incredible devastation! Major flooding and damage almost
everywhere. The levee was breached in at least two or three places,
spilling water into the city from Lake Pontchartrain and from a large
canal. I haven't heard whether the levee of the Mississippi River was
breached. Hundreds of people stranded on rooftops. 80% of the city
underwater. Whole suburbs flooded to rooftops. It's very sad. It's going to
take a very long time for the city to recover from this. It won't ever be
the same. No word yet on the death toll in the city. There are unconfirmed
reports of bodies floating in the floodwaters.

Somewhere in the city, a building was on fire, and firemen were watching
helplessly with flat hoses, since there was no water pressure.

I have no way of knowing what happened to my apartment. It's on the third
floor, so it couldn't have flooded from the rising waters. The building is
probably still standing. but there could be water damage from roof leakage.
I won't be able to re-enter the city for several days, possibly weeks. And
the power will almost certainly not be restored for weeks. The water supply
has been breached, so there's a mandatory boiling order in New Orleans and
some of the surrounding parishes. The roads are completely impassable. In
short, the city is virtually uninhabitable.

On a personal level, I don't know what this will do to my plans to move to
Toronto. It's very ironic . . . I knew that there was a possibility of this
happening, and every couple of days i had been checking the National
Hurricane Center to see if any hurricanes were on the way that might
interfere with my plans . . . I was trying to beat the clock to escape this
very thing, but I had no way of knowing that the inevitable "big one," the
one people have been talking about for decades that would devastate New
Orleans, was on the horizon . . . Another irony: if my books are a loss, my
problem of fitting everything in my smallish Toronto apartment has been
solved (grim smile).

For some reason, one rather surreal phrase from a report has stuck with me:
"little islands of red ants floated in the gasoline-fouled waters through
downtown."

I hope to know more in the coming days. The difficult thing has been
waiting and not knowing . . . I'm emotionally drained.

Thank you Skip and Camille for your news. My thoughts are with all the New
Orleans folk and the rest of you in the area, where I feel so lucky to have
spent 2 short, fabulous, mind-opening trips. I went to New Orleans before I
ever got to Europe, and those were the most historical buildings I had seen.

A few months ago, I posted a notice for donations of poetry books for a
project I was just starting.  I'm sure those generous poets -- some of whom are on
this list -- would support making those books available for not just my
project but for this offer below (please feel free to forward):


TO THOSE AFFECTED BY KATRINA:

Our thoughts are with you in these difficult times.  As you begin to recover
from Katrina's aftermath, if you would like to either rebuild your poetry
library -- or start one -- please feel free to let me know if you would be
interested in a box of 20 poetry books.  These are books donated by various
contemporary poets, as well as from those titles published by Meritage Press.

This offer is not just open to poets but poetry lovers, and those who might
now welcome poetry books into their post-Katrina lives.

Some of you may need time to figure out your new address; just know that this
offer is open to you whenever you are ready to receive such a package (or I
suppose available for as long as my supplies last).  Email me at
Ertabios@aol.com if you wish to receive this attempt to let you know that we are wishing the
best for you in Katrina's aftermath.

Sincerely,

Eileen Tabios

Aside from concern about people, I'm wondering about the libraries and
museums. I assume the library collections are history, but a lot of the art
is moveable. No word yet,. I'm also very worried about a wonderful small
museum devoted to the work of Walter Anderson, an astonishing original, in
Ocean Springs, Mississippi. The most important work thee is or was a two
sets of murals. If the tidal surge got that far there will be nothing left.
There are no other major holdings of his work.

Yes, I concur with Mark Weiss' worries.  I imagine it will be a significant loss.

Camille-- Skip-- is it true that someone talked to
Bill and Nancy AFTER the the hurricane and that they
ARE indeed ok? I really can't deal with not
knowing--and the fact that there may be no
communication from people that styaed for weeks!! My
friend Utahna today told me that although still unable
to get through to cell phones, she did  get a
voicemail, and was able to send a text message to our
friend, Claudia (though no reply yet). This is all
just so unthinkable--I can't process it. I know I'm
being dramatic because I'm upset, but I feel like the
city itself has died and will never be habitable
again. I just cannot believe this has actually
happened. I'm so glad you're okay, Camille, and being
uptown, your stuff is probably mostly safe. Utahna and
Gina had houses in the lower 9th ward and have lost
everything.  I'm still so so worried that something's
going to happen to a friend.  I feel so helpless here.
I wish I could just talk to everyone! This is just
horrific.

Susan Shultz wrote to the effect that Joseph and Amanda Boyden, both
novelists, where elsewhere when the storm hit.

Susan also writes "Aaron Belz in St. Louis says he can take in 5-6 =
people,
so if you know anyone looking to evacuate to St. Louis....he's
aaron@belz.net"

David Brinks left a message on my machine to the effect that he and his
girlfriend are safe in Natchez and that he thought Paul Chasse and his =
wife
had gone north as well prior to storm.

Camille said the city's historical archives were in the basement of the
library. Maybe she can update that with you, but as an old researcher, I
take this to be a repository primarily of primary records (few of which
would have copies probably).

Todd. I have not heard of anyone talking to Bill Lavender on this side =
of
the storm. I called him just before and then was unable to get him =
later.
Only his mail message (whatever) last night. I gave him numbers and told =
him
I'd contact anyone he wanted (and this list), but wasn't thinking about =
cell
phone batteries. I, too, am hanging. Can't stand to think that voice I =
heard
saying "Please leave a message" is no longer his. But I remember how
resourceful Bill is. Former contractor, etc. He's big and smart.

Concerning books, many of us who have relatively large libraries find
duplicates every time we go through our shelves. Maybe it's a good time =
to
"read the stacks."

I suggest we consider a nearby location to which books can be donated in
bulk and/or anonymously and from which books can be distributed to
effected poets. Can anyone do this? I'll talk to some east Texans.

 >>PUB: call for papers--literature for our times
========================================

The Association for Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies (ACLALS)
14th Triennial Conference

August 2007, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada

Call for Papers

Literature for Our Times

At the 2005 World Social Forum, held in Porto Allegre, Brazil,
Booker-Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy spoke about the function of
literature for our times: "Our strategy should be not only to confront
empire,
but to lay siege to itâ€¦ With our art, our music, our literatureâ€¦ â€”and our
ability to tell our own stories."  In an article, â€œThe Arduous Conversation
Will Continue," published in The Guardian on July 19, 2005, Hanif Kureishi
voiced a similar opinion: "â€¦the only patriotism possible is one that refuses
the banality of taking either side, and continues the arduous conversation.
That is why we have literature, the theatre, newspapersâ€”a culture, in other
words."

Are there other roles, besides the ones suggested by Kureishi and Roy, that
literature has played in the era of colonialism and continues to fulfill
now in
this young Twenty-First century of ours, amidst the upheavals of regime
changes,
wars for resources, loss of faith in elected representatives, genocide,
suicide
bombings, resistance struggles and environmental disasters?  Is literature a
force for reconciliation and cross-cultural understanding or only an
instrument
for aesthetic pleasure of the privileged?  Does literature provide us,
in the
famous phrase of Kenneth Burke, with "equipment for living," or does it only
obscure reality and deflect resistance?

Papers are invited to engage with all aspects of the above theme.  They
could
address, by referring to the literary, critical and other kinds of cultural
texts, the following questions:

Literature as an institution and ideologies of 'literature'
Commonwealth versus Postcolonial versus World literature
Literature as resistance
Literature as "arduous dialogue"
Literature as "equipment for living"
Literature as pedagogy; Pedagogy of literature
Literature of human survival (including issues of poverty and prosperity)
Literature of Human Rights (including the right to access knowledge and
resources)
Literature of Apocalyptic and Utopic imaginings
Literature for promotion of Peace and Justice
Literature of real and imagined Ethnicities
Literature of cultural affiliations (Race, Gender and/or History)
Literature as a world language
Literature in a global cultural economy
Literature in translation
Literature of healing and reconciliation

Abstracts of approx. 300 words for papers of 20 minutes duration, and
approx.
400 words for three-paper panels (with the names of the panelists) which
engage
with these and other relevant questions should be e-mailed, with a short
bio-note (50 words) and contact address to spierr@sfu.ca no later than
August
30, 2006.

Address for regular mail:

My colleague Michael Joseph sent this to the children's literature listserv
I'm on.  Thought it might interest you here on the poetics list:

***************************************************************

American Libraries has posted a summary of what little news has emerged
about libraries in the states affected by Hurricane Katrina. See top news
story at www.ala.org/alonline/ (displayed below): since the information is
being continually updated, bookmark the site.


In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina



In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina's August 29 landfall on the Gulf
Coast, the fate of many of the region's libraries is still uncertain.
American Libraries will post news of any library-related damage on an
ongoing basis as we learn of it. Watch this site for updates.

Vanderbilt Hustler campus newspaper, Nashville, Tennessee, August 31:
The severity of the Katrina-related storms in Memphis August 30 flooded the
basement of Rhodes College's brand new library, which will remain closed
until it is fully repaired.

Houston (Tex.) Chronicle, August 31:

Craig Nocaise, 21, a police officer, waited out the storm inside the Pass
Christian (Miss.) Public Library, a branch of the Harrison County Library
System, with 12 other town police. They noticed about a dozen of their
police cars circling the building on a current of water. Then one crashed
through the front door. Water poured in and rose quickly.
When the back glass door wouldn't open, the officers pulled their guns and
fired at least 50 rounds into it before it shattered. They each then grabbed
a cable line and climbed onto the roof, where they spent the next three
hours in 130-mile-an-hour winds. "We lost every patrol car," said Nocaise.
"We still haven't found some. They're probably in the Gulf somewhere." Asked
more about the experience in the library, Nocaise choked up and walked away.

Baltimore (Md.) Sun, August 31:

In Gulfport, Mississippi, Katrina chewed up such everyday items as
furniture, computers, and a piano and spat them back onto the city's
crumbling streets and beaches. In what was once the public library, wet
books formed a mound of soggy pulp.

Biloxi (Miss.) Sun-Herald, August 29:

In Gulfport, windows were blown out and the business district was partially
underwater. The damage was described by Fire Chief Pat Sullivan as
"massive." Waves were breaking across U.S. 90 and there was water standing
in the Gulfport Library.

Biloxi (Miss.) Sun-Herald, August 30:

Beauvoir, the Jefferson Davis home in Biloxi: The bottom floor of the
Presidential Library and the home itself were gutted. A Confederate flag,
though, still draped over the arm of Davis's statue in the library.

Jackson (Miss.) Clarion-Ledger, August 31:

The University of Southern Mississippi, Alcorn State University, and Jackson
State University, as well as private Tougaloo College, remained without
power and communication access on Tuesday afternoon. On Tuesday at JSU,
students slept on makeshift beds in the student union and library, where
generators could provide light.

"I would say 90 percent of the structures between the beach and the railroad
in Biloxi, Gulfport, Long Beach, and Pass Christian are totally destroyed,"
Gov. Haley Barbour said Tuesday. "They're not severely damaged, they're
simply not there. . . . I can only imagine that this is what Hiroshima
looked like 60 years ago."

Cincinnati (Ohio) Post, August 31:

Kentucky Gov. Ernie Fletcher declared a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon
because of the heavy Katrina-related rains. The order triggered
implementation of the Kentucky Emergency Management Plan, which coordinates
response and relief activities in response to the emergency. The heavy rain
exacerbated leaks at the three-year-old Boone County Justice Center in
Burlington, Kentucky. "I've never seen anything like it," said Union,
Kentucky, attorney Edwin Kagin. There was a leak in the fourth floor men's
bathroom, which deputy sheriffs closed down, he said, and a leak in the law
library. "I couldn't believe it. I was in the law library and I hear this
plunk, and there's a bucket catching water," he said.

Tyler (Tex.) Morning Telegraph, August 31:

Tyler Public Library sent its bookmobile to the hurricane shelter Tuesday
afternoon. It provided books, magazines, and other reading material to
evacuees from Louisiana.

Other sources:

Evacuees from New Orleans are also being sent to the Houston area. The
Harris County Public Library in Humble, Texas, north of Houston, has
announced that evacuees are being given full residential privileges by the
library.

Water Damage FAQ:

The ALA Library has a fact sheet with some links to sites on the proper
steps to take in cleaning up a library after a disaster.

Did New Orleans Catastrophe Have to Happen?
'Times-Picayune' Had Repeatedly Raised Federal Spending Issues
By Will Bunch

PHILADELPHIA - Even though Hurricane Katrina has moved well north of the
city, the waters may still keep rising in New Orleans late on Tuesday.
That's because Lake Pontchartrain continues to pour through a
two-block-long break in the main levee, near the city's 17th Street Canal.
With much of the Crescent City some 10 feet below sea level, the rising
tide may not stop until it's level with the massive lake.

New Orleans had long known it was highly vulnerable to flooding and a
direct hit from a hurricane. In fact, the federal government has been
working with state and local officials in the region since the late 1960s
on major hurricane and flood relief efforts. When flooding from a massive
rainstorm in May 1995 killed six people, Congress authorized the Southeast
Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project, or SELA.

Over the next 10 years, the Army Corps of Engineers, tasked with carrying
out SELA, spent $430 million on shoring up levees and building pumping
stations, with $50 million in local aid. But at least $250 million in
crucial projects remained, even as hurricane activity in the Atlantic
Basin increased dramatically and the levees surrounding New Orleans
continued to subside.

Yet after 2003, the flow of federal dollars toward SELA dropped to a
trickle. The Corps never tried to hide the fact that the spending
pressures of the war in Iraq, as well as homeland security -- coming at
the same time as federal tax cuts -- was the reason for the strain. At
least nine articles in the Times-Picayune from 2004 and 2005 specifically
cite the cost of Iraq as a reason for the lack of hurricane- and
flood-control dollars.

Newhouse News Service, in an article posted late Tuesday night at The
Times-Picayune Web site, reported: "No one can say they didn't see it
coming. ... Now in the wake of one of the worst storms ever, serious
questions are being asked about the lack of preparation."

In early 2004, as the cost of the conflict in Iraq soared, President Bush
proposed spending less than 20 percent of what the Corps said was needed
for Lake Pontchartrain, according to a Feb. 16, 2004, article, in New
Orleans CityBusiness.

On June 8, 2004, Walter Maestri, emergency management chief for Jefferson
Parish, Louisiana; told the Times-Picayune: "It appears that the money has
been moved in the president's budget to handle homeland security and the
war in Iraq, and I suppose that's the price we pay. Nobody locally is
happy that the levees can't be finished, and we are doing everything we
can to make the case that this is a security issue for us."

Also that June, with the 2004 hurricane season starting, the Corps'
project manager Al Naomi went before a local agency, the East Jefferson
Levee Authority, and essentially begged for $2 million for urgent work
that Washington was now unable to pay for. From the June 18, 2004
Times-Picayune:

"The system is in great shape, but the levees are sinking. Everything is
sinking, and if we don't get the money fast enough to raise them, then we
can't stay ahead of the settlement," he said. "The problem that we have
isn't that the levee is low, but that the federal funds have dried up so
that we can't raise them."

The panel authorized that money, and on July 1, 2004, it had to pony up
another $250,000 when it learned that stretches of the levee in Metairie
had sunk by four feet. The agency had to pay for the work with higher
property taxes. The levee board noted in October 2004 that the feds were
also now not paying for a hoped-for $15 million project to better shore up
the banks of Lake Pontchartrain.

The 2004 hurricane season was the worst in decades. In spite of that, the
federal government came back this spring with the steepest reduction in
hurricane and flood-control funding for New Orleans in history. Because of
the proposed cuts, the Corps office there imposed a hiring freeze.
Officials said that money targeted for the SELA project -- $10.4 million,
down from $36.5 million -- was not enough to start any new jobs.

There was, at the same time, a growing recognition that more research was
needed to see what New Orleans must do to protect itself from a Category 4
or 5 hurricane. But once again, the money was not there. As the
Times-Picayune reported last Sept. 22:

"That second study would take about four years to complete and would cost
about $4 million, said Army Corps of Engineers project manager Al Naomi.
About $300,000 in federal money was proposed for the 2005 fiscal-year
budget, and the state had agreed to match that amount. But the cost of the
Iraq war forced the Bush administration to order the New Orleans district
office not to begin any new studies, and the 2005 budget no longer
includes the needed money, he said."

The Senate was seeking to restore some of the SELA funding cuts for 2006.
But now it's too late.

One project that a contractor had been racing to finish this summer: a
bridge and levee job right at the 17th Street Canal, site of the main
breach on Monday.

The Newhouse News Service article published Tuesday night observed, "The
Louisiana congressional delegation urged Congress earlier this year to
dedicate a stream of federal money to Louisiana's coast, only to be
opposed by the White House. ... In its budget, the Bush administration
proposed a significant reduction in funding for southeast Louisiana's
chief hurricane protection project. Bush proposed $10.4 million, a sixth
of what local officials say they need."

Local officials are now saying, the article reported, that had Washington
heeded their warnings about the dire need for hurricane protection,
including building up levees and repairing barrier islands, "the damage
might not have been nearly as bad as it turned out to be."

that newspaper, Attytood.

Does anyone out there know of any essays interpreting Oppen via Emmanuel Levinas?  I had come across reference to an upcoming article, though I'm not able to remember exactly where.

Thanks in advance,
Eric Hoffman
