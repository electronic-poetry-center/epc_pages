What I or the poets I publish do with our books (or what you do with yours, Doug) is another matter--beyond author copies they've been paid for. I wrote as a publisher. I can't publish if I don't sell books, and libraries are important customers. So I expect to be paid.

As an author I find the idea that I should be honored if someone accepts a freebie a bit strange. I do realize that in the world as it is poetry is a hard sell, and I make sure that poets I admire get copies of my books. But I don't write as a hobby. I also don't write for my books to be preserved as if mummified.

Try asking a baker how honored he is if you eat his bread without paying.

Cathleen, I appreciate your frustration. Library budgets aren't what they used to be. When I started out a small publisher could count on 500 library sales--it's what kept presses going. It's really a question of who pays for the changes we've all faced.

Doug, for the life of me I don't understand your anger. I wasn't trying to legislate anybody else's behavior, but apparently I struck a nerve. What nerve that was is mysterious to me.

One of my authors asked me to send books to Doug. So I will. If Doug had
not posted a message here, that author would not have asked me to do
that. That would be sad.

Issue twenty-six of Otoliths <http://the-otolith.blogspot.com/>, the
southern winter issue, has just gone live.



It's a great & wide-ranging issue as always, but I've run out of
superlatives. So, instead, a minimalist introduction.

Subject:      rob curates TRUCK during the month of August,

During the month of August, I'll be curating Halvard Johnston's blog, TRUCK,
and daily posting new work by various Canadian writers.

This is the same site where Christine McNair and I first premiered our
work-in-progress collaborative work (which has yet to figure out a title),
a work that recently produced a small fragment as an above/ground press
chapbook.

Given that TRUCK originates in the tri-state area, I wanted to find a wide
array of Canadian writers to introduce to American audiences, to further
previous sections I've edited on and by Canadians such as the three
features I edited for Jacket ("Some Canadian poets," "George Bowering at
70" and "Douglas Barbour at 70"), or dusie 10: the Canadian issue.

http://robmclennan.blogspot.ca/2012/08/rob-curates-truck-during-month-of-august.html

Be sure to check the site every morning to see just who might be featured,
each with a poem, a bio and an attractive photo. The first poet is Nikki
Reimer, recently returned to Calgary from Vancouver.

halvard-johnson.blogspot.com/2012/08/southern-alberta-poems-by-nikki-reimer.html

Watch for new work over the coming days by Jake Kennedy and kevin
mcpherson eckhoff, Camille Martin, Stan Rogal, Kathryn MacLeod, Natalee
Caple, Gil McElroy, Monty Reid, Daphne Marlatt, Nathan Dueck, Amanda Earl,
Sandra Ridley, Marilyn Irwin, Cameron Anstee and plenty of others. Enjoy!

Truck's new driver for August
*Many thanks to Elizabeth Switaj for taking Truck through the splashy,
water-slick roads of July.*
*
*
*Our driver starting tomorrow, and for the entire month of August is rob
mclennan. The keys, rob, are . . . well, I guess they're wherever Elizabeth
they hid them. Buen viaje.*

   really used that space, that could have only been done in that space. A
   lot of people have described coming in and seeing the raw floors and

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

The University of New Orleans Press has been put on "haitus" and its
modivating editor fired. The presumptive reason was that of budget
constraints, but in fact the Press was self-sustaining and cost-free. It
also published an international range of writers, many of them prize
winners or otherwise notable. Bill Lavender had, in fact, taken a rather
lifeless creature in 2007 an enlivened it with over 100 publications, a
remarkable achievement.

In support of the Press and in support of Bill Lavender and in support of
fine literature and good reading, please visit UNO Press's site and then
consider signing a petition indicating your support.

If one of my authors asked me to send books to Doug I'd ask him/her to pay for it at the usual author's discount. If he/she refused that would be sad.

I do initial runs of 300 (digital printing, yay!), of which 100 are hors commerce--author copies (10 percent of every run), review copies, friends of the press. I'm plenty generous. I also periodically have sales at ridiculous discounts. But the schnorers come out anyway--the "reviewers" who don't review, the libraries who think they're doing me a favor, the poets or publishers I have no interest in who want to trade books. I have my limits. You have yours too, but they're different from mine. That's ok with me. But don't think that yours correspond with some sort of self-evident rightness.

Hi. This is going to just a few people, mostly alums, who will have nothing
to lose by posting this info. Some of the students have started a petition
and I would really appreciate if you could post a link on facebook.

Some of you don't even know what I'm taking about; see below for that:

Here is the petition:
http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/president-of-the-university-of-new-or=
leans-louisiana-maintain-bill-lavender-as-the-director-of-uno-s-low-residen=
cy-mfa

Also, here is the FB page devoted to the issue:
http://www.facebook.com/SaveTheUnoLowResProgram

And for those of you who haven't heard, the story:

Below is an email I received from my Dean while I was in Edinburgh this
summer. I then  heard from my GA that they have changed the locks on my
office. I'll leave it to you to judge the fairness of this action after my
15 years at UNO during which I created and developed one of the most unique
and successful low res programs in the country.

Dear Bill=97The news I have for you is not good, and I apologize for relayi=

it through e-mail, rather than face-to-face.  But I completely understand
your wish to know the disposition of your employment as soon as possible.
Your position will be eliminated.  We have put the Press on hiatus and are
relocating the CWW Low-Res to an existing faculty member.



I would very much like you to work through the month of August, so that we
can make the transition as smooth as possible.  By working through August,
you will also complete 15 years of employment at UNO.  I encourage you
toseek advice from HR as soon as you return from your trip
to understand what benefits you are entitled to.



I am very sorry to bring you this news; although it does not make the news
any easier to swallow, I want to assure you that you are not alone.  During
this period, 19 Liberal Arts employees=97both faculty and staff=97are losin=

Please make an appointment to see me at your very earliest convenience when
you get back.

Sorry for the personal note.
I would like to share an article that appeared on the Times Picayune this
morning:

The entire saddest story:


Visionary director of UNO Press sacked amid budget cuts at the University
of New Orleans
Chris Waddington
Posted: 08/03/2012 6:49 PM


The director of UNO Press, the University of New Orleans=92 ambitious,
nationally regarded book publishing venture, will lose his job in the
current round of state-mandated budget cuts for public universities in
Louisiana.

Professor Bill Lavender, who also led UNO=92s Low Residency MFA and Creativ=
e
Writing Program, confirmed on Friday that his position at the press has
been eliminated. Lavender was the sole employee of the press, which he
operated with a staff of four graduate assistants. News of his departure
spread on the internet Thursday as authors and students began a petition
drive in support of the ousted writer. Lavender also lost his position with
the university=92s writing program for MFA students who did much of their
work online and met with faculty during brief, intensive residencies.

UNO spokesman Adam Norris declined to comment on changes at the press and
in the MFA program, noting that the school is still formulating its budget
plans and expects to make formal announcements about cuts in the coming
week.

The fate of the publishing venture remains unclear, Lavender said

=93I=92ve been asked to tell our authors that UNO is evaluating the press t=
o
determine what course of action the school will take with it in the
future,=94 Lavender said

Lavender transformed the publishing operation during his tenure. When he
took the reins in 2007, it had two out-of-print books in its inventory,
both by UNO faculty. Currently the press has about 80 titles in print. It
specializes in works in translation, including fiction and poetry by some
international figures who first appeared in English through UNO=92s program=
.
Lavender also forged an alliance with the popular Neighborhood Story
Project, published two oral histories about Hurricane Katrina, and
championed books like =93New Orleans: The Underground Guide,=94 a quirky
eccentric guide for tourists that sold especially well at local festivals.

Lavender attracted big names to the press, including the widely published
New Orleans fiction writer Moira Crone. Crone, who won a prestigious Robert
Penn Warren Award for Fiction, turned to UNO Press to publish her 2012
novel, =93The Not Yet.=94

=93As an author, I was delighted to work with a publisher that would take a
chance on a book that was way outside my usual kind of writing,=94 Crone
said. =93Bill encourages innovation in writers.=94

Crone also praised the innovative business model that Lavender created at
UNO Press.

=93I have never encountered a publisher =97 in New York or at other
universities =97 that was so agile, so savvy and responsive about publicity=
,
and so smart about using new technology and short print runs to keep costs
down,=94 Crone said. =93This wasn=92t a place with tons of books sitting ar=
ound
in boxes. They know how to get books into the hands of readers. The press
is a feather in the cap for New Orleans: a literary addition to the
international profile we already have as a port, a music center and a
culinary hub.=94

    George Quasha: "art is"

Tune in to hear this show.

Tune into free103point9 Online Radio and WGXC 90.7-FM for a special
radio iteration of George Quasha
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Quasha>'s expansive /art
is/Speaking Portraits/ project. This program will feature "radio
portraits" in-process and broadcast live from the free103point9 Wave
Farm Study Center and WGXC's Acra studio.

"*art is* ... what?" Quasha's ongoing video work of "speaking portraits"
puts this impossible, but inevitable, question before artists
themselves, who let us in on their private space of art definition.
Since 2002, he has filmed around 1000 artists of all kinds (including
sculptors, painters, filmmakers, video artists, poets, composers,
performance artists, dancers, potters, etc.) in 11 countries (and 24
languages!). The result is an ongoing and constantly changing work
called art is/music is/poetry is, which has been internationally
exhibited in museums and galleries, primarily as installations, screened
either as projections or on one or more monitors. You can see multiple
volumes online at quasha.com/art-is. <http://quasha.com/art-is>

Now, for the first time, /art is/ will be created live and unedited for
radio, where Quasha interacts with Hudson Valley artists of various
kinds as he asks them to say what, in their view, art or music or poetry
actually is. In his own view there is no "right" answer, but only the
ideas artists themselves work from, either implicitly or explicitly.
Many artist say that they don't know what art is, but in the process of
discussing it they discover that, often to their own surprise, they know
very well what it is. What if art is different for every person? In a
culture that tries to define things in the abstract, this could spur us
to think very differently about art and how it works in our lives and in
society at large. In art is the question comes alive in the moment as if
asked for the first time.

Visionary director of UNO Press sacked amid budget cuts at the University
of New Orleans
Published: Friday, August 03, 2012, 6:49 PM     Updated: Friday, August 03,
2012, 7:14 PM
 By Chris Waddington
The director of UNO Press, the University of New Orleans=92 ambitious,
nationally regarded book publishing venture, will lose his job in the
current round of state-mandated budget cuts for public universities in
Louisiana.

The Times-Picayune Archive
Bill Lavender, the New Orleans editor who led the UNO Press to national
prominence, has lost his job amid state-mandated budget cuts at the
University of New Orleans.
Professor Bill Lavender, who also led UNO=92s Low Residency MFA and Creativ=
e
Writing Program, confirmed on Friday that his position at the press has
been eliminated. Lavender was the sole employee of the press, which he
operated with a staff of four graduate assistants. News of his departure
spread on the internet Thursday as authors and students began a petition
drive in support of the ousted writer. Lavender also lost his position with
the university=92s writing program for MFA students who did much of their
work online and met with faculty during brief, intensive residencies.
UNO spokesman Adam Norris declined to comment on changes at the press and
in the MFA program, noting that the school is still formulating its budget
plans and expects to make formal announcements about cuts in the coming
week.
The fate of the publishing venture remains unclear, Lavender said
=93I=92ve been asked to tell our authors that UNO is evaluating the press t=
o
determine what course of action the school will take with it in the
future,=94 Lavender said
Lavender transformed the publishing operation during his tenure. When he
took the reins in 2007, it had two out-of-print books in its inventory,
both by UNO faculty. Currently the press has about 80 titles in print. It
specializes in works in translation, including fiction and poetry by some
international figures who first appeared in English through UNO=92s program=
.
Lavender also forged an alliance with the popular Neighborhood Story
Project, published two oral histories about Hurricane Katrina, and
championed books like =93New Orleans: The Underground Guide,=94 a quirky
eccentric guide for tourists that sold especially well at local festivals.
Lavender attracted big names to the press, including the widely published
New Orleans fiction writer Moira Crone. Crone, who won a prestigious Robert
Penn Warren Award for Fiction, turned to UNO Press to publish her 2012
novel, =93The Not Yet.=94
=93As an author, I was delighted to work with a publisher that would take a
chance on a book that was way outside my usual kind of writing,=94 Crone
said. =93Bill encourages innovation in writers.=94
Crone also praised the innovative business model that Lavender created at
UNO Press.
=93I have never encountered a publisher =97 in New York or at other
universities =97 that was so agile, so savvy and responsive about publicity=
,
and so smart about using new technology and short print runs to keep costs
down,=94 Crone said. =93This wasn=92t a place with tons of books sitting ar=
ound
in boxes. They know how to get books into the hands of readers. The press
is a feather in the cap for New Orleans: a literary addition to the
international profile we already have as a port, a music center and a
culinary hub.=94

Hi,

While doing some archival research recently, I came across
correspondence relating to an LP anthology of poets reading their work,
that was being planned by Carl Larsen's 7 Poets Press (sometimes written
"Seven Poets Press") around August 1961. I am wondering if the project
was ever seen through to publication. Does anybody know?

Thanks,
Robert Dewhurst

"Basil's Arc - The Paintings and Poetics of Basil King" will be presented a=
t Anthology Film Archives (Maya Deren Theatre) on September 22, 2012 from n=
oon to 6pm.

A celebration of the visual art of Basil King, now in his 77th year, the pr=
ogram includes conversations on King's  art (illustrated with slides) by no=
ted critics and poets, original music inspired by his images and his texts =
and will culminate in the debut screening of Basil King: Mirage, a film por=
trait created by Nicole Peyrafitte and Miles Joris-Peyrafitte, commissioned=
 by the Friends of Basil King.

What does it mean when a small group of poets join together to create such =
an event?  While a growing circle of readers recognize and cherish King's i=
nventive literary output, exhibitions of his visual art have been confined =
to "literary" venues-Poets House, the Poetry Project, the Bowery Poetry Clu=
b, the old Gotham Bookmart.

The Friends - Mitch Highfill, Vincent Katz, Burt Kimmelman, Martha King, an=
d Kimberly Lyons-are determined to introduce his visual art to a wider audi=
ence.

King's syncretic aesthetics have been shaped by his early childhood in WWII=
 London, friendship with poets of the San Francisco Renaissance, Abstract E=
xpressionist painters and poets in New York, and mentors and friends at Bla=
ck Mountain College, including Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, and John Wien=
ers. His past 40 years have been spent in studios in Brooklyn where King co=
ntinues to live, paint, and write poetry. His most recent writing, compleme=
nting his prodigious output of paintings, is the book, Learning to Draw/A H=
istory (Skylight Press, 2012) and chapbooks from Cy Gist and fewer & furthe=
r Press.  He has also continued his history of providing art for small pres=
s poetry publications by friends and colleagues.

Participants in the program at Anthology include Edna Augusta, William Bent=
on, Laurie Duggan, Tom Fink,  Paolo Javier, Andrew Levy, Harry Lewis, Tom P=
atterson, George Quasha, Barry Schwabsky, and each of the Friends.

Thanks.

Hello beautiful people,

/Unlikely Stories/ and Revolution Theory will be sponsoring the 2012
event for 100 Thousand Poets for Change in Lafayette, Louisiana!

There's a worldwide trend in 100TPC events to combine poetry and music,
and we'll be going with that, featuring:
Cajun/zydeco by Papa Delta and The Zigzag Wanderers
R&B by Angie Joell
Spoken word by Revolution Theory, Project S.O.U.N.D. and the St.
Martinville High School Dead Poets' Society
Poetry by Darrell Bourque, Marthe Reed, Jerry McGuire, and /Unlikely/
regular Michael Harold
and Delta Papa will retake the stage to participate alongside a spoken
word open mic

All poets and spoken word artists in the area should feel free to
contact me or Jessica Bordelon of Revolution Theory if they'd like to be
involved.

The event will be held at:
Cité des Arts
109 Vine St.
in downtown Lafayette, Louisiana
Saturday, Sept. 29, 6pm
(note that there are some announcements floating around the Internet
with an afternoon time. That has been changed. The correct time is 6pm,
to wrap up by 10pm.)

Check out http://unlikelystories.org/blog/content/?p=606 or
http://www.unlikelystories.org/pdfs/100tpc_2012_lafayette_6pm.pdf for
the poster or https://www.facebook.com/events/338362036250654/ for the

Hope to see you there!

"On Saturday, August 10, 2012, Ottawa poet, performer and publisher
jwcurry held the tenth edition of his ongoing Messagio Galore performances
at the Rockcliffe Park Pavilion in Rockcliffe Park, featuring "a variety of
sound poetry & similaria" performed by himself, Rachel Lindsey, Sheena
Mordasiewiez, Brian Pirie and Zachary Robert, with additional fill-ins by
former Messagio regular Alistair Larwill. I'm pretty sure that I've now
witnessed all but three of his Messagio performances (the third was in
Calgary and the previous was held in Toronto), and he has utilized a variety
of voices over the years, including Christine McNair, Grant Wilkins,
Sandra Ridley, Peter Norman, Lesley Marshall, Nicholas Power, Rob Read,
Roland Prevost, John Lavery, ross priddle, Laurie Fuhr, Maria Erskine, Max
Middle and Carmel Purkis.[...]"

Two new posts at Retort Magazine;=20
http://retortmagazine.com/live/

Four new poems by Noel Black:=20

from "Sky"-

Words are so stupid. I hate when writers say,
=E2=80=9CI love words.=E2=80=9D What does that even mean?

and from Ozymandias-

=E2=80=9CI am Ozymandias
king of this little fish castle.
Look upon my weird modern apartment novelty fish tank,
ye mighty ,and despair!=E2=80=9D

http://retortmagazine.com/live/2012/08/four-by-noel-black/



And introducing the G8 Lollies by Siarhei Tserasiuk

You have to see them to believe them!
All-day suckers - 8 of them; Obama, Merkel, Putin, et. al.

=
http://retortmagazine.com/live/2012/08/g8-lollipops-by-siarhei-tserasiuk/

=E2=80=9CG8 lollies: more color, more taste=E2=80=9D is a series of =
lollipops. The series=E2=80=A8 consists of small portraits 3D of the G8 =
leaders; 8 faces in total. All made of sugar. You can buy and eat them, =
lick them, suck them or throw them away =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s up to =
you.
=E2=80=9CFor the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil=E2=80=9D =
I once read in one book. The idea of human supremacy in this world is an =
illusion, since none of us can continue his/her life forever or predict =
what is going to happen tomorrow. We are born naked and leave this earth =
the same way. But still many think they are very powerful, and can make =
decisions about lives of others, etc. Eight all-day suckers.

ARY U.S. POETRY / LYRIC PROSE / POETICS =0A=0A"The formal inventiveness of =
Mary Burger's writing in part derives from her questioning of received idea=
s but also from the sheer pleasure she seems to take in following what the =
sentence can do within the "as-yet as-ever still-undetermined space between=
=A0send=A0and=A0receive." The attempt in these poems-in-prose, which are al=
so essays or essay-like poetic inventions, is critical (as in critique and =
crucial):=A0to make more real what is covered over and abstracted, not by s=
implifying but activating the thinking writer's experience of those cultura=
l, philosophical, scientific, and social logics that imagine their target a=
udiences ("us") to be objects merely of affirmation and compliance."=A0CARL=

=0A=0A"Vulnerability, fragility, and anxiety are all flushed out into the o=
pen here and addressed with such strong sound and rhythm that we recognize =
a resilient, defiant strength within them. King puts relentless pressure on=
 forces seemingly beyond our reach and, in bringing them closer, exposes th=
eir own vulnerable centers. This is a poetry equally committed to language =
as a tool with social obligations and language as an art material obligated=
 to reveal its own beauty. King's language does both magnificently."=A0COLE=

to a ritualistic text, a celebration of witnessing, of the minute manifesta=
tions of reality. Brandon Shimoda barely touches his own words: they come t=
o him from afar, float, take a sigh, haunt us and disappear, reappear on th=
e next page, follow their obscure journey--in that we become bound to hear =
them, we follow them--they make a poem we want to read, and reread with clo=

Useful for creative writing (at least in terms of poetry) that I've
found particularly interesting and useful (students particularly like
the first one) are:

The Art of Recklessness, by Dean Young --  "We are making birds, not
birdcages."
and
Poets on teaching: a sourcebook, ed. by Joshua Marie Wilkinson



More wreck and less discourse -- Hopkins

We are very pleased to announce the new staff and review structure at
http://www.UnlikelyStories.org/ . First, we'd like to welcome Frankie
Metro to the tribe. Frankie is a well-published author of prose/ essays/
poems/ flash fiction/ haibuns/ senryus/ short stories and stuff. His
latest chapbook, "The Anarchist's Blac Book of Poetry," is now available
from Crisis Chronicles Press. He'll be working with Margret Crist on our
music selections, as well as blogging and reviewing books.

With Frankie's help, we're now accepting books (primarily of creative
writing), films, music, and theatre productions in the SF Bay area for
review consideration. If you feel your work would be appropriate, please
see http://www.unlikelystories.org/mission.shtml#criticism for specific

I am surprised that Jeffrey Side thought that the Buffalo Poetics  Listserv
might be interested in his diatribe(s) against me and his use of  private
correspondence to prove his single point, needlessly surfacing and
resurfacing Bobbi Lurie.

I was not planning to send my updated links to Buffalo Poetics Listserv,
but since Side seems to feel there might be interest in it, I'll post  them.
In my view, the most interesting of the posts is "American  Candid."

The first link below was not and has not been censored on the  Internet.
The second link is a reply to Jeffrey Side's first diatribe  against me at
his blog and has not been censored.  The third link is a  partial transcript
of a flaming thread against me started by Jeffrey Side at  Otherstream group
at Facebook that I read a week after it occurred on August 1,  2012 and
determined its genre "live theater."  The fourth link is a partly  censored item
(the original paragraph in English was censored twice; the
machine-translated German version and its machine-retranslated English version  were not
censored), both at Facebook Mad about Mad Hatters' group by Marc  Vincenz and
due to his diligence at Fictionaut, where Carol Novack had asked me  to
administer a small group for Mad Hatters' Review in the spirit of cooperation
and Marc Vincenz had later delegated to me the same duty.  I got Marc his
first job at Mad Hatters' Review, co-editor in poetry, in the first week of
October 2010, though he never stated his job title that way.  He stated on
the Internet editor in poetry.  Carol Novack who might know that best
besides the two of us has died.  In her will, she stated that her  friend and
caregiver, Douglas Querl, may stay at her house, deeded to Mad  Hat, a
non-profit she formed, as long as he likes and that her cats stay there  as well and
the house not be sold for 40 years.  It was to operate as a  writers'
retreat, overseen by Douglas or subsequent caretaker, and meeting place  for the
Mad Hatters' Review staff past and present.  The attorney in  Asheville who
wrote the will that Carol signed, Robert Karriker, later  discovered that as
a deceased person, Carol cannot decide what becomes of  the endowment or
properties within the non-profit.  The board of four  or five (names withheld)
wrote Douglas an eviction letter, came to the house and  removed the cats
and brought them to an undisclosed location (though there was a  picture of
Clicquot on Facebook being nuzzled by the Asheville bank  employee, friends
with Karriker, whom Carol met late in  life).

instrumentalist. With influences ranging from Patti Smith and Nirvana =20=

without hesitating to embrace melodic catchiness. Autostraddle calls =20
their latest EP Bleed Me "a panther"; "it=92s a little dark and =20
dangerous, it stalks and menaces and makes my heart thump that tiny =20
bit faster. This is not glossy music. Bleed Me serves up six tracks =20
ranging from gritty grunge to seductive melodic rock, each radiating =20
raw heat and energy that edges near NSFW."

Hi Everyone,

I'm needing to cite a quote attributed to Zukofsky, I believe, by Charles T=
omlinson in a memoir of his. It has to do with a remark LZ made about Bronk=
's poetry; asked about it he replied, "Oh, all that Stevensian bother."

I'm embarrassed that I can't find the source now, and am hoping someone can=
 save me here.

Thanks,

Burt

=A0and=C2=A0Sampson=C2=A0reading from their work:=0A=0AAna Bo=C5=BEi=C4=8De=
vi=C4=87 is both a poet's poet and the people's poet.=C2=A0Rise in the Fall=
, her second full-length collection, is a revolutionary book and an ars poe=
tica for the polis in which she excludes nothing. Navigating literary histo=
ry, gender, sexuality, economics, family and friends, she is at ease employ=
ing both the universal political statement and the lyric "I". A Croatian =
=C3=A9migr=C3=A9, Bo=C5=BEi=C4=8Devi=C4=87 approaches the English language =
with a playful objectivity, bouncing back and forth from the conversational=
 to the grand: "This is the whitest shit / I've ever written" she notes in =
her half-myth "About Nietzsche." Her critique of our time and place is at o=
nce empathetic and crude, tender and grotesque. Lucky for us, "beauty [wins=
] in all its casual terror and pain."=0A=0AWritten over ten years,=C2=A0The=
 First Four Books of Sampson Starkweather=C2=A0is surreal but always ground=
ed in the life of the poet. Comprised of experimental translations, emails,=
 dreams, spells, prose, advice, and mythologies (among other things), these=
 poems transform and steal from literary history, current events, technolog=
y, and the world. Just as Starkweather questions what makes a poem, his fir=
st book completely questions and reinterprets what a first book=E2=80=94or =
any book=E2=80=94of poems can be.=0A=0ALove,=0A=0Athe Editors

PEDESTRIAN SPEECH ACTS will document and continue an ongoing project of walking concrete poems on the surface of Chicago.

On August 25th, members of the group will walk a new poem in the Wicker Park neighborhood concurrently with a reading/discussion and installation at Outer Space Studio.  The event will conclude with a shared meal in Wicker Park and is guest curated by Andrew Cantrell.

I'm needing to cite a quote attributed to Zukofsky, I believe, by Charles T=

Comments: To: UKPOETRY@listserv.muohio.edu
MIME-Version: 1.0

Hello All -

The latest release from quarter after press is Joel Chace's *Red Power:
http://quarterafter.org/2012/08/17/red-power-joel-chace/*

*With a nod toward Tristan Tzara's instructions for making a Dadaist poem
("take some scissors...."), Joel Chace's new book also takes its place among
a number of works that have put gravity in the service of chance. Like Hans
Arp's compositions of abstract geometric cut-outs or Jackson Pollock's
signature drips or Joan Retallack's paperclipped apertures in Afterrimages,
the poems here illuminate the extraordinary accident by which the aleatory
and precipitous are linked in both Latin and German. The chance [Zufall]
disposition of the words across the page in these poems is a singular event
[Fall] arising from the coincidences [from the Latin cadere: "to fall"] of
falling [fallend] along clinaminatic paths. The poet's gestures, however
often repeated, cannot account in advance for variables in atmospheric
conditions and the discrepant surface-areas of cut paper. The results,
happily, are frequently prophetic, describing their own circumstances with
a poetic obliquity. None of which should be surprising for a poet whose
name, as it happens, is just a letter drop away from chance.*

-- *Craig Dworkin*
**
*When I look at Joel Chace's work, I see a series that speaks in tongues
that spins out into eternity that hangs from Van Gogh's asylum like a
starry night.*

*The elements of this series are deceptively simple: cut up words,
punctuation, tape, and the background of the page.  The beauty of this
arrangement is how it all interacts; each word has multiple references,
creating a nearly infinite number of combinations.  Periods float, looking
for sentences to close. The page speaks its essence, a grey haze that
resembles dark matter that silently affects the overall mechanism. This
quantum field, this gravitational attraction, aids in poem formation,
pulling and tugging every word.*

*And then there's the tape; this is an aspect of cut up, of visual poetry,
of illustrations that each creator attempts to cover up.  Joel takes a bold
leap here and intentionally incorporates his tape, creating an extra level
of fog, words falling, sinking softly into a majestic black hole.*
*If you enjoy checking out a visual poetry series, this is the one.  Joel
brings us all closer to the ultimate source of creativity.  Any good visual
poet should enlighten any good visual poet; Joel is and does both, and who
could ask for more?*

 -- *Bill DiMichele*

All the Best,

Evan Jones has reported that Canadian poet Daryl Hine, former editor of
Poetry magazine, died on the 20th of August. See Lindsay Garbutt's post on
Harriet, the blog of the Poetry Foundation here, and another by Carmine
Starnino (with more recent photo), on the Vehicule Press blog.

Hello

I'm pleased to announce this new translation of *Beowulf* by the poet
Thomas Meyer, just released by Punctum Books:

http://punctumbooks.com/titles/thomas-meyer-beowulf/

This is an open access publication, which means it's available for free
download; however, there is also an option to purchase a physical copy of
the book, and I would urge anyone who's interested in Tom's work, Old
English poetry, or supporting independent publishers to buy a copy.

Tom's translation was done 40 years ago during his studies at Bard, and
it's pretty groundbreaking, especially compared to what poets have usually
done with this poem. Check it out!

from "The Amateur Scientistâ€™s Notebook: Floret as Bird"

What is hunger if I once listened to a floret
slurp spilt water into soil, its sex a spore on wind,
a single seed left for a bird to eat. With any certainty
I could not call you bird. I could not call you
anything other thanâ€”Like, say, in the shallows
of the river we laid crawdad traps until our fingers pruned.
 From the bankâ€™s oxblood-colored body we uprooted
clay, molded wet grains into plates, set them on some
stones to harden. Shoes soaked in silt, we swelled,
a hunger heavy as a field of florets, feathers
dreamed to sprout from skin. A hunger of when one
is lost once in another. Anything other thanâ€”
(Whether we notice the moth at the lamp,
or its shadow winged on the wall).
We were privy to all manner of underhanded shit.
We were a kind of happiness, meaning
â€œmomentarily without guiltâ€
or, â€œnot poised to attack.â€
Or astonishment:  the work
of becoming another.
The stalled animal of the body at rest.
Hair collecting in the comb.
A single wire, unbending.

There=92s a terrific review of Sonnets (Shearsman Books, 2010) by C. L.
Bledsoe at Murder Your Darlings. I say =93terrific=94 not only because it=
=92s a
positive review (music to any poet=92s ears) but also because the reviewer
quotes from and discusses several poems in the book. It=92s a mindful revie=

and it=92s evident he didn=92t just skim the book but read slowly and
attentively.

The music-to-my-ears part (be thankful you can't see my happy dance):

=93Martin=92s poems are complex and elegant. She reveals a vital, passionat=

intellect in these poems that move fast as river water after a spring thaw.
I can=92t wait to read her next collection.=94
