Assuming I'm not off base in this that I posted to a psychologists'
listserv:
"In _Imagination and the Meaningful Brain, Modell has some interesting
things to say about therapy and poetry and touches on Bakhtin's Diological
Imagination.  The idea of poetry as process constructed collaboratively by
writer and reader rather than printed as classics to be studied is a major
impetus behind 'expermental' poetry of the last century."
I'd be interested in suggestions of readings to give them a flavor of what
poetry is today.

Dean Not Progressive on Mideast
By Ahmed Nassef, AlterNet
June 30, 2003
Although often portrayed as progressive, former Vermont governor and
Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean falls short on several issues
important to progressives, with the Middle East being one of the more glaring.
True, Dean is one of the Democratic presidential hopefuls who opposed the
invasion of Iraq (along with Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich, conservative Sen.
Bob Graham, former Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, and Rev. Al
Sharpton), but he is closer to a hawk when it comes to Israel/Palestine and
U.S. policy toward Iran.
In a major foreign policy speech earlier this year, Dean, while calling for
an end to Palestinian violence, did not call for an end to Israeli
violence, let alone an end to the illegal Israeli occupation.
And when asked whether his views are closer to the dovish Americans for
Peace Now (APN) or the right-wing, Sharon-supporting American Israel Public
Affairs Committee (AIPAC), he stated unequivocally in an interview with the
Jewish weekly The Forward, "My view is closer to AIPAC's view."
"At one time the Peace Now view was important, but now Israel is under
enormous pressure. We have to stop terrorism before peace negotiations," he
said.
Similarly, Dean's official campaign position on solving the
Palestinian-Israeli problem is that "terrorism against Israel must end,"
but there is no mention of the Israeli violence that has resulted in over
2,391 deaths since September 2000.
Last December, Dean told the Jerusalem Post that he unequivocally supported
$8 billion in U.S. loan guarantees for Israel. "I believe that by providing
Israel with the loan guarantees ... the US will be advancing its own
interest," he said. His unconditional support for the loan package, in
addition to $4 billion in outright grants, went further than even some of
the most pro-Israel elements in the Bush administration, like Paul
Wolfowitz, who wanted to at least include some vague restrictions like
pushing Israel to curtail new settlements and accept a timetable to
establish a Palestinian state.
On the illegal Israeli settlements, Dean seems to be waffling of late. A
pro-Dean blog quotes his campaign as calling for the ultimate removal of
only "a number of existing settlements." (The link back to the official
site was no longer operational as of this writing.) However, in what may
signal a softening of his position to woo progressive voters in the just
passed MoveOn.org PAC Democratic "primary" vote, Dean called last month for
"ultimately dismantling the settlements." So which one is it?
(Dean won the MoveOn vote, but did not secure the 50 percent majority
needed to gain the PAC's support. More rounds of voting will take place.)
In fact, Dean's alignment with AIPAC and their right-wing politics goes
much deeper than aligning with the group's platform. Last year, he named
Steven Grossman, a former AIPAC head, as his campaign's chief fundraiser.
Soon after, he flew to Israel on an AIPAC-sponsored junket.
And in a telling statement about whether a President Dean would act any
differently toward Iran than the Bush neocons, Dean also told The Forward,
"The United States has to ... take a much harder line on Iran and Saudi
Arabia because they're funding terrorism."
In fact, Dean thinks President Bush is way too soft on Iran. In a March
appearance on CBS' "Face the Nation," Dean explained that "[President Bush]
is beholden to the Saudis and the Iranians," something that would certainly
come as a surprise to the current regime leaders in Iran who've been
labeled as part of an alleged "Axis of Evil" by the current U.S. president.
Dean even left open the possibility of preemptive strikes against that
country in that interview, adding that "we have to be very, very careful of
Iran."
Once again, sounding very much like President Bush, Dean charged during a
New Hampshire campaign stop this month that Iran (along with Saudi Arabia,
Syria, and Libya) was "funding Palestinian terrorists and fueling terrorism
throughout the world."
Apparently, there is another side to this "anti-war" candidate. When
combined with his dubious record as governor on issues like welfare
"reform" and gun control, it may be prudent for progressives to think twice
before casting their vote for Howard Dean.

my u-grad students love spicer.  i teach him in the context of a kind
of bitchy intertextuality, sniping at other poets. maybe it makes
them feel smart, or like it's okay to make fun of other poets.

        Kerouac's Johnson's Corner Moved in Colo. =20

      LONGMONT, Colo. - Johnson's Corner, the gas station and eatery =
described in Jack Kerouac's "On the Road," has been moved from the spot =
where the Beat poet found it.=20

      The rare precast concrete, 1937 art-deco structure, designed by =
Denver architect Eugene Groves, was moved Sunday to its new home in =
Prospect New Town, a development about a mile south of its former =
location on Longmont's Main Street.=20

      Kerouac describes taking a nap under a tree at a gas station =
fitting its description and then ordering a creamy milkshake.=20

      "It's on the road," said Mark Sofield, the development's designer. =
"I think he'd appreciate it if he were here. We're going to have to =
replace the tree."=20

      Historical preservation activists, among others, battled for 18 =
months to save the building, which had last been used as an office for a =
car lot, finally raising the $160,000 needed to move and establish a new =
home for the structure.=20

      The Colorado Department of Transportation had planned to raze the =
structure to make room for the extension of a highway.=20

      Although Kerouac didn't mention the curvy filling station trimmed =
with molded dental details by name, the book includes a description of a =
place presumed to be Johnson's Corner.=20

      Sofield said they hope to raise money to restore the building and =
possibly convert it into an eatery.=20

MASS WORLDWIDE PROTEST DURING THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN
NEW YORK CITY: SUNDAY, AUGUST 29, 2004

In the last three years, George W. Bush has presided over
a radical right-wing takeover of the U.S. government whose
ramifications have been felt all over the world. Not only
has he waged two wars, killing thousands of innocent
people, during his short time in office, but he has also
implemented a policy of pre-emptive war that violates
international law and threatens global security. On the
home front, unemployment soars, the federal budget deficit
swells into the billions, and states prepare to slash
funding for everything from healthcare to education, yet
Bush responded with two huge tax cut that will primarily
benefit the wealthy rather than the people who are most in
need.

On every issue - from environmental regulations and
international treaty participation to worker rights, civil
rights and civil liberties - George W. Bush has pushed for
unprecedented and destructive changes in U.S. foreign and
domestic policy that even more sharply favor corporations
and the wealthy, especially Bush Administration supporters
at the expense of the people of the world and our
environment.

Meanwhile, the Bush Administration shamelessly uses the
tragic attacks of September 11, 2001 to justify its
aggressive and militaristic policies. In its most recent
attempt to exploit the grief and fear that were provoked
after September 11, the Republican Party pushed back its
2004 convention to August 28 - September 2, 2004 and will
hold it in New York City, not far from Ground Zero.

SAVE THE DATE: ON AUGUST 29, 2004, THE WORLD SAYS NO TO
BUSH

On February 15, 2003, millions of people all over the
world took to the streets in protest with the message The
World Says No to War. On August 29, 2004, we will come
together in New York City and in cities throughout the
world to say The World Says No to Bush!

We are also organizing a protest for Thursday, Sept. 2,
2004, the day of Bush's official selection as the
presidential candidate of the Republican Party.

Initiated by United for Peace and Justice
(http://www.unitedforpeace.org ), a U.S. anti-war
coalition with more than 600 member groups. UFPJ looks
forward to working with many other organizations on this
day of protest, so please contact us at
info@unitedforpeace.org if your group wants to work
collaboratively on these actions and to let us know about
other actions being planned to coincide with the
Republican Convention.

Tom
First, my thoughts on this quote from your note: "...The idea of poetry =
as process constructed collaboratively by
writer and reader rather than printed as classics to be studied..."=20

Television producers across the country (and indeed in England, as =
perhaps elsewhere) have played with the idea of what they refer to as =
"interactive television."  You may recall that's tv programming in which =
the audience members will sit in their living rooms and write their own =
endings to the movie they are watching. =20

As I understand things, the process remains experimental because of both =
some hardware and some software developments that need to be fine-tuned. =
 The idea has some appeal as a mass audience entertainment device =
because the "happy ending" crowd will always be pleased with the way the =
movie ends.  Old Yeller won't ever have to die; Shane can be made to =
turn around and return to the ranch...life can become what ever the =
viewer imagines or desires.   Is that process in any way therapeutic?  =
Interesting thought that, and to my thinking, somewhat related to the =
idea "of poetry as process..."   =20

And of course, interactive poetry exists via the net, visit:
www.csd.net/~cantelow/poem_welcome.html - 7k - Cached - Similar pages=20

Or you may do a google on interactive poetry and find even more =
opportunities to participate in the process of creating a poem. =20

What poetry is today can best be experienced by visiting some of the =
hundreds...perhaps thousands of sites at which one may either read =
poetry written by others, write and post (publish in that "classics to =
be studied" sense) his/her own creations, or participate in the process =
of collaboratively creating a poem. =20

But, I'm fascinated by the idea of the process having therapeutic =
applications, and I'd appreciate your posting a small suggested reading =
list if you  wouldn't mind.

  Assuming I'm not off base in this that I posted to a psychologists'
  listserv:
  "In _Imagination and the Meaningful Brain, Modell has some interesting
  things to say about therapy and poetry and touches on Bakhtin's =
Diological
  Imagination.  The idea of poetry as process constructed =
collaboratively by
  writer and reader rather than printed as classics to be studied is a =
major
  impetus behind 'expermental' poetry of the last century."
  I'd be interested in suggestions of readings to give them a flavor of =
what
  poetry is today.

MIME-Version: 1.0

I may be overreacting and really it's a trivial matter, I suppose, what the
big wigs of world academic poetry cum Industry think of pop pan flashers but
my first reaction to Seamus Heaney's latest is this:

Oh, Gawd, more cause for puking. Joe Noble Laureate Heaney adopts Eminem
<Nobel laureate in praise of Eminem >. Play for new readers? What a fuckin
dork? Why is the news so depressing so often? Even I have better taste and
more wherewithal...

Nobel laureate in praise of Eminem

"Seamus Heaney, the Nobel laureate, today praised the US rap star Eminem,
saying the artist had 'sent a voltage around his generation.' "

Which is not to say I have any taste and wherewithal at all (in that I'm
bothering to comment on this, etc), but truly, there are a zillion pop music
and avant-garde musicians that would more properly and appropriately compare
with the Beatles, and the jerk Heaney's praising possesses little more
sensibility than the emperor in office at present.  Okay, it's a terribly
minor irritation, like a mosquito, but I still feel like there are just
sky's full of these mosquitos and they're infecting us bite by bite with
cultural malaise worse than any super strain of malaria.   Blah blah blah,
there are surely a zillion things more important to obsess about.  Just the
same, I think old Heaney's out of touch, so a pop music 15 minuteman gets
his kudos, forgiveable and predictable mistake for an old codger steeped in
straight white verse and safe literary history...

Last year I wrote (and published on-line) an essay
connecting Yoko Ono and Eminem. I was gratified to
read an interview with Ono (in the New Yorker no less)
in which she says Eminem is one of the only
contemporary musicians she listens to.

Hm.

joel;
probably the easiest place to find it is in _An H in the Heart: A Reader_
by bpNichol (edited by george bowering and michael ondaatje) Toronto: M&S,
1994. p. 220-222. (and followed immediately by 'the long weekend of louis
riel" a companion piece). bp's billy is the only small press (mimeo) book in
canadian history to win the governor general's award - which it shared with
3 other bp books, and ondaatje's billy as well (by co-incidence)
happy hunting!

so what's your problem with eminem?

aside from him being a "15 minuteman" and a "pan flash".

i personally find eminem's work quite compelling --political
incorrectness notwithstanding.  i'd heard all the flapdoodle, then
happened to come across one of his numbers on the car radio one day
(thanks Jack Spicer);, not knowing it was em, i was spellbound. once
i found out it was him i was a bit embarrassed but there you have it;
it's excellent for what it is. he's a wonderful story-teller.

Hmmm, getting whacked (back) hard for (careless?) semi-frustrated slam of
Heaney and Eminem
(so I know I must deserve at least some of it).
And/or perhaps for cliche Joe Anti-Mainstream stance adopted (all too easily
and kneejerky, too often).

Can't retract anything, and won't.  Nor can I make excuses.  Apologies to
those who felt offended.

"Eminem" in my head is culled from sporadic listenings at best, so I
probably shouldn't even have much of an opinion.
Have also adopted, I guess, "mainstream" or whatever criticism of Eminem
that the music is misogynist, etc.
Not sure, given the surface I have taken from TV and mainstream media
samples, that he's worth investigating more, but
I probably will, might even buy an album or something.  I don't think I'll
be able to rid myself of some kind of serious antagonism or repulsion
I DO have for "his" style and "art," or for much rap altogether, which
surely I am old and out of touch enough to "not get" (like maybe it's all
irony, parody of Might/Muscle/Machismo equals King Male in the middle and
40-50 female admirers, like maybe that's just an act meant
to shock people like me who are capable of showing pomposity and uptightness
they otherwise always drearily condemn in others), so I don't know.
So I'm sure I'll investigate a little, time permitting, and for now,
apologies to
those who dig Eminem or appreciate his music with wider range than I've
obviously exhibited.

Ditto Heaney, whose poetry I've only read here and there, and the "Heaney"
in my head is, like the "Eminem" in my head, surely more
a symbol of something I don't like than the real Heaney that closer readers
of his poetry would know and defend, rightfully so.

Just the same, that doesn't mean it isn't stupid of me to blast off another
"alienate the mainstream" diatribe preaching to the choir here and all, so
maybe I just plain fucked up good today, and will give it a rest.  Had a
hunch I was being quite trite making a big deal of a little note in the
newspaper, anyway.

Be back when I am more refreshed, have something fresh and more substantial
to post, lick my wounds, and maybe gain a little depth where presently there
is a bit of a lack at times.

Tomorrow's gonna be another day, Steve :)

Robert Duncan's
    LETTERS
    Poems 1953-56
Flood Editions ISBN 0-9710059-6-6 $16.95

is now available from Small Press Distribution
    www.spdbooks.org
    1-800-869-7553
or directly from the publisher

First published by the Jargon Society in 1958, LETTERS announces
the major phase of Robert Duncan's writing. Though long unavailable,
it stands as a foundational book of postmodern poetry, setting
"self-creation and self-consciousness in constant interplay" (in the
author's own words). Edited by Robert J. Bertholf, this new edition
includes an afterword as well as a series of memos from Duncan to
the typesetter Claude Fredericks. Also included are Duncan's original
illustrations for the book.

"The composition of Letters begins with 'Letter to Denise Levertov'
and moves out over almost three years' work to complete a book
presided over by an alphabet primary to world creation. These angelic
letters then those powers hidden or discovered are substance of our
speech. A naming of my peers, and an exclamation of joy: Denise
Levertov, Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, James Broughton, Mike McClure,
Helen Adam - it is the presence of companions, named and unnamed,
that inspires LETTERS. A book of primaries, a book of companions. A
book of praise. I have stored here, as best I know how, the songs of all
I live by. For I adhere to form as the bee obeys the geometry of the hive."

Hi Flood People: As an old poetry publisher - who's probably tried every
"gesture" in the book except the "author naked flash" trick (though I have
published a few poets a portion of whose audiences were more into getting as
close as visually, if not physically, possible to poet's body than any
meta-concept of text as pleasure),  can I ever so nobly suggest an excerpt
from the Duncan  a good lure for this particular work - particularly in the
light of Duncan's huge output, though who knows how much is still in print.

Thanks, Stephen Vincent

REMINDERS FOR INDEPENDENCE DAY, 2003


=93Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.=94  --  Thomas Jefferson

"Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever he shall deem=

 Founding=20
Fathers resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold=20
the power of bringing this oppression upon us."
         -- Representative Abraham Lincoln in a letter to William H. Herndon

"That there are men in all countries who get their living by war, and by=20
keeping up the quarrels of nations, is as shocking as it is true; but when=
=20
those who are concerned in the government of a country, make it their study=
=20
to sow discord, and cultivate prejudices between nations, it becomes the=20
more unpardonable."
         -- Thomas Paine, "The Rights of Man", circa 1792

=93In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of=
=20
unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the=20
military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of=20
misplaced power exists and will persist.  We must never let the weight of=20
this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should=

compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of=

defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty=20
may prosper together.=94
         --  Dwight D. Eisenhower (Republican), January 17, 1961

"I don't want to see a single war millionaire created in the United States=

as a result of this world disaster."
         -- Franklin D. Roosevelt

instruments of tyranny at home.=94

It may sound funny, but I've often wondered what kind of poet Eminem would have been in different circumstances. However you feel about his music and unsavory views, Slim Shady clearly has a powerful verbal gift - a way of spitting out words in patterns that stick to the brain. Who knows what he could write if he had a stronger education to go along with his witty streets smarts.

Or maybe Eminem was born to be just what he is: a popular artist who knows the value of controversy and has the talent to back it up. I think Heaney has gotten a whiff of something real, something that can't be created by music executives. Maybe that's worth something.

"Everybody only wants to dis-cuss me
So this must mean I'm dis-gusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
"Hey" there's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me.."

But, I'm fascinated by the idea of the process having therapeutic
applications, and I'd appreciate your posting a small suggested reading list
if you  wouldn't mind.
alex saliby


I'd be willing to post info from one list to the other if there were an
interest but basically process is therapy or therapy is process so almost
any book would be woth reading.  By the way, I wasn't referring to
specifically interactive poetry as much as all experimental poetry is by
it's nature interactive. Interesting idea, though.

I would agree that this is odd, but it's bad. If you don't like hip hop
that's ok, but it IS what rock 'n roll was to the kids way back when. Eminen
is not a poet, but a performer who's pop styles incorporate poetry. I'd say
Nelly is a better choice, or even Jay Z. But it may have to do with skin
color which is worse than hopping on the hip hop band waggon.

Best, Geoffrey

I agree w/ Geoffrey but I also happen to like Eminem and why not poetry?
It's definitely the cross-over thing but he's great at invention.

For some of us, just like rocknroll, if it doesn't disturb it's not poetry

eminem, as a storyteller, ranks quite below, say, what Ice-T was doing on
tracks like 'Six in the Morning' or 'The Tower', & what Ice Cube did on most
of 'Amerika's Most Wanted', or, for that matter, Slick Rick on 'La di da
di'...& the kind of things he talks about aren't anything new if you
listened to The Geto Boys or NWA's 'Straight Outta Compton'...as a lyricist
he's nowhere near as inventive as Chuck D, Michael Franti, KRS-One, or
numerous others...

seems to me that the fascination surrounding eminem is precisely his
whiteness (just as the 'crisis' surrounding school shootings didn't enter
the public consciousness in America until Columbine despite the fact that
for decades ghetto schools were frequent sites of such things)...his
thug-style (which, I'll give him, he brilliantly appropriated from Tupac
(eminem has went so far as to call himself a white 'Pac)), I've thought, has
validated the thinking of millions of middle-class, suburban white kids that
it's okay for them to act 'ghetto' & wear Fubu gear...

Yes, also, as Elvis was the con of the '50's, Eminem's the con of this
decade. This time around a slight twist: as a movie figure, he's now also
the James Dean con (with (undoubtedly) about as much duration).

I agree completely. And Chuck D changed the way I percieved music and
america. White youth will always be thuggish no matter what uniform they
adopt. The good aspect of Slim Shady is that he is opening the playing field
for new markets of music.

I think my favorite thing about Eminem is not his own song, but a parody
of "Slim Shady" that goes "I'm Greg Brady, I'm the real Greg Brady" --
performed by Barry Williams, the real Greg Brady. I don't know if it's
still on his website, www.barrywilliams.com, but it's damn funny and just
pokes a huge hole in the Eminem ego-image-monster.

Here's Sean O'Brien's obit from today's _The Independent_ for English=20
poet Ken Smith. I fondly remember a goodly number of evenings with Ken=20=

around the table in my place on Deal Road, Tooting, South London, & at=20=

the local pub, downing pints of bitter. The talk was always about the=20
trouble people were in (this was Thatcher's England) and about poetry=20
(this was Ken's life). -- Pierre

Ken Smith

Poet of ambition and real feeling

02 July 2003


Kenneth John Smith, poet: born Rudston, Yorkshire 4 December 1938;=20
Co-Editor, Stand 1963-69; married 1960 Annie Minnis (one son, two=20
daughters; marriage dissolved), 1981 Judi Benson (one stepson); died=20
London 27 June 2003.


  Ken Smith brought an original and memorable voice to poetry in=20
Britain. He spent his writing life not so much swimming against the=20
stream as ignoring the stream's existence. Now he leaves a large and=20
richly varied body of work, some of which will surely outlast that of=20
more fashionable names. Smith was a poet's poet, not because he=20
attracted a cult of obscurity or led a coterie of impersonators, but=20
because of the integrity and craftsmanship he brought to writing the=20
poems his imagination demanded.



Born in East Yorkshire in 1938, the son of an itinerant Irish=20
farmworker, Smith was educated in Hull and Knaresborough, did National=20=

Service in the RAF and then read English at Leeds University. Among the=20=

other writers associated with the English Department around the time he=20=

was there, 1960-63, were Tony Harrison, Geoffrey Hill, Wole Soyinka and=20=

James Simmons. Leeds was also associated with Jon Silkin's famous=20
magazine Stand, and Smith was one of many writers to pass through the=20
editorial team.



His first collection of poems, The Pity, was published in 1967. At=20
first the book may have seemed in key with the popular nature poetry of=20=

the period, whose most famous exponent was Ted Hughes, but Smith's work=20=

has a melancholy concern with social themes which sets it apart, just=20
as the characters in his poems - who include his father - were=20
themselves set apart, gesturing towards a lost society which, Smith=20
wrote, "left / not a mark, not a footprint".



Despite this impressive d=E9but, Smith found no permanent home among=20
mainstream publishers. For a decade he put work out through a series of=20=

almost gleefully obscure imprints, supporting himself with teaching,=20
first in school and later as a university writer in residence in=20
Britain and the United States. Smith was one of the first in Britain to=20=

map the route of the contemporary journeyman poet - a rather more=20
uncertain existence in the 1960s and 1970s than it is nowadays.



Perpetual wandering becomes the underlying theme of his work, which is=20=

frequently written from beyond or below the pale of ordinary social=20
norms and reveals a marked antipathy to what Smith called the "Rupert=20
Bear" school of English establishment poetry. He was drawn instead to=20
American poets such as James Wright and W.S. Merwin.



When in the late 1970s the publisher Neil Astley began to establish=20
Bloodaxe Books, he provided Smith with the combination of security and=20=

liberty his work required. When Bloodaxe published The Poet Reclining:=20=

selected poems 1962-1980 (1982), Smith, in mid-career, found a new=20
readership - often young enthusiasts who were to feed the growing=20
interest in poetry through the 1980s by reviving the live poetry=20
reading, an arena in which Smith at times excelled.



Smith could wield a strange, laconic desperation, as at the opening of=20=

"To Survive": "Each day the last, / each a survivor. A shaft / other=20
days fall into". His work also steered away from the visual imagery=20
prevalent in both English and American poetry. Instead he concentrated=20=

on voice and implied narrative. These qualities are exemplified by two=20=

very different works published in the early 1980s. Burned Books (1981)=20=

is a fragmentary, fire-damaged history of a political dictatorship=20
drawn from the library of the vanished President Perdu. Fox Running=20
(1980), a headlong account of breakdown, applies a desperate energy to=20=

an endless journey back and forth across London between DHSS offices=20
and grim bedsits. This book helped to create the possibility of the=20
distinctive urban poetry of the 1980s and many younger writers are,=20
perhaps half unwittingly, in Smith's debt. (Living in East Ham, Smith=20
was well placed to observe the Thatcher years.)



Terra (1986) is a work of remarkable ambition. It contains the "London=20=

Sonnets", surveillance reports on a city where, as in Henry Mayhew's=20
time, "the poor are pushing to the windows like the fog", while "slow=20
workless docklands" are "going cheap", where drugs and racism are=20
widespread and the nuclear threat can be heard in the telephonic white=20=

noise of the secret state. Alongside this stands "Hawkwood", the=20
journal of an English mercenary in 14th-century Italy. Smith was also a=20=

fine comic poet, as the wild improvisation of "Departure's Speech"=20
indicates.



Given Smith's sympathy with losers and misfits, it was appropriate that=20=

he was one of the first writers to work in prison, at Wormwood Scrubs.=20=

Wormwood (1987) is an eloquent, harrowing and quite unsentimental book=20=

of songs by and about the damned. On the prison wings there are those,=20=

Smith writes, "whose eyes I don't meet", but in "Cain's Song" he shares=20=

the common longing for another world that "lives in another song in a=20
tune / I can't recall, another tale / told at the road's turn where=20
wind / moves among beeches. I know. / I was there. The wind told me."



The residency and the accompanying prose book, Inside Time (1989, with=20=

Dave Wait), resulted in a television appearance on Wogan, but Smith=20
preferred to be on the move. A number of visits to Berlin in the late=20
1980s produced a further prose work, Berlin: coming in from the cold=20
(1990), while the opening up of the Iron Curtain is reflected in many=20
poems from The Heart, the Border (1990) and Tender to the Queen of=20
Spain (1993), where he combines lyricism with widely travelled=20
investigations of politics, history and place.



The culmination of this phase was Wild Root (1998), which juxtaposes=20
old and more modern notions of Europe and its torments. The superb "The=20=

Shadow of God" recreates the terror provoked by the name of Suleiman=20
the Magnificent, while "Part of the Crowd that Day" is a pessimistic=20
assessment of the moral potential of those who find themselves in the=20
audience of history:


  They gawp at the hungry, they gawp at


  the dead.


  In the end they are not spared. In their turn


  everything happens to them. Of any half


  dozen


  one has a secret vice, one an incurable


  disease,


  one a deep faith in God and the rest don't


  care


  =A0


  one way or the other. But they see it all


  happen.



In 2002, Shed: poems, 1980-2001 was published.



Ken Smith's originality was a matter of omission as well as inclusion.=20=

He read and wrote against the grain of contemporary taste, often=20
preferring a bare eloquence to a crowded stanza. Yet he also loved=20
details, such as the proper names of people, cities and flowers, as=20
well as the poignancy and absurdity of overheard remarks.



His poetry stays close to songs and ballads, and while his way into a=20
poem is often oblique, and some of his work quite naturally resists=20
interpretation, the result never lacks the animating charge of real=20
feeling - sympathy, love, loss, delight, longing, political fury. He=20
was one of those by whom the language lives.

Subject:        Ken Smith
Here's Sean O'Brien's obit from today's _The Independent_ for English=20
poet Ken Smith. I fondly remember a goodly number of evenings with Ken=20
around the table in my place on Deal Road, Tooting, South London, & at=20
the local pub, downing pints of bitter. The talk was always about the=20
trouble people were in (this was Thatcher's England) and about poetry=20
(this was Ken's life). -- Pierre

Ken Smith

Poet of ambition and real feeling

02 July 2003


Kenneth John Smith, poet: born Rudston, Yorkshire 4 December 1938;=20
Co-Editor, Stand 1963-69; married 1960 Annie Minnis (one son, two=20
daughters; marriage dissolved), 1981 Judi Benson (one stepson); died=20
London 27 June 2003.


  Ken Smith brought an original and memorable voice to poetry in=20
Britain. He spent his writing life not so much swimming against the=20
stream as ignoring the stream's existence. Now he leaves a large and=20
richly varied body of work, some of which will surely outlast that of=20
more fashionable names. Smith was a poet's poet, not because he=20
attracted a cult of obscurity or led a coterie of impersonators, but=20
because of the integrity and craftsmanship he brought to writing the=20
poems his imagination demanded.



Born in East Yorkshire in 1938, the son of an itinerant Irish=20
farmworker, Smith was educated in Hull and Knaresborough, did National=20
Service in the RAF and then read English at Leeds University. Among the=20
other writers associated with the English Department around the time he=20
was there, 1960-63, were Tony Harrison, Geoffrey Hill, Wole Soyinka and=20
James Simmons. Leeds was also associated with Jon Silkin's famous=20
magazine Stand, and Smith was one of many writers to pass through the=20
editorial team.



His first collection of poems, The Pity, was published in 1967. At=20
first the book may have seemed in key with the popular nature poetry of=20
the period, whose most famous exponent was Ted Hughes, but Smith's work=20
has a melancholy concern with social themes which sets it apart, just=20
as the characters in his poems - who include his father - were=20
themselves set apart, gesturing towards a lost society which, Smith=20
wrote, "left / not a mark, not a footprint".



Despite this impressive d=E9but, Smith found no permanent home among=20
mainstream publishers. For a decade he put work out through a series of=20
almost gleefully obscure imprints, supporting himself with teaching,=20
first in school and later as a university writer in residence in=20
Britain and the United States. Smith was one of the first in Britain to=20
map the route of the contemporary journeyman poet - a rather more=20
uncertain existence in the 1960s and 1970s than it is nowadays.



Perpetual wandering becomes the underlying theme of his work, which is=20
frequently written from beyond or below the pale of ordinary social=20
norms and reveals a marked antipathy to what Smith called the "Rupert=20
Bear" school of English establishment poetry. He was drawn instead to=20
American poets such as James Wright and W.S. Merwin.



When in the late 1970s the publisher Neil Astley began to establish=20
Bloodaxe Books, he provided Smith with the combination of security and=20
liberty his work required. When Bloodaxe published The Poet Reclining:=20
selected poems 1962-1980 (1982), Smith, in mid-career, found a new=20
readership - often young enthusiasts who were to feed the growing=20
interest in poetry through the 1980s by reviving the live poetry=20
reading, an arena in which Smith at times excelled.



Smith could wield a strange, laconic desperation, as at the opening of=20
"To Survive": "Each day the last, / each a survivor. A shaft / other=20
days fall into". His work also steered away from the visual imagery=20
prevalent in both English and American poetry. Instead he concentrated=20
on voice and implied narrative. These qualities are exemplified by two=20
very different works published in the early 1980s. Burned Books (1981)=20
is a fragmentary, fire-damaged history of a political dictatorship=20
drawn from the library of the vanished President Perdu. Fox Running=20
(1980), a headlong account of breakdown, applies a desperate energy to=20
an endless journey back and forth across London between DHSS offices=20
and grim bedsits. This book helped to create the possibility of the=20
distinctive urban poetry of the 1980s and many younger writers are,=20
perhaps half unwittingly, in Smith's debt. (Living in East Ham, Smith=20
was well placed to observe the Thatcher years.)



Terra (1986) is a work of remarkable ambition. It contains the "London=20
Sonnets", surveillance reports on a city where, as in Henry Mayhew's=20
time, "the poor are pushing to the windows like the fog", while "slow=20
workless docklands" are "going cheap", where drugs and racism are=20
widespread and the nuclear threat can be heard in the telephonic white=20
noise of the secret state. Alongside this stands "Hawkwood", the=20
journal of an English mercenary in 14th-century Italy. Smith was also a=20
fine comic poet, as the wild improvisation of "Departure's Speech"=20
indicates.



Given Smith's sympathy with losers and misfits, it was appropriate that=20
he was one of the first writers to work in prison, at Wormwood Scrubs.=20
Wormwood (1987) is an eloquent, harrowing and quite unsentimental book=20
of songs by and about the damned. On the prison wings there are those,=20
Smith writes, "whose eyes I don't meet", but in "Cain's Song" he shares=20
the common longing for another world that "lives in another song in a=20
tune / I can't recall, another tale / told at the road's turn where=20
wind / moves among beeches. I know. / I was there. The wind told me."



The residency and the accompanying prose book, Inside Time (1989, with=20
Dave Wait), resulted in a television appearance on Wogan, but Smith=20
preferred to be on the move. A number of visits to Berlin in the late=20
1980s produced a further prose work, Berlin: coming in from the cold=20
(1990), while the opening up of the Iron Curtain is reflected in many=20
poems from The Heart, the Border (1990) and Tender to the Queen of=20
Spain (1993), where he combines lyricism with widely travelled=20
investigations of politics, history and place.



The culmination of this phase was Wild Root (1998), which juxtaposes=20
old and more modern notions of Europe and its torments. The superb "The=20
Shadow of God" recreates the terror provoked by the name of Suleiman=20
the Magnificent, while "Part of the Crowd that Day" is a pessimistic=20
assessment of the moral potential of those who find themselves in the=20
audience of history:


  They gawp at the hungry, they gawp at


  the dead.


  In the end they are not spared. In their turn


  everything happens to them. Of any half


  dozen


  one has a secret vice, one an incurable


  disease,


  one a deep faith in God and the rest don't


  care


  =20


  one way or the other. But they see it all


  happen.



In 2002, Shed: poems, 1980-2001 was published.



Ken Smith's originality was a matter of omission as well as inclusion.=20
He read and wrote against the grain of contemporary taste, often=20
preferring a bare eloquence to a crowded stanza. Yet he also loved=20
details, such as the proper names of people, cities and flowers, as=20
well as the poignancy and absurdity of overheard remarks.



His poetry stays close to songs and ballads, and while his way into a=20
poem is often oblique, and some of his work quite naturally resists=20
interpretation, the result never lacks the animating charge of real=20
feeling - sympathy, love, loss, delight, longing, political fury. He=20
was one of those by whom the language lives.

The superlative chefs at Bar Italia have concocted a five-course dinner that sings along with Eunoia, and you can be a part of it! Both meat (fresh tender beef) and veggie (three-cheese-blend penne) meals are available. Tickets are only $20 (not including alcohol or gratuities). If you're keen, drop us an email at jason@chbooks.com or give us a call at 416 979 2217 for more info or to reserve one of these limited-edition dinners. Admission to the reading itself is free, so please come even if you don't want dinner.

But the problem with Eminem is that he only aims to disturb, and the way
he aims to disturb is, frankly, not that much different from the
disturbances of reality TV shows, such as Survivor or Fear Factor, etc.
Being gyno-and homophobic, being frank about violence, being arrogant
about success, these all come down to desires that exist just under the
skin.  Eminem is disturbing, but he is disturbing in the way we expect
someone to be.  If he is an artist, he is an artist of tabloid fodder...
something along the lines of Bret Easton Ellis, who also poses as much he
disturbs.

hi,
the cd will be available at the reading/eating. I'm sure Coach House would
love to sell you one. Go to http://chbooks.com

they are very friendly.

a few weeks ago Scott Pound mentioned the Coach House. I too made a
pilgrimage there a few summers ago. the last time i passed through
toronto. i got there pretty laste in the day and was only given a quick
tour as my tour guide was already on her bike heading for the post office
with a basket full of goodies. she ( i can't remember her name) gave me a
quick show-around and let me buy (at a good rate) Kenny G's Fidget. A book
that i would never have a chance of coming across where i live.

for a poet who has been influenced by the coach house project (in all of
its manifestations) it was quite a treat for me.

this leads me to think about the afore mentioned RE-Lit awards. It is odd
that all of the poetry nominees were Coach House Books. I'll bet that the
copies of those books that were sent to the local judge (Carmelita McGrath
who lives down my street and has a new kid's book out called the Boston
Box - it's beautiful) are the only copies on the island (except for seven
seconds missing VII by Caff McStevery which I'm reviewing for Canadian
Literature - but then i had to order volume one and wait four weeks just
to get up to speed).

so what i'm saying is that we may live on the edge of the continent but
we're hardly the leading edge of poetry.

Thanks, Ron. This is awful. Let alone the damage to Iraqi life, I don't even
want to begin to imagine the kind of psychological damage that is being done
to U.S soldier Occupiers and what this country will domestically reap in the
way of mental illness and violence when these men and women ever come home.
With the fiscal deficit and tax cuts the services will be minimal etc. etc.
More walking casualties on the streets. "IVS" - Iraq Vets.

Yesterday, after noting that 725 occupiers had been wounded, and 225
variously killed since the President declared the formal end of fighting -
the New York Times web edition dropped these facts from a later version of
the same article. Hmmm...

Indeed we are being led by crazy people - but I guess that's becoming more
and more obvious.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

RHIZHOMES: CULTURAL STUDIES IN EMERGING KNOWLEDGE

www.rhizomes.net

Issue 6: Codework/Surveillance guest-edited by Louis Armand, with
contributions by McKenzie Wark, Alan Sondheim, Zoe Beloff, Darren Tofts,
Ondrej Galuska, MTC Cronin, Alan Roughley, Philip Hammial, David Seiter,
Tom Mackey, Damien Judge Rollison.



"Codework/Surveillance" attempts to work the seam between critical
paradigmatics & social discourse, between codework as invention, aesthetic
practice, activism, sabotage & its recuperation within and by institutions
of knowledge & techno-social surveillance (& vice-versa).



"Codework/Surveillance" attempts to go beyond the usual pseudo-antagonism
of theory/praxis by investigating how the contest over such terms (and
other terms which are supposedly defined by them) is itself a mirage
effect of the oppositional assumptions of institution vs.
anti-institutional practition.



"Codework/Surveillance" designates a relation of terms & of social
postulates which are & remain biomorphic, parac(r)itical and dialectically
irreducible. As "criticism" is placed under increasing pressure to account
for itself in terms of action within the social/technological sphere, the
artist & "public intellectual" may be regarded more in terms of "codework"
than of traditional critical or aesthetic practices--in the sense that
"codework" implies not only a working with the language and means of
contemporary technological conditions (& of "taking responsibility" or
"coming to terms" with these), but also a tactical counter-coding which
exploits the margins of error within control apparatuses exemplified by
such mechanisms as "surveillance."



The linkage of "surveillance" to "codework" here stands for the way in
which infrastructures of power always operate on a basis of hybridity &
structural discontinuities which leave them open to "uses" other than
those sought or intended by the various institutions of "authority." That
authority, too, is inherently linked to codework, to the authenticity &
authorship of certain codes or codices (of the law), points not only to
existing critiques of "writing" but to the institution of critique itself
& the enormous resources of codification which are today applied in the
name of learning &/or knowledge.



As in Orwell's 1984, it remains necessary to consider seriously the fact
that "authority," in order to be what it is, deploys its resources in a
hugely asymmetrical way "against" the "individual"--that sabotage (or
terrorism) is not exclusively a means used by individuals (or cells of
individuals) against the symbols & institutions of "authority." Codework
in this sense is not the masturbatory fantasy of the programmer or hacker,
but above all the game of power calling its own bluff & still trying to
reduce all the bad odds to zero.

In the mid-Sixties, during the two years that preceded the Biafra/Nigerian
Civil War I had the good - and finally mixed - fortune to teach - as a Peace
Corps Volunteer at the University of Nigera, Nsukka (which was at the
intellectual heart of the unsuccessful secessionist movement - ironically,
for reasons I will not go into here, I did not support the soon oncoming
war, one that with some colleagues - including an also young Ken Tsara-Wiwa
- we forecasted as either fatalistic or self-serving for a few.)
However, the Sentinel is a fledgling On-Line London based magazine that is
edited by Nnorom Azonye, the brother of a former student. And I am delighted
to be interviewed - in the first of two parts - in the current issue. The
interview has given me the wonderful opportunity to bring up what it was
like to live, write poetry and teach in Nigeria. Nsukka just happened to be
a hot bed of writing at the time - I was surrounded by both well published
poets and students who were similarly ambitious.

Take a look and I look forward to any response.

above/ground press - the mind of a ten-year-old

How To Learn To Love Sodomy
This just in: GOP atremble, love and sex rejoice, revolution imminent.
Can you feel it?
By Mark Morford

And now here we are, at a shimmeringly historic moment where we cannot
help but note the delicious irony, the divine karmic genius of it all.

When we cannot help but notice how millions of progressive love-minded
Gay Pride folks across America, from S.F. to N.Y., from Atlanta to
Seattle to Chicago, were actually cheering on the Supreme Court last
week -- the same crusty bunch that snuck BushCo into office in the
first place -- for slapping the tragically heartless GOP right across
its wan butt with a leather whip and a shocking 6-3 decision, stunning
the Christian right into disbelief and abject terror.

Not to mention Canada's gay marriage, and maybe even how the United
Kingdom, too, is one step away from legalizing gay unions, and the poor
GOP is feeling the slope toward calm debauchery and delicious
godlessness getting slippery indeed. Can I get a hell yeah.

And these days, amidst BushCo's insane deficit and more tax cuts for
the rich and 150,000 U.S. troops still stuck in Iraq, amidst a
warmongering ethos and $135 mil set aside for "abstinence only"
programs for America's disgusted youth, you take the joyous and the
celebratory and the progressive and the pro-sexual and the positive
where and when you can, honey.

Truly, it will indeed be years before the Lawrence sodomy case has its
full impact, as state by state, lawsuit by lawsuit, homophobic senator
by homophobic senator, the walls break down and the prejudices
evaporate and the hatred is squelched like a hissing cockroach.

The war is far from over, but one of the most important battles in the
history of gay -- nay, human -- rights has been won. Decisively. This
case is, as many analysts have pointed out, Roe v. Wade for the new
millennium, Brown v. the Board of Education for the next generation. It
is seminal, landmark, a sea change. Go get yourself all wet with it.

You simply have to note it. It cannot be denied. When not even this
sometimes nasty Rehnquist court, saddled with Scalia's snide claim of a
rampant "homosexual agenda," could turn back the tide, could find
sufficient fault with consensual love and sex and fleshy exploration
among open-minded adult humans of any gender and any orientation, well,
you know something larger and more potent is going on.

Here comes the radical notion. Here is where hard-core anti-lib
conservatives snicker and roll their eyes and point and scowl about
"goddamn liberals" and their "new-age tree-hugging commie-tofu crapola"
and clutch their military portfolios and crank up the Toby Keith to
numb the pain.

Because this ruling isn't just a victory for gays. It isn't merely a
victory for those seeking to advance the idea of gay marriage, or gay
adoption, or "deviant" sexual activity (read: anything other than two
minutes in the missionary position with a DustBuster and a copy of
"Last Days," per the Christian right), or even a victory for basic
human rights for all sexual orientations in this nation.

It is, quite simply, a stunning and rather unexpected victory for the
spirit, for the heart, for the body, for the very notion that we as a
humble and chaotic and distressed species can actually progress almost
despite ourselves, despite a famously oppressive and uptight
leadership, despite reams of deceit and war and John Ashcroft's sad
nipple fetish.

This is a crazed wildflower bursting through a concrete sidewalk. This
is a breath of fresh air after smoking four packs of toxic
disinformation a day for the past three years. This is the unexpected
royal flush when all you've been dealt to date are jokers and suicide
kings.

And, for proof, we need only look to the Trent Lotts and Rick Santorums
and Bill Frists of the Right's political oligarchy, the sneering
Republican apocalyptics who are right this minute scrunched and
apoplectic and immediately proposing a major change to the U.S.
Constitution to block gay marriage forever, to try and protect the
"sanctity" of God-given man/woman missionary-position
50-percent-divorce-rate marriage in this country.

To protect it from, well, they don't know what, exactly, but it's
something very, very icky and scary and it's coming for their sons and
daughters right now and it reeks of lavender and honey and butch
haircuts and tattoos and it loves to wear glitter and Versace and to
sing.

They want to actually change the U.S. Constitution. This is how
terrified they are. This is how utterly embittered and out of touch and
absolutely determined they are to keep this nation under the callused
thumb of religious dogma and free of anything resembling orgasmic
delight and karmic evolution.

And this is how you know. When those whose sole agenda is to promote
the tyranny of fear and violently misinterpret the Bible for their own
acidic agenda are themselves horrified and running scared, there has
been a gorgeous breakthrough.

Maybe it's this. Maybe this case signifies the deeper acknowledgment of
our purpose on the planet, the subtle realization that God, that the
divine, is not, in fact, separate from the flesh, is not something to
be dreaded and guilted by and wielded like a bloody sanctimonious sword
by born-again presidents and sexless attorney generals and snickering
foreign despots.

In other words, maybe this is not, as the GOP so desperately wants
everyone to believe, about icky "deviant" sex and unholy gay marriage
and blasphemous anal-sex toys at all. Maybe the change is about the
potency of love. About the natural explorations of love in nature, of
human relationships and the freedom to explore and let love penetrate
our lives and make the divine into something we can touch, taste, slide
into and, ultimately, incarnate.

Oh my heavens. No wonder the conservative Right is aghast and atwitter.
No wonder the Death Star is panicky and sweaty and flagellating itself.
Because the divine is winking in our general direction. And, this time,
it looks like we just might wink back.

course that was the way with Elvis back then -- he
exposed a lot of people to a type of music that
they otherwise wouldn't have heard, because he was
white, and acceptable (albeit barely) to the white
mainstream. But I'll still take Eminem, who at

Nearly a year ago, there was an article in the New Yorker, I think, that dissected the three-pronged persona of Eminem (Slim Shady, the misogynistic, homophobic thug;
Eminem, the platinum-record selling superstar; and Marshall Mathers, the bemused Detroit kid behind it all, taken aback by the fame) as a marketing ploy par
extradonaire, a vehicle that allowed M simultaneously to cause controversy and to distance himself from the views that caused the controversy, raising record sales
while remaining immune to his critics' rancor. Perhaps that's so, and having heard him freestyle, I have to give him props as a MC. But he doesn't have the verbal
pyrotechnics of a number of other rappers in my estimation. Here's a list of five rappers (with an indicative lyric) off the top of my head who'd do better with the
appellation of poet than Eminem does:

-Mos Def
I seen her on the ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front

Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken

Better off behind a desk tryin to surf the net

-Q-Tip (of Tribe Called Quest)
So sit and anylze this lyrical spray

A quick chime in here, Eminem is talented with his rhymes, but he will
never be able to do what Biggie Smalls did. Biggie was incredible. Early
on JayZ was also quite good, but he's fallen off quite a big, and Nelly
is not someone I consider to be that talented at all.

Let's not forget the irrepressible SHIZZOLATOR. Not only can Snoopp
rhyme, he can create languages.

All I know of Eminem (melts in your mouth, not in your hand)
is what I learned from *8 Mile* (one of those movies I can't
remember the morning after I've seen it), but does anyone know
if/how Eminem would sing the praises of Heaney?

Vancouver Activists To Open Olympic Tent City
http://vancouver.indymedia.org/news/2003/07/54829.php

July 2, 2003
Independent Media
Vancouver, Canada

Even though Vancouver is notorious for its police violence
since the publication a Human Rights Watch report in May
2003 and a Pivot Legal Society affidavit campaign of last
year, the Associated Press and other news producers
nonetheless filled their outlets this morning with
descriptions of "wild cheering and flag-waving" on the
street of this city.

In the Downtown Eastside neighbourhood, however, local
residents, squatters, and homeless citizens from the
Housing Action Committee (HAC) have joined forces with the
direct-action group the Anti-Poverty Committee (APC), to
fight back by opening an Olympic Tent City tonight.

Their target is Gordon Campbell and the Liberal government
of British Columbia: for dismantling social services and
privatizing public utilities. The groups have two demands.
The first is that welfare is a right and that the
government must not sever the benefits of 38,000 people in
April 2004 as they have scheduled to do. The second is
that there should be social housing for all in need. Both
welfare and housing are the responsibility of the
provincial government.

Meanwhile, a representative of the City of Vancouver has
issued a threat to the groups if they continue with their
plan to construct the Olympic Tent City and food kitchen,
which has broad endorsement by community and labour
organizations. Councillor Jim Green stated to CKNW radio
that "we can deal with them." Vancouver Police Department
Chief Constable Jamie Graham is expected to back up the
City's threat with a show of force this evening.

Vancouver Police Persecuting Drug Users:
Anti-drug Crackdown May Worsen North America's Worst AIDS
Epidemic

(Vancouver, May 7, 2003) -- An anti-drug crackdown by the
Vancouver Police Department has driven injection drug
users away from life-saving HIV prevention services,
raising fears of a new wave of HIV transmission in the
city that is already home to the worst AIDS crisis in the
developed world, said Human Rights Watch.

In a 25-page report released today, "Abusing the User:
Police Misconduct, Harm Reduction and HIV/AIDS in
Vancouver," Human Rights Watch documents instances of
unnecessary force and mistreatment, arbitrary arrest, and
other intimidation and harassment of drug users as part of
a campaign commonly referred to as Operation Torpedo.

The crackdown began on April 7 in the city's impoverished
Downtown Eastside neighborhood. Though drug traffickers
are the ostensible target, drug users not charged with
selling drugs have been driven to places where health
workers cannot reach them to ensure access to sterile
syringes and other HIV prevention services.

"The flouting of due process in this crackdown is shocking
for a country with Canada's strong commitment to human
rights," said Joanne Csete, director of the HIV/AIDS
Program of Human Rights Watch. "Vancouver risks making its
HIV/AIDS crisis much worse--and it's already the worst on
the continent."

Based on a field study conducted in recent weeks, Human
Rights Watch documented cases of police officers beating
and otherwise mistreating drug users in custody,
conducting public strip searches, and using petty
allegations such as jaywalking to justify stops and
searches. The report
also documents a significant reduction in the use of
needle exchange programs and other life-saving services
related to fear of police abuse and harassment among drug
users.

In November 2002, Vancouver elected a mayor and city
council members whose platform included support for a
"four-pillar" strategy to address illegal drug use,
including needle exchange programs and safe injection
facilities. Since those officials took office in January
2003, the city's most conspicuous anti-drug effort has
been several crackdowns against users and dealers, of
which the current operation is the most prominent.

Vancouver is a candidate city to host the winter Olympic
games of 2010. The decision of the host city will be
announced in July.

"As Olympic fever grows in the city, the temptation to
continue to 'clean up' the Downtown Eastside through
repressive means will also grow, but it must be resisted,"
Csete said. "We know from the experience of scores of
countries that the way to contain an AIDS epidemic is to
work respectfully with those persons at highest
risk--exactly the opposite of what Vancouver is doing."

All right, I guess what I'm grokking here is that
Heaney would have more justifiably praised one of
these worthier rappers, but like the rest of the
mainstream world, he has probably only heard of
Eminem. I very seriously doubt Heaney's sitting in
his flat hitting the 420 and spinning the latest
from Snoop, Nelly et al.

That still doesn't mean that Eminem isn't a very
talented wordsmith -- poet's a pretty strong word,
but then he's more inventive and a damn sight
funnier than most young poets I know, myself
included, if I still qualify as young or a poet.
And I doubt that Eminem would have benefited AT
ALL from a more polished education, as someone
suggested; he is what he is and he's great at
that, although i'd be willing to bet that all the
mainstream success isn't going to make him a
better rapper. And I'm sure that, conversely, he
isn't sitting in his Grosse Pointe mansion worried
about what all of us think of his rhymes.

On a separate pop culture note: has anyone else
seen the poster for the new Ben Affleck/J-Lo opus
"Gigli"? And has there ever been a worse name for
a movie in the history of cinema? To describe the
poster: J-Lo torques herself up into a curvaceous
stance, buttons practically popping off her blouse
and jeans so tight over her round ass that you can
read her credit card number through the denim,
while Ben gazes smugly down at her, his hands
shoved with self-conscious carelessness into the
pockets of a leather jacket. That's it;
apparently, the sheer animal magnetism between
them is supposed to be enough to draw me to the
movie. If this thing doesn't bomb worse than
Ishtar -- I'll eat my Gigli.

Subject: Re: Heaney praises Eminem

Nearly a year ago, there was an article in the New
Yorker, I think, that
dissected the three-pronged persona of Eminem
(Slim Shady, the
misogynistic, homophobic thug;
Eminem, the platinum-record selling superstar; and
Marshall Mathers, the
bemused Detroit kid behind it all, taken aback by
the fame) as a
marketing ploy par
extradonaire, a vehicle that allowed M
simultaneously to cause
controversy and to distance himself from the views
that caused the
controversy, raising record sales
while remaining immune to his critics' rancor.
Perhaps that's so, and
having heard him freestyle, I have to give him
props as a MC. But he
doesn't have the verbal
pyrotechnics of a number of other rappers in my
estimation. Here's a
list of five rappers (with an indicative lyric)
off the top of my head
who'd do better with the
appellation of poet than Eminem does:

-Mos Def
I seen her on the ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front

-Nas
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricocheting between the spots that I'm hidin in

-Talib Kweli (of Black Star)
Makin wack rappers go and merc the set
Better off behind a desk tryin to surf the net
Adament, worse than boric acid in your project
cabinet

-Q-Tip (of Tribe Called Quest)
So sit and anylze this lyrical spray
Cause all it really is word play

-and of course, the brilliant, fatally flawed,
ultimately doomed,
Notorious BIG:
Excuse me, flows just go through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches.

I logged some time on the Kucinich Web site and I'm very impressed with his views. Willy Nelson never steers you wrong!

The most important thing is to get Bush and his Wrecking Crew out of there,
and stop the bleeding of people at home and around the world, of the
economy, the environment.... The strongest Democrat needs to be running
against him. Kucinich, whom I'd like to vote for, isn't the strongest
candidate, Kerry is. I don't agree with Kerry on foreign policy, but first
things first, as they say. If you think Bush has done damage already, wait
until he can't run again, when he doesn't have to pay attention to the
people at all!

Thanks for the reminder, David. I'll be reading at a group reading

Ted and perhaps pick out something of his to read.

I really recommend Cox's book - he's the closest thing to a great critic
to appear in Britain in the last, oh, century or two. A critic with an
ear, an eye, and (for a change) a MIND.

Kenneth Cox:  COLLECTED STUDIES IN THE USE OF ENGLISH (Agenda Editions,
2001) Pb, 269 pp, isbn 0 902400 69 X

"I have learned more from Kenneth Cox's essays than from any other
living critic of twentieth century poetry. He writes with masterly
directness about the masters of indirection, and his summarizing power
rivals that of Samuel Johnson." --Thom Gunn

"I used to read Agenda only to catch Cox's thoughtful, well-written
essays, so it's a pleasure to be able to have a compilation of them
here."  --Tony Frazer in Shearsman.

"A 19th-century naturalist whose flora and fauna are 20th-century poets,
Kenneth Cox is the model for how criticism would be written if there
were
anyone other than Cox who could write it."  --Eliot Weinberger

Kenneth Cox states in his Preface that his collection of essays "has

My first book, The Smell of Oranges, has just been released.

Here is the title poem:


The Smell of Oranges


My mother would ask
if I wanted them cut or peeled.
I’d answer that I wanted them peeled
if only to see her fingers hold them
like clay to be molded.
After peeling their husk,
she would put her thumbs in the centre
and break each into halves;
Later separate the slices, one by one.

I marvel at the flexible skins
pulling away,
not ever breaking at the pressure.

- Jill Chan

OPEN CALL FOR LAUNCH OPTION BERLIN

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An open call to musicians & sound artists for LAUNCH OPTION BERLIN

Musicians and sound artists of all kinds are invited to participate in
LAUNCH OPTION BERLIN, a joint project of Opsound and Rocket Shop, which will
take place at BueroFriedrich, Berlin, July 22-26, 2003 as part of
BueroFriedrich's month-long Open Arch program.

LAUNCH OPTION BERLIN is a test site and data gathering center, a 5-day event
devoted to discovering, collecting, playing, and listening to the sounds &
noises of Berlin.  We want to know what Berlin sounds like: Berlin real,
Berlin virtual, Berlin dreamt and desired -- from field recordings of
Oranienstrasse to the music of underground punk bands, techno tracks and
experimental audio files lurking on hard drives.  Over the five days of the
project and continuing through the internet, LAUNCH OPTION BERLIN will
create a network of exchange, a temporary gift economy of sounds inspired by
the free software and open source software communities.


How to Participate:

LAUNCH OPTION BERLIN, is gathering material for an open sound pool of
material from, about, or inspired by the idea of Berlin. (We also have a
weakness for sounds of, about, & inspired by rockets and rocket launches --
if you have any, we want them).  Anyone is welcome to add work to the sound
pool, and all material for the pool will be released under a Creative
Commons license (the "Attribution-ShareAlike license"), a  copyleft license
in the spirit of open source software licenses which allows for all kinds of
copying, remixing, use, and reuse while retaining an attribution to the
original  artist.  Sound from the pool will be played in the LAUNCH OPTION
control center at the BueroFriedrich gallery, mixed into sets by LAUNCH
OPTION djs at parties and listening salons, and made available for remix
contests and internet distribution through the opsound.org website.

To enter your work in the pool visit


Deadline:

For practical reasons it is advisable to enter your work in the pool as soon
as possible, but entries will be accepted up to and throughout the LAUNCH
OPTION BERLIN event.

In addition, we have many slots for live performances throughout the
five-day period.  If you can be in Berlin in person during July 22-26 and
would like to perform your music or play your sounds, please contact us by
email at launch@opsound.org

About Rocket Shop:

Rocket Shop was founded in 2001 by the artists Roger Frank and Laura
Schleussner and featured monthly exhibitions in a store-front project space
in Berlin through 2002. Rocket Shop is currently in orbit and currently
presents regular exhibitions and events at venues in Berlin and abroad.

Reflecting the function of rockets and spaceships as symbols of progress and
carriers of collective visions of the future, the exhibition project is not
only interested in the visionary function of art. Rocket Shop also supports
art as a means of investigating the human aspect and impact of the unending
pursuit of technical, social and personal utopias.

About Opsound:

Opsound (http://www.opsound.org) responds to recent upheavals in the music
industry by creating an alternative structure for musicians and sound-based
artists wishing to share and release music under a copyleft, or open source
structure. Opsound will gather a pool of sound material from artists and
encourage the development of both web-based and real-world micro labels to
release artists' work. All work will be released under a Creative Commons
license which permits free copying and modification (the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike license, http:/www.creativecommons.org). In the
second phase of operation, over the coming months Opsound will also begin to
function directly as a record label in its own right focusing on
experimental electronic music.

Opsound is a project of artist Sal Randolph. It is one of a series of
artworks exploring the idea of social architecture as an art form. Other
recent projects include Free Manifesta, The Free Biennial, and Free Words.
More information can be found at http://www.highlala.com

http://www.opsound.org


About BueroFriedrich:

BueroFriedrich has existed as a project space for contemporary art in Berlin
Mitte since October 1997.  BueroFriedrich was founded and is currently
directed by Waling Boers.  In a climate of intensified commercial and
non-commercial exhibition activity, BueroFriedrich positions itself as an
intermediary facility for contemporary art.

With Open Arch BueroFriedrich presents a month-long series of summer shows,
which invite artists and designers from the respective fields of
architecture, publications, art and fashion to make use of the exhibition
space for a 5-day period. The individual segments are not exhibitions in the
traditional sense. Instead groups of artists and designers present projects
which encourage interaction and participation on the part of the public. In
conjunction with a series of talks, the series intends to generate active
communication between the viewers and artists-producers. In some cases,
projects will actually require and depend on on-site participation of the
visitors. The core idea is to create a communicative space, in which the
viewer is actively engaged.

i always support the person i want until push comes to shove, i.e.
the convention.  then i get practical.  but we can't make change
unless we agitate for what we really want while we can still make a

This discussion calls to mind the quality I think of as pop...a gift for
exciting large groups of people with one's work, and personality or
persona...distinct from art but not incompatible with it. In fact, to my mind art that does
have this indefinable and unbottleable quality of pop is the most thrilling
art there is, and I love it when I encounter it in poetry too. No doubt that
Eminem has it, and yes, it often happens as a result of a more palatable or
marketable artist borrowing from what purists think of as "the real thing." But I
don't think Eminem, or Elvis for that matter, started out as "palatable"; they
opened up a new area of expression for mass consumption, and I do see a value
in that. "If it sells it can't be art" is a pretty common form of critical
closemindedness... I can't help thinking that poets (myself included) might do
with a little more "pop" consciousness...

Subject: Re: Heaney praises Eminem

Nearly a year ago, there was an article in the New
Yorker, I think, that
dissected the three-pronged persona of Eminem
(Slim Shady, the
misogynistic, homophobic thug;
Eminem, the platinum-record selling superstar; and
Marshall Mathers, the
bemused Detroit kid behind it all, taken aback by
the fame) as a
marketing ploy par
extradonaire, a vehicle that allowed M
simultaneously to cause
controversy and to distance himself from the views
that caused the
controversy, raising record sales
while remaining immune to his critics' rancor.
Perhaps that's so, and
having heard him freestyle, I have to give him
props as a MC. But he
doesn't have the verbal
pyrotechnics of a number of other rappers in my
estimation. Here's a
list of five rappers (with an indicative lyric)
off the top of my head
who'd do better with the
appellation of poet than Eminem does:

-Mos Def
I seen her on the ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front

-Nas
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricocheting between the spots that I'm hidin in

-Talib Kweli (of Black Star)
Makin wack rappers go and merc the set
Better off behind a desk tryin to surf the net
Adament, worse than boric acid in your project
cabinet

-Q-Tip (of Tribe Called Quest)
So sit and anylze this lyrical spray
Cause all it really is word play

-and of course, the brilliant, fatally flawed,
ultimately doomed,
Notorious BIG:
Excuse me, flows just go through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches.

-RS

Currently I would recommend Mr. Lift out of NYC. I cannot remember the
Album's name, but it is not playing on radios up here. I heard about it from
friends. In terms of MCs who might deserve more praise than Eminem, how
about GZA from Wu-Tang?

Yours seems a good approach.
 It is a repeat of the Nader incident that scares me, and now the stakes are

However, unlike Nader, Kucinich is a Democrat, so that after the convention

This came to me through one of the music lists I'm on.

It's not entirely relevant to the poetics list, since so many writers
are able to travel through the US as tourists without work permits
(though that situation has obviously gotten worse as well) but heck,
the article is written by a poet and it has to do with the increasing
difficulty of international culture getting into the US, so it fits
right into some of the ongoing discussions:

Isolation blues
Could perpetual war cut us off from world music?
BY DAMON KRUKOWSKI


Last March, one of the biggest stars of African pop music, Youssou
N'Dour, cancelled a 38-date tour of North America to protest the US
government's policies toward Iraq. The singer said, in a press
release: "I believe that coming to America at this time would be
perceived in many parts of the world - rightly or wrongly - as
support for this policy, and that, as a consequence, it is
inappropriate to perform in the US at this juncture."

As any fan of African music here in the United States will recognize,
the cancellation of a Youssou N'Dour performance is more than the
loss of an evening of great music - it's a lost opportunity for
members of our own communities to discover one another. The "world
music" concerts here in Boston draw crowds unlike any other in town;
the mix of cultures represented by the events is mirrored by a mix of
people in the audience who might otherwise never gather in the same
room, though they live in the same city.

"It's travel without an airplane ticket," is how Phoenix contributor
Banning Eyre, author of In Griot Time, a memoir of his musical
apprenticeship in Mali, describes the experience of watching African
musicians perform here in the US, in the company of those to whom
this same artist means home. "When you can be in the presence of a
cultural audience interacting with a beloved musical act, there's
nothing like it - it's an enriching experience in terms of sense of
place."

A performance last January by the Angolan singer Bonga at the
Somerville Theatre was exactly that. I had gone for the music, which
was as thrilling as I had hoped (Bonga has one of the most powerfully
moving voices on the planet). But among the marvels of the evening
for me was that the Lusophone crowd - with its origins in Angola,
Cape Verde, and East Cambridge - represented neighbors I hadn't
before had the occasion to meet. As they bantered with Bonga in
Portuguese, as they clapped knowingly on the downbeat rather than the
backbeat, as they whistled in anticipatory counterpoint to the band's
semba rhythms, they announced their own collective presence, in
Boston, to one another and to everyone else who had assembled that
night in Davis Square.

In other words, if the USA becomes the new Sun City, isolationism as
an international policy will contribute to our isolation from one
another, here within our own patchwork culture. Boston, famously
divided by neighborhood, uses the impetus from abroad - Bonga,
Youssou N'Dour - to breach lines of race, class, and religion that
too often divide us. What could be more American than an
African-music concert in an Irish/Italian neighborhood? Remove these
opportunities and before long we may no longer understand why such
experiences are integral to our identity as Americans.

"I feel so melancholic just thinking about how things were even two
years ago - it was a golden age and we didn't know it," says Cindy
Byram, independent publicist and a board member of the World Music
Institute in New York City. Promoters of world music took freedom of
travel for granted as they worked for more than a decade to develop
audiences for this music. And since the early '90s, after the
enormously successful tours of the great Sufi devotional singer
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, there has been an explosion of interest in
world music in the US.

Byram credits key promoters - in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit,
Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington as well as New York - with
working slowly and steadily at cultivating their local audiences,
until extensive tours could be undertaken for practitioners of music
that previously would have been considered too esoteric. "A few
companies built up enough of a circuit that people could trust their
taste, and people wanted to be introduced to other music. For
example, there are musicians from Iran who had never performed here
other than to exclusively Persian audiences, in shows advertised only
to the local Iranian audience. But for the last five or 10 years, we
have started to see more of those acts sponsored by American arts
organizations, for an American audience. And these were so successful
- if you are picking the best musicians in a tradition, it
translates."

=46or Byram, this broadening of the audience for world music represents
more than a commercial success (WMI, like many of the key world-music
promoters around the country, is a nonprofit arts organization). "By
building an audience, we were doing something that mattered - turning
people on, expanding their boundaries, changing their world view.
Worlds intersected, and everyone came out the better for it." Byram
believes the "ethnic" audience for these acts benefitted as well:
"People can be surprised to find that [other] Americans are
interested - they are proud. It can make you value your own culture
more, seeing it reflected back. They look around at intermission and
are thrilled to see that their culture is speaking to more than their
own community. It's a great energy. But now, we're back to the old
publicist's joke: you can't get a world musician covered in the media
unless we're bombing their country. We were past that!"

At last count, nine WMI-sponsored tours had been cancelled as a
result of the current political situation - from the Peking Opera to
Gypsy singer Esma Redzepova. These cancellations eliminate a crucial
tool that world-music promoters have used to develop their audiences:
long-term planning. Some have been motivated by an artist's politics,
like Youssou N'Dour's. But even more have been due to the visa issues
that have developed in the wake of the US government's reaction to
September 11.

This problem hasn't been confined to world music: over the past year,
visa delays or denials have been blamed for cancellations of US
appearances by pianist Eliso Virsaladze, conductor Jaap van Zweden,
the Jerusalem Quartet, the Artemis Quartet, and singer Henk Smit,
among others. But for world-music promoters, bureaucratic visa delays
have been compounded by what some assert is prejudicial treatment of
performers from Islamic countries. Dawn Elder, manager and producer
of world-music acts from the Middle East and North Africa, says that
as the war in Iraq loomed, the expediting service she used to process
visa applications suddenly raised its fees for applications
originating in the Arab world from $1500 to $20,000.

"I'm pretty tenacious . . . I've never had a visa turned down," says
Elder, who in the face of recent events even managed to promote a US
tour by Iraqi musician Kazem al Sahir. But obviously $20,000 per visa
wasn't going to happen. "The visa issue was looking pretty dismal,"
she admits. Then she met a sympathetic immigration lawyer, Brian
Goldstein, at a meeting of the American Performing Arts Association.
Goldstein's law firm now processes applications for her, and though
the fee for its services has increased tour overhead, she's been able
to continue to bring Arab musicians into the country.

And if the musicians themselves are reluctant to come to the US? "I
have been known to get on a plane, go to their door, and hold their
hand on the plane [back] to get them here," she says. "Artists have
said to me that if they come here, they feel they might be showing
support for war. I argue that it is now more important than ever for
them to tour, because through music you can create a very special
dialogue. Music is one of the best forms of communication - to
understand there's more to the people and cultures of these different
countries than what you see generally on the news." Elder cites a
performance in Chicago shortly after September 11 by Simon Shaheen,
the Palestinian violinist and oud player, as particularly powerful;
the tears that night were not of rage but of hope. "The end result is
that musicians bring their communities together. It's what keeps me
going and keeps the artists coming. We're not going to stop."

Not every musician is managed by Dawn Elder, however. And even her
tenacity has not managed to surmount every difficulty. In San
=46rancisco, a venue owner simply cancelled the contract for a
performance by an Arab musician (she scrambled and moved the show
farther left, to Berkeley). And she notes that since September 11,
she's been unable to include Boston on tours of her Arab acts.

Banned in Boston? Maure Aronson, executive director of World Music,
the leading Boston promoter of the genre, says there is no reluctance
on his company's part to booking Arab music while acknowledging that
World Music has promoted only one such performance since September
11. "It's supply and demand. We've never been at the forefront of
promoting music from the Middle East; we might do only one concert a
year. We're planning for next year a festival of sacred music - we
hope to have musicians from Morocco for that - and a festival of
Egyptian music."

Whatever the reason, it's sad that since September 11, Boston has not
had more opportunities for the kind of cultural encounter that
concerts by Arab musicians can facilitate. And if the Bush
Administration has its way, these cultural lacunae will broaden,
until no one notices what's missing anymore. The world beyond our
borders will begin to look like an undifferentiated alien mass. And
so will our neighbors.

Jordi Savall, the Spanish virtuoso of the viola da gamba, cancelled
this spring's North American tour of his influential early-music
group Hesperion XXI, which was to include a local stop in April under
the auspices of the Boston Early Music Festival, because, as the
promoter put it in a press release, "Mr. Savall feels that under the
current situation, he and others in the ensemble have a strong moral
dilemma about touring the United States." Hesperion XXI specializes
in music from Spain's "golden age," that is, before the expulsion of
the Moors in 1480 and the Jews in 1492. Savall is passionate about
what was lost in the expulsion - a few years ago he titled a
Hesperion XXI tour "Paradise Lost" because it featured medi=E6val
Sephardic, Arabic, and Christian melodies. "These three civilizations
have lived together," he explained when asked about the title at the
time. "This was a paradise. If you could put the three back together,
it would again be a paradise."

Without trying to get overly academic on Mr. M/Shady/Mathers I've always placed him in a context of "portraying personas" a la any number of poets (pick the lineage that pleases you here), as kind of a generative device more than a marketing ploy. (Not saying that his output isn't marketed as all hell, obviously.)

You gotta add "Stan" to that persona list -- definitely a generative device, all the moreso cuz of it's one-off use?

Other than character creation though, you gotta give him points for his sense of rhyme which is just miles beyond so many of his peers. I don't know who it was who said it, but "he makes words rhyme that just shouldn't rhyme."

And for those who say he's just out to disturb... I think you should add "amuse" and "exert dominance" to his bag of tricks.

Ravi, where's Chuck D on that list?

Nearly a year ago, there was an article in the New Yorker, I think, that
dissected the three-pronged persona of Eminem (Slim Shady, the misogynistic,
homophobic thug;
Eminem, the platinum-record selling superstar; and Marshall Mathers, the
bemused Detroit kid behind it all, taken aback by the fame) as a marketing
ploy par
extradonaire, a vehicle that allowed M simultaneously to cause controversy
and to distance himself from the views that caused the controversy,
raising record sales
while remaining immune to his critics' rancor. Perhaps that's so, and
having heard him freestyle, I have to give him props as a MC. But he doesn't
have the verbal
pyrotechnics of a number of other rappers in my estimation. Here's a list
of five rappers (with an indicative lyric) off the top of my head who'd do
better with the
appellation of poet than Eminem does:

-Mos Def
I seen her on the ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front

-Nas
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricocheting between the spots that I'm hidin in

-Talib Kweli (of Black Star)
Makin wack rappers go and merc the set
Better off behind a desk tryin to surf the net
Adament, worse than boric acid in your project cabinet

-Q-Tip (of Tribe Called Quest)
So sit and anylze this lyrical spray
Cause all it really is word play

-and of course, the brilliant, fatally flawed, ultimately doomed,
Notorious BIG:
Excuse me, flows just go through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches.

I think it's time we stopped blaming Nader for the results
of the last election. More likely suspects: registered Democrats
who didn't bother to vote.

"The Nader incident." That's a good one. When did the concept of elected
officials actually working to earn the vote of the individual citizen become
outdated?

I don't want to push-start the Nader-Go-Round on this list again. I do want to
point out that the Democrats(as we know them)are fueling the fear fire as a
means to their end, which is business as usual. Inaction.

They huff & they puff as they play catch-up w/ the latest polls. As long as
they're afraid to lead, they don't deserve to lead.

Republicans say it like they mean it. And they do mean it, as we're witnessing.
What wins undecided voters is respect for the candidate, & nobody really
respects Republican Lite. If progressive Democrats don't demand accountability
from their own party, the vote will be split again & again. If we don't support
progressive Democrat candidates straight through next year's election, we
deserve what we get.

You're clearly right that the Demos are a weak-kneed bunch. The alternative,
however, four more years of Bush, and the Ten Commandments will take the
place of the Constitution. Then what will you do? Pray?
Vote for a Democrat who can't win, and Bush will laugh all the way to his
next war.

Well Joel, I'm guessing that you voted for the Democrat who couldn't win in
2000. If you revisit my post, maybe you'll understand why I'm saying this-
again.

A year & a half before the election, you have already decided that a
progressive Democrat doesn't have a chance. Because this is what you're told.
You're prepared to take your medicine 15 months in advance. You're that scared?
Wow, they've(the Dem Machine)got you runnin'.

With or without your spoonful of sugar, my point still stands. A candidate
lacking progressive accountability(a Bush-Lite nominee)WILL NOT win in 2004.
There will be Party Splitsville again. And you WILL deserve what you get.

I'll pray for you now, my friend.

THE WILD BUNCH
Presented by White Box
Organized by Tairone Bastien

July 3 - August 2, 2003
Opening reception: Thursday July 3, 6-8 PM

601 West 26th Street, 14th Floor

The Wild Bunch gets its name from the practice of "wilding," a
spontaneous outburst of uncontrolled and aggressive behavior.  Common in
the 80's, wilding was born out of what many considered a political and
economic crisis; it embodied a growing disregard for social conventions
viewed as hypocritical by disenfranchised and alienated youth.  Working
on a national scale as a teacher for over two decades, Tim Rollins has
harnessed the spirit of wilding, transforming it into a productive and
socially creative force for hundreds of young artists throughout the U.S.

The work of Rollins' current and former students acknowledges an
anti-art tradition that originates in Dada and extends through the
practices of Pop, Arte Povera, Process Art, Graffiti and Hip-Hop.  The
work is often resistant to fixed positions, solid identities and
cultivation.   Instead this art celebrates perpetual flux, strangeness,
improvisation, unconventional materials, anarchistic ordering systems
and a delight in the careful construction of serious nonsense made in
response to an increasingly out-of-control world. The Wild Bunch will be
an unstable exhibition with works and actions unpredictably added,
subtracted or altered throughout the month of July.

MASS WORLDWIDE PROTEST DURING THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN
NEW YORK CITY: SUNDAY, AUGUST 29, 2004

In the last three years, George W. Bush has presided over
a radical right-wing takeover of the U.S. government whose
ramifications have been felt all over the world. Not only
has he waged two wars, killing thousands of innocent
people, during his short time in office, but he has also
implemented a policy of pre-emptive war that violates
international law and threatens global security. On the
home front, unemployment soars, the federal budget deficit
swells into the billions, and states prepare to slash
funding for everything from healthcare to education, yet
Bush responded with two huge tax cut that will primarily
benefit the wealthy rather than the people who are most in
need.

On every issue - from environmental regulations and
international treaty participation to worker rights, civil
rights and civil liberties - George W. Bush has pushed for
unprecedented and destructive changes in U.S. foreign and
domestic policy that even more sharply favor corporations
and the wealthy, especially Bush Administration supporters
at the expense of the people of the world and our
environment.

Meanwhile, the Bush Administration shamelessly uses the
tragic attacks of September 11, 2001 to justify its
aggressive and militaristic policies. In its most recent
attempt to exploit the grief and fear that were provoked
after September 11, the Republican Party pushed back its
2004 convention to August 28 - September 2, 2004 and will
hold it in New York City, not far from Ground Zero.

SAVE THE DATE: ON AUGUST 29, 2004, THE WORLD SAYS NO TO
BUSH

On February 15, 2003, millions of people all over the
world took to the streets in protest with the message The
World Says No to War. On August 29, 2004, we will come
together in New York City and in cities throughout the
world to say The World Says No to Bush!

We are also organizing a protest for Thursday, Sept. 2,
2004, the day of Bush's official selection as the
presidential candidate of the Republican Party.

Initiated by United for Peace and Justice
(http://www.unitedforpeace.org ), a U.S. anti-war
coalition with more than 600 member groups. UFPJ looks
forward to working with many other organizations on this
day of protest, so please contact us at
info@unitedforpeace.org if your group wants to work
collaboratively on these actions and to let us know about
other actions being planned to coincide with the
Republican Convention.

dear writers,

i just wanted to tell you a couple of new things about the m.a.g. and
about my work - i met a wonderful young poet who is 19 and is from nova
scotia - she is going to co-edit a student writing department in the
m.a.g. - we are going to call it "next-generation" - i think like 30
submissions came in this morning already

then a very fine man and writer from armenia is heading an armenian
department in the m.a.g. - he is planning to move to new york in the
near future to attend nyu or ccny

so much work came from australia and bulgaria that i am going to present
the work from both countries in two-part special features - the writers
from both countries are extraordinary in my opinion

the iranian editors are two very fine people - charles is friends with
one of them - i admire them very much - we are continuing an iranian
department in the m.a.g.

i have been asked to be inteviewed about my own work by editors in
several european countries - it is synchronistic because it comes at a
time when i am about to begin selling my own work and i have just asked
a few writers i know here if they would be interested in interviewing me
or writing an article about my work to help me to promote my work

i have a great editorial intern now who is 19 and his energy level is
radical - he is on the crew team at the university here and is an
english major undergraduate - stephen-paul martin is his professor -
this is how we met - through stephen

he is virtually assembling the entire m.a.g. which allows me to respond
to submissions quickly like i used to be able to and also to produce
more of my own projects

now i am looking for the right person to travel the alternative press
book circuit to represent my work - this is a salary position of course
and includes commission

i didn't tell very many people about this but a few months ago i almost
suffered a heart attack and had to be rushed to the er - but at the last
minute i told my wife to take me instead to see our alternative health
practitioner - he administered emergency alternative treatment including
massage acupuncture nurtritional supplements and homeopathy - he then
put me on a three-month protocol of nutritional supplements and
colustrum and regular acupuncture treatments

i am one-hundred percent recovered now

the crisis happened of course because the muse apprentice guild was
growing so fast and i was still managing it all alone - this is why i
finally relinquished total control and succumbed to asking stephen to
help me find an intern

stephen-paul martin and harry polkinhorn are the board members of the
muse apprentice guild - i think harry is one of the greatest living
writers - he is also probably one of the most intelligent men i have
ever met - he is in a class of his own - a real master

i have become close friends with mel freilicher too - we have lunch
together often - he is very sweet and sensitive and so is his partner -
mel is writing a short memoir about kathy acker for the m.a.g. - mel and
kathy were soulmates - they were like siblings

i would be honored to meet any one on the poetics list if any of you
ever travel to san diego - i don't travel because i have a 5-year-old
and she comes first



sincerely,
august highland

I need francophonic help:

A couple of years ago (when I was in France and could
read and write a little better) I copied a French
quote into my journal but without attribution.

I don't know who wrote it; I don't know what it means.
But I know it was important to me once.

Any help on either question Kazim-2003 and Kazim-2000
will both appreciate...

Here's the quote


“La poesie…n’y a pas de poetes mas un poet, toujours
le meme, du commencement j’usqu’a la fin du monde, une
force qui revét les coleurs des temps, des tribes, des
pays, des langages, des visages donnés, elle s’écoule
entre les rives qui la bordent comme un fleuve, sous
tels cieux ou tels autres, sur tels fonds ou tels autres.”

Dennis Kucinich is not what he appears. He was until June of last year
Anti-Abortion he has always been pro-labor but he came at it for most of his
career as a white ethnic Catholic midwesterner, not as a "progressive"in the
sense of those who post on this list serv. He is also Anti-Globalization
which is at best a mixed set of values since while things are not perfect we
cannot very well close the doors to the world can we?

I think that progressive candidates miss the point of winning elections.
Middle Class people those who make between 25,000-75,000 a year are under
incredible duress in this country they cannot even take vacations because of
fear of being pushed out of jobs, many people's so called high tech jobs are
being outsourced to Asia and many people are over extended creditwise, also
and I think this is important people over 45 cannot get health insurance if
they lose their jobs and many are being bankrupted by small medical
emergencies.
We do not need shrill
answers to these problems (which Kucinich provides). What we need is someone
who actually can speak to these people since those of us who read poetry
listservs are a very small part of the population. Unfortunately the only
politicians who could speak to these people successfully in the past 30
years were Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and look where that got us?

A Democrat who ran on some key issues could win, 1) A real healthcare safety
net that covers everyone removing that fear of financial ruin 2) Time, most
American have no time to take care of kids, take vacations or anything else
a candidate who said I will fight for your right to vacations and weekends
without being forced to work overtime would have a great issue,Most working
Americans work more than 60 hours a week (I know I do) and making this
illegal would be a great issue 3) The fact that Bush is in bed not only with
the Oil companies but with the Terrorist money providers and he lied to
us(Saudi Arabia is one for Example) if a Democrat could run on these issues
they would win, Instead however Democrats run on issues that make them look
extreme because unfortunately in most of America right wing opinions are the
majority opinion (outside of a few island of progressives) but these issues
cut across class lines.

Hi all,

Does anyone know if Coleridge coined the word 'experiential' or, if not
him, who did or how this word came about?

I might love to argue with you Haas, and maybe a few months or so down the
line, there will be some wonderful development -- a latter day Ellsberg
comes along and blows Emperor George out of the game, say -- but really I
agree with most of what you say.  (1)If he's not anti-Globalization, then he
won't make it.  Globalization may be ugly, but it's here to stay.  Best off
improving it, shoring up its defects, I suspect.  (2)The Economy is the Key.
Bush is turning the country into Chattel Slavery, somehow just too damn
stupid to realize folks will eventually crucify him, or at least I want to
believe that and strive for it. Ditto, that he's getting more and more
vulnerable every day.  I've spent two years reading, posting, and
participating daily if not hourly on a Yahoo Finance stock board focusing on
one of the really bad corporate scoundrels (Global Crossing).  I've been
"accepted" and liked there all along, though I've been openly
"SocialMarxist/MonetaryAdamSmithian" (or whatever) and spoken out loudly and
vulgarly against Bush throughout.  "We" are essentially unanimously incensed
by Bush now, and scores of fellow GXers announce regularly that they have
been lifelong Republicans, but will never vote for him again.  Bottom line?
Bush Sr. is a member of the Carlyle Group, which is under Blackstone
(Bankruptcy Advisors for Global Crossing), Perle is one of the creeps
they've tried to get on their board of directors, Bush Jr. hasn't done a
thing, Ashcroft and the DOJ haven't indicted a single GX exec, etcetera
etcetera etcetera.  Equals "the Govt. colluding with the perps," and
together they're screwing the retail stockholders.  There are similar
numbers of disaffected shafted similarly by Exxon and Worldcom and Tyco and
others, in all cases, shareholders ruined/devastated, the market a joke, and
corruption abounds while Emperor Bush is out to lunch with Kissinger (also
Global Crossing also sought) or Pitt or some other other buffoon crook and
Clinton goes to the superbowl with Winnick or plays golf with same, ditto
DNC's Terry McAuliffe.  Anyway, there's a lot of staunch and lifelong
Republicans and they're going to jump ship.  And they're not Progressive.
Plenty of bigots, anti-communists, Reagan lovers, and especially Evangelical
Christians, but they're as angry as hell at Bush and he's going to lose them
big.
IMO, a Democrat that ran on revamping the country's corporate bankruptcy
codes; ways of means of Wall Street, the Investment Banks, and the large
Brokerage Houses; corporate malfeasance; and justice for retail shareholders
and pension holders would win in a heartbeat, especially coupled with bright
and shrewdly manipulated counter-point to Bush's militarism, which is also
an economic issue is pursued intelligently.
I was, myself, torn between Kucinich and Graham and Dean, anyone that
originally against the war.  I have written Lieberman and strongly requested
he pull his middle-of-the-road campaign out of the game.  Ditto Hillary, who
hasn't done a damn thing for Global Crossing investors, though here in
upstate New York is supposed to be her territory, but I'm convinced    she
and Bill and other "middle-of-the-road" Dems got their hands dirty, and,
ummm, lotta anger there.  My own money (literally $50.00 for now) is
presently on Dean.  Will change in a flash if need be to put anybody but
Bush in, including Limp Lieberman or Long Shot Kucinich, if necessary, and
personally I believe that Kerry will be the frontrunner, though he's no
Nader, who'd be my ideal candidate.
Anyway, I won't argue here about who's best.  They're all politicians ('cept
Nader), so they all suck is my cynical opinion, but none of them make "evil"
a good candidate for re-introduction to the language like Bush Junior does.
Last, my fingers are crossed that the "republicans" raped in the market and
stripped of their retirement funds and despairing of job opportunities will
throw the Carlyle Group's son and his American Enterprise Institute
pseudo-"Straussian" cabal not only out of office but straight to jail.
That's how angry a lot of the middle class is.  There are some significant
numbers of "us" who want blood.  And, smile, yer average Evangelical
Christian seeking revenge of their "trusted heroes" aren't real lenient.
They'd want the death penalty.  (They're already hungering to string up
Winnick and Legere and others behind the Global Crossing redistribution of
wealth.  Me, too, ummm, of course, smile.  Actually, there is not a day that
goes by that my imagination doesn't entertain some dark thoughts).
Blah blah blah

Dennis Kucinich is not what he appears. He was until June of last year
Anti-Abortion he has always been pro-labor but he came at it for most of his
career as a white ethnic Catholic midwesterner, not as a "progressive"in the
sense of those who post on this list serv. He is also Anti-Globalization
which is at best a mixed set of values since while things are not perfect we
cannot very well close the doors to the world can we?
I think that progressive candidates miss the point of winning elections.
Middle Class people those who make between 25,000-75,000 a year are under
incredible duress in this country they cannot even take vacations because of
fear of being pushed out of jobs, many people's so called high tech jobs are
being outsourced to Asia and many people are over extended creditwise, also
and I think this is important people over 45 cannot get health insurance if
they lose their jobs and many are being bankrupted by small medical
emergencies. We do not need shrill answers to these problems (which Kucinich
provides). What we need is someone who actually can speak to these people
since those of us who read poetry listservs are a very small part of the
population. Unfortunately the only politicians who could speak to these
people successfully in the past 30 years were Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton
and look where that got us?
A Democrat who ran on some key issues could win, 1) A real healthcare safety
net that covers everyone removing that fear of financial ruin 2) Time, most
American have no time to take care of kids, take vacations or anything else
a candidate who said I will fight for your right to vacations and weekends
without being forced to work overtime would have a great issue,Most working
Americans work more than 60 hours a week (I know I do) and making this
illegal would be a great issue 3) The fact that Bush is in bed not only with
the Oil companies but with the Terrorist money providers and he lied to
us(Saudi Arabia is one for Example) if a Democrat could run on these issues
they would win, Instead however Democrats run on issues that make them look
extreme because unfortunately in most of America right wing opinions are the
majority opinion (outside of a few island of progressives) but these issues
cut across class lines.

Derek R, experience the French word links to experiment. See de Montaigne
and Mr. Bacon. Agamben has essay in early book on experience experiment +
youth among other things, see his Infancy of History (but don't quote from
Giorgio unless you are wearing Armani and able to weather accusations that
may be hurled at you from the very fetid middenheap of the critics' den of
DisOlympus - a scene by the way that was left out of Quest for Fire, but is
crucial to any understanding of the 1980s - accused, that is, of being,
today, too au fait with le snooty monde de philosophie and thinking anything
French applies to anything really Truly Poetry).

Too true: "the temptation of ethics [is] to recontain itself by assigning
hostile and more properly political impulses to the ultimate negative
category of _ressentiment_" (Jameson, _Political Unc., 60).

Californians are a population on the move, alive to change, living on the=20

of gritty towns and cities, burning deserts, lonely mountains, a huge sky=20

Rochelle Owens
Luca: Discourse on Life and Death

Rochelle Owens=92 writing, here as elsewhere, is sui generis. She is, in=
 many=20
ways, a proto-language poet...  But Owens is angrier, more energetic, and=20
more assertive than most of her Language counterparts, ...and she presents=
=20
herself as curiously non-introspective. Hers is a universe of stark=20
gesture, lightning flash, and uncompromising judgement: it is imperative,=20
in her poetic world, to face up to the horror, even as the point of view is=
=20
flexible enough to avoid all dogmatism.
Immensely learned, sophisticated, and witty in its conceits, this Discourse=
=20
on Life and Death demands two kinds of reading. First, it should be read=20
through from beginning to end as if it were a novel...
But a second reading is required to note the poem=92s microstructure=96its=
=20
superb modulation of rhythms and internal rhymes, its ironies and=20
paradoxes. It is the layering of cultures and especially of myths,=20
including our own contemporary myths of the Great Creative Genius (always=20
male), creating beauty out of the detritus around him, that makes Luca  so=

distinctive. Watch out, Owens seems to be saying, for those high-minded=20

=93In the world of these poems the ground is never steady. There is the=

MY MIND ON BUSH (READ ON)


Because of the fact that we cannot, absolutely cannot, analyze this hated
fuhrer of ours any further (fuhrer-further), not even for a farthing
(fuhrer-further-farthing), there remains only the possibility of an
examination of the faring (fuhrer-further-farthing-faring) of our hatred
for his forming (fuhrer-further-farthing-faring-forming) of the most
violent furious (fuhrer-further-farthing-faring-forming-furious) regime
this bloody country has been subjected to as long as I can remember.

Our hatred knows no bindings or bounds; were it legal, I would hoist the
man to toast his incarcerated body, held by a military tribunal, within
its desiccated stockade. He was born barren. He is evil and believes -
beeviles - in an evil god. He lives - evils - in an ugly world. His
ugliness wears ours thin. He sleeps in his livery - evilry. We are
bedeviled - bedeviled. He is vile - evil. He should not be alive - aevil.
We are no longer lively - evilly. We are believed - bedevile - veiled -
eviled - and dead. We are dead.

HONORING THE 4TH OF JULY
A Message from People For the American Way

** Abandonment of the constitutional rule of law.

** Military encroachment on civilian authority.

** Suspension of judicial protections.

Scary times.

So scary, in fact, that grievances against our head of state
had to be expressed resolutely.

In a document released on this day, a group of real patriots
have done just that.

He is "depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by
jury," "he has...obstruct[ed] the laws for naturalization of
foreigners," and people are being transported "beyond seas to be
tried for pretended offences," the document reads.

This group of civil libertarians went on to point out that our
government's head has abolished "our most valuable laws," and
altered, "fundamentally the forms of our governments." They
elaborated, explaining, "He has erected a multitude of new
offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our
people." Moreover, "he has affected to render the military
independent of and superior to the civil power."

"He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction
foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws,"
reads the indictment.

Particular aim is taken at the threat to our judiciary, stating
that George "has obstructed the administration of justice, by
refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers,"
and has "made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure
of their offices."

Released today - 227 years ago - the Declaration of
Independence made the case for what would later become the
United States of America and its guiding Constitution - the
model for budding democracies ever since.

I asked Willard Bohn about the quotation; he didn't know the source, but
gives this brief gloss and a quick translation:

I don't know where the quote (filled with spelling errors) comes from, but
it means something like:

Poetry . . . There are no poets but simply one poet, always the same, from
the beginning to the end of the world, a force that assumes the color of
the times, tribes, countries, languages, certain faces, it flows between
banks that border it like a river, beneath various skies and against
various backgrounds.

Subject:      The problem with senators
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The problem with senators is that they think they can (should) be
president. In the history of the United States, the number of senators
who immediately ascended to the White House is exactly one: JFK.

Since Watergate the White House has changed parties four times. In EVERY
case, the incoming president who ousted the other party was a Governor.

Carter ousted Ford
Reagan ousted Carter
Clinton ousted Bush 41
Bush 43 "defeated" Gore

If Bush had been a Senator (or Gore had been a governor), the Supreme
Court would never had had a chance to rig the results.

Conclusion: when the populace is dissatisfied with the incumbent, they
will NOT turn to another "Washington insider."

Conclusion 2: John Kerry has ZERO chance of beating Bush. Ditto every
other senator and congressman. A Kerry candidacy is a "gimme" to the
Republicans.

It's Dean or nothing. I'm not wild about Dean - he seems like a New
England version of Carter. He's good on certain issues, but not
necessarily good on others and may prove every bit as rigid as Carter
did when in office.

Nor is Dean is the best positioned Governor to run - but the one who
is/was best positioned - Gary Locke of Washington - isn't running.

And I agree with the perception that Kucinich is not all he seems to be.
His flip flog on women's rights to control their bodies seems entirely
brought on by his desire to win the nomination. I would expect
anti-choice Supreme Court nominations from him.

There are no guarantees. Bush would certainly try to make Dean look like
Dukakis all over again, the lone exception to the governors' rule (but
he was running against another former governor). Given that even Al
Sharpton would be an improvement on what is certainly the worst
president in U.S. history, I think we have to try.

But don't drink the "Kerry is the strongest candidate" Koolaid. Because
it's absolutely not true,

Ron


PS on another topic altogether: The OED shows the first use of the word
"experiential" belongs to Coleridge, yes.

Frank:

We know why the Democrat didn't win--the election in Florida was fixed. Not
to excuse Gore. who didn't have the fire in his belly. I'm not criticizing
your strategy, if it moves Kerry to the left then it's more than worthwhile.
But having seen several progressive democrats defeated, and badly, during my
lifetime, I don't want to go the same route again. We can't afford it, as
corporations are taking over the reins of government. Yes, the right-wing,
in any country, always has the shit together, as their program is simple:
power, greed, intolerance. Hitler was a straight-ahead kind of guy. The
right-wing always has the upper hand because it appeals to simplicity and
the always lurking dark side of the human psyche. It's the master of secrecy
and the lie, as we see with the Bush Administration. While democracy is
about discussion, argument, the testing of ideas. of airing the laundry out.
And it's about compromise, whether we like the compromise or not.
As for a progressive candidate being able to win the next election. I agree
that one could win the Democratic nomination, but not the national election.
You can tell how a progressive candidate can do by the level and quality of
a country's literacy. Need I say more?

All those philosophical whims called duties have no relation whatever=20
to Nature; duty proceeds from men, Attraction proceeds from God; now,=20
if we desire to know the designs of God, we must study Attraction,=20
Nature only, without any regard to duty, which varies with every age,=20
while the nature of the passions has been and will remain invariable=20
among all nations of men.

Be grateful Locke isn't running. As one of the PI columnists wrote
this last week, the Republicans should consider Locke their best
candidate.

The only reason Locke looks like a Democrat in this state is because
the Republicans are busy polishing their guns and waiting for the
black helicopters to come in over the treetops.

Most recently, Locke almost wet himself, so anxious was he to help
out Boeing. He gave the company $3 billion in tax write offs (this is
on a state budget of $23 billion per biennium -- do the math, even if
the cut is over ten years ... ). He gutted unemployment law. And on
and on. This for a corporation that has, so far, proven a lynchpin of
the Puget Sound economy by laying off 30,000 people in the last
year and a half and announced another 500 job cuts the week after it
got the giveaway.

In the regular session, Locke refused to raise taxes and smacked
social services hard across the mouth. As a result, 60,000 working
poor in the state are going to be booted off the state's basic
healthcare plan. Next stop, the ER -- if they can make it that far. And
that's only the largest of the cuts. If you were poor, underemployed,
or have children, you got fucked.

Locke makes Dan Evans (a former moderate Republican governor)
look like a tree-hugging pinko.

Locke!

Where does or does not Gen W Clark fit into any Democratic profile. I have
skim knowledge - but I assume he would scare the shit out of the Bushies. He
can't be easily McGovernized, etc.

Time for  Peace Convoys to Iraq to bring out a whole new rush of
Conscientious Soldier Objectors. My "precision" radar senses the lines are
forming. Otherwise the military in Iraq looks likes it's stuck and rolling
on a Velcro road to hell with absolutely no way out - well, "we" are buying
Polish and other mercenaries to camouflage an apparent absolute failure of
"occupation" foresight and "precision" planning. Correct me if I am wrong,
but I think "we" is fried.

Happy Fourth!

A reminder that the DWP benefit concert happens tomorrow nite, that is,
Saturday, 7/5, at 9pm at Signal 66 in DC. I'm hoping for a strong turn-out,
so that we can put on more of these kinds of concerts and shows, per the
recommendations of the art gallery we're putting this on at, not only in DC,
but across the midwest on our way to the Chigaco gig next March. So pleez
come. Brian Kalkbrenner is reading, we're passing out free copies of the
first DWP journal, which includes our list of recommended children's books,
and there will be much merrymaking. John Sinclair is in the house,
m*therf*cking John Sinclair! This is going to be a blast.

 Brilliant! Very, very good. (I like the links, too)

(That is, it deflects the catastrophe for a minute or two through wit --
which is more than most poetry does).

"Catastrophe is not what threatens to occur at any given moment but what is
given at any given moment. . . That things have gone this far *is* the
catastrophe." (Benjamin)

If you hit the buttons within the page you wind up in what appears to be an

That specific link also serves to link Donald Rummy to

This is out there!

From the July 5 London Independent:

... the US military said it had killed 11 Iraqis who had attacked a convoy
with rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun fire. No Americans were
injured.

The mortar attack on the base came just before the arrival of Arnold
Schwarzenegger on a 4 July visit to US troops and also presumably in the
hope of boosting his chances if, as he has indicated, he runs for the
governorship of California.

On arriving at Baghdad airport, where there was a special screening of his
latest movie, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Mr Schwarzenegger had
already, somewhat tastelessly, given his first impressions of Iraq.

"It is really wild driving round here, I mean the poverty, and you see there
is no money, it is disastrous financially and there is the leadership
vacuum, pretty much like California," he said. If he had stayed longer, he
would also have discovered differences between California and Iraq such as
the stream of raw sewage that runs in front of the door of the main
children's teaching hospital in Baghdad, the lack of electricity and water
and the continual looting...

I've been writing up a storm of sorts on my blog of late -- hence my lack of
contribution to the listservs.  It's probably all nonsense anyway but I
invite you to check it out:

Silliman on Lowell

http://www.arras.net/weblog/000694.html

The "Third Way", etc.

http://www.arras.net/weblog/000700.html

***

The "Third Way," etc.

This is in response to something Kasey wrote on his blog, which includes at
the moment writing by both him and Michael Magee that is worth reading if
you have any interest in this debate:

My sense is: so much as you permit there being "two ways," there will have
to -- especially for a good Hegelian -- be a third way. But if one lives in
a universe of heterogenous (however provisional) wholes coming in conflict
with each other at all points, none with compelling claims to be more
ascendant than others (this is, of course, possible), then these "thirds"
will always themselves be provisional, and are if anything aids to thinking.
(If these "claims" are compelling, then the "third ways" tend to have a
revolutionary aspect to them -- as it might have in England when Pound was
there -- performing what might be the function of a "second" or "other" way.
It's obviously most salient when a language -- such as Italian -- is being
used for the first time to peform in fashions usually reserved for other
languages, in this example, Latin. We have no such divide right now unless
someone were to attempt a poem or novel in Black American English -- far as
I know.)

If one were to put on a small books shelf Pierre Guyotat's Eden Eden Eden ,
Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons and William Burrough's Naked Lunch, then
put -- on the other side of the bookshelf -- Robert Lowell's Life Studies,
Edgar Lee Master's Spoon River Anthology and even -- for kicks -- the
collected Robert Frost or the Amy Lowell of "Patterns" -- her exploitation
of the idea of "imagism" -- you could probably place most Language poetry
somewhere in between. Language poetry often has the reproducibility of form
that one associates with the latter writers -- one hits upon something and
is able to exploit it for an impressive duration -- with the modernist
charge of the former -- desparate acts of creation often involving
ephemerality and "failure" -- but in neither case entirely sacrifices a
claim to "realism" entirely (at least among the Americans, who can often
recuperate their work into a philosophy of pragmatism), nor to a secure
position in relation to national norms of discourse (i.e. what is not
allowed to be said). I.e. the very functionality of the method seems to
preclude there being as negative a charge as might occur in a neo-romantic
vein (whether our neo-romantic be Rimbaud, Kafka or Beckett -- and these are
hardly Romantics!).

I'm being schematic here (and maybe confusing), but certainly, much of RS's
writing will tend toward the side of autobiographical, and more or less
dispassionate, social realists than it will on the side of the fiery or
oddball, truly "negative" writing of the formal innovators. This doesn't
make it "bad" writing -- I'm a fan of much of his work, obviously, just look
at /ubu -- but because a formal technique is being employed (in his case the
"new sentence," which never, frankly, struck me as radical) hardly spares a
poem (such as his tiring, distracted Roof book "N/O") from being branded as
passive -- about language, about society, about issues of epistemology and
genre. What can be more "quietudinous" than a passivity regarding these
issues? In comparison, the tortured, jagged, compressed rhythms of Lowell's
"The Skunk Hour" come off as punk rock.

I don't think any Language poet with the exception of Bruce Andrews (and
maybe Bernstein and Watten) has taken the project of the evisceration of
national social (or linguistic) mores to the same extremes thant the great
French tradition (or anti-tradition) of Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Lautreamont,
Jarry, the Situationists (Guyotat is often identified as one of them),
etc. -- not to mention predecessors Rousseau or de Sade. Most Language
writing looks quite polite and "healthy" in comparison, at least from this
perspective -- the Protestant ethic of the good work done daily in order to
"make it new" appears as a subprogram of much of this writing. This is not a
statement about American poetry as a whole -- that's more complex -- or all
of Language poetry -- the fragmentary nature of Bernstein's early and
middle-period writing seems to me attentive to this ethics of failure, of
anti-systemicity, in "hot" modernism -- but oddly, someone like Plath
occupies a more critical space -- there with Ginsberg and Burroughs -- than
one would think. There is an "out on a limb" aspect to what she was trying
to do that is impressive to me, and her later method doesn't strike me as
less "radical" than that of, say, Rae Armantrout -- quite the contrary, in
fact.

When I hear about a truly national debate (or maybe a good essay by
Christopher Hitchens) about the unquietudinous-ness of Language poetry then
I will be impressed -- so far, it has not happened. There's nothing wrong
with this, of course, I just don't understand how one can point to a
"lineage" in one's writing as somehow conferring a badge on a writer as
being on the good side of a -- presumed, but in my mind quite "imaginary" --
literary divide. To suggest Language poets as somehow sweating in the
trenches and other poets not -- categorically -- strikes me as nonsense. And
it always seems to involve the rather limited purview of "American"
writing -- observing how the two principled, dueling Scots, MacDiarmid and
Finlay, came to a rapprochement at the end of the former's career should be
illustrative of where the future -- for "us" -- lies. Much of this won't
matter: the 1200 pages of The Alphabet will be judged on its own merits as
something to read, as will the 60 or so pages of Life Studies. We can only
guess why these works will be interesting in the future, one that may not
even have room for such concepts as "perfect binding."

(P.S. It's ironic that, in that bit from Duncan, he quotes the end of the
Lowell poem about Delmore Schwartz. My favorite ending of a Duncan poem is
that one in which some attention to different registers of style in
contrapuntal play is demonstrated, and that ends:

A second: a moose painted by Stubbs,
where last year's extravagent antler's
      lie on the ground.
The forlorn moosey-faced poem wears
      new antler-buds,
      the same,

"a little heavy, a little contrived,"

his only beauty to be
      all moose.

It's actually the same kind of compression that Lowell brings in at the end
fo the Schwartz poem -- a sudden swerve from the dominant, even heroic,
meter into a bathetic, skipping tone, finally focusing on a fine point at
the end as if the poem were balanced on a pin, like some geological
balancing act out in the Yellowstone Park. Duncan almost seems drunk here
himself -- and I like it. Ironically, the climas results in a telescoped
image of an animal (or animal part) -- "strong" imagism, a la white
chickens, coming to save the day again.

Few poets were more afraid of letting his metrics be taken over by anything
as vulgar as social realism or speech as Duncan -- I find so much of him
unreadable because of all the gaudy European trappings, the Pound-envy, the
loping "stately" rhythms and capitalized Nouns, like he were Philip Sydney
and didn't know better, or Mallarme, enriching every detail with
"correspondence". I guess I just never believed he had as much access to
higher states of knowledge than the rest of us -- I hope it's fair to be
suspicious here, since he made some huge claims. In terms of "fear" versus
"freedom," I'm not sure that Duncan wins. One is, after all, quite free
before the "void" -- it is, after all, the evacuation of meaning that
provided some of the bases for the theory of Language writing itself (and
that brought Mallarme himself to start slinging words across the page like
dice).

When Duncan starts psycho-analyzing his writers -- Spicer is apparently the
poet of "death" while he himself was of life, or sex, or whatever, from my
dim memory of the Spicer biography -- one must -- as a good iconoclast and
heretic -- recoil, as it's clear such oppositional binaries are only
intended to create the image of power around the naming creature, ye who
sets terms (terms being, in themselves, very useful). Sacrificing this power
for the sake of flows, on the one hand, or in service of the dialectic, on
the other, seems to me to be imperative -- if that doesn't sound too much
like a "spiritual" disposition. But they must at the same time be questioned
at all moments if possible -- why not, seems to me the only confirmation of
living that is reliable.

Bard is well-versed in Carrboro's character
July 3, 2003

By Susan Broili, The Herald-Sun=20
It happened once. And, now it's happened again. Carrboro has its second poe=
t laureate.           =20

    Patrick Herron, 32, takes over the helm as town bard officially today w=
hen he makes his first public appearance at the town's July Fourth festivit=
ies at town hall. At 1:10 p.m. "after the square dancers and before the clo=
ggers," he'll read the poem that won him the position.            =20

    The first part of his poem is meant to be sung, but Herron plans to rea=
d it.           =20

    "I have a terrible singing voice," Herron said Thursday during an inter=
view at the Carrboro home he shares with his wife, Janet, boxer Hooch and c=
ats Cobweb and Rosemary.           =20

    In his poem, he mixes the personal and the public as he celebrates the =
town he loves.           =20

    It was just these qualities that convinced the town's first poet laurea=
te, Kate Lovelady, to choose Herron as the town's next poet from about a do=
zen applicants who had to submit a poem based on the theme of Independence =
Day to be considered for the honor.           =20

    "What I liked about his poem was his combination of public and private =
images in a nice way. He seemed to really love Carrboro but still be able t=
o see it very clear-eyed. It wasn't sentimental at all," Lovelady said. "He=
 was so exuberant to write such a long poem I thought he would make a good =
poet laureate."           =20

    He'll have to see how the reading goes to decide whether his future off=
icial poems will be as long, Lovelady added.           =20

    Herron is definitely enthusiastic about Carrboro, where he has lived fo=
r almost 15 years.            =20

    "It's a really progressive, small town with a lot of charm, into arts a=
nd music. It's a great town to be a writer or painter or musician," Herron =
said.           =20

    The fact that Carrboro is the only municipality in the state with its o=
wn poet laureate pleases him.           =20

    "If anything, it's saying, `We value the arts.' I think that's fantasti=
c," Herron said.           =20

     He also has a little fun, in his poem, with the town's progressive qui=
rks, such as taking a stand by defending the French amidst the recent criti=
cism that country received here, in which some people took to calling frenc=
h fries freedom fries.           =20

    In his poem, he writes: "We call ourselves the Paris of the Piedmont be=
cause we have a sense of humor. Elsewhere under this radiant sky we share, =
you can get your Freedom Fries."           =20

    And he pokes fun at some clich=C3=A9s about Southern writers by referri=
ng to four different types of plants by name. "To be a sophisticated Southe=
rn poet, one must know the horticulture," he said.           =20

    Herron wanted to be poet laureate to share locally the work that has wo=
n him success elsewhere in the past two years. He will have poems published=
 this fall in The Iowa Review and Exquisite Corpse.           =20

    The poet gained early support and recognition for his poems via the Int=
ernet, after he joined an on-line poetry discussion group.           =20

    He also wants to use the position to start a poetry series or festival =
in which he'll invite local and other poets to read, featuring "people who =
are moving the art form forward but are not part of the establishment."    =
       =20

    Although Herron has written poetry since he was 15 and still living in =
the Philadelphia area where he grew up, he got serious about it after a per=
sonal tragedy six years ago when his best friend, Chris Lewis, 26, died in =
a fire.           =20

    Lewis had encouraged him to pursue poetry and told him he would be mise=
rable as a doctor. Herron was enrolled in the pre-med program at N.C. State=
 at the time.           =20

    "After he died, I listened to him," Herron said.           =20

    So, Herron began writing poetry every day -- a practice he continues ev=
en though he is currently working on a master's degree in information scien=
ce at UNC, where he majored in philosophy and linguistics as an undergradua=
te. He also works as a freelance computer programmer.           =20

     Four years ago, he became one of six poets selected to participate in =
a master class with poet James Tate in New York. Then, David Kellogg, a tea=
cher at Duke University and president of the Durham-based Carolina Wren Pre=
ss, introduced him to an on-line poetry discussion group, and he began gett=
ing invitations to submit his work.           =20

    Lovelady said that she was struck by how different Herron's poetry is f=
rom what she writes, and thought the town could use some variety.          =
 =20

    For instance, Herron said the poem that will be published in Exquisite =
Corpse consists entirely of synonyms for death written in a musical form he=
 invented.           =20

    But, in many ways, the poem he submitted in the poet laureate contest i=
s different from what he usually writes. His wife, Janet, said she thought =
writing official poems for the town would be good for him.           =20

    "So much of what he writes is so esoteric. This is more approachable an=
d personal," Janet Herron said of the poem that won her husband the title o=
f poet laureate.           =20

    Still, Patrick Herron plans to write even official poems as only he can=
.           =20

    "I love ambiguity. It can eliminate the facts of the world and get to a=
 state of feelings," he said. "It's not the facts of the moment but the fee=
lings that are important."          =20

         =20

  Editor's note: This is the poem that won Patrick Herron the title of Carr=
boro poet laureate. Carrboro's first poet laureate, Kate Lovelady, served a=
s judge for this year's selection. Herron will read his poem at 1:10 p.m. t=
oday at Carrboro Town Hall as part of the town's Fourth of July festivities=

  It's been ten years today        =20

  since I first asked you.        =20

  Ten years of waking up        =20

  inside you. Ten years.        =20

  Do you remember        =20

  that sticky July evening        =20

  we watched fireworks from        =20

  the strip mall parking lot        =20

  along the highway?        =20

  Independence Day was somehow our        =20

  first dependence day and we agreed,        =20

  we agreed. We chose to say       =20

  we will live here,        =20

  together among the loblollies       =20

  and the metal sticks that point us        =20

  to everywhere else, the signposts       =20

  carrying signs that try to remind us        =20

  this town is not the only place.        =20

  Raleigh, 25 miles. Durham,        =20

  12 miles, Chapel Hill, 1 mile.        =20

  Some of the signs seem holy,       =20

  bullet piercings appearing as if the        =20

  wounded DMV signs        =20

  were photographed just        =20

  before bursting into flame.        =20

  It's that hot here in July.       =20

  But we discovered why to stick        =20

  together, inside each other,        =20

  as each other, that is. It had little       =20

  to do with the vinyl seat       =20

  sticking to us.       =20

  That's how some places grow,        =20

  in you not on you. The ones that       =20

  stay, not go on. `On you' is        =20

  parasitic, a fungus, something to        =20

  be rid of like an infection        =20

  but `in you' is        =20

  love, a phrase of affection.        =20

  As evidence of that growth        =20

  I can offer you only        =20

  a handshake or        =20

  a wave as you pass by in your car,        =20

  or simply my helping hand,        =20

  We call ourselves       =20

  Paris of the Piedmont because       =20

  we have a sense of humor. Elsewhere       =20

  under this radiant sky we share,       =20

  you can get your Freedom Fries.       =20

  Here some still call our fries French       =20

  and we all relish the right to do so.       =20

  So look here at my palm.       =20

  In it is me, it is I;       =20

  it is a map of you,       =20

  it is you. I can no longer       =20

  discern where you end       =20

  and I begin. You open your hands,       =20

  a silent gesture of submission.        =20

  Look here, this is        =20

  Hillsborough Road, your heart line,       =20

  where you hope and grow and dream       =20

  freely, under the willow oak       =20

  beside the billow of hydrangea; ours sometimes sky blue when we choose.  =
     =20

  Hillsborough meets Greensboro Street,        =20

  the brain line, this artery to school,       =20

  conducting me to such places as        =20

  that apartment on Hanna Street        =20

  so many people ago       =20

  when you were still here with me       =20

  or all those long conversations        =20

  about fixing an oppressed world        =20

  when the town around us was        =20

  working perfectly. Food before        =20

  morality. Weaver Street       =20

  the life line, of course, without which       =20

  I just might not eat.        =20

  And this crooked line        =20

  intersecting all of them        =20

  is my Main Street, my destiny       =20

  line. This line is a       =20

  scar, actually. It stems from        =20

  when I wrecked my bicycle after        =20

  a crooked evening on you.        =20

  Main Street, o you I love,       =20

  `how do you do,' you say so sweetly,       =20

  even if your traffic signals       =20

  are so poorly timed. It's all true.       =20

  That night, the sky drove        =20

  a car in the dark. One headlight        =20

  was out, but the other glowed        =20

  as a disc of mercury, or       =20

  like a spotlight outside some giant        =20

  auto dealership in the sky.        =20

  I remember you, your car wreck.       =20

  Under that moonlight we bled.        =20

  The same moonlight,        =20

  in the same moonlight,       =20

  this place, this Main Street       =20

  where I wished a part of you,       =20

  some say all of you,       =20

  goodbye. Don't go. You must       =20

  stay here in this place. Here       =20

  at this somewhere where       =20

  the heaving charcoal clouds        =20

  are bearable, this where we        =20

  are able to speak happily        =20

  among us, we who are passing       =20

  by street or by clock. A home        =20

  is where we bear       =20

  the yoke of life's misfortunes       =20

  yet choose to stay a little longer.       =20

  Buoyancy is a wonder for us, we       =20

  who live to see we are afloat.       =20

  Because something better        =20

  is soon within reach, because        =20

  the whisper of these   `Carrburra' streets       =20

  is, `we can, we can.' Here is a town        =20

  where it is not so important       =20

  who we are as separate beings       =20

  but as interdependent   wrinkles.       =20

  folding together on a hand, and        =20

  where my end is where you        =20

  began. This is the place        =20

  where I forget what it is       =20

  that distinguishes and separates       =20

  me from you, you Carrboro,       =20

  you who wishes to infuse        =20

  your self among us until        =20

  we feel it common for us        =20

  to meet upon the streets       =20

  of your gentle contradiction       =20

  in freedom, hand in hand.      =20

=20

Walked over in Times Square

Touching her sleeping breasts they suddenly opened like sharp spikes of a
railroad bridge ripped in two. The trees filled with a silver light growing
with contaminants far from the river. A cluster of barbed wire riddled with
pieces of fur and flesh. The Artist died in 1916 in a ditch filled with
water and rot.

Lacerations colored her white raw nakedness . I won’t repeat the things she
said to me smeared with sand and kisses I took her away from the river. I
behaved like what I am ;a thick fingered faux man asking the wrong questions
at the wrong time in loud bleats like a pig being cut and dressed for the
first time.

A porous border sits between the colors that matter and the colors that don’
t Nothing here is profoundly American but a collection of nuts and bolts and
colors and old shoes that have no more use for us except to take up space in
the back seat of an old Chevy. . Europe has assembled an American place of
extreme and dangerous sensuality.

They stand to be painted with big fleshy posteriors or large breasts that
don’t seem to fit high-heeled nudes, dancers and circus acrobats; pensive
girls who seem so aware of being looked at and are used to the spotlight.
They want to live the laid back bohemian life but it is not possible since
smoking is now illegal ;thinking is regulated and we are not allowed to wear
black anymore. The twists and distortions are a kind of energized mental jar
bouncing and causing your brain to slosh around and hit the sides of your
skull.

Hi, can anyone backchannel me the issue of Poetics Journal in which Bob
Perelman's review of Jameson's Political Unconscious appears, and the page

Hi Maria Damon,

I just got back from that area -- spending nine days with extended family and
miraculously no fights!  Only one stomach flu.

Delaware Water Gap used to be called the Eighth Wonder of the World -- it's where
the Delaware River slices through the Appalachian Mountains.  The river at that
point is about a mile wide, and is rather scenic.  Would be more so if a roaring
highway didn't go from there straight into NYC about an hour and twenty minutes
hence on Route 80.  There is a town called Delaware Water Gap.  I used to go there
to get drugs while in high school.  You could always count on hashish and pot,
especially if you went to a place called Deer Head Inn, which is filled with deer
heads, and a ten foot wide urinal.  Many jazz players once lived in this small town
of 500 -- Zoot Sims, Bob Dorough, and many many others.  Every night the piano in
the Deer Head went from six pm to four in the morning.  If anybody's ever heard of
Fred Waring -- his group maintains a large studio there.  The town is cute with
nice parks, and is right off the Appalachian trail (there is an info center there
for the trail) and now somebody has come in and put in a to-scale Stonehenge at a
place called Columcille -- a New Age place about ten minutes up in the mountains
near a New Age conference center called Kirkridge.  There are labyrinths and large
stone churches set in the hills in striking poses.

The news is that Columbians have started using the place to distribute cocaine
because the local airport isn't patrolled at all and yet flies small planes to
Chicago and the west coast.

Maria, I haven't lived there for a long time -- just some family left there -- when
I did live there it was all hippies, but a lot of those people have become heads of
insurance companies, joined the CIA (I'm not kidding -- a guy who blew up the local
draft recruiting office in 1973 is now a big guy in the CIA), and so on.  Hippy
life is just too hard to maintain without a trust fund.

But you can see (or hear) the end of it at the Deer Head Inn, at Delaware Water
Gap.

Maria Damon, and others on the places thread --

In addition to the Deer Heads, there are still a lot of potheads.  I went over for a
non-alcoholic beer and saw them lighting up on the porch.  I didn't recognize any
specific people -- but recognized the scarf around the head, the lack of a good shave,
the hiking boots and flannel shirts, etc.  It reminded me very much of where I went to
college, too, at Evergreen -- whose major export seems to be radical people who like
nature.  I used to really try to love nature, but only like Linden trees now, becuase
they have such smooth bark.  You can kiss them without injury!

Oh, another thing: I went to the Allentown Bethlehem Easton area for a look-see.  That
looked built-up and yet is older, and has neighborhoods.  I went to the library at
Muhlenberg College.  I'm doing a study of formerly Lutheran colleges.  What happened,
etc.  There used to be 42 of these, and now most of them have voted to oust their synod
affiliation.  It has to do with money, mainly -- there is more money to be gotten as a
secular school that doesn't discriminate on the basis of religion.  So almost all of
the Lutheran schools have caved in.  I think St. Olaf's and Valparaiso and a few others
still maintain Lutheran priorities in student and professional staffing.  Others have
caved in to EOP and Affirmative Action rulings in order to get government subsidies.

Muhlenberg for instance just got rid of 21 of their 22 Lutheran clergy on their Board
of Trustees and replaced them with good solid businessmen.  Now over half the student
body is Jewish, and the rest are mostly Catholic.  One guy in the English department
told me there are still a few old Lutherans skulking around but nobody can stand them
since they are so dour.  They have a gorgeous neo-Gothic Cathedral that is still
staffed by Lutherans, and the chorus was practicing a hymn called something like "With
Wounded Head I Bow Down"  -- they sounded good to my dour ear.

This area looked interesting to me -- lots of gingerbread houses made of brick by what
looked like largely German immigrants in terms of the design -- but I didn't really
know the area.  Is housing expensive?  I'm looking for a good small town of about
100,000, somewhere on either the east or the west coast.  Not right away, mind you, but
as places to check out.  I like to look at  cities and towns and see how they are
doing, and talk to the mayor if I can, and find out about their problems.

Maybe I'll even live in one again if I can find an appropriate one.  Carrsboro sounds
very nice, but I want to see the winning poem, and I want to know what the Poet
Laureate receives as compensation.  Who chose the poet laureate at Carrsboro?  I think
that Chaucer got a barrel of spirits and ten dollars.  Is that right?  I can't
remember.  Billy Collins gets 33 thousand, or something like that, with a place to stay
in DC.  How much does the Carrsboro laureate get?

It isn't a lot, really, to ask say ten grand.  I think that's what Amiri Baraka was
getting before the 9-11 poem.  Is he still employed?

Should every town and village have a poet in this country?  How should they be picked?
What should they do?  Should they write a history, as Olson did for Gloucester?  How
much should they be paid?  Can they be impeached?  Does Gloucester have a poet
laureate?  Perhaps it should be on the balloting -- and rival poems published in the
papers, so that citizens can choose!  Enough of these hand-picked appointees, already.
It would be a charming institution, improbably.

Yes, and a court jester, and a gentleman of the mayor's closet, and an
equerry, and ladies in waiting. There could even be a changing of the
guard--think of the tourist dollars.

Ben Frankilin must have said something relevant to all of this. Happy 5th!

Thanks Ron, thanks Maria.  Very kind of you.  Very very kind.

Ron, I honestly haven't seen Lester in a long time.  He was traveling and
was lost in luggage for a while.  I occasionally hear from him but he seems
to be laying low.  He's depressed about Bush and doesn't want to come back
to the US.

It's weird to suddenly exist here in my own town, and it is very funny too,
and it is also nice.  Tomorrow AM I do a radio show.  Another article
appeared today (link below) and another will appear in two weeks.  I had fun
writing that fake fake poem (it also can be considered a fake flarf poem, as
I had flarf in mind when writing it), playing with Southern Poet(TM)
clichés, and I laughed and laughed and laughed when I learned that I won.

Then I learned that the joke was on me.  Funny how that works out.  Now I am
honestly embarrassed of the poem even in its correct from for a large number
of reasons though I am repeatedly told not to be.  Be careful who you even
pretend to want to be I think is the lesson....

The poem is here in its "correct" form:
http://www.carrboro.com/poetlaureate2003poem.html

The new article:
http://www.triangle.com/triangle.com/communities/chapelhill/story/2671548p-2
477085c.html
or go to chapelhillnews.com, then under the news section on the right,
select the first story....

(There are numerous inaccuracies in each article...I didn't want to point
them out so I wouldn't be complaining.  The poem in the heraldsun.com
article was mutilated beyond recognition...The Iowa Review Web, not The Iowa
Review, never went to London for a reading but an invite to Nottingham,
etc.)

Kirby!

The Carrboro Poet Laureateship pays $0.00.  Zip.  And you already have to be
a resident; and my rent still costs the same.


Mark!

Our Mayor is out of the closet.  That eliminates the gentleman of the
mayor's closet, since he has no closet & already has a steady beau, and
ladies in waiting wouldn't help much.

Laureates in every town would be madness!  Thinking about it, there are not
many towns like Carrboro where the residents would not collectively freak
out if they heard their elected officials create a Poet Laureate position.
And there aren't many towns or cities where a poet laureate would fit.  I'll
try to name where it might fit: Arcata CA, Iowa City IA, Madison WI, and
maybe Ithaca NY or Providence RI or Gloucester MA or Ann Arbor MI.  Portland
ME?  Berea KY?  Berkeley CA?  Athens OH or Athens GA?  Minneapolis-St.Paul
MN?  Lawrence KS?  Flagstaff AZ (where Pluto was discovered)?  I'm running
out of places quickly.

I have skim knowledge too, but I do know this: when Clark
commanded the NATO troops in Yugoslavia, and Russian
paratroopers took the Kosovo airport to force the West to give
Russia a seat at the table, Clark ordered NATO forces to take it
back.

Luckily for us all, Clark's second in command, a British officer,
countermanded that order, and we did not get a
confrontation/firefight between Russian paras and the 82nd
airborne.

Let's not even suggest anymore that Clark might be a viable
presidential contender, OK?

Finished reading Janet Malcolm's "Gertrude Stein's War" last night. I =
get the New Yorker as a hand-me-down, and am also a slow reader, thus =
the delay. Only slightly remember some of the comments from a few weeks =
ago, and recall them as having a negative brace, while I came away from =
this long engaging piece feeling it a balanced critique. But I would =
like to hear more about this from others.

I don't know the full particulars of Clark in Kosovo - was he following
orders - as required from the Clinton Admininstration? My understanding is
that Clark was dead=set against the invasion of Iraq and continues to be
publicly quite powerfully vocal on the subject.  Whether that makes him a
contender for the Democratic nomination - I would agree - is not any reason
to make him President. I would still like to know more about him. Other than
a continuing major implosion in Iraq - which now seems a possibility - and
the emergence of a public figure in the the Democratic party that can
identify, command and take public leadership out of the deepening quagmire
(as well as the domestic fiscal/economic ones, etc.) - the D Party is the
one that remains in a deeper quagmire. If Dean is the candidate, he is going
to have to perform a major act of public alchemy with the concurrent support
of multiple implosions simultaneously cracking Bush's ostensible public
support.
I know it sounds reactionary to even consider a General. It is, however, my
understanding that the Generals did not support Coup Rummy in the current
venture. Ironically, however, given the way the Bush folks have weaponized
"war" into their self-justifying metaphor, it might take a General to
justify pulling us out of Iraq and bring some common sense to the wars on
terror, etc. Whether a General can also resolve and lead this country
through all the collateral international and domestic damage that has been
done will be a hard crap shoot. (Declare wars on unemployment, poverty,
Corporate oligarchy, international corporate and military triumphalism,
etc,) On all these and other issues Gen Clark's holsters may be totally
upside down. But that's why - not knowing much about him - I asked the
question.

First, years ago I had two oboes, one a Boehm system which I could play,
but far too open a sound. Both were lost in the flood. Now, a couple of
months ago, a friend gave me a rather battered Selmer Paris Oboe - I've
been trying to repair it (it's quite old and had poorly repaired cracks
etc.), and play it - it's quite difficult for me, although the tone - on
occasion when I 'get' it - is wonderful. And I'm fascinated by the
enormous number of keys and levers necessary for trills, especially
compared with the older pre-Triebert oboes, the boxwood-and-ivory ones.

Beyond this, there's a phenomenology of the body involved - body and labor
- just as there is with any mechanical instrument. With the woodwinds,
it's a matter of breathing, which brings the shakuhachi, meditation, etc.
into consideration. And the oboe reed - double reed - is the most similar
to the vocal cords themselves. So there are all sorts of associations -
and then associations with sound and originating sound (such as described
in the Upanishads).

Finally, there's my own frustration with the instrument. Because of its
condition and complexity, I keep adjusting and adjusting, not always
knowing if an error - say jumping an octave - is the result of a really
poor embrochure or leakage, mismatching of levers, keys, pads, etc.
somewhere down the line. So I keep working on it...

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I was wondering if anybody would like to join me in a festival of the ghazal?
It is a format widely used by Islamic and Sufi poets.  By trying our hand at
them and perhaps some people posting some of the better ones from the classical
tradition, it would be a way to find an understanding of some of the high points
of that culture.  I have heard that Rumi, among others, used this form.  I could
pick the winner, or we could just have a free-form everybody wins sort of
festival.  People could even try to write deliberately bad ones, which can be
fun.

The classical ghazal is very complicated, but I propose a simpler format.  You
have to have at least five couplets.  Each couplet has to stand on its own as a
separate poem.  The first two lines have to end with the same word.  Then from
then on, the second line of each of the five to ten couplets has to end on that
word, too.  I cooked up an example recently, and send it in in hopes that my
ghazal will call out to others lying asleep in your preconscious!

Mathematical Beauty

Divide the sun by beauty
And you get mathematical beauty

Add a cup of sherbet to long division
& up jumps mathematical beauty

Give the goose a flair for algebra
A feather in the cap of mathematical beauty!

Tie up traffic with Euclid's geometry
& you'll sniff the bouquet of mathematical beauty

Everywhere you look there's a cube or a square
But it's rare to see mathematical beauty.

Monkey Time
poems by Philip Nikolayev
Winner of the 2001 Verse Prize, selected by Lyn Hejinian
Paperback, 99 pages, $14

Temporarily available for $10 from Verse Press:
http://www.versepress.org/nikolayev.html

"I subvert by suggesting alternative forms," says Nikolayev, and so he
does, brilliantly. Nothing escapes his formal insistence to renew. He
can make (in homage to Malevich) a square made of curves, an alchemy of
sinuous line. His ears are wide open, international, and very good. And
I'm dazzled by his development of the "immured sonnet," a full-fledged
rhyming sonnet embedded in continuous text. A wild, generous book, full
of invention.
        - Robert Kelly

Philip Nikolayev's poetry demonstrates magnificently that register is
where it's at. So much of the considerable energy in this book comes
from the variety of his ways with words. English is constantly being
destabilised by an awareness of other languages, Russian, Hindi, Bangla;
it's constantly under critique from non-native speakers, specialist
jargons, media intrusions. The effect is an enormous liberation of lyric
energy, and a restless experimentation that always feels necessary.
Nikolayev reinhabits ballads, accretes new layers of language around
sonnets, and everywhere enacts those small joyous transitions of sound
that set your intellect ringing. There's a form explored here where the
only metric is that a regular number of words appear in each line: it's
typical of this book in that this kind of tight collage is only
attempted by those really excited by words. The thing about Nikolayev is
he conveys that excitement to you the reader without the clique's
shortcut or the ideologue's shillelagh. Just the facts, ma'am.
        - W. N. Herbert

Philip Nikolayev is a subverter of form and language. He is starkly
innovative, but in an unpredictable and non 'school'-oriented way. His
is a poetics in 'cahoots' with a self-created idiomatic Russian-American
English, that like Nabokov's adds to the possibilities of the word, of
the line, of the overall form of expression in the text. His poems
address both the cross-cultural space of the work's evolution, and the
transitory world of potential readerships. The poems slip in and out of
the familiar, where nothing is as it seems. Visceral and vicarious,
liminal and disturbingly concrete at times, they help us comprehend the
'manifold of the senses.' Richly ironic, sensitive, and variable in
voice, these poems are barbs from a place few of us see, but most of us
would like to visit.
        - John Kinsella

About the Author:
PHILIP NIKOLAYEV was born in Moscow, Russia, in 1966 and grew up fully
bilingual in Russian and English thanks to his father, a linguist. He
started out as a Russian poet, but came to the United States in 1990 to
attend Harvard University, and has since been writing primarily in
English. His poems have appeared in such journals as The Paris Review,
Grand Street, Verse, Stand, Jacket, Salt, overland and many others
across the English-speaking world. Nikolayev lives in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, with his poet wife Katia Kapovich and their four year old
daughter Sophia Margarita. He is the editor and publisher of Fulcrum: an
annual of poetry and aesthetics.

Hi all,

Just discovered Publisher's Weekly's review of my new book of poems, _MS_,
thought it might interest.

-m.

*************

Publisher's Weekly
Following up on last year's Morning Constitutional, Magee forges an
exaggerated, ludic, punning idiom to propel his lines deep into English's
latest incarnations, a sort of "Jive to Juba" scat-talk la Harryette Mullen
with the breathless pace, if not quite the soul, of Frank O'Hara at his peak
typewriter-hysteria period: "The belles of St. Mary knell `The Real Slim
Shady'/ have made up their minds and are keeping their babies/ their CHANNELED
HISTORY Knickerbockers by proxy." Magee's channelings of U.S. history owe as
much to Amiri Baraka and Barrett Watten as they do to Eminem ("what Amadou to
you/ later, cable wires in the white poplar/ a concrete vector"), but not all
of the poems in MS (or, "Manuscript") have such discernible trajectories. Some
magic is lost when the poet seems vainly invested in maintaining the effect of
a mind radiantly overloaded with linguistic possibility, reaching for the first
neat pun ("like mallards, like melba/ toast we are/ dying on the bank/ like a
bank shot") or throwing in 10 bad jokes (yuck-yucking over the word "vagina"
for instance) in lieu of one good one. But the pleasures of this book are many,
capturing the vicissitudes of language, by turns approaching the spareness of
Creeley and the philosophical resonance of Cold of Poetry-era Hejinian. As
Magee moves toward more complex, contradictory poetic personae, he'll have
more than enough chops to negotiate the minefield of American culture and
cultural appropriation. (June) Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.

Military Recruiters Get School Directories
Pentagon says it needs to fill the ranks, but critics
complain about aggressive sales pitches
By Douglas Holt
Chicago Tribune
Saturday 05 July 2003

     When an Air Force recruiter recently strode out of
Evanston Township High School with a student directory, it
marked a major turning point for a school that had long
resisted handing over the highly coveted information to
the military.

     The brief exchange last month came only after loud
protests from some parents who opposed releasing the
directory, a list of roughly 1,000 names, addresses and
telephone numbers of juniors and seniors.

     But under a little-noticed provision tucked into the
No Child Left Behind Act--the sweeping education-reform
law designed to identify and overhaul failing
schools--school administrators had little choice. The law
gives the military unprecedented access to all high school
directories of upperclassmen--a mother lode of information
used for mass-mailing recruiting appeals and telephone
solicitations.

     "You can touch a person that may not have known we
were out there," said Air Force Sgt. Derrick Russ, who
recruits in the Chicago area.

     Before the law took effect last July, 12 percent of
the nation's public high schools--some 2,500, including
Evanston--denied the military access to student databases,
according to the Pentagon. Now, only six high schools are
holding out, said a spokeswoman, who declined to identify
the schools.

     School districts in the Chicago area are dealing with
the law in distinctly different ways--particularly in how
aggressively they have informed parents of its provisions.
Some have done little to tell parents of their legal right
to have their children's names withheld from recruiters.

     No questions asked
     For example, at Naperville District 203, Stevenson
High School in Lincolnshire and Elgin-based Unit School
District 46, officials stressed they have long provided
the lists to the military, no questions asked. Parental
notification often has amounted to a brief mention in
newsletters and a disclosure statement included among
student registration papers.

     It's a different story at Evanston, where high school
officials repeatedly informed parents of their rights.
Responding to complaints, the district even extended the
deadline for parents to have their children's names
removed from the list. Nearly one-third of them, 491, did
so at the school, which has 1,509 juniors and seniors.

     Similarly, parents at Lake Forest and New Trier High
Schools can choose to have the information withheld from
the military, but turned over to colleges and
universities.

     Driving the provision was the concern that federally
funded schools have an obligation to cooperate with the
armed forces and provide students with information on
military careers, said U.S. Rep. David Vitter (R-La.), who
sponsored the recruiting amendment to the No Child Left
Behind Act.

     "I think it's a disservice to the country and the
military to shut down access to qualified young kids who
may be very interested in military service," said Vitter,
who was concerned some high schools had slammed the door
shut on recruiters.

     The law is designed to help the nation maintain an
all-volunteer military force that requires nearly 210,000
young people to enter full-time service annually, with
150,000 more joining the reserves or National Guard.

     Over the last decade, the cost of recruiting nearly
doubled from $6,500 to $11,600 a recruit as an increasing
percentage of high school graduates opted for college and
as unemployment rates were relatively low, defense
officials said.

     The issue of military recruiting has provoked little
discussion at many Chicago-area schools.

     Patriotism cited in Elgin
     Elgin District 46 spokesman Larry Ascough ridiculed
schools that take issue with providing student
directories.

     "I could never imagine this being a controversy
here," he said. "This town, they're very patriotic."

     Stevenson High School put a two-paragraph item in its
"Minuteman" newsletter last January noting the law. "While
this has been an unusual development for some schools, it
is not for Stevenson. The school has willingly provided
names and addresses [but not phone numbers] to the armed
forces for more than two decades," the notice said.

     In the Chicago Public Schools system--home to 99,000
high school students--only 17 parents have opted to have
their children's names removed from recruiting lists, said
spokeswoman Joi Mecks. Parents were notified of the law in
a school newsletter, a memo to parents and on the
district's Web site, she said.

     "They may have received information and didn't pay
attention to it," she said. "Or it may be a non-issue."

     The law also applies to private schools that get
federal funds, such as the prestigious Chicago Latin
School, which received about $40,000 in federal money last
year. But so far, military recruiters have evinced little
interest in the school, officials said.

     "In the last six years, we've never received a
request of information from a military recruiter,"
spokeswoman Evelyne Girardet said. "It's a little
embarrassing."

     Concerned about the law's impact, some educators
complain recruiters oversell the military's benefits,
downplay the risks, use dogged sales tactics and prey on
poor students.

     "I think they glorify the military," said Marilyn
Madden, Evanston Township High School's director of pupil
personnel services, who opposes turning over student
lists. "I don't think it's a good idea. I think it's more
kids of color who feel like this is the only way to go to
college. They may not make it to college if there's going
to be a war."

     Some educators say they've seen too many students
come away feeling misled. Students have been told they
could train as pilots or nuclear engineers, only to learn
after enlisting that they don't qualify, said Michael
Johnson, executive director of the Illinois Association of
School Boards.

     Recruiters also have come under fire for unscrupulous
tactics.

     About 50 recruiters in the Navy's Chicago district
faced disciplinary action in 2001 after an investigation
found they falsified records to qualify recruits who
didn't meet education requirements.

     Completing medical forms
     Two recent recruits interviewed by the Tribune said
they were urged to answer "no" to potentially
disqualifying medical questions when they reported for
military physicals.

     Evanston resident William Hicks, 18, said recruiters
in Virginia, where he lived until this year, gave him a
practice medical questionnaire "so you know what to put on
the paper."

     Waukegan resident Ari Soto, 19, said, "The recruiters
actually told me to say `no' to everything."

     On her military entrance physical, she said she
concealed that she had been hospitalized for a dislocated
knee and had chickenpox twice. She also didn't mention a
slight case of asthma, she said.

     Bill Kelo, spokesman for the Army's Chicago
recruiting effort, declined to comment on Soto's
allegations.

     Soto also learned firsthand another concern voiced by
educators: It's hard to change your mind after an initial
commitment.

     She signed up for the Delayed Entry Program, which
allows recruits as young as 17 to agree to join the
military within one year.

     Soto broke her agreement with the military, which
wasn't legally binding, and had a baby girl in January.
But not before recruiters repeatedly called her,
requesting that she submit to a physical to prove she was
pregnant, she said.

     The experience left her embittered. "I think they
sugarcoated everything and told lies just to get you to
sign up," she said.

     Though declining to speak about any specific recruit,
Kelo stressed that high school students who commit to the
all-volunteer armed forces but change their plans
typically can get out of it. In most cases, all it takes
is a letter, he said.

     "It doesn't serve our purposes to do anything to put
people in the services who don't want to be there," he
said.

     Dickell Fonda, an Evanston Township High School
parent, said a Navy recruiter called on the telephone last
winter and asked to talk to her 17-year-old son.

     Angered by phone call
     "They asked him what he wanted to do after high
school," Fonda said. "He said he was planning on going to
college. The recruiter said very clearly to him, `Now, do
you really think your parents are going to pay for that?'"

     Fonda said the exchange left her so enraged that she
went to a Navy recruiting station and had them delete her
son's name from their computer.

     "We're in a mode of war without end, I'm afraid, so
it's a pertinent issue," she said. "It's a dangerous time
for children to be making these choices."

The words and actions of the Bush administration have so often been labeled=20

At a July 1 White House press briefing, a reporter asked spokesman Ari=20

Fleischer replied: "Well, number one, because the President is following the=

with what's called Article 98 actions that would make certain that American=20

So what do we have here?  The Bush administration drafts a law to serve its=20

e=20
press expresses some skepticism about the law's effect, the same Bush=20

As to the court's sovereignty being in dispute, this is of course entirely=20

     For a dozen years, international groups supporting the Iraqi people=20
campaigned to have the UN (read US) sanctions removed, sanctions which Clint=

National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, called "the most pervasive sanction=
s=20
every imposed on a nation in the history of mankind".  The United States,=20
meanwhile, insisted that the suffering of the population was not due to the=20
sanctions, but was the result of Saddam's lavish lifestyle.  ("People of Ira=
q ... the=20
amount of money Saddam spends on himself in one day would be more than enoug=
h=20
to feed a family for a year," said a Pentagon radio program broadcast into=20
Iraq).  So then Saddam and his regime were overthrown.  But the suffering=20
continued anyhow in much the same ways.  And then, with their usual lack of=20
embarrassment, Washington officials declared that the sanctions are actually=
 harmful=20
and that they would have be removed in order to provide humanitarian aid and=
=20
rebuild the country.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Reading about a horribly bloody suicide attack upon a Shiite Muslim mosque i=
n=20
Pakistan on July 4 that killed dozens, and which is blamed on members of the=

Sunni Muslims, I imagined what many Americans would think about this: "That'=
s=20
good, they should all just kill each other with their uncivilized tribal=20
violence if they can't learn how to get along any better than that."
Then I thought about the American tribe which recently killed thousands of=20

US military commanders in Iraq have branded the guerillas as "subversives"=20
and "terrorists".
Donald Rumsfeld said there are five groups opposing US forces -- looters,=20
criminals, remnants of Saddam Hussein's government, foreign terrorists and=20

An American official there maintains that many of the people shooting at US=20

said. "They're people who wanted to take a few potshots."
    Other members of the Bush administration use terms like "well-trained=20
militants" and "professional operations".
What no American official dares to have cross his lips is the idea that any=20
part of the resistance is composed of Iraqi citizens who do not like being=20
bombed, invaded and occupied and are demonstrating their resentment.  Does t=

A few things- the fix. Didn't you blame Nader a few posts ago? Was Nader in on
the fix? Maybe your point is that Nader made it close. My point is that it
should have never been close. But okay.

"Corporations are taking over the reins of government." The reason Nader got
any votes at all was because corporations HAVE TAKEN government. Al Gore is a
great example, in fact.

The cartoon history of the right wing does no one justice. Is the right really
simple? Saying they "always have their shit together" is another way of making
an excuse why the left doesn't.

The left is no more complicated. It shouldn't be, unless we want to come off as
the oh so complex & enlightened good guys that know what's best for everyone
whether they like it or not.

"Hitler was a straight-ahead kind of guy." Come on. Do you really believe he
was any less complicated than say, Bill Clinton?

Dismissal of the right squanders the opportunity to know it, dissect it & learn
from it.

The "literate equals progressive" argument is elitist, but also untrue. Brazil
elected Lula- maybe the most progressive leader in the world, while France
recently had a runoff election w/ a neo-nazi.

I'd just like to say- hold on, Joel. Don't give up so early in the game. You
seem like a good guy, & I just can't believe that Joe Leiberman is the man for
you.>

Does Gloucester have a poet

Vincent Ferrini is the poet laureate of Gloucester.

A local bookstore (The Bookstore) campaigned the city council and the mayor
to create the position and install Vincent. However, friends have thought we
should walk in the July 3 Horribles Parade, passing out the candidates'
poems and ballots w/ their names. (In the Horribles Parade, people dress up
in costumes, etc. though now many of the floats are sponsored by businesses
and religious groups.) A second group of walkers could collect the ballots.
An interesting experiment, no?

Perhaps even better would be for the laureate candidates to read their poems
on the back of a flatbed truck. A good spot for the poets' float would be
right behind the fundamentalist Christian float & its cloying,
kid-friendly(?) music.

But I also like the idea of using the _Gloucester Daily Times_, the local
paper in which Charles O. himself was published, as a means of determining
the poet of the polis. (See: _Maximus to Gloucester; The Letter and Poems of
Charles Olson to the Gloucester Times, 1962 - 1969_, edited by Peter
Anastas, foreword by Gerrit Lansing, 1992.)

As for Vincent, his letters and poems frequently appear on the GDT's Op-Ed
page.

Stinging these chemicals from my eyes
with such soft hopes as wasps leave
in pumice and syrup trails, grinding light
until I can see clear through noon. Oh,

I do love you, packed in your new needed
shell, but I'm lonely for you, stitching
your words which you believe with
assumed large hands, jewel-eyed

clear through me to rotting cave. I struggle

two of them trapped between the screen and

Patrick,

I was offline most of last week.  Congratulations!   I think the poem
shows great knowledge of horticulture and geography.  Next time you have
to include what Louis Rubin once said must be present in all Southern
poetry, namely a dead mule.  (Best thing he ever said).

The Herald-Sun piece reminded me of the distinction Ron S. makes
somewhere between "scene" and "network" in poetry (Ron, where is that
anyway?).  As we both know, Patrick, there is not really a scene here as
such, just some isolated individuals (you and me and . . . let's see . .
. Joe Donahue, Chris Vitiello if he's still around, others) doing their
work in some proximity to a medium-sized poetic circle jerk of Southern
establishment poets. Nor is there really a network.  What is _named_
here as a network (the North Carolina Writers Network) is actually made
up largely of (often blue-haired) writers who want to get invited to the
aforementioned circle jerk.  The Herald-Sun article implicitly
recognizes the authority of the real "network" (in this case, an
electronic one) though their elision of "web" from "Iowa Review Web"
suggests that they're not fully at ease with the idea.  In fact, though
I really like the poem you submitted, I think the real poem is your
application, exhibitiing what Al Franken calls "kidding on the square"
(http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/03/06/12_franken.html).

Best,
David

>>Does Ferrini get any money?

I don't believe so but I'll ask.

>>How long does his position last?

In Gloucester it's a lifetime appointment as far as I can tell, though in
Rockport (the farthest reaches of Cape Ann mentioned pejoratively in a post
by Ron Silliman in this thread) the position is an annual one.

In Gloucester the position was invented for Ferrini so it will be
interesting to see what happens to it in the future.

>>He must be getting up there since Olson was writing to him in the early
>>fifties.  Did he take to heart any of Olson's admonitions concerning his
>>writing?

Here's a link to an article about Vincent turning 90 that appeared recently
in the Gloucester Daily Times. (I am not related to the article's author
{Greg Cook} though we are good friends. He's a terrific cartoonist too. See
highwaterbooks.com.)

http://info.chymes.org/notes/ferrini_glou_times.html

In the article Greg comments a bit on Vincent's writing.
For my part I will say this...
I enjoy his letters to the editor though I often find them obscure.
I also enjoyed _No Smoke_ which first appeared 1941 & was recently
republished. The poems are about the working class in his hometown, Lynn,
Massachusetts).
I agree w/ Greg's comments about Vincent's attempt to render a
Sicilian-Gloucester accent in _No Fish_. {Full disclosure: Greg once gave me
a copy of _No Fish_ as a gift.}

>>Also, what letters does he write to the paper?  Does he structure them as
>>poems?

The article, if memory serves, deals w/ this a bit too.
Off the top of my head, I recall letters about mayors, local painters, the
march to war, local authors, etc. Many of them show enthusiasm for an
artist's/writer's work. (After reading Demon of the Waters_ (about the Globe
Mutiny, pub. Little, Brown, & Co.) he compared the book's author Gregor
Gibson--a local {&, in the name of further full disclosure, my wife's
boss--to Melville.) The political poems/letters--some of them are in lines,
others are written as prose--tend to be more obscure, usually referring to
something like the failure of x politician/gov't body to affirm life/energy
or to act w/ wisdom. Abstractions are coupled w/ action verbs. I've clipped
some of them but can't put my hands on any just now. Anyone out there who
has read some of Vincent's letters & disagrees w/ my assessment please
write(!)
I have many fond memories of Vincent: yelling down Main Street to tell me
about a new translation of the Iliad he had just finished; or rising from
his seat to take his turn at the podium during a reading at The Bookstore
(he followed Gerrit Lansing who was spellbinding), swaggering as he
approached the mic, holding no poems, and then intoning, "Politics/is the
manure/of the Pegasus"--as if no other words were needed-- before sitting
down. That was it. That was his reading.)
In Gloucester, Vincent has been an exemplar of perserverance & energy. His
presence & advice have been important to many. (Ask Joe Torra--_My Ground_
trilogy, _Keep Watching the Sky_,

As a society we've been speeding away from democracy as fast as the powers
that be and the bulk of the electorate can manage. In that light, it's
worth asking why we did without laureates for two centuries and suddenly
they sprout like weeds.

I realize the issue is purely symbolic, but we're poets, and we're supposed
to know that symbols matter.

About form, ghazal, following the rules, judges, and
stuff:



Some of the best--in all senses: passionate,
overwrought, dramatic, melodramatic, technically
perfect, technically rule-breaking, etc.--ghazals in
English are found in Agha Shahid Ali's books
"Ravishing DisUnities" and "Call Me Ishmael Tonight"
though he's of course by no means the only writer
doing ghazals in English.

He is though probably the main practitioner of the
form in English who hails from the Urdu speaking
world.

But Ali's attention to the form (he would scold you
Kirby for suggested we don't have to follow *all* the
classical rules of ghazal) had more to do with his
understanding of that form's inherent relationship
(think Creeley) to the ghazal's peculiar brand of
"meaning-making" -- i.e. the "thought" is created by
the very gymnastic constraint of the rules than any
belief Ali had in so-called "purity" of "form," or
rule-following for mere sake of fulfilling a
particular formal requirement.

What's interesting is that when Ali translated Faiz
Ahmed Faiz's ghazals into English he did *not* try to
replicate the "form" of the ghazal in English as he
later espoused it, but rather tried to appromiximate
the intent of the poetry. I think later he may have
come to believe that the intent was *inseparable* from
the form.

So I think if you are going to try to write "ghazal"
you should give yourself over to the form as it has
developed over centuries and not try to work inside
it. The whole ridiculous point of "form" is to be
constrained by.

(Tho' Buddha teaches "form is no other than
emptiness...emptiness no other than form..."

Ali's essay of the "rules" of the ghazal in English is
in Annie Finch's book "After New Formalism".



I think no need to have a "practicing" Muslim judge.
The "ghazal" has drunkenness, heresy, and apostasy at
the very heart of it.

And also not. Also pure devotion, absolute faith,
dynamic rapture in the belief of unity of all things.

Find some sadhu or kabbalist or mystic or lunatic or
drunk. Have that person judge. Or have that person
not-judge.

Listmembers interested in this discussion should know about the review of
Vincent Ferrini's *The Mysterium of Matter* by Ken Warren in the latest
issue of his excellent *House Organ* magazine.

(I'd say more about the review but I'm still trying to figure it out.)

Hard to know what a poet laureate might do or not do. I thought Robert Haas
was more effective in the role than the media-friendly Pinsky, but for the
life of me, I can't remember why.

On another note, it's very good news to hear about cris cheek's
collaboration, which I've immediately ordered via paypal. Several months ago
cris responded to one of my long rants about the paucity of political work
with a query for members to post some; few, if any, took up the challenge.
The market for medieval ghazals seems more vital.

Of course the relation between politics and poetry isn't a simple one. I
hope to have finished an essay soon about the related practice of Ed Dorn
and Walter Benjamin that will problematize the issue even more. In the
meantime, check out www.centomag.org -- its editors have put together a
handsome collection of reminiscences and comment about Dorn that's worth
your time.

Finally, finally . . . what about a thread on places to *visit*?

For example, I'm trying to decide whether to use some frequent flyer miles
to visit Europe this summer, from mid-August to mid-September. But if I do,
I'd go to Paris and southern Italy and the Czech Republic and the Greek
island of Sifnos . . . all places I know, partly to visit friends. If I had
four or five additional days on the continent . . . where should I spend
them?

(Of course, visiting Europe has a built-in problem: one would have to come
back).

Thanks Kazim for putting all this together. Very clear and helpful.
Interesting how 'mericans love to mis-wrought the well wrought, formal or
otherwise. A cultural habit of being out on the range without a set of
tools(?): ignore the trail and improv the way over the mountain. Or the
anxiety many of us have around Yvor Winters & Co.

Thanks again,
Stephen Vincent

Dear David,

Feb. 5 is looking very solid for Chax. I do wonder, though, if it might be
possible to include as many as possible of the poets Chax has published who
live within proximity and are willing to come. Chax Press may not do
another event in New York for years, and we've not done one yet (except for
just a reading by me, and one talk about books years ago at Granary). That
would mean, possibly -- Charles Bernstein, Hank Lazer, Jackson Mac Low,
Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Ron Silliman, Allison Cobb, Gil Ott (if he is well
enough to make it), Eli Goldblatt, Karen Mac Cormack, Steve McCaffery (I
already have a nod from them that they'd like to come and participate), and
me. There may even be one or two more. So I'm a bit concerned about the
format, of two twenty-minute segments). So, if Chax had ten or twelve poets
there, would it be possible to get enough time to offer everyone ten minutes?

Thanks,

Charles

Dear Kirby Olson

Do you know the paperback edited by Agha Shahid Ali called RAVISHING
DISUNITIES: REal Ghazals in English (Wesleyan IUniversity Press, 2000).  I am sure the
book will please you.  And may I be immodest and say the following ghazal of
mine is included in the book. Here it is.

                              How Many Bouquets

The lover holds the letter in the palm of his hand.
Unread it flutters as it wilts in his hand.

There are oceans to cross but the harbor is sealed.
Why not, she said, pick up shells from my hand?

Bejeweled the queen makes a tragic false start.
Her consort, resigned, plays the card in his hand.

It is bewitched, the child cries out to her nanny,
Who laughs as the parrot eats from her hand.

There are eels, a dead whale, a voice in the sand.
Will Poe kiss the unringed, quivering, ghostlike hand?

She is cold in her bed and the butler with tea
Wavers once, wavers twice, spills the tea on her hand.

It is the story of the rose.  How many bouquets?
The tide slaps the oozing sand.  Unmanned, he slaps her hand.

Harriet Zinnes

My hope is to gather more thoughts on this "School of Quietude" issue while
I may, running up against this logic of the blog, which is to permit spokes
of divergent meaning that could distract from a potentially absent core (I
like the centripetal / centrifugal dialectic but it has its dangers).
However, Ron Silliman asks, on his blog, whether a certain statement of his
on "vispo" -- visual poetry, a sort of grab bag descendent of Concrete
poetry and, I guess, visual digital stuff -- is what I, in my statement on
Lowell, characterized as RS's "famously knee-jerk, even reactionary,
positions."

I'm not going to claim that what I wrote was very nice -- it wasn't, of
course, and I suppose I could become infamous for being knee-jerk as well --
so I apologize. But one might almost believe that Silliman is the most read
critic in our decidedly uncritical America right now (certainly his
advertisements of his hit count, a weird tick that other bloggers have
picked up, seem to suggest it) along with the most trusted (I don't ever
actually read much in terms of criticism of his very content, and he's
certainly very selective of what he links to). Anyway, so I poked the
growing behemoth, if only to give a little flavor to what I wrote and, more
importantly, to keep it honest. Going out on a limb with something a little
off-color like that while trying to make a point leaves one vulnerable to
being dismissed outright.

Most recently, Ron writes:

"One thing that all the works I looked at here have in common is that they’
re static – straight JPEG files, no Flash, not even an animated GIF. This I
found very liberating. It puts all of the demands of the work right back
onto the image itself, rather than trying to distract us with bells &
whistles. It also suggests work that, over time, will be able to survive
beyond current computing platforms. Anyone who is old enough to have seen
“animated” poems written in Harvard Graphics or Ventura Publisher when they
were the presentation software programs of the day will recognize the
advantage of that. At the very worst, these works can just be scanned into
whatever new platform exists ten, fifty or 150 years from now & be good to
go, something you can be certain won’t happen with the present generation of
animated, sound-augmented writing."

There are several obvious flaws to this statement.

For starters, this assumption that .jpegs and .gifs will be what creators of
new computer platforms will want to preserve from old ones, and not Flash
and sound files. Why is this? Both formats are simply rows of digits that
are then interpreted into something -- an image, a sound, a bit of
interactive software -- that is translated by a machine into something more
or less comprehensible by the senses and intellect. That one is for a
"two-dimensional" image file and the other a "three-dimensional" or
time-based digital object should not distract one from the like basis of
each.

The second is a sort of purism about the "image itself" apart from the
"bells and whistles." Did one ever write, after the first decades of film,
that "I like this photograph because, unlike a movie, we are not distracted
by the motion of the objects -- they just sit there to be looked at"? Or
after listening to a quartet of Beethoven's: "I would have much preferred
one stringed instrument as the other three were distracting." Certainly, any
Flash artist would want to create works that integrate the separate elements
into a whole -- if it fails, that's one thing, but the tool or the
motivation itself cannot be blamed. (I've never used sound in my Flash works
because I suck at it.)

The third is to compare the trivial experiments in the very nascent stages
of a technology -- the animated poems of Harvard Graphics or Ventura
Publisher (I haven't seen them, but no doubt these are silent and without
interactivity) with poems in Flash. This would be comparable to criticizing
cinema based on the films of Muybridge and Edison, or criticizing live
motion digital graphics -- the stuff that brings you Titanic and Matrix
Reloaded -- based on an anecdote about Max Headroom and early episodes of
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Ironically, people love to look at these
early incarnations of art in new media -- the retrospective of video work
from the 70s that was up at the Whitney two years ago was fantastic, and
emulators of early computer platforms are rampant on the internet -- there's
even one for the ZX81 (search my blog to find it).

Lastly, it's quite obvious that Flash cannot be "scanned into a new medium"
but neither can film -- can you imagine people walking around holding
flip-books of Abel Gance's three-screen, 6-hour or so long Napoleon in front
of gas lamps? And can visual poetry be "scanned and good to go"? I suppose
the assumption is that one prints out a .jpeg, that the paper on which it's
printed will last 150 years, and then it can be scanned to reproduce what
the original .jpeg looked like. But inkjet inks don't last that long, and
cultural memory is even shorter -- who will be around to say you got it
right, and who is creating verbal descriptions for this work now? (Needless
to say, one can't scan in ballet.)

One thing I always ask, though, when I see "vispo" is not "is it poetry"
but, in the most basic sense, "what is it about"? I rarely see discussions
of content, of social relevance, of ethics, or even of art history -- as in
the use of appropriation to give a discursive element to what might
otherwise be a completely non-linguistic creation -- in relation to "vispo."
Is it all just tweaking the sign / image divide? Is it's only purpose to
make us ask questions of genre? Why have no visual poets tried to occupy the
same space in American culture that, say, Andy Warhol did, or try to be as
politically relevant and upsetting as the Situationists (or the clowns who
made that "Empire Strikes Back" poster with Rumsfeld cast as Darth Vader)?

I think there is content to Miekel And's work, for example, it seems to have
some spiritual / ecological dimension -- some relation of the organic
component of graphemes that suggests an interest in biodiversity -- and
Basinski often incorporates aspects of Greek mythology in his work that seem
to suggest a relationship to the paintings of Cy Twombly when drops in tags
about the sacking of Troy, etc. There's probably writing on them somewhere
but I've not investigated it.

The list of great predecessors -- Finlay, de Campos -- are rich in social
and aesthetic dimensions that I've written about elsewhere (my article in
Jacket appears here:
http://www.jacketmagazine.com/15/finlay-by-stefans.html; a better one by
Drew Milne appears here:
http://www.jacketmagazine.com/15/finlay-milne.html). Certainly, the TRG --
Steve McCaffery and bpNichol -- have created a rich discourse around their
work that investigates some of the classic concepts familiar from Language
poetry and deconstructionism, but with a "pataphysical dimension and modal
variety that make reading this work fulfilling in its own right, beyond its
use as "theory."

"Content" might be a clumsy word to use when discussing the thematics of
what Finlay is doing -- I often use the term "thematics" instead, since, at
best, the disparate universe of his works points to some pre-Socratic
philosophical landscape (located "here and now" in Scotland, of course) that
simply cannot be revealed in material world. His content is the lava of
history that flows under our fragile creations -- the Roman coliseum, the
Macintosh computer -- and which only reveals itself in moments of terrible
conflagration, social "eruptions" in a sense. It's all very scary. But
certainly, one might look at his use of charged political symbols, such as
the guillotine and the swastika, as some attempt to insure his work is never
discussed in purely formal terms -- is it "poetry" or not? -- but rather to
throw the focus on these subterranean aspects of his themes. If only for
this reason, I've often focused on Finlay's place in the "vispo" universe --
he doesn't let you relax into your prejudices.

Ironically, Ron has chosen a purely aesthetic -- dare I say "quietist" --
stance, and one based on fairly conservative aesthetic positions (the "pure"
image released from any sort of social or historical considerations) to
discuss, and subtly shout down, the innovations that are being made in
poetry using Flash and other new media technologies. His statement are even
angled such as to preclude the possibility of such innovations, without a
single piece of historical data to justify this preclusion.

I'll be the first to say that there is a lot of pretty clunky stuff being
done in Flash, but my sense is that no "tradition" (or shall we say
"lineage") in the arts is never as clean as one would like (but who wants it
clean?). One needn't throw away the technology after discovering that the
technology itself does not provide enough material for the theme of the
work -- quite the contrary, this void or emptiness can be a beginning (not
to sound too much like Yoda). I'll be happy when Flash works are not "about
Flash" or "about interactivity," not to mention when poetry is not "about
language" or "about lineage." I hope this doesn't sound prescriptive -- all
options seem, to me, open (except, of course, that of being "quiet").

Actually, this is not precisely on topic with Brian's post.  What, though,
would a poetics of "Knee-jerk" "look like?"  I.e., a poetics of overcoming
"the Knee-jerk," deconstructing it, getting beyond it, etc., I guess...

Is even that, the notion it would have to be "overcome," deconstructed,
transcended, or otherwise
"garbaged" a knee-jerk notion in itself?  Maybe...

Watched Molly Ivins, O'Reilly (knee-jerk decision to omit for him a first
name, smile?), and Al Franken (Victor Frankle, smile?) on C-span 1 or 2 a
few evenings ago.  Pretty delicious, incidentally.  Franken/Frankle was in
top form and pulled no punches.  (Or was he "in top form?"  Wasn't it more a
"material" than formal thing (Michael Palmer distinction between formal and
material poetries), straight up and forward with "content" and "directly"
and INTIMATELY challenging O'Reilly to take reponsibility for "lying," to
which the latter responded "in form," with exceptionally angry "Shut up" act
(and exhibits archetypal difference between Left Sophisticated and Right
Superior, too, i.e., Frankle actualizes vulnerability, whereas O'Reilly will
not admit being imperfect or wrong, will predictably only lash back with
anger when delivered criticism -- which is also vulnerability, tho, too, as
it takes great courage to get angry ('cept not all the time?)).  Anyway,
using these three or imaginative caricatures of them, say, what would a
poetry making transparent, and examining and resisting, "their" knee-jerk
languages be like?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------

Another topic: Am sure this has been discussed in more elegant and efficient
terms, but if one divides "writing" into "truth" and "beauty" (and I'm not
saying anything about "poetry," necessarily, as "it" is the bogeyman here,
to some degree), how can a great deal of attention during a time like this
be spent concerning oneself with "beauty" when it is "truth" that is most
threatened?  I know that this is a terribly simplistic and unspecific
dichotomy, but does anyone else feel torn between creating a writing that
pursues "truth" and creating a writing that seeks to be framed as "poetry"
and/or appeal to "poets?"  Am struggling with this a lot lately, myself
(perhaps always have), and with a piece (poem?) called, for now, "You will
be told that," which as anyone can imagine can go anywhere from propaganda
to deconstruction of the second person pronoun.

More to the point, though, Damn I can feel "the knee-jerk" habit of turning
the first draft (not yet typed) into more consciously manipulated line
breaks and increasing the irony and becoming increasingly more aware of how
"poet readers in my mind's eye/ear/wit" would read it and how before that,
in the first draft (handwritten) it had what at least felt like a more
powerful potential to communicate directly to a very wide range of readers
and perhaps not be in the forms of "lines/linebreaks" at all.  Or I can feel
where suddenly I have to make a choice between adding the "self-reflexive"
and wit or keeping things on the same nonplayful and same dimensional track.
Then things get frustrating, for I don't know how to bridge the two
impulses, and it feels like a sham to "reduce" the writing to "poetry."
(Not saying it's good writing either way, or will be, but just describing my
bind/conflict -- and sometime antipathy for "clamor for poetry.")


Really, Steve Tills

P.S.
(Have been following Brian's and Ron's blog a little, two that I most
frequently choose to lurk on, as they're always excellent.  Have even pulled
my old copy of *Life Studies*  (purchased for a class in 1977 and not much
read since) out from the cobwebs and started a re-read of some of the poems
and especially "Words for Hart Crane").

Allot of people on the site are writing about why the right has its shit
together and the left does not. I am prob the only person on this site who
went to GOP Campaign school and worked when I was in college for Reagan and
I have to tell you that the reason that the right wins is because they
learned from great leftists of the past to be ruthless. The GOP and the
Conservative movement was build upon resentment and giving voice to people
who the left chose to ignore, white ethnics, white southerners, lower middle
class workers and suburbanites a voice.  This is a message drilled into
everyone on the right just look at who are Fox's key personalities, Bill
O'Reilly a self described Irish Catholic from Long Island, Sean Hannity,
look at Rush Limbaugh, he is an evangelical from Missouri, Anne Coulter is a
a German American Catholic School product, and the list goes on.

The model for much of what the right does is not Fascism it is the old left
of Richard Daley and FDR and old labor. If you look at the rise of the Right
in the USA what did they do to build themselves up? 1) They allied
themselves with easy issues that were easy to convey and they did it in a
non elitist way.. 2) The left on the other hand was spending its time
drumming the Richard Daley's,Jimmy Hoffa's and John Connally's out of its
ranks this created resentment among these core groups the result was that
they left and today congressmen like William Lipinski in Chicago or Zell
Miller in Georgia are rarities in the Democratic party. 3) The fact is that
the key swing groups in this country, many that have leftist economic views
but conservative morals, are white ethnics in the north and white
southerners this group is over 40% of the US population and the
Conservatives focused on this group and while many of them, especially the
Catholics and Southern/Northern Labor Union members were genetically
democrats and liberal on allot of issues for example 60% of all Catholics
oppose the death penalty,  they left and voted for the GOP because no one
spoke to them in the Democratic party except Bill Clinton, since 1964 Bill
Clinton was the only Democrat to do well with these voters. 4) FDR and LBJ
understood that the key to winning elections was to build a coalition of
people who have some things in common, not all things in common, and they
won, and the right was all but wiped away from 1933-1964 but Conservatives
learned well from FDR and built their own coalition. 5) But the left still
has the neo-Marxist notion that you must be on board on all issues to be
part of a movement as FDR said someone who is with me 80% of the time is not
my 20% enemy he is my 80% friend.  This is something that most on the left
do not understand.

The fact is that while the left has preached ideological purity and elitism
the right has gathered together a coalition and this coalition is growing in
the South West they are spending millions on Hispanics and in New York they
are spending millions on the Jewish vote. They are smarter because they
realize that winning leads to governing and building a coalition is key to
this. Democrats cannot win with Gays, Feminists, Blacks some Hispanics and
what is Left of the Union vote you need more votes and they are to be found
in white working and lower middle and the middle class.

The left has not given the members of the Right's coalition a reason to look
to them, when industrial jobs were being destroyed in this country
environmentalists looked upon this as a way to clean up the environment.
Today industrial jobs are a memory in the nation and it is hard to have a
labor movement without these jobs and Labor's strength is the reason that
Europe has a humane system and we do not.

While affirmative action is essential and needed for African Americans the
left has not come up with anything to help those people who do not fall into
a protected group for education and opportunity. If you are a working class
white male from Appalachia or Queens or Berwyn, IL there is no one offering
you a hand  you are considered 'white'just like some  society WASP from
Connecticut and you wonder why these people vote Republican? They do not
feel that anyone on the left is listening as their opportunities are taken
away; go to neighborhoods like Hegwisch here in Chicago and see the three
generation Union families that are on welfare now because the factories
moved to China,  there are millions of Americans in this position and no one
on the left cares. Franco once said that the reason the left lost in Spain
is because they thought they knew what the 'people'wanted but they did not
know any 'people'.
I think that the left needs to spend more time with regular working people
and less time in university towns and elite neighborhoods if the left did
this and really listened there is no way that the right could win another
election and Fox would not matter

Steve T, "What, though, would a poetics of "Knee-jerk" "look like?"  I.e., a
poetics of overcoming "the Knee-jerk," deconstructing it, getting beyond it,
etc., I guess..."

In that sense of a poetics, as you raise it, Lucy Lippard actually called it
"retrochic" in late 70s during punk heyday, and there's numerous moments of
or allusions to it today and yesterday in poetry and beyond, which I
consider in a post (on allusion and Bruce Andrews) to Silliman's blog due, I
believe, tomorrow (and coming out there because he inspired les pensees).

All of this is very nice, except for the parts that are simply stupid
(environmentalists didn't force manufacturing jobs overseas, lower wages
did. As I write, US manufacturers are beginning to abandon their factories
in Tijuana, where environmental regulations aren't enforced, because 55
cents an hour is simply too much to pay a worker when you can get the same
job done for 12 cents in China), but it doesn't change the fact that the
Republican senate majority represents 42 % of the population and the
Democratic minority represents 58%, because of the unequal distribution of
population, which means that democrats have to work a lot harder than
Republicans to do as well, and they have to do it, let's remember, on a lot
less money. It also overlooks that even tho he ran an incredibly inept
campaign on a lot less money Gore won the popular vote and very nearly the
electoral college and that he would have won easily without Nader splitting
the vote.

The shift in the relative power of the parties happened when northern
Democrats decided that segregation had to go. You could say that they
became purists and lost touch with the south. What would you have
preferred? More lynchings? Unending tolerance for bigotry?

This is a little disorienting in our times with waves of emigres coming from
all over.  Are these Russian avant garde poets or Russian avant-garde poets
of the emigre generation of 1917 or 1960 or 1980 and are the emigre poets of
Russia or Ukrainia?  I'm not saying this in a dismissive way at all and
await my copy but I think the question might be of interest to the list as
we start to see waves of emigre avant garde artists and \poets from other
lands.   Somebody needs to come up with a better way of classifying these
things.

I did not say that environmentalists caused industrial jobs to leave what I
said is that many were happy when they did go and no one on the left not
Jesse Jackson or anyone else challenged this in Europe for example nations
like Germany and Italy have spent billions retooling industries and
retraining workers what have we done? Let our industrial cities rot.

The issue is not how the Senate or the House is distributed or the fact that
Rural areas are over represented the issue is that except for Bill Clinton
no Democrat since LBJ has set forth a vision that the key swing voters
wanted. Hell Al Gore lost
his own home state and region if he had won one southern state he would be
president today. I think that you make a mistake when you equate White
Southern and Northern White Ethnic concerns with bigotry most are not bigots
they work hard and play by the rules and have been victimized by changes
that have benefited the elites in our society.

by Ernie Bloch
Transworld News
Calgary, Alberta
July 7, 2003
http://alberta.indymedia.org/news/2003/07/7422.php

Alberta Premier Ralph Klein was pied in the face during
his annual Calgary Stampede pancake breakfast on Monday.

The incident occurred at approximately 8:30am as the
Premier was just beginning a speech to the assembled
crowd.

It has been reported that three people have been arrested
in connection with the incident.

It was not immediately known if any of the three arrested
was Louis Cabri.

The breakfast event was held at the provincial Macdougall
Centre building in downtown Calgary.

Hi, Kirby:

Not exactly sufi stuff, but historically hysterical:

GHAZAL





Soldiers have always sought loot 'n booty

or loot enough at least to purchase booty



Odysseus, chronically indifferent to swag,

at length grew tired, too, of booty



Alexander, philanderer, minted coin

& left his troops to divvy up the booty



King Charles's minions: left holding the bag

despite all that puritanical booty



Napoleon, rolling in simoleons,

considered only Josephine his booty



Warriors all, eyeing a beauty,

contemplate the joys of booty

Haas,
Brilliantly said!  Perhaps the message will not go unheeded!  And better =
yet, the message in the "work" element of the message is =
devastating...the right does not sit outside the meetings of the left =
dressed in turtle suits spouting aphorisms.  The "right" are diligent =
workers for their cause in ways that collect votes; the "left," on the =
other hand, mull about musty corridors in library rooms and agree to =
assemble and demonstrate...mostly they demonstrate to themselves. =20

I'm super impressed with how a group I count as both an ideological and =
a numerical minority has orchestrated the political takeover of the =
country...I'm distressed at the fact that I have to live under the rules =
of the right, but I'm impressed at the manner in which the mission was =
accomplished. =20

  Subject: The Reason that the Left does not Succeed in the USA in my =
Humble opinion


  Allot of people on the site are writing about why the right has its =
shit
  together and the left does not. I am prob the only person on this site =
who
  went to GOP Campaign school and worked when I was in college for =
Reagan and
  I have to tell you that the reason that the right wins is because they
  learned from great leftists of the past to be ruthless. The GOP and =
the
  Conservative movement was build upon resentment and giving voice to =
people
  who the left chose to ignore, white ethnics, white southerners, lower =
middle
  class workers and suburbanites a voice.  This is a message drilled =
into
  everyone on the right just look at who are Fox's key personalities, =
Bill
  O'Reilly a self described Irish Catholic from Long Island, Sean =
Hannity,
  look at Rush Limbaugh, he is an evangelical from Missouri, Anne =
Coulter is a
  a German American Catholic School product, and the list goes on.

  The model for much of what the right does is not Fascism it is the old =
left
  of Richard Daley and FDR and old labor. If you look at the rise of the =
Right
  in the USA what did they do to build themselves up? 1) They allied
  themselves with easy issues that were easy to convey and they did it =
in a
  non elitist way.. 2) The left on the other hand was spending its time
  drumming the Richard Daley's,Jimmy Hoffa's and John Connally's out of =
its
  ranks this created resentment among these core groups the result was =
that
  they left and today congressmen like William Lipinski in Chicago or =
Zell
  Miller in Georgia are rarities in the Democratic party. 3) The fact is =
that
  the key swing groups in this country, many that have leftist economic =
views
  but conservative morals, are white ethnics in the north and white
  southerners this group is over 40% of the US population and the
  Conservatives focused on this group and while many of them, especially =
the
  Catholics and Southern/Northern Labor Union members were genetically
  democrats and liberal on allot of issues for example 60% of all =
Catholics
  oppose the death penalty,  they left and voted for the GOP because no =
one
  spoke to them in the Democratic party except Bill Clinton, since 1964 =
Bill
  Clinton was the only Democrat to do well with these voters. 4) FDR and =
LBJ
  understood that the key to winning elections was to build a coalition =
of
  people who have some things in common, not all things in common, and =
they
  won, and the right was all but wiped away from 1933-1964 but =
Conservatives
  learned well from FDR and built their own coalition. 5) But the left =
still
  has the neo-Marxist notion that you must be on board on all issues to =
be
  part of a movement as FDR said someone who is with me 80% of the time =
is not
  my 20% enemy he is my 80% friend.  This is something that most on the =
left
  do not understand.

  The fact is that while the left has preached ideological purity and =
elitism
  the right has gathered together a coalition and this coalition is =
growing in
  the South West they are spending millions on Hispanics and in New York =
they
  are spending millions on the Jewish vote. They are smarter because =
they
  realize that winning leads to governing and building a coalition is =
key to
  this. Democrats cannot win with Gays, Feminists, Blacks some Hispanics =
and
  what is Left of the Union vote you need more votes and they are to be =
found
  in white working and lower middle and the middle class.

  The left has not given the members of the Right's coalition a reason =
to look
  to them, when industrial jobs were being destroyed in this country
  environmentalists looked upon this as a way to clean up the =
environment.
  Today industrial jobs are a memory in the nation and it is hard to =
have a
  labor movement without these jobs and Labor's strength is the reason =
that
  Europe has a humane system and we do not.

  While affirmative action is essential and needed for African Americans =
the
  left has not come up with anything to help those people who do not =
fall into
  a protected group for education and opportunity. If you are a working =
class
  white male from Appalachia or Queens or Berwyn, IL there is no one =
offering
  you a hand  you are considered 'white'just like some  society WASP =
from
  Connecticut and you wonder why these people vote Republican? They do =
not
  feel that anyone on the left is listening as their opportunities are =
taken
  away; go to neighborhoods like Hegwisch here in Chicago and see the =
three
  generation Union families that are on welfare now because the =
factories
  moved to China,  there are millions of Americans in this position and =
no one
  on the left cares. Franco once said that the reason the left lost in =
Spain
  is because they thought they knew what the 'people'wanted but they did =
not
  know any 'people'.
  I think that the left needs to spend more time with regular working =
people
  and less time in university towns and elite neighborhoods if the left =
did
  this and really listened there is no way that the right could win =
another
  election and Fox would not matter

David -

Thank you for your most sincere congratulations.  We must take a moment to
set on the veranda and enjoy a moment's leisure, perchance with a mint
julep.  How do you do.  The voice of Gertie Stein has become fluid, nay,
babbling Southern politesse.  An age gone by.  Bye bye.  How do you do.

Oh how you continue to get this here scene right.

And I'll be darned if I didn't remember that quote to which you have brought
my attention on one fine occasion long ago.  Nevermind that I once
frequented a Chapel Hill gin joint by the name of Dead Mule.

To be honest, since I am so unsure of my own honesty as a result of my
inability to comprehend the possibility of truth as a metaphysical property
of the universe (hence poetry), I can't tell any more when I'm lying or
telling the truth, at least when it comes to poetry.  The poet is a faker,
Pessoa wrote, and hell if I didn't discover my own subgenre of literature:
the fake fake.  I'm very confused.  Clarity has slipped me.  So clarity
seems so fake when it is written in an application for a contest.  Perhaps
this is my experience in Korporate Amerika showing.

For example, this afternoon I spent a full hour on the telephone with a
charming young woman of 85 years who has now run a poetry circle in Chapel
Hill for over 30 years.  (The other organizer is 93 and still never misses
one.)  For 30 years they have gathered together every Friday to eat lunch
together and read poems to one another.   Ms. Lyman asked me if I would
attend, and I said, "of course, I would be honored."  And that's damn
sincere.  I am honored.  This woman is "keepin' it real": she lost her
husband 25 years ago, an oceanographer and very late victim of Hiroshima
(while with the US military during WWII they used his oceanography skills
and made him measure radiation under water in proximity of the blast).
Maybe they once called Michael McFee and asked him to attend, or James
Appelwhite, but I might be surprised to see them there.  My dilemma is, what
to read, what to read.  What is an "honest" reflection?  When it comes to
poetry, I disappear.

But I'm in, in like the proverbial Flynn (with whom I have not had the
pleasure of dining), and with all my inflated guffaws, I am ready to
discontinue immediately the Whitman pieties and pseudo-transcendance and
marketing trysts.  So you like the application?  I am going to do that
reading festival.  Fortunately the judging was based solely on the poem, or
so I am told.  You should have read the original application, replete with
name dropping.  I was embarassed for myself.  It is still farily lacking in
the ruth department.  "I have it all and I bring it to you."  Aren't we
poets some sort of hybrid between a dog and a magician?  Sit, down, speak,
disappear, and then wistfully remembered.  I ceased to be a canine enchanter
and became a very human snake oil salesman.  That's the business.  Gotta do
what I gotta do considering I didn't attend the UNC Creative Writing courses
beyond the one I was required to take for the honors program.  If I had
taken another, I might have been on the news for murdering a professor.

My body, spirit, and mind.

Both articles elided "Web" from the Iowa Review Web while certainly getting
that confidence gesture in.  And I never said publication was a certainty:
the project is not completed, and Thomas never said "OK this is going in
this issue like this;" it's more or less been an understood sort of thing
between us we've discussed on several occasions.  We all know how these
sorts of things go, and I guess I have learned that the mass media has no
clue.  That's OK; I know they need the confidence gestures, and I'm happy
they spelled my name right.  They did offer to do a portrait of Lester but I
had to inform them that his location is at the moment unknown.  And I think
they did much better than that.

I guess it all comes down to the fact of the world: that I am "nuts."  Yes,
"nuts" I think is the most recent term I've seen bandied about.

So I don't want to make a network or a scene.  I just want an event.  Or
two.

I'm waiting for WRAL to call.


Patrick

Subject: Carborro poet laureate/network/scene (Re: heraldsun.com (Maria,
Ron, Kirby, Mark))

Patrick,

I was offline most of last week.  Congratulations!   I think the poem
shows great knowledge of horticulture and geography.  Next time you have
to include what Louis Rubin once said must be present in all Southern
poetry, namely a dead mule.  (Best thing he ever said).

The Herald-Sun piece reminded me of the distinction Ron S. makes
somewhere between "scene" and "network" in poetry (Ron, where is that
anyway?).  As we both know, Patrick, there is not really a scene here as
such, just some isolated individuals (you and me and . . . let's see . .
. Joe Donahue, Chris Vitiello if he's still around, others) doing their
work in some proximity to a medium-sized poetic circle jerk of Southern
establishment poets. Nor is there really a network.  What is _named_
here as a network (the North Carolina Writers Network) is actually made
up largely of (often blue-haired) writers who want to get invited to the
aforementioned circle jerk.  The Herald-Sun article implicitly
recognizes the authority of the real "network" (in this case, an
electronic one) though their elision of "web" from "Iowa Review Web"
suggests that they're not fully at ease with the idea.  In fact, though
I really like the poem you submitted, I think the real poem is your
application, exhibitiing what Al Franken calls "kidding on the square"
(http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/03/06/12_franken.html).

Best,
David

Subject:      first laureate poem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

Here's my first poem as laureate, along with some explanation for the Arts
Committee...the poem is to be posted in a place where a piece of artwork was
taken down in Town Hall; the piece of art was an American flag with stars
made from swastikas, made by Hunter C. Levinsohn:



This is a sort of early draft for the poem you requested...with a very long
introductory quote that may serve as a sort of side panel to the display of
the poem. I imagine the poem displayed as a center panel in a triptych of
text bookended by some pre-US naval flag designs.  I imagine the left panel,
the with pledge of allegiance and the quotes of Francis Bellamy, the author
of the pledge who was an incorrigable bigot who hated everyone:
African-Americans, Southerners, immigrants, etc.  The right panel might
contain perhaps a copy of the constitution and some quotes about the
differences between patriotism of one sort and patriotism of a more grand
sort, the patriotism our Founding Fathers envisioned.  I simply want to pit
the "pledge" against the "Constitution."  I think there's a huge rift there
in the American psyche that very few are actually conscious of.  We who have
recited the Pledge of Allegiance so many times.  As opposed to how few of us
have ever read the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.  It's starting to show.

I also want to show the image from old public school manuals requiring
students to raise their hands during the muttering of the Pledge.  The
raising of the hand is uncannily similar to the Seig Heil sign of Nazi
Germany.  http://history.vineyard.net/pledgem.gif

The motif of the intervening statements between the couplets were taken from
Betsy Ross flags ("Don't tread on me" and "An appeal to heaven"), a quote
from the Founding Fathers about the original flag of 13 stars and stripes,
and of course the constitution.

Wash.gif

They have rather opposite sentiments, don't they?

"A new constellation"  On 14 June 1777 (my birthday) the Second
Constitutional Congress met in Philadelphia (my home hometown, the home of
my family), voting to create a national flag.  The Founding Fathers wrote:
"Resolved, that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate
red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field
representing a new constellation."

The last segue of the liberty tree flag "An appeal to heaven" allows a
transition to ever-so-slight images of 9/11, of who has died, who is dying
and who is surviving.  This flag has incredible resonances with Hunter's
work, not only with her swastika'd flag but also with her cigarette butt
art, with 9/11, and with the American flag.  But how to tie all of those
together, and into something bigger?

The idea that the dead have a sort of levity was inspired by Hunter's
reference to the Incan symbol of butterflies.  It's a very sober and
unexclamatory moment that works well only when set against the
word-and-rhythm-drunk remainder of the poem.

I've written this piece in a sort of voice I imagine an African-American or
African-American-inspired/influenced Evangelical preacher taking, which I
think is the perfect voice for such a stance.  (Maybe it's because I watched
Robert Duvall in "Apostle" last night.)  We know we're being held asunder
and we know we are ignored but we refuse to be silenced.  So we shout
insisting we must be heard.  We can "take back" the flag fron these
mealy-mouthed regressivists by aligning ourselves with the dead of 9/11.  We
must "take back" the language and iconography of America!  Here's a start,
right here, in our own town.  No battle is too small.

The title is in part a "veiled" reference to the cover-up of Guernica in
Colin Powell's presence at the UN during the US Gov'ts WMD presentations.



Cover-up


for Hunter C. Levinsohn



"The hard inescapable fact is that men are not born equal. Neither are they
born free, but all in bonds to their ancestors and their environments...

"The success of government by the people will depend upon the stuff that
people are made of. The people must realize their responsibility to
themselves. They must guard, more jealously even than their liberties, the
quality of their blood.

"A democracy like ours cannot afford to throw itself open to the world.
Where every man is a lawmaker, every dull-witted or fanatical immigrant
admitted to our citizenship is a bane to the commonwealth. Where all classes
of society merge insensibly into one another every alien immigrant of
inferior race may bring corruption to the stock.

"There are races, more or less akin to our own, whom we may admit freely,
and get nothing but advantage from the infusion of their wholesome blood.
But there are other races which we cannot assimilate without a lowering of
our racial standard, which should be as sacred to us as the sanctity of our
homes."

"The stuff in our Anglo-Saxon blood [...] supplies the stamina and wholesome
aggressiveness of our race. The sane impulse of conflict that is in us needs
some recognition.

"There is no quality that a nation can less afford to lose than its
aggressive manliness. It is a quality amalgamate of courage, endurance,
restraint, and the power to act surely and unfalteringly in an emergency."

"The leaders of the negroes have been unendurable, more than the negro
voters themselves. .. So white Republicans make common cause with Democrats
for the disfranchisement of the negro...

"When the Southern finds a method for accomplishing his purpose he does not
stop."

"Cheap peon labor in Mexico is of a shiftless and unreliable kind. The
native Mexican works only that he may live. If he can live for a month on
the rewards of a week's work, he will work for twelve weeks out of the year
and not a week more."

 - Francis Bellamy, author of the Pledge of Allegiance



Don't tread on me.

Some attend to the Pledge of Allegiance and
Offend upend and bury the rights that still guide us.

Damnation!  Freedom is not the right to put asunder the views
of any one star that glows and stands in one nation under


A new constellation.

We refuse to be gagged and we resist,
Insisting we too under the same flag,


We the people.

Communion is not the ability to restrict or forsake free speech
Protected by Constitutional edict.  Together we make


An appeal to heaven.

We are the handworkers, the artisans of garbage.
We the dead hold office in the refuse, the rubble and the sewage.

Flags some use to cover up caskets
Cannot keep the dead down.

JTC,
Oh, I did so enjoy this one!...and I'm truly fond of the mirror and the =
lake images as reflecting elements.  Only I don't know why "...you =
couldn't drown in..." either.  Might one not drown in self-indulgence?  =
Interesting ending though.

The poets Kathleen Raine, and Ken Smith, in very different ways, added =
immeasurably to the strength of contemporary UK, indeed world, poetry.  =
To lose them both (and admittedly at different stages of their lives) =
within the space of less than a fortnight is more terrible still.

Kathleen Raine=20
Singular poet who stood as a witness to spiritual values in an age that =
rejected them=20

Janet Watts=20
Tuesday July 8, 2003
The Guardian=20

Kathleen Raine, who has died aged 95, was a poet who believed in the =
sacred nature of all life, all true art and wisdom, and her own calling. =
She knew as a small child that poetry was her vocation.=20

William Blake was her master, and she shared his belief that "one power =
alone makes a poet - imagination, the divine vision". As WB Yeats, her =
other great exemplar, put it, "poetry and religion are the same thing". =
To this vision she committed not only her poetry and erudition, but her =
whole life. She stood as a witness to spiritual values in a society that =
rejected them.=20

By the end, she inspired many kindred thinkers, including the Prince of =
Wales, whom she met through her friend Laurens van der Post. "I thought, =
that poor young man - anything I can do for him, I will do, because he =
is very lonely," she said of their first contact. In his turn, Prince =
Charles gave her vital support through his patronage of the Temenos =
Academy of Integral Studies, which she founded in London in 1990 as a =
new "school of wisdom".=20

Although Kathleen had a Christian upbringing and became a Roman Catholic =
in the 1940s - a decision she later admitted was a mistake - her spirit =
was more at home in the eastern traditions and the world view of Plato, =
Plotinus and the 18th-century English Platonist Thomas Taylor, on all of =
whom she produced scholarly studies. She drew Jungian psychology into =
her poetic vision of the divinity manifest in nature and the cosmos, and =
the "perennial wisdom" and spiritual symbols common to all religions, =
peoples and times.=20

These enthusiasms did not make her popular in her own culture, whose =
scorn she robustly reciprocated. She minded that Roy Fuller was =
preferred to herself as Edmund Blunden's successor for the Oxford poetry =
chair in 1968. In 1991, she declined the Royal Society of Literature's =
companionship of literature when she realised it had already been given =
to Anthony Burgess and Iris Murdoch, whom she dismissed as journalists.=20

But she received the Queen's gold medal for poetry in 1992, by which =
time she had won warm recognition in France, the United States and =
India. Three years ago came the CBE and the Commandeur de L'Ordre des =
Arts et des Lettres.=20

As a young poet, she longed to be published by TS Eliot at Faber, but in =
vain. Decades later, the daughter of her beloved Yeats told her that =
"Tom" had first told "WBY" (as Anne Yeats called her father) to read =
Kathleen Raine's poems. When she no longer bothered about such things, =
"I received Eliot's posthumous acceptance, with Yeats's also." It was =
the Sri Lankan, Tambimutto, who published her first book of poems, Stone =
And Flower, in 1943, with illustrations by Barbara Hepworth; he never =
ceased to see greatness in her work.=20

Kathleen's life had its pleasures, but much pain. She was beautiful and =
intelligent, and knew the passions of the heart and body as well as the =
immortal longings of the soul. At Cambridge, a group of young men hung =
around simply to catch sight of her. There were love affairs, marriages, =
partings.=20

After her greatest love - for the naturalist Gavin Maxwell, author of =
Ring Of Bright Water - proved disastrous, she renounced personal =
emotions, and judged her own part in these dramas with ruthless =
severity. Threads of sorrow, regret and loneliness run through her four =
volumes of autobiography, as well as through her poetry. Among the =
unpublished poems she chose for her last collection of poems (in 2000) =
were the lines: "Being what I am/ What could I do but wrong?"=20

She was an adored only child; a photograph of her at eight shows a =
ravishing girl with grave eyes and long, light brown hair. Her Scottish =
mother, Jessie, sang her the border ballads and wrote down her poems =
before she could hold a pencil herself. Her father, George, a miner's =
son, went to Durham University, and became an English teacher and =
Methodist lay preacher.=20

Though she was born in London, during the first world war she lived in =
Bavington, a Northumbrian hamlet, where she was "Kathie", a country =
child. For the rest of her life, this became her touchstone of wild =
beauty, simplicity and innocence; everywhere she went, she sought what =
she had known and lost there.=20

The family was close and happy, proudly nurturing Kathie's exceptional =
gifts - until a former pupil of her father's fell in love with her, aged =
14. When her father found out, he forbade the relationship. Not long =
afterwards, when the family were in France visiting a friend of her =
father's, a man of learning and culture, he, too, fell in love with her. =
Again, her father intervened.=20

It took Kathleen much of her life to forgive her parents for these =
traumas. When she did, realising the depth of their love for her - and =
hers for them - it was even harder for her to bear the memory of her own =
cruelty towards them, a rejection at the same pitch of harshness with =
which, she felt, they had devastated her youth. "I set out in a dream/ =
To go away -/ Away is hard to go, but no one/ Asked me to stay/ And =
there is no destination for away," she wrote.=20

With a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge, from Ilford county high =
school, she read natural sciences and psychology, rather than the =
English literature she already knew well. William Empson published her =
poems in the magazine Experiment. Later, she suspected it was because he =
had found her pretty.=20

Later, in old age, she admitted her shame to have fallen for the =
nihilism, atheism and cleverness of Cambridge. But her father's =
"blasting of first love", she wrote, had "cut something from my soul". =
With her first paradise of Northumberland lost, she saw Ilford, where =
her family settled, lose its idyllic countryside to the suburbia she =
loathed.=20

After Cambridge, Kathleen married: because, as she admitted in her =
autobiography, she had no idea what else to do. The marriage - to Hugh =
Sykes Davies - failed; she eloped with Charles Madge (obituary, January =
24 1996), who conceived Mass Observation, and with whom she had a son, =
James, and daughter, Anna. But she left this marriage, too, caught in a =
sensual passion for a man who did not care for her.=20

The love of her life was the homosexual Gavin Maxwell. She believed they =
shared all she held dearest in life. His grandfather was the Duke of =
Northumberland; her grandmother had sat behind his in Kielder Kirk, =
"admiring her coils of shining hair". He and Kathleen were at one in =
their love for that place, for his hut at Sandaig on the west Highland =
coast, and for Mijbil, the otter he had brought from the Euphrates. But =
the relationship was doomed.=20

Once, at his request, they shared a bed, without sexual contact. "Every =
night of my life, since then, I have spent alone," she wrote in The =
Lion's Mouth (1977), her third volume of autobiography. In it, she tells =
their story with surgical honesty, not avoiding what she came to see as =
her most terrible act, the words she spoke in her despair by the rowan =
tree on Sandaig that had symbolised for her the eternal quality of their =
bond: "Let Gavin suffer in this place, as I am suffering now."=20

Maxwell's beloved Mij was killed, for which Kathleen blamed her =
negligence; his house on Sandaig burned down. He endured other losses =
and failures, and died prematurely of cancer in 1969.=20

The agony that Kathleen Raine underwent thereafter, expressed in her =
poetry and prose, seems never wholly to have expiated her guilt for a =
curse that so rebounded on herself. As a woman, she reviled herself as =
loveless and destructive of other lives; as a poet, she castigated =
herself for not writing more, or better - for neglecting her daimon, as =
she called her gift and source. "Sin of omission: as women/ Withhold =
love, so I poetry," as one poem begins.=20

Yet she kept faith with her vocation, producing more than a dozen books =
of poetry in six decades. She visited India for the first time in her =
70s, and felt she had come home. She grew closer to her children, whose =
lives she thought she had ruined, her grandchildren and =
great-grandchildren. All but one grandchild survive her.=20

In 1980, her life took a new turning. With a group of like-minded =
artists and writers, she launched Temenos - "a review devoted to the =
arts of the imagination" - with its first issue offering contributions =
from fellow poets David Gascoyne, Peter Redgrove and Vernon Watkins, and =
the visionary artist Cecil Collins, as well as herself. The editors of =
Temenos (the word means the sacred area around a temple) declared that =
"the intimate link between the arts and the sacred" had fired =
imaginative creation in almost all human societies, except our own. =
Temenos aimed to challenge this "deviation" in the arts of its time.=20

It did so at an unpropitious moment, the start of the 1980s, a decade =
that epitomised all that Temenos opposed - secularism, materialism, a =
popularised culture and press, and Margaret Thatcher's denial of the =
very existence of "society". Yet in the 1990s a tide turned. At the =
Temenos Academy, Kathleen presided over discussions and lectures by =
scientists, ecologists and economists, as well as scholars, writers and =
artists from both east and west.=20

When asked how she wished people to remember her, Kathleen Raine said =
she would rather they didn't. Or that Blake's words be said of her: =
"That in time of trouble, I kept the divine vision". Better to be a =
sprat in that "true ocean", she believed, than a big fish in a literary =
rock pool.=20

Ken Smith=20

A poet of self-discovery, his work was highly personal, yet accessible =
and involving=20

Jon Glover

The Guardian=20

Ken Smith, who has died aged 64, was a great poet. He emerged first in =
the 1960s with other important new voices in Leeds, and was still =
opening new doors for poetry in the new century. He was a writer of =
personal experience who often reflected a sense of loss as he talked =
through the urban landscape. But he was also a fine poet of the visual =
and the present. Many of his books were a joy because of the way in =
which they integrated photographs and drawings into the experience of =
reading. His BBC radio programmes also merged speech with music and =
sounds recorded on location. His poems had to be heard, seen and felt, =
and they live on now as the visual, tactile and audible worlds of a =
wonderfully rich imagination.

Unlike some poets whose work is sparse, Ken Smith simply lived to write, =
and he was at the height of his powers when he brought legionnaire's =
disease with him back to London after a visit to Cuba. His last =
retrospective collection, Shed, published in 2002, confirmed the immense =
power of his poetry.=20
Ken Smith was born in Rudston, a small village in Yorkshire. His father =
(a farm worker and then greengrocer shop owner), whose life he explores =
in an early poem, Family Group, moved around, and Ken attended junior =
schools all over the county:

He was my father who=20
brought in wood and lit=20
The hissing lamp. And he=20
would sit, quiet=20
As moor before the fire.=20

After grammar school in Hull and Knaresborough, he did national service =
in the air force from 1958, returned to Hull in 1960 and married his =
first wife, Ann Minnis. In the same year he went to Leeds University to =
read English. He was one of that generation who remembered the impact of =
the war as children and who then went on to study after their own spell =
of military life. Fellow students at Leeds included Jon Silkin and Tony =
Harrison, and, like them, he was involved in editing and writing the =
extraordinary weekly poetry magazine, Poetry And Audience. Geoffrey Hill =
was an important influence as teacher and poet.=20

Silkin invited Ken to join him as coeditor of the quarterly Stand in =
1963, a position he held with others until 1972. In 1964 he won a =
Gregory Award For Poetry, and his first pamphlet collection, 11 Poems, =
appeared in the same year from Northern House, the small press jointly =
organised by Stand and the school of English at Leeds University. This =
established him as a key member of the group of poets most associated =
with Leeds, and with a growing national and international reputation - =
Silkin, Harrison and Hill.=20

From 1963 to 1965 Ken joined Silkin and others in selling Stand to =
cinema queues, in pubs and in university halls of residence. His =
journeys put him in contact with other important young writers. They =
also helped to spread Stand's influence as a radical journal with a =
commitment to politics, and to the world of writers with a consciousness =
of social purpose far wider then that normally associated with the =
English tradition.=20

Ken moved to teach in Exeter College of Art in 1965, and his first full =
volume, The Pity, was published by Jonathan Cape in 1967. After joining =
the widespread student (and staff) protests of 1968 and, crucially, =
writing poetry about them in Academic Board Poems, in 1969 he left for =
the US, where he became writer in residence at Slippery Rock State =
College, Pennsylvania, and then at the College of the Holy Cross and =
Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.=20

Work, Distances/Poems was published by the Swallow Press in Chicago in =
1972. His American poems had a more relaxed and open style than those in =
The Pity, and seemed to discover an intensity of meaning, bringing =
experience of space and experience of poetry together in a way =
encapsulated in the layout of the title.=20
There was still the sense of movement that originated in the Yorkshire =
landscape, but whereas rootlessness had earlier seemed only expressible =
in a gruff, remorseful, hurting anger, now it was more relished and =
tolerable, as in The Dream:=20

Where we are we belong,=20
Here or another place=20
How the tree speaks, talks=20
Of a fox passing through...=20

The fox, after its first appearance in 1968 in A Good Fox, was there =
again in Fox Running (1980).=20

Ken and his family had returned to England in 1973; his work mainly =
appeared in pamphlets, some self-published. He returned to Leeds =
University as a Yorkshire arts fellow from 1976 to 1978. He went to live =
in London after his marriage broke up. Fox Running appeared as a =
cyclostyled, 32-page A4 pamphlet, just 150 copies at =A35 each.=20

This had some good reviews. An unsuspecting purchaser writing to The =
Rolling Moss Press for a copy discovered that Rolling Moss was actually =
Ken himself. Neil Astley of Bloodaxe Books (who had also worked with =
Stand in Newcastle), had already published Ken's Tristan Crazy in 1978, =
and agreed to produce a second edition of Fox Running in 1981. This was =
followed the same year by Abel Baker Charlie Delta Epic Sonnets, and =
Burned Books and The Poet Reclining, Selected Poems 1962-1980, both in =
1982. Writing in The Times Literary Supplement in June 1983, Roger =
Garfitt, one of Ken's most perceptive critics, said: "Poetry ceases to =
be what it so often is in England, an art of framed observations: it =
becomes the spelling out of a selfhood, 'a language to speak to =
myself'." Ken's reputation was established and his readership widened.=20

To some extent his achievement has paralleled the expansion and =
influence of Bloodaxe. His journeys were both inwards and outwards. His =
poems were intimately related to self-discovery as he placed himself in =
stranger and more demanding situations. Terra (1986), A Book Of Chinese =
Whispers (prose poems) and Wormwood (both 1987); all were produced while =
Ken was writer-in-residence in Wormwood Scrubs prison between 1985 and =
1987. These were followed in 1989 by a major prose account of prison =
life called Inside Time. He continued to travel and gathered his =
intensely felt observations into prose, including Berlin (1990), on the =
fall of the Berlin Wall and its aftermath, and several poem sequences =
for BBC radio.=20

Later collections include Tender To The Queen Of Spain (1993), Wild Root =
(1998), and the widely praised Shed. Many of his books have been Poetry =
Book Society recommendations, and Terra was shortlisted for the =
Whitbread poetry prize. Ken held other fellowships and awards. He =
travelled widely in the US and Europe, visiting Hungary, Slovakia, =
Ukraine and Romania to record sounds and voices for the BBC. He =
continued to speak for victims of oppression, and the collaboration =
required for radio work was a vital counter-balance to his intense =
individuality. He edited, with his second wife, the poet and artist Judi =
Benson, Klaonica: Poems For Bosnia (1993). He took part in Stand's 50th =
birthday reading in Leeds in November 2002. He was about to carry out =
research in the West Country for the BBC when he became ill in January.=20

Like many poets of his generation he formed a creative, symbiotic =
relationship with America - its landscape, history and language. While =
he lived for many years in London's East End he could, perhaps, talk =
about the city experience only afterthe freedom and distances of the US =
and its people. His poetry offers a special insight into the world in =
which we now live. Highly personal yet accessible and involving, it =
provides a record of journeys that seem at first to be strange, =
distressing and unique. But many readers will continue to join him as =
though finding vital common ground for the first time.
=20
He is survived by his first wife and their children Nicole, Kate and =
Danny; and by Judi and his stepson Todd.=20

Let me see if I have this right; if the left (which I've never been able to
find despite going out every day for years with my flashlight looking for one)
abandons its political agenda and appeals to the nigger-hating, jew-baiting,
anti-queer, anti-feminist nazis, and panders to these and other hatreds of the
poor, forgotten white bigots, it might be able to win an election?  You forget
to mention in your litany of why the right has its shit together that the
right controls the media, the economic agenda, the military, the money, and the
judicial system.  This is probably an oversight on your part, and a very
telling one.  Perhaps we ought to stop talking about leftists who, if they exist at
all, have never had much of an impact on the US political scene except in the
negative, and speak to liberals and democrats, which is not the same thing.
Of course, in your right-wing training class, you probably were taught that
these ARE the same things, which is why you use this label to describe people who
wouldn't be caught dead at a leftist gathering, should one ever take place.

Hello, Tom!

I'm not exactly sure who you mean by "these Russian poets," but since
you've posted this in response to my Fulcrum announcement, I guess you
probably mean Katia Kapovich and me? We were both born in the sixties.

I don't see myself as a Russian poet because I don't write anything
literary in Russian, nor do I particularly identify with any sort of
"Russian sensibility" (whatever that means), although people are already
beginning pigeonhole me into that (to my slight annoyance) now that the
first critical mentions of my book are beginning to emerge. Although
love Russian poetry, am on friendly terms with many Russian poets, and
am "steeped" (love that word) in Russian culture (I suppose this
explains why certain things Russian can be found in Fulcrum 2), I don't
really consider myself a part of any sort of Russian =E9migr=E9 =
"community"
or "identity," although I have no objection to them either. The whole
business of national identity/mentality is quite foreign to me =96 I
couldn=92t care less for such things.

Katia Kapovich, my wife and co-editor, writes in both languages. She is
bilingual; is a brilliant and well-regarded Russian poet with a few
books in that language; and also has an English-language collection
forthcoming. Her style in English is original, largely independent of,
and quite different from her Russian style. She was a member of literary
dissident movement in the USSR and emigrated in 1990. (Katia is not from
Russia proper -- she lived in Moldova throughout her "Soviet" years.
Moldova was one of the =93sister republics=94 that formed the old USSR =
but
is a separate country today.)

Katia and I don't publish our own poetry in Fulcrum. There are three
Russian poets in Fulcrum 2: two Moscow residents (Lev Rubinstein and
Sergey Gandlevsky) and one =E9migr=E9 who lives in Prague (Alexei =
Tsvetkov).
All three are very major poets. Their poetry appears in Fulcrum in
translation. (Their bio notes can be found at the end of Fulcrum 2.)=20

Fulcrum 2 also includes black-and-white graphic works by the
20th-century Russian artist Mstislav Dobuzhinsky (with a biographical
essay by Mikhail Kovner); Mikhail Iamposki's essay on Komar and Melamid
(two Russian avantgarde collaborative artists who founded the Sots Art
movement in the late 60s and have lived in NY City since the 70s); and
interview with Joseph Brodsky.

None of the other 60+ contributors to the issue are Russian, nor are the
15 contributing editors.)

As an aside -- and in my own humble opinion with which some will surely
to disagree -- there are only two serious avangtgarde poets writing in
Russian today: Dmitrii Prigov and Lev Rubinshtein. Both live in Moscow
(though Prigov also visits London a lot). The two used to be known as
"conceptualists" (in a peculiar Russian sense). Prigov is also a
considerable visual artist. Their work lends itself to translation
reasonably well and is definitely worth considering. Alexander Eremenko,
another brilliant Muscovite with an avantgarde temperament, does not
seem to be writing these days.

There are several English-language poets of Russian extraction in the
US. Many if not most of them adhere to avantgarde poetics. I am no
expert on this group, but I believe most of them are somewhat younger
than me (I'm 37), and most of them grew up in this country and use
English as their first language. I gather that this group (or groups?)
does have some sort of shared identity (or identities).

At any rate, my friend Matvei Yankelevich (vibrant writer and publisher
of Ugly Duckling Presse in NY) is currently writing an essay about
Russo-American poets. He certainly knows more about this latter group
than I do, and I'll forward this discussion to him for possible comment,
and will also post the reference when his essay appears.

I hope this helps a bit!

With best wishes,

Philip

My two cents

the right has also won many elections by strategically
disenfranchising lower income people, people of color,
and new immigrants.

the right won the last presidential election with
blatant disregard for public opinion.

i love that fierce exchange Michael Douglas has with
Michael J Fox in "American President". "Lewis, people
don't crawl through the desert to drink sand because
they want water, they drink sand because they don't
know the difference."

the right wins elections through misrepresentation,
chicanery, terrorism, and in some cases brute
violence.

The "right" stole the election in Florida. It didn't "win" anything.
STOLE. It took criminal ledgers from Texas, Alabama, and two other
states. Then it listed all the more general "black" sounding common
names like James Johnson, etc. and everyone who showed up to vote in
Florida with the same names were not permitted to vote. It illegally
stole the election.

Ah, my friend, you have the illusion of honesty as being relevant in =
politics...it just ain't so.  Perhaps the new right gets to say, "back =
at ya!."  Was there in recent decades a more blatant theft of an =
election than the outright purchase of votes by Joe Kennedy Sr. for his =
slightly to the left of center son John?=20

And that thievery of which you speak took organization and dedicated =
effort on the part of thousands of dedicated criminals intent on gaining =
the top seat in order to advance their agenda.  Reversing that victory =
will require as much (or perhaps more) labor on the part of those...left =
or otherwise...interested in achieving that goal of gaining the top =
office and advancing a different agenda.=20

No Joe, you don't have it right. The point Haas is making is that no one is
reaching out to the poor, forgotten whites except for those with a bigoted
agenda. Unless you assume that white ethnics & southerners are by their very
nature bigoted, which would be a classist & misguided assumption.

Obviously white working folks haven't cornered the market on intolerance, since
that agenda is being pushed in "the media, the economic agenda, the military,
the money, the judicial system." The pusher here is a super-rich power
structure with the juice to get their point across, not white have-nots.

The post reinforces Haas' statement. Dismissal of the white working class in
America spells political failure. You also make a great point- university
intellectuals who ignore the forementioned agenda machines will likewise fail.

<<In the Iraqi capital Monday, a polyglot city council met for the first
time, bringing together a wide range of members - from tribal leaders in
headdresses to women in smart business suits. The role of the 37-member
advisory body - which has no spending authority - is to advise the U.S.-led
administration.

"It's probably the most important day since April 9th, when the coalition
came and liberated you from the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein," said L.
Paul Bremer, the top U.S. official in Iraq. "Today marks the resumption of
the democratic system in Baghdad, which hasn't been here in 30 years." >>

Resumption of the democratic system? Who elected this advisory board?
Elections were cancelled, so it wasn't the Iraqi people.

The advisory panel is "to advise the US-led administration" rather than
advise the Iraqi people.

It's not surprising that this obviously sn't democracy. What's surprising
to me is that the AP article makes no mention of the fact that this
obviously isn't democracy despite Bremer's words.

Much respect and gratitude for Hass' post.  Have "fought" and otherwise
contended with "the working white" all my life, a/the class with which I'm
intimately familiar.  Cannot but agree with almost everything that Hass
smartly introduces.  Including the "ruthless" thing.

Philosophy and Platonic ideals aside, ("we") must be ruthless in defeating
the Republicans politically.  So some prospective voters are horrible
bigots?  Then manipulate them into voting against Bush by any means.  It's
politics, and the game needs to be played hard and fast and shrewdly.  Ain't
a lot of time to be intolerant about gaining intolerant voters or tolerant
about criticizing ourselves for being ruthless.  Moreover, there are
innumerable elite Dems who could care less about all the finer points of
Tolerance, and they would sell Tolerance X, Y, Z down the river in a
heartbeat if it threatened their financial well-being.

I couldn't answer yesterday because of the 2 message rule.

Look, I'm not impuning the virtue of the working class in general, but it's
a matter of record that the south shifted from voting for democrats to
voting for republicans, and democratic legislators and
governors  succesfully jumped  to the republican party in the wake of
desegregation. Those erstwhile democrats weren't all liberals or
progressives, let alone leftists, but they could be counted on to vote with
the democratic majority in congress. Meanwhile in their home states the
legislatures were voting for "right to work" laws, which crippled the
unions, and textile manufacturing continued its exit to the far east.

In much of the rest of the country the urban exodus to the suburbs was
accellerated by what was called "white flight," working class people
fleeing their newly integrated neighborhoods. The suburbs have become the
other major base of the republican party.

The working class of your dreams has with a fair degree of consistency
voted against its own best interests. A case in point: all the polls
indicated that Jesse Helms, who had become a laughing stock in North
Carolina, would lose his last two senate races. Apparently significant
numbers of people were too embarrassed to admit their voting plans to the
pollsters. Helms was running against a black man. He played the race card
and won.

I'm not aware, by the way, of the rejoicing of the environmental community
over the loss of industrial jobs. Factories that poisoned their workers and
the environment, incidentally an environment largely inhabited by working
class people, were unlamented, but the plea has always been for
sustainable, non-polluting industries.

Note that I use democrat as a stand-in for leftist. I kinow the difference.
I also know that what progressive legislation we get, insufficient bas it
is, comes mostly out of the democratic caucus.

This is too good, Patrick! You are going to get a movie contract out of
this. And think of the web blog you can keeping during the shoot - the
literary reputation of "Swimming to Cambodia" will be reduced to a pond and
the ocean out there - off Cape Hatteras - "combustion to the astral core"
will be yours. Along with all the other obvious treats.

Well Frank, I think I do have it right.  In the first place, not all working
class people vote republican -- those who do are mostly white males, whose
feelings of impotence have been greatly exacerbated.  The reason that the working
class shifted to the whacko right is that they didn't like the democratic
standards that were developing in the 60s & 70s -- you know, political rights for
every group, whether you like them or not.  And indeed, no one should be
characterizing the white middle class as poor because if you've looked around
lately, almost all of the working class is solidly  in the middle class.  The
issue is that the liberals have sold out any real values they have that are in the
slightest democratic -- witness the election of Clinton, who in any real
survey would come off as a moderate republican.   The truth is that American don't
much give a shit about anything but their lifestyles and their narrow
religious beliefs.  Most of them don't care how many people we kill around the globe
as long as gas is cheap and the malls are open.  It's a delusion to think that
electing democrats will be much of an improvement, since the pols from both
parties are bought and paid for by the same groups of elites, whose particular
interests these days are ways to accelerate the shift of wealth from the
middle-class to themselves -- that's right, Frank, they're robbing the same bigoted
boobs that vote them in!   & what will be the net result of this theft,
Frank?  Why, an increase in their feelings of impotence, which will again be
exploited by dishes of testosterone had fed them by the right-wing controlled media
to hate minorities and women even more.  Haas's solution is to be just like
the rats and use the same hate tactics that they use, and of course with
promises of tax cuts that in reality turn out to be just the opposite.  This goes
right to the heart of the matter -- there's no difference between the two parties
except spin.  If you or Haas really want to promote democracy, go out and
found a new political party -- that's how we might get democracy here.  As it
stands, we're about 15 or 20 political parties short of one.

MIME-Version: 1.0

I don't have time to write today... probably good news for you!  But I've
hired a stand-in -- one of my staff writers, Robert Lowell, who has recently
responded quite positively to literary CPR, has agreed to submit some of his
early comments on William Carlos Williams and the Beats to FSC.



Lowell's collected prose is quite short, about 370 pages, and not ambitious
at all as a "critical" collection.  In fact, they are not unlike blog
entries themselves -- informal appreciations of what he felt informed him
(though far from "lugubrious").  The parts that I most enjoy are those which
depict him <i>changing his mind</i>, and which illustrate for me the
humility one poet had before the language, which he recognized as <i>coming
from elsewhere</i>, in a sense -- transmissions from the culture in which he
lived but felt that, at times, he didn't know.  I don't think it was ever in
fashion to be entirely candid about one's failures, especially after having
won the Pulitzer with a first book.



Lowell's first two short essays on WCW were written in 1947, around the time
he published <i>Lord Weary's Castle</i> (the title of which, Ron Silliman
claims, told us "all about his literary allegiances").  But his longer, more
considered "career assessment"-type essay was written in '62, from which the
following quotes are taken:



<blockquote>To explain the full punishment I felt on first reading Williams,
I should say a little about what I was studying at the time. A year or so
before, I had read some introductory books on the enjoyment of poetry, and
was knocked over by the examples in the free-verse sections. When I arrived
at college, independent, fearful of advice, and with all the world before
me, I began to rummage through the Cambridge bookshops. I found books that
must have been looking for a buyer since the student days of Trumbull
Stickney: soiled metrical treatises written by obscure English professors in
the eighteen-nineties. They were full of glorious things: rising rhythm,
falling rhythm, feet with Greek names, stanzas from Longfellow's "Psalm of
Life," John Drinkwater, and Swinburne. Nothing seemed simpler than meter. I
began experiments with an exotic foot, short, long, two shorts, then fell
back on iambics. My material now took twice as many words, and I rolled out
Spenserian stanzas on Job and Jonah surrounded by recently seen Nantucket
scenery. Everything I did was grand, ungrammatical, and had a timeless,
hackneyed quality. All this was ended by reading Williams. It was as though
some homemade ship, part Spanish galleon, part paddle-wheels, kitchen pots,
and elastic bands and worked by hand, had anchored to a filling
station.</blockquote>



This is, to me, a fantastic, and well-constructed, paragraph -- the use of
the word "ungrammatical" followed by the 7-word sentence hinge that
dramatizes RL's conversion is subtle.  The phrase "All this was ended by
Williams" almost reminds me of the "All the field was lifted..." line that
Williams himself wrote about Olson's Projective Verse essay.  Trumbull
Stickney!



Next, here is Lowell on Williams's idiom.  Note the use of the word
"exotic," which I think is an accurate way to convey the very alien nature
of Williams's use of "speech" in the context of anti-intuitive, quasi
"formalist" -- dare I say "futurist" -- lineation:



<blockquote>I have emphasized Williams's simplicity and nakedness and have
no doubt been misleading. His idiom comes from many sources, from speech and
reading, both of various kinds; the blend, which is his own invention, is
generous and even exotic. Few poets can come near to his wide clarity and
dashing rightness with words, his dignity and almost Alexandrian modulations
of voice. His short lines often speed up and simplify hugely drawn out and
ornate sentence structures. I once typed out his direct but densely observed
poem, "The Semblables," in a single prose paragraph. Not a word or its
placing had been changed, but the poem has changed into a piece of
smothering, magnificent rhetoric, much more like Faulkner than the original
Williams.</blockquote>



One might almost think that Williams, who wanted to learn from the American
idiom of his times, was all about <i>simple sentence structures</i> in the
ideologically-tinged reading of his attention to "plain speech."  I've
always contended that Williams had little to do with "plain speech," which
seems to me a hangover from Puritan times when our souls (like the economy
of a "rogue nation") were supposed to be transparent.



I was under the impression that the autobiographical free verse poems of
<i>Life Studies</i> were the clearest indication of the effect of the Beats
on Lowell's poetry, but the following suggests otherwise.  I trust any poet
who is honest about their conversions, including those who seem intent on
changing their mind if only to keep it alive.  The question, then, is how to
keep a <i>poem</i> alive -- here's one story (this could almost be a section
from Eileen Tabios's excellent, probably utterly forgotten, <i>Black
Lightning</i> -- look it up!).  I thought "Skunk Hour" was a fantastic poem
when growing up and still do:



<blockquote>"Skunk Hour" was begun in mid-August 1957 and finished about a
month later. In March of the same year, I had been giving readings on the
West Coast, often reading six days a week and sometimes twice on a single
day. I was in San Francisco, the era and setting of Allen Ginsberg and all
about, very modest poets were waking up prophets. I became sorely aware of
bow few poems I had written, and that these few had been finished at the
latest three or four years earlier. Their style seemed distant,
symbol-ridden, and willfully difficult. I began to paraphrase my Latin
quotations, and to add extra syllables to a line to make it clearer and more
colloquial. I felt my old poems hid what they were really about, and many
times offered a stiff, humorless, and even impenetrable surface. I am no
convert to the "beats." I know well, too, that the best poems are not
necessarily poems that read aloud. Many of the greatest poems can only be
read to one's self, for inspiration is no substitute for humor, shock,
narrative, and a hypnotic voice, the four musts for oral performance. Still,
my own poems seemed like prehistoric monsters dragged down into the bog and
death by their ponderous armor. I was reciting what I no longer felt. What
influenced me more than San Francisco and reading aloud was that for some
time I had been writing prose. I felt that the best style for poetry was
none of the many poetic styles in English, but something like the prose of
Chekhov or Flaubert.            When I returned to my home, I began writing
lines in a new style. No poem, however, got finished and soon I left off and
tried to forget the whole headache. Suddenly, in August, I was struck by the
sadness of writing nothing, and having nothing to write, of having, at
least, no language. When I began writing "Skunk Hour," I felt that most of
what I knew about writing was a hindrance.</blockquote>



Here's a type of self-criticism that I would hope becomes addictive (not
least with me).  How many poets do you know who call their knowledge a
"hindrance"?  And if this is just a sign of manic depressiveness, then I
don't know what to say except the depths, at times, are productive of useful
confrontations with one's ego.  Is this the writing of a person who was tied
to (in Silliman's words) "presumptions about 'what poetry should be.'"
(BTW, Has anyone ever noticed how James Schuyler's elegy for Frank O'Hara,
"Buried At Springs," is practically indistinguishable, metrically and
tonally, from a <i>Life Studies</i> poem.  Sheik it out!)



Lastly, here is Lowell on the "poetry wars."  Reading the following gives me
the impression that Ron Silliman's contention that the "school of quietude"
is performing literary CPR by buttressing the collected Lowell -- they
probably are, but who cares? -- can be countered by a contention that
Silliman is performing a similar service -- by reviving the "poetry wars" he
and other "New Americans" (the values of the Language poets don't seem to
play a large role here) are able to don the old Cold War armor and appear
rather fresh again.  This is just a suspicion, and certainly there is no
reason to "care" about this either, but alas I can't get over the nagging
feeling that these forms of balkanization are stripping the poetry culture
of an ability to think subtly through complex issues.



<blockquote>A seemingly unending war has been going on for as long as I can
remember between Williams and his disciples and the principals and disciples
of another school of modern poetry. The Beats are on one side, the
university poets are on the other. Lately [in the sixties] the gunfire has
been hot. With such un likely Williams recruits as Karl Shapiro blasting
away, it has become unpleasant to stand in the middle in a position of
impartiality.



The war is an old one for me. In the late thirties, I was at Kenyon College
to study under John Crowe Ransom. The times hummed with catastrophe and
ideological violence, both political and aesthetical. The English
departments were clogged with worthy but outworn and backward-looking
scholars whose tastes in the moderns were most often superficial, random,
and vulgar. Students who wanted to write got little practical help from
their professors. They studied the classics as monsters that were slowly
losing their fur and feathers and leaking a little sawdust. What one did
oneself was all chance and shallowness, and no profession seemed wispier and
less needed than that of the poet. My own group, that of Tate and Ransom,
was all for the high discipline, for putting on the full armor of the past,
for making poetry something that would take a man's full weight and that
would bear his complete intelligence, passion, and subtlety. Almost
anything, the Greek and Roman classics, Elizabethan dramatic poetry,
seventeenth-century metaphysical verse, old and modern critics,
aestheticians and philosophers, could be suppled up and again made
necessary. The struggle perhaps centered on making the old metrical forms
usable again to express the depths of one's experience.



For us, Williams was of course part of the revolution that had renewed
poetry, but he was a byline. Opinions varied on his work. It was something
fresh, secondary, and minor, or it was the best that free verse could do. He
was the one writer with the substance, daring, and staying power to make the
short free-verse poem something considerable. One was shaken when the
radical conservative critic Yvor Winters spoke of Williams's "By the road to
the contagious hospital" as a finer, more lasting piece of craftsmanship
than "Gerontion."



Well, nothing will do for everyone. It's hard for me to see how I and the
younger poets I was close to could at that time have learned much from
Williams. It was all we could do to keep alive and follow our own heavy
program. That time is gone, and now young poets are perhaps more conscious
of the burden and the hardening of this old formalism. Too many poems have
been written to rule. They show off their authors' efforts and mind, but
little more. Often the culture seems to have passed them by. And, once more,
Dr. Williams is a model and a liberator. What will come, I don't know.
Williams, unlike, say, Marianne Moore, seems to be one of those poets who
can be imitated anonymously. His style is almost a common style and even
what he claims for it-the American style. Somehow, written without his speed
and genius, the results are usually dull, a poem at best well-made but
without breath.</blockquote>



Lowell's Shakespearean approach to the culture wars -- he occupies the role
of Prospero in the staging of the Ariels vs. Calibans -- seems, to me, just
more trustworthy, at this moment in time (but also that), then the Leninist
mode of aligning forces around some perception of obdurate "class" values
(not to mention those of "nation") that are unclear even to those on which
you side.  Making your enemies out to be utter conformists while all your
buddies are free-thinking individualists just never struck me as a good
tactic.



I think it's a sign of the even-handedness of "madman" Lowell's approach
that he includes this anecdote about Yvor Winters, and it seems to me that
Lowell, if anything, hopes only to make this "war" tenable as something of
cultural value, were that possible, than to win it!  Such a dramatist's
flair would be welcome in Silliman's blog.  And sad to say, the final line
of this excerpt seems to me true of a lot of the writing that RS seems to
class under the "school" of plain speech -- few are able to maintain the
level of tension that appears in Williams' best work.  Silliman may be right
that there is a shipwreck occurring, but I'm not sure we are looking at the
right shore.

Thanks, Philip As I said I wasn't being dismissive.  More curious than
anything and I kknow here are others on the list with Russian backgrounds of
sorts.  I also know the politics of Russian emigre poetics in the past have
been of interest to the mainstream media - (reacting to Fulcrum's award by
NPR) - not that that is the case here.  I was thinking also that maybe the
time has come for a breakdown of the old idea of a monothic Russia.  I also
see no mention of Dmitri Bulatov but maybe he is of the wrong generation or
his reputation is more international rather than Russian.

I think that Haas only said what is true, not that he agreed with it.

What's true is that the white working class is considered to be garbage by the
left.  They are embarrassing in their art, their taste, their ideas, and the
academic left doesn't want to be associated with them.  In academia every kind of
culture is ok except for white working class culture, which means country western
music, tap dancing or clog dancing, bowling, fishing, earnest movies about World
War II, movies that make you cry, and the top of the line stuff is Ernest
Hemingway.  They like Dolly Parton.  They also like Sammy Davis Jr.  It's not so
much about race as about sensibility.  Most poets and academics have a very
nihilistic viewpoint, and are quite suspicious.  Most Republican Americans are
really happy, and think hamburger on a grill is something to die for, and that a
good sunset, and kids swimming in a pool together is heaven.

The Republican vision is more coherent than the Democratic -- the Democrats are
split between a very erudite group (that voted or was tempted to vote for for
Nader) and a heterogeneous mix of Hispanic, black, poor and middle-class white.
But increasingly the whites are taken for granted by that group and are told that
they are imperialistic all the time and are scolded for their history, and told
they are evil.  Should they be swatted into outer space?  Maybe so, but are you
going to get them to vote for it?

Every group has a right to exist.  Fifty years ago the Democrats wanted to help
the white southern working class -- that was their constituency.  Now they don't
want to be associated with them.  The Republican right has a natural alliance
with them because they are both for things like family values, anti-abortion, and
they are both pro-Christianity. America is 87% Christian.  I hate most Christians
(not as people, but I can't stand their ideas -- I don't like Catholic ideas
because the Counter-Reformation sucked -- I hate Methodists -- Chiang Kai-=Shek
was a Methodist, I don't like anything Baptist much except for the little group
in Rhode Island, and so on. I don't even know what a Presbyterian is, and I don't
think that they do either...).  But most Americans are made of this cheesy
substance.  The Republicans speak directly to that.

Democrats want on the other hand to be totally inclusive, so that it seems they
don't have a clear constituency.  Like they won't say if they are for abortion or
not.  They just float.  Can anybody say for sure what Gore thought about that?
His wife is against porn and rock music.  Nader was a loser who never had a
girlfriend, or a family.  That's how most Americans think.  Nader would rather
hug a tree than a human.  How many people can really relate to that? At least if
he was gay, or SOMETHING, he would have a constituency.  But neuter?

The Democrats' real constituency now is super-smart academics on the one side,
and all the rainbow coalition, but they are still seemingly keeping one foot in
the corporate door. They are all over the place, and so they are just unfocused.
Why didn't they fight over the chads?  Suddenly they wanted it to be all
principled.  The Republicans JUST WANTED to win, so they did.  I voted for Gore
and just thought he was a prick to not want to fight with Bush for the
nomination.  He should have raised hell.  What a stupid prick.

My family is largely Republican, and has been for some time (since Lincoln), but
they are voting Democrat for the last couple of elections because the Democrats
seem to have good economic ideas. I used to be a green anarchist, but now am just
disgusted with the Marxism on the one side and the Calvinism on the other.

The last politician I really liked was Paul Simon of Illinois.  I liked his bow
tie, and his ecological ideas.  He was trounced in the primaries.

In Finland, where I spent most of the last ten years -- there are thirty some
parties.  There's even a beer party, and they all get seats.  What we need is a
different proportional system so that we can stop playing football between these
two megalithic sides that speak for Manichean opposites.  I'm so tired of hearing
about politics in this country.  Our side is good, and the other side is totally
evil.  The only cultural thing in this country that interests me at all is the
poetry.  Everything else just stinks -- especially the rubbery cheese.  If I was
to start a new party, I would concentrate on getting more varieties of cheese
into this country.  That's something I could get excited about. We seem to have
only two kinds of cheese in this country -- the orange and the white -- and two
parties -- it's like something out of Romeo and Juliette.  A plague on both your
houses.

Is there any really good cheese that is made in this country?  Does anybody
really like ANY of it?  Is there something I'm missing?

Subject:      Is the political ground suddenly shifting with potential
              consequences?

Today I am under the strong impression that many things are shifting on the
ground:

1. The Bush Administration's Acknowledgement that Bush used forged "Niger"
documents to lead this country into war.
2. The Admission has made Blair an almost certain casualty - he's on the
edge of being thrown out of power.
3. The situation on the ground in Iraq is become progressively more
untenable. Short of establishing a very expensive, dangerous door to door
police state, US troops on the ground are in an impossibly vulnerable
situation. Reports suggest troop moral is floating down the Trigris as fast
as the untreated sewage. Even in the unlikely scenario that the Government
constructs a quick exit - even at the expense and unlikely giving up of oil
"rights" - it's unlikely the Bush folks can escape some heavy political
damage here. (Funny cartoon of Blair pulling Bush down by his coat-tails).
4. A higher Appeals court has determined that Cheney - the apparent source
of the Niger Uranium forgery - must reveal the names present in the secret
meetings of the Energy Task Force. It will be hard to cook Cheney, but maybe
public opinion will force his exposure on several levels.


I guess the real question is whether the combination of these four factors -
combined with a miserably performing economy - will be the Bush
administration's Achilles' heel.  The public disgust so large and one that a
strong Democrat may take advantage of.
Yet - the cleanup and healing from the consequences of this regime's off the
chart's ideological madness - will take years from which to recover. I fear.

[Apologies again for just shoveling this in your inbox, please shout if this
is worthless American gunslinging to y'all.  I think it's important to use
this moment in contention to clear up some ideas - or some of mine, at any
rate - concerning the distracting generalizations that seem to me to have
have been occurring since before I was born.]

I don't have time to write today... probably good news for you!  But I've
hired a stand-in -- one of my staff writers, Robert Lowell, who has recently
responded quite positively to literary CPR, has agreed to submit some of his
early comments on William Carlos Williams and the Beats to FSC.

Lowell's collected prose is quite short, about 370 pages, and not ambitious
at all as a "critical" collection.  In fact, they are not unlike blog
entries themselves -- informal appreciations of what he felt informed him
(though far from "lugubrious").  The parts that I most enjoy are those which
depict him <i>changing his mind</i>, and which illustrate for me the
humility one poet had before the language, which he recognized as <i>coming
from elsewhere</i>, in a sense -- transmissions from the culture in which he
lived but felt that, at times, he didn't know.  I don't think it was ever in
fashion to be entirely candid about one's failures, especially after having
won the Pulitzer with a first book.

Lowell's first two short essays on WCW were written in 1947, around the time
he published <i>Lord Weary's Castle</i> (the title of which, Ron Silliman
claims, told us "all about his literary allegiances").  But his longer, more
considered "career assessment"-type essay was written in '62, from which the
following quotes are taken:

<blockquote>To explain the full punishment I felt on first reading Williams,
I should say a little about what I was studying at the time. A year or so
before, I had read some introductory books on the enjoyment of poetry, and
was knocked over by the examples in the free-verse sections. When I arrived
at college, independent, fearful of advice, and with all the world before
me, I began to rummage through the Cambridge bookshops. I found books that
must have been looking for a buyer since the student days of Trumbull
Stickney: soiled metrical treatises written by obscure English professors in
the eighteen-nineties. They were full of glorious things: rising rhythm,
falling rhythm, feet with Greek names, stanzas from Longfellow’s “Psalm of
Life,” John Drinkwater, and Swinburne. Nothing seemed simpler than meter. I
began experiments with an exotic foot, short, long, two shorts, then fell
back on iambics. My material now took twice as many words, and I rolled out
Spenserian stanzas on Job and Jonah surrounded by recently seen Nantucket
scenery. Everything I did was grand, ungrammatical, and had a timeless,
hackneyed quality. All this was ended by reading Williams. It was as though
some homemade ship, part Spanish galleon, part paddle-wheels, kitchen pots,
and elastic bands and worked by hand, had anchored to a filling
station.</blockquote>

This is, to me, a fantastic, and well-constructed, paragraph -- the use of
the word "ungrammatical" followed by the 7-word sentence hinge that
dramatizes RL's conversion is subtle.  The phrase "All this was ended by
Williams" almost reminds me of the "All the field was lifted..." line that
Williams himself wrote about Olson's Projective Verse essay.  Trumbull
Stickney!

Next, here is Lowell on Williams's idiom.  Note the use of the word
"exotic," which I think is an accurate way to convey the very alien nature
of Williams's use of "speech" in the context of anti-intuitive, quasi
"formalist" -- dare I say "futurist" -- lineation:

<blockquote>I have emphasized Williams’s simplicity and nakedness and have
no doubt been misleading. His idiom comes from many sources, from speech and
reading, both of various kinds; the blend, which is his own invention, is
generous and even exotic. Few poets can come near to his wide clarity and
dashing rightness with words, his dignity and almost Alexandrian modulations
of voice. His short lines often speed up and simplify hugely drawn out and
ornate sentence structures. I once typed out his direct but densely observed
poem, “The Semblables,” in a single prose paragraph. Not a word or its
placing had been changed, but the poem has changed into a piece of
smothering, magnificent rhetoric, much more like Faulkner than the original
Williams.</blockquote>

One might almost think that Williams, who wanted to learn from the American
idiom of his times, was all about <i>simple sentence structures</i> in the
ideologically-tinged reading of his attention to "plain speech."  I've
always contended that Williams had little to do with "plain speech," which
seems to me a hangover from Puritan times when our souls (like the economy
of a "rogue nation") were supposed to be transparent.

I was under the impression that the autobiographical free verse poems of
<i>Life Studies</i> were the clearest indication of the effect of the Beats
on Lowell's poetry, but the following suggests otherwise.  I trust any poet
who is honest about their conversions, including those who seem intent on
changing their mind if only to keep it alive.  The question, then, is how to
keep a <i>poem</i> alive -- here's one story (this could almost be a section
from Eileen Tabios's excellent, probably utterly forgotten, <i>Black
Lightning</i> -- look it up!).  I thought "Skunk Hour" was a fantastic poem
when growing up and still do:

<blockquote>“Skunk Hour” was begun in mid-August 1957 and finished about a
month later. In March of the same year, I had been giving readings on the
West Coast, often reading six days a week and sometimes twice on a single
day. I was in San Francisco, the era and setting of Allen Ginsberg and all
about, very modest poets were waking up prophets. I became sorely aware of
bow few poems I had written, and that these few had been finished at the
latest three or four years earlier. Their style seemed distant,
symbol-ridden, and willfully difficult. I began to paraphrase my Latin
quotations, and to add extra syllables to a line to make it clearer and more
colloquial. I felt my old poems hid what they were really about, and many
times offered a stiff, humorless, and even impenetrable surface. I am no
convert to the “beats.” I know well, too, that the best poems are not
necessarily poems that read aloud. Many of the greatest poems can only be
read to one’s self, for inspiration is no substitute for humor, shock,
narrative, and a hypnotic voice, the four musts for oral performance. Still,
my own poems seemed like prehistoric monsters dragged down into the bog and
death by their ponderous armor. I was reciting what I no longer felt. What
influenced me more than San Francisco and reading aloud was that for some
time I had been writing prose. I felt that the best style for poetry was
none of the many poetic styles in English, but something like the prose of
Chekhov or Flaubert.

When I returned to my home, I began writing lines in a new style. No poem,
however, got finished and soon I left off and tried to forget the whole
headache. Suddenly, in August, I was struck by the sadness of writing
nothing, and having nothing to write, of having, at least, no language. When
I began writing “Skunk Hour,” I felt that most of what I knew about writing
was a hindrance.</blockquote>

Here's a type of self-criticism that I would hope becomes addictive (not
least with me).  How many poets do you know who call their knowledge a
"hindrance"?  And if this is just a sign of manic depressiveness, then I
don't know what to say except the depths, at times, are productive of useful
confrontations with one's ego.  Is this the writing of a person who was tied
to (in Silliman's words) "presumptions about 'what poetry should be.'"
(BTW, Has anyone ever noticed how James Schuyler's elegy for Frank O'Hara,
"Buried At Springs," is practically indistinguishable, metrically and
tonally, from a <i>Life Studies</i> poem.  Sheik it out!)

Lastly, here is Lowell on the "poetry wars."  Reading the following gives me
the impression that Ron Silliman's contention that the "school of quietude"
is performing literary CPR by buttressing the collected Lowell -- they
probably are, but who cares? -- can be countered by a contention that
Silliman is performing a similar service -- by reviving the "poetry wars" he
and other "New Americans" (the values of the Language poets don't seem to
play a large role here) are able to don the old Cold War armor and appear
rather fresh again.  This is just a suspicion, and certainly there is no
reason to "care" about this either, but alas I can't get over the nagging
feeling that these forms of balkanization are stripping the poetry culture
of an ability to think subtly through complex issues.

<blockquote>A seemingly unending war has been going on for as long as I can
remember between Williams and his disciples and the principals and disciples
of another school of modern poetry. The Beats are on one side, the
university poets are on the other. Lately [in the sixties] the gunfire has
been hot. With such un likely Williams recruits as Karl Shapiro blasting
away, it has become unpleasant to stand in the middle in a position of
impartiality.

The war is an old one for me. In the late thirties, I was at Kenyon College
to study under John Crowe Ransom. The times hummed with catastrophe and
ideological violence, both political and aesthetical. The English
departments were clogged with worthy but outworn and backward-looking
scholars whose tastes in the moderns were most often superficial, random,
and vulgar. Students who wanted to write got little practical help from
their professors. They studied the classics as monsters that were slowly
losing their fur and feathers and leaking a little sawdust. What one did
oneself was all chance and shallowness, and no profession seemed wispier and
less needed than that of the poet. My own group, that of Tate and Ransom,
was all for the high discipline, for putting on the full armor of the past,
for making poetry something that would take a man’s full weight and that
would bear his complete intelligence, passion, and subtlety. Almost
anything, the Greek and Roman classics, Elizabethan dramatic poetry,
seventeenth-century metaphysical verse, old and modern critics,
aestheticians and philosophers, could be suppled up and again made
necessary. The struggle perhaps centered on making the old metrical forms
usable again to express the depths of one’s experience.

For us, Williams was of course part of the revolution that had renewed
poetry, but he was a byline. Opinions varied on his work. It was something
fresh, secondary, and minor, or it was the best that free verse could do. He
was the one writer with the substance, daring, and staying power to make the
short free-verse poem something considerable. One was shaken when the
radical conservative critic Yvor Winters spoke of Williams’s “By the road to
the contagious hospital” as a finer, more lasting piece of craftsmanship
than “Gerontion.”

Well, nothing will do for everyone. It’s hard for me to see how I and the
younger poets I was close to could at that time have learned much from
Williams. It was all we could do to keep alive and follow our own heavy
program. That time is gone, and now young poets are perhaps more conscious
of the burden and the hardening of this old formalism. Too many poems have
been written to rule. They show off their authors’ efforts and mind, but
little more. Often the culture seems to have passed them by. And, once more,
Dr. Williams is a model and a liberator. What will come, I don’t know.
Williams, unlike, say, Marianne Moore, seems to be one of those poets who
can be imitated anonymously. His style is almost a common style and even
what he claims for it—the American style. Somehow, written without his speed
and genius, the results are usually dull, a poem at best well-made but
without breath.</blockquote>

Lowell's Shakespearean approach to the culture wars -- he occupies the role
of Prospero in the staging of the Ariels vs. Calibans -- seems, to me, just
more trustworthy, at this moment in time (but also that), then the Leninist
mode of aligning forces around some perception of obdurate "class" values
(not to mention those of "nation") that are unclear even to those on which
you side.  Making your enemies out to be utter conformists while all your
buddies are free-thinking individualists just never struck me as a good
tactic.

I think it's a sign of the even-handedness of "madman" Lowell's approach
that he includes this anecdote about Yvor Winters, and it seems to me that
Lowell, if anything, hopes only to make this "war" tenable as something of
cultural value, were that possible, than to win it!  Such a dramatist's
flair would be welcome in Silliman's blog.  And sad to say, the final line
of this excerpt seems to me true of a lot of the writing that RS seems to
class under the "school" of plain speech -- few are able to maintain the
level of tension that appears in Williams' best work.  Silliman may be right
that there is a shipwreck occurring, but I'm not sure we are looking at the
right shore.

A Nation of Victims
Renana Brooks

The Nation

Renana Brooks, PhD, is a clinical psychologist practicing in
Washington, DC. She heads the Sommet Institute for the Study of Power
and Persuasion (http://www.sommetinstitute.org) and is completing a
book on the virtue myth and the conservative culture of domination.

George W Bush is generally regarded as a mangler of the English
language. What is overlooked is his mastery of emotional language --
especially negatively charged emotional language -- as a political
tool. Take a closer look at his speeches and public utterances, and
his political success turns out to be no surprise. It is the
predictable result of the intentional use of language to dominate
others.

President Bush, like many dominant personality types, uses
dependency-creating language. He employs language of contempt and
intimidation to shame others into submission and desperate
admiration. While we tend to think of the dominator as using physical
force, in fact most dominators use verbal abuse to control others.
Abusive language has been a major theme of psychological researchers
on marital problems, such as John Gottman, and of philosophers and
theologians, such as Josef Pieper. But little has been said about the
key role it has come to play in political discourse, and in such "hot
media" as talk radio and television.

Bush uses several dominating linguistic techniques to induce
surrender to his will. The first is empty language . This term refers
to broad statements that are so abstract and mean so little that they
are virtually impossible to oppose. Empty language is the emotional
equivalent of empty calories. Just as we seldom question the content
of potato chips while enjoying their pleasurable taste, recipients of
empty language are usually distracted from examining the content of
what they are hearing. Domina-tors use empty language to conceal
faulty generalizations; to ridicule viable alternatives; to attribute
negative motivations to others, thus making them appear contemptible;
and to rename and "reframe" opposing viewpoints. Bush's 2003 State of
the Union speech contained thirty-nine examples of empty language. He
used it to reduce complex problems to images that left the listener
relieved that George W Bush was in charge. Rather than explaining the
relationship between malpractice insurance and skyrocketing
healthcare costs, Bush summed up: "No one has ever been healed by a
frivolous lawsuit." The multiple fiscal and monetary policy tools
that can be used to stimulate an economy were downsized to: "The best
and fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax
it away in the first place." The controversial plan to wage another
war on Iraq was simplified to: "We will answer every danger and every
enemy that threatens the American people." In an earlier study, I
found that in the 2000 presidential debates Bush used at least four
times as many phrases containing empty language as Carter, Reagan,
Clinton, Bush Senior or Gore had used in their debates.

Another of Bush's dominant-language techniques is personalization .
By personalization I mean localizing the attention of the listener on
the speaker's personality. Bush projects himself as the only person
capable of producing results. In his post- 9/11 speech to Congress he
said, "I will not forget this wound to our country or those who
inflicted it. I will not yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in
waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American
people." He substitutes his determination for that of the nation's.
In the 2003 State of the Union speech he vowed, "I will defend the
freedom and security of the American people." Contrast Bush's "I will
not yield" etc. with John F: Kennedy's "Ask not what your country can
do for you, ask what you can do for your country."

The word "you" rarely appears in Bush's speeches. Instead, there are
numerous statements referring to himself or his personal
characteristics -- folksiness, confidence, righteous anger or
determination -- as the answer to the problems of the country. Even
when Bush uses "we," as he did many times in the State of the Union
speech, he does it in a way that focuses attention on himself. For
example, he stated: "Once again, we are called to defend the safety
of our people, and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this
responsibility."

In an article in the Jan. 16 New York Review of Books, Joan Didion
highlighted Bush's high degree of personalization and contempt for
argumentation in presenting his case for going to war in Iraq. As
Didion writes: "'I made up my mind,' he had said in April, 'that
Saddam needs to go.' This was one of many curious, almost petulant
statements offered in lieu of actually presenting a case. I've made
up my mind, I've said in speech after speech, I've made myself clear
. The repeated statements became their own reason."

Poll after poll demonstrates that Bush's political agenda is out of
step with most Americans' core beliefs. Yet the public, their
electoral resistance broken down by empty language and persuaded by
personalization, is susceptible to Bush's most frequently used
linguistic technique: negative framework . A negative framework is a
pessimistic image of the world. Bush creates and maintains negative
frameworks in his listeners' minds with a number of linguistic
techniques borrowed from advertising and hypnosis to instill the
image of a dark and evil world around us. Catastrophic words and
phrases are repeatedly drilled into the listener's head until the
opposition feels such a high level of anxiety that it appears
pointless to do anything other than cower.

Psychologist Martin Seligman, in his extensive studies of "learned
helplessness," showed that people's motivation to respond to outside
threats and problems is undermined by a belief that they have no
control over their environment. Learned helplessness is exacerbated
by beliefs that problems caused by negative events are permanent; and
when the underlying causes are perceived to apply to many other
events, the condition becomes pervasive and paralyzing.

Bush is a master at inducing learned helplessness in the electorate.
He uses pessimistic language that creates fear and disables people
from feeling they can solve their problems. In his September 20,
2001, speech to Congress on the 9/11 attacks, he chose to increase
people's sense of vulnerability:
"Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign,
unlike any other we have ever seen.... I ask you to live your lives,
and hug your children. I know many citizens have fears tonight.... Be
calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat."
(Subsequent terror alerts by the FBI, CIA and Department of Homeland
Security have maintained and expanded this fear of uknown, sinister
enemies.) Contrast this rhetoric with Franklin Roosevelt's speech
delivered the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He said:
"No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated
invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win
through to absolute victory.... There is no blinking at the fact that
our people, our territory and our interests are in grave danger. With
confidence in our armed forces -- with the unbounding determination
of our people -- we will gain the inevitable triumph -- so help us
God." Roosevelt focuses on an optimistic future rather than an
ongoing threat to Americans' personal survival.

All political leaders must define the present threats and problems
faced by the country before describing their approach to a solution,
but the ratio of negative to optimistic statements in Bush's speeches
and policy declarations is much higher, more pervasive and more
long-lasting than that of any other President. Let's compare "crisis"
speeches by Bush and Ronald Reagan, the President with whom he most
identifies himself. In Reagan's October 27, 1983, televised address
to the nation on the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut, he
used nineteen images of crisis and twenty-one images of optimism,
evenly balancing optimistic and negative depictions. He limited his
evaluation of the problems to the past and present tense, saying only
that "with patience and firmness we can bring peace to that
strife-torn region and make our own lives more secure." George W
Bush's October 7, 2002, major policy speech on Iraq, on the other
hand, began with forty-four consecutive statements referring to the
crisis and citing a multitude of possible catastrophic repercussions.
The vast majority of these statements for example: "Some ask how
urgent this danger is to America and the world. The danger is already
significant, and it only grows worse with time"; "Iraq could decide
on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a
terrorist group or individual terrorists") imply that the crisis will
last into the indeterminate future. There is also no specific plan of
action. The absence of plans is typical of a negative framework, and
leaves the listener without hope that the crisis will ever end.
Contrast this with Reagan, who, a third of the way into his
explanation of the crisis in Lebanon, asked the following: "Where do
we go from here? What can we do now to help Lebanon gain greater
stability so that our Marines can come home? Well, I believe we can
take three steps now that will make a difference."

To create a dependency dynamic between him and the electorate, Bush
describes the nation as being in a perpetual state of crisis and then
attempts to convince the electorate that it is powerless and that he
is the only one with the strength to deal with it. He attempts to
persuade people they must transfer power to him, thus crushing the
power of the citizen, the Congress, the Democratic Party, even
constitutional liberties, to concentrate all power in the imperial
presidency and the Republican Party.

Bush's political opponents are caught in a fantasy that they can win
against him simply by proving the superiority of their ideas.
However, people do not support Bush for the power of his ideas, but
out of the despair and desperation in their hearts. Whenever people
are in the grip of a desperate dependency, they won't respond to
rational criticisms of the people they are dependent on. They will
respond to plausible and forceful statements and alternatives that
put the American electorate back in touch with their core optimism.
Bush's opponents must combat his dark imagery with hope and restore
American vigor and optimism in the coming years. They should heed the
example of Reagan, who used optimism against Carter and the "national
malaise"; Franklin Roosevelt, who used it against Hoover and the
pessimism induced by the Depression ("the only thing we have to fear
is fear itself"); and Clinton (the "Man from Hope"), who used
positive language against the senior Bush's lack of vision. This is
the linguistic prescription for those who wish to retire Bush in 2004.

Me? I like best the super-wolves that were seen to cross the sun during the
earthquake at Palerno. They howled. Or the loves of the worlds. The howls of
the planets. I suppose deep-sea fishes have their noses bumped by cinders.
All sciences begin with the attempt to define. Nothing has ever been
defined. There is nothing to define. Darwin wrote _The Origin Of The
Species_. He was never able to define what he meant by "species". It is not
possible to define. Nothing has ever been finally found out. There is
nothing to find out - it's like looking for a needle that no one ever lost
in a haystack that never was stacked. But all scientific attempts really to
find out something, whereas really there is nothing to find out, are
attempts, themselves, really to be something. We are not realists nor
idealists we are intermediatists.

I think that one is likely to smile incredulously at the notion of blue
moons. NEVERTHELESS they were as common in 1883 as were green suns in 1883.
The Earth complained to Mars & swore a vast oath at us. Little frogs start
hopping - knowing no more what it's about than we do when we crawl to work
in the morning and hop away at night.

Bacteria could survive in what we call outer space, of which we know
nothing. If you'd like to have a chemist's opinion, even though it is only a
chemist's opinion, see the report of the meeting of the Royal Chemical
Society, April 2, 1903. If there were elements there could be a real science
of chemistry. A coin is condemned because it came from the same region from
which, a few years before, had come pottery that had become fraudulent. Hair
called real hair - then there are wigs. Teeth called real teeth - then there
are dentures. Official money - counterfeit money. Some third-rate scientist
comes out with an explanation of the vermiform appendix that would have been
acceptable to the biblical Moses. The twinkling of stars is the penetration
of light through something that quivers.

IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO SAY THE WHOLE SKY IS GELATINOUS: it seems more
acceptable to say only certain areas are gelatinous. It is safe to say most
of us are deep-sea fishes of a kind - iron, nickel, butter, paper, wool,
silk resin, beef, blood, and stone are these kinds of deep-sea fishes.
Lucifer never fell from the Heavens - there was Adam in the first place & a
human being attracts lightning - the lightning was seen and mistaken for a
falling angel when it was just Adam in the first place & a close call it was
with the lightning. Science relates to real knowledge no more than the
growth of a plant or the organization of a department store or the
development of a nation. I know of no difference between science and
Christian Science, a Lord Kelvin and a Mrs. Eddy. A Christian Scientist and
a toothache - neither exists in the final sense.

In 1859 the thing to do was to accept Darwinism but Darwinism was never
proved: the fittest survive. What is meant by the fittest? Not the
strongest, not the cleverest - weakness and stupidity everywhere survive.
There is no way of determining fitness except in that a thing does survive.
"Fitness", then, is only another name for "survival". Darwinism: that
survivors survive. Survival of the survivors. A cultural revolution ignited
by a tautology. The little harlots will caper and freaks will distract
attention and clowns will break the rhythm of the whole with their
buffooneries - but the solidity of the procession as a whole and the
impressiveness of things that pass and pass and pass will keep on and keep
on and keep on coming.

Venus de Milo - to a child she is repellent. Never has a chemical law,
without exception, been discovered - chemistry is continuous with astronomy
physics biology. For instance, if the sun should greatly change its distance
from the Earth the familiar chemic formulas would no longer work out. There
is only in human experience intermediateness to harmony and discord. Harmony
is that besides which there are no outside forces. All biologic phenomena
act to adjust - there are no biologic actions other than adjustment. As
distinct from vegetables, animals do not exist. Newton's three laws, or
three attempts to break continuity, are as unreal as all other attempts to
localize the universal. Newton's three laws are three articles of faith.
Demons and angels and inertias and reactions are all mythological
characters.

If there are cats, they're only an emphasis upon universal felinity. If
everything else is variable, the notion of gravitation as fixed and
formulable is only another attempted positivism. Though gravitation may
approximate higher to invariability than do the winds, it must be somewhere
between the absolutes of stability and instability. The language of
physicists and astronomers is the language of expiring sibilations.
Astronomers are mercantile purists who would deny commercial vagabondage.
Astronomy is a phantom-film distended with myth-stuff. In a real existence,
such a quasi-system of fables as the science of chemistry could not deceive
for a moment - but that in an existence attempting to become real, it
represents that attempt.

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list carries
about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these subscribers do not
necessarily receive messages at any given time. A good number of other
people read the Poetics List via our web archives (see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that
are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to
the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible.  We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature
of this project, and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. For
subscription information or to contact the moderators, write to
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be posted
to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the list
membership to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and two messages
per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that we
employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed
after having been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that
basis; however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between this
and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to be read and approved
before being forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option, as it
hampers the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition
to these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for moderators'
approval before being forwarded to the list. We remain committed to this
editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this list have
forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide by list policies as
stated in this Welcome message. While we adhere to a practice of not
discussing particular cases on the list, the areas of our greatest concern
include flaming of other list subscribers, including the list owners,
and/or giving us false registration information. Please note some
individuals have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames of the
list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what is necessary to preserve
this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has always been
private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers and
series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC (http://epc.buffalo.edu)
and at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts
to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide your
full name, street address, email address, and telephone number. All posts
to the list should provide your full real name, as registered. If there is
any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the "from" line of
the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All
subscription-related information and correspondence remains absolutely
confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions about
subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or subscription
policy, should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increased
quota from your system administrator.  You might also consider obtaining a
commercial account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting
the moderators at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-----------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's individual
posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without the
text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in HTML
format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics
html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account may become
flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail.

-----------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then return to
your new address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
to resubscribe. If you find that it is not possible to unsub using your old
address, please contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for
assistance.

--------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political activism,
film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel free to query the
list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions
to the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications and
reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this list.
Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-------------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In this
category are included messages gratuitously attacking fellow listees or the
list owners, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or cause the list
to reach its daily limit. These messages are considered offensive and
detrimental to list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be removed from the
list immediately. Please do not put this policy to test.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted messages
to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent in
Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long documents
(1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments will be presumed
to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of the
author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for all
material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from this list
and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day from
any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see if
it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not posted
there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

  SIX FEET UNDER
TEAR ME UP TEAR ME DOWN
Curator Amy Davila
Assistant Curator Tairone Bastien

Since its inception in 2000, the Six Feet Under series has offered
viewers a new vantage point into the White Box space, a unique
perspective of its subterranean architecture and alternative direction.
By closing the doors and installing work that can only be viewed through
the 26th Street window, passersby are invited to see the space as an
excavated site, a submerged container beneath the sidewalk, and
understand White Box as an "underground" and insurgent agent operating
within the commercial art environment of Chelsea.

Tear me Up Tear me Down is the fourth installment of the series and will
occur in the midst of the reconstruction of the building that houses the
gallery.  The exhibition will introduce the idea of the "cover-up," the
act of concealment, and the process of change through destruction and
remaking.  As a mask and mirror of the disarray of reconstruction behind
the façade, the exhibition will screen viewers from what lies beneath.
The window becomes a stage and the artists' installation the ruse.

Six galleries were asked to select six artists each of whom will create
a six-day installation within the window space at White Box. These
artists will work with the curators in actualizing their work within the
on-going process of the building's reconstruction. As each artist tears
down the old installation to put up a new one, the audience is invited
to witness the process.  Tear me Up Tear me Down examines the issues
surrounding renewal both literally and figuratively and puts into
perspective the reality of change.

West Coast's Legendary Bookpeople Hopes to Halt Southward Turn


The bug that has bitten LPC and a host of other small and mid-size
intermediaries has stung Oakland's Bookpeople, which is working
frenetically to complete a restructuring plan by Friday. Without the
money, the West Coast institution could be forced to file for Chapter
11.

The cash would come from investment firm St. Cloud Capital, which has
agreed to provide new financing for Bookpeople as long as the wholesaler
can significantly reduce its debt to publishers. To do that, Stephen
Kerr, a financial consultant brought in by Bookpeople nine months ago,
has asked publishers to accept an agreement that would pay them 50% of
what they're owed on invoices between 91 and 180 days old, and 25% on
invoices over 180 days. All invoices less than 90 days will be paid in
full.

At the end of June, Kerr sent letters to 430 publishers; about 65% have
already agreed to the new terms, with the consent of roughly another 60,
or 15%, needed by Friday to secure the St. Cloud cash infusion.

Publishers are mixed on the company's efforts. One house, Boston's Red
Wheel/Weisser, says it remains optimistic. "I tend to be bullish. We
still see Bookpeople as a valuable and vital supplier of books to the
West Coast," says the house's Michael Kerber, who made good on his
optimism by signing on as one of the wholesaler's featured publishers.

But another publisher, Berkeley's Ronin, says that at the end of 2002 it
pulled out most of its stock from the firm's warehouse and didn't have
any great hopes "It got to the point where they could barely even get us
$200," says publisher Beverly Potter, "and we realized if a creditor
came in to their warehouse we would be out of business." She adds that,
"The thing about Bookpeople is they do some things very well and some
things very poorly They're really good at packing books and hardly ever
make a mistake. But when it comes to paperwork? Ridiculous." Still,
Potter says she signed the letter because she had nothing to lose.

If the money comes through, Bookpeople says that in addition to paying
down debts, it will use the new funds to upgrade its backoffice
operations and to help it move into new retail accounts.

 In his letter, Kerr blamed the sluggish book market and loss of
independent booksellers as the main reasons for the wholesaler's plight.
Kerber agreed. "This says a lot less about Bookpeople than [it does] the
times," he says.-Steven Zeitchik and Jim Milliot

Reading at Remote!


Portraits at Other Sides:

Tuesday, July 15th at Remote Lounge, 327 Bowery above 2nd St.  Doors will
open at 7pm, the event will start at 7:30.  There is a $5 cover.

The readers are:

Samuel Delany
Alan Sondheim
Rob Stephenson
Tom Zummer
Ellen Zweig

Portraits From Other Sides:

Rob Stephenson presents an evening of text, sex, video, a philosophical
dog, and maybe robots with Ellen Zweig, Alan Sondheim, Tom Zummer and
special guest Samuel R. Delany.


Remote Lounge is a revolutionary new concept in nightlife entertainment.
Located in downtown Manhattan, it is a technology-themed cocktail lounge
and new media art space unlike anything else in the world. The lounge is
outfitted with over 60 video cameras - covering every square foot of the
space from multiple angles - and this live video is displayed on over 100
output devices, such as CRTs, LCDs, large format plasma screens and video
projectors. Into this mix of live feeds are an ever-changing roster of
digital and analog video artworks, animation, special effects, web-based
art and interactive multimedia created by both emerging and established
new media artists.


Samuel R Delany is a writer and literary critic. Delany is best known for
writing extensively in the mainstream science fiction and fantasy genres.
He has won four Nebula Awards.  The best-selling novel. Dhalgren, has sold
over a million copies.  He is also the author of a number of fictional and
autobiographical works that include references to extreme aspects of human
sexuality.  His most recent novel is The Madman.

Tom Zummer studied philosophy under Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida,
and is an artist and curator.  "Zummer's uncanny portraits of robots are
beautiful and out of this world.  He is also a theorist, book designer,
professor, and comic art novelist, Zummer's artistic talents are as
eclectic as they are numerous."  The Austin Chronicle

Alan Sondheim is a writer/multimedia theorist (editor of Being On Line).
Alan is a poet and critic who writes on and about the Internet.  His books
include Disorders of the Real, and the anthology Being on Line.  He
co-moderates several email lists, including Fiction of Philosophy,
Cybermind, and Cyberculture.  He was also virtual writer-in-residence for
the trAce (sic) online writing community at the beginning of this year; he
worked on a number of collaborative projects at The Lost Project at trAce,
and his trAce projects are collected in their Writers-in-Residence
archives.

Ellen Zweig is an artist who works with video, audio, installation and
performance.  Her most recent work is the video series, HEAP, a collection
of experimental portraits of Westerners who have studied, invented,
misunderstood and loved China.  "(tongue tongue stone) G. W. Leibnitz"
premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam, 2003.  In her
installations, Zweig has used optics to create camera obscuras, video
projection devices, and miniature projected illusions.  She has also
created multi-channel video installations that have toured the US (museums
include: New Mexico Museum of Fine Art in Santa Fe, List Center for the
Visual Arts at MIT, Scottsdale Center for the Arts, P.S. 1 in New York).

Rob Stephenson's writing has been published both on and offline in a wide
variety of publications, recently including the Blithe House Quarterly,
Dangerous Families, Velvet Mafia, Please Records, and Perspectives on Evil
and Human Wickedness.  He designs a continuing series of chapbooks that
feature his poetry, essays, stories, artwork, and photography.  Some of
his short films were shown at the International Film Festival in Seoul
Korea this year.  His drawings have been exhibited at the Intersection Art
Gallery in San Francisco, the Headlands Center for the Arts, the Katona
Museum, and the Wexner Museum.

All,

here is some info on a great show up in western MA...


http://www.petergregorio.com/


July 2003: Exhibition at the Northampton Center for the Arts, Northampton,
MA

Peter Gregorio will be showing the ten Nepal paintings and the Civilization
paintings.

Exhibition Dates: July 7-28, Hours M-F 10-3pm and by request
Artist Reception: Sunday, July 20th, 5-7pm.
Northampton Center for the Arts
17 New South St. Suite 303

The Work of Peter Gregorio

It is fitting that Peter Gregorio works on such a large scale; fitting
because his paintings, ranging in size from the 6ft by 6ft Nepal series to
the massive 14ft by 8ft paintings in his Civilization series, are both
informed by and respond to architecture. However, the architectural
structures in Gregorio's work, whether mysterious descending stairs and
shadowed façades or the temples and alleyways of India and Nepal, engender a
tactility missing from much representational painting. Rather than rendering
a particular building with mathematical precision, he has chosen to enliven
the sometimes-ineffable experience of looking at architecture. Gregorio
works through the intersection of the actual world and the abstractions we
apply to it. The paintings achieve a compelling duality through the use of
foundational color fields, which simultaneously form the background and fill
in much of the depicted structures. All of the shapes, forms and patterns
carry something of the whole of each work, creating a balanced visual
harmony. One senses the breath of the artist in the subtle expansions and
contractions of his lines. Everything here seems to hum, while numerous
directional imperatives send one at once across and into the depths of the
canvas. There is a static-free motion to these works, a motion complicated
by the inclusion, within a single painting, of the light from both different
seasons and multiple hours of the day. This lends the paintings a
peripatetic and rejuvenescent quality as they interact with the light from
their surroundings, further mirroring the experience one has while observing
architecture. Here, then, is the successful re-creation of the artist's
perception, allowing one to intimately enter into the open-ended meaning of
a reverent moment.

Dear listers,

I am planning to teach Stein's "Pink Melon Joy" as part of a seminar next

literature on that particular poem.

Many thanks in advance!

Well Joe, I think you have alot right. What I took issue with was your
condemnation of the white working middle as the real bigots, since they don't
pull the strings of military, media & international trade. Not apologizing or
justifying their intolerance- just not letting the real culprit off the hook.

Of course all working class people don't vote Republican. I thought we were
talking about whitey. The "poor, forgotten" were your words, not mine. I would
agree with your assessment of class shift.

What puzzles me is how Joel can think "you have it right." While I am in 100%
agreement with the last half of your post, this thread started because I
responded to Joel's reference to "the Nader incident" & his plea for a
Democrat, any Democrat at any cost. Joel believes that if a Republican
wins "the nation will be controlled by corporations." I say that has been our
miserable now, not our scary future.I cited Al Gore as dirty business
posterboy. Clinton too. Maybe it sounded better when you said it.

So rock on, Joe. Joel, what's the story?

This is wonderful. I have never witnessed a melon osculate, though I have
heard others claim, particulary in summer fields at night, especially
adjacent with fields with tall wands of corn offering secondary reflections
of moonlight, you can literally see a melon's skin ripple while the body
grows and becomes more round in its various diameters.
Ah, and it's so nice to read prose entirely unselfconscious of cellulite and
all the Po Mo detritus that interrupts 'discourse' into the blind pleasure
of a "plump melonous hemisphere."

Thanks, Mr. Gudding, for interrupting the morning labors - tapping away at a
plastic keyboard - with this lovely, fleshy 'distraction.' !

Tom Bell,
Your post of Renana Brooks' essay "A Nation of Victims," is excellent.
Maybe not doing it justice here with a quick cut-up I made for writing/poem
I doing now, but thought I'd share it anyway.  The Brooks' essay is right up
my alley.  For "Poetics," my own problem is how to make such cut-up
"poetry," how to not try so hard to begin with, and how to make some kind of
decent writing out of the simple, natural impulses.  Or something like
that...  Note the substitution of "poetical" for "political" in line 2.
Does that get the writing/"poem" off to a bad start right from the get-go?
And does it constrict the "point-of-view," the "You," and then the reader
(now the reader is a body of poets instead of a body of, say, voters or
other middle class citizens) and thus by constricting the reader to "poets"
blow its range?

You will be told that he's already made up his mind,
that his poetical failure turns out to be no surprise,
that his is the dominant personality
type or that his is a dominator emotional language,
mastery, hot media marital concealing of faulty Union speech,
empty language, including thirty-nine examples that I will not yield,
personalization, core beliefs, and contempt for argumentation, that curious
almost petulant substitutes ask what you can do for your nations, that
multiple fiscal and monetary policy tools used to stimulate
an economy of learned helplessness and speech after speech
and hyponosis and advertizing and emotional language were used, too,
that the condition becomes pervasive and paralyzing and overlooked,
that the repeated statements became their own electoral resistance, that
once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people and
the hopes of all mankind, folksiness, confidence, determination, and
catastrophic words and phrases repeatedly drilled into the listener's head,
and
that Saddamn needs to go, that he's made himself clear.

Tom Bell's post:
A Nation of Victims Renana Brooks
The Nation
Renana Brooks, PhD, is a clinical psychologist practicing in Washington, DC.
She heads the Sommet Institute for the Study of Power and Persuasion
(<http://www.sommetinstitute.org>) and is completing a book on the virtue
myth and the conservative culture of domination.
George W Bush is generally regarded as a mangler of the English language.
What is overlooked is his mastery of emotional language -- especially
negatively charged emotional language -- as a political tool. Take a closer
look at his speeches and public utterances, and his political success turns
out to be no surprise. It is the predictable result of the intentional use
of language to dominate others.
President Bush, like many dominant personality types, uses
dependency-creating language. He employs language of contempt and
intimidation to shame others into submission and desperate admiration. While
we tend to think of the dominator as using physical force, in fact most
dominators use verbal abuse to control others. Abusive language has been a
major theme of psychological researchers on marital problems, such as John
Gottman, and of philosophers and theologians, such as Josef Pieper. But
little has been said about the key role it has come to play in political
discourse, and in such "hot media" as talk radio and television.
Bush uses several dominating linguistic techniques to induce surrender to
his will. The first is empty language . This term refers to broad statements
that are so abstract and mean so little that they are virtually impossible
to oppose. Empty language is the emotional equivalent of empty calories.
Just as we seldom question the content of potato chips while enjoying their
pleasurable taste, recipients of empty language are usually distracted from
examining the content of what they are hearing. Domina-tors use empty
language to conceal faulty generalizations; to ridicule viable alternatives;
to attribute negative motivations to others, thus making them appear
contemptible; and to rename and "reframe" opposing viewpoints. Bush's 2003
State of the Union speech contained thirty-nine examples of empty language.
He used it to reduce complex problems to images that left the listener
relieved that George W Bush was in charge. Rather than explaining the
relationship between malpractice insurance and skyrocketing healthcare
costs, Bush summed up: "No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit."
The multiple fiscal and monetary policy tools that can be used to stimulate
an economy were downsized to: "The best and fairest way to make sure
Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place." The
controversial plan to wage another war on Iraq was simplified to: "We will
answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people." In
an earlier study, I found that in the 2000 presidential debates Bush used at
least four times as many phrases containing empty language as Carter,
Reagan, Clinton, Bush Senior or Gore had used in their debates.
Another of Bush's dominant-language techniques is personalization . By
personalization I mean localizing the attention of the listener on the
speaker's personality. Bush projects himself as the only person capable of
producing results. In his post- 9/11 speech to Congress he said, "I will not
forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it. I will not
yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in waging this struggle for
freedom and security for the American people." He substitutes his
determination for that of the nation's. In the 2003 State of the Union
speech he vowed, "I will defend the freedom and security of the American
people." Contrast Bush's "I will not yield" etc. with John F: Kennedy's "Ask
not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."

The word "you" rarely appears in Bush's speeches. Instead, there are
numerous statements referring to himself or his personal characteristics --
folksiness, confidence, righteous anger or determination -- as the answer to
the problems of the country. Even when Bush uses "we," as he did many times
in the State of the Union speech, he does it in a way that focuses attention
on himself. For example, he stated: "Once again, we are called to defend the
safety of our people, and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this
responsibility."
In an article in the Jan. 16 New York Review of Books, Joan Didion
highlighted Bush's high degree of personalization and contempt for
argumentation in presenting his case for going to war in Iraq. As Didion
writes: "'I made up my mind,' he had said in April, 'that Saddam needs to
go.' This was one of many curious, almost petulant statements offered in
lieu of actually presenting a case. I've made up my mind, I've said in
speech after speech, I've made myself clear . The repeated statements became
their own reason."
Poll after poll demonstrates that Bush's political agenda is out of step
with most Americans' core beliefs. Yet the public, their electoral
resistance broken down by empty language and persuaded by personalization,
is susceptible to Bush's most frequently used linguistic technique: negative
framework . A negative framework is a pessimistic image of the world. Bush
creates and maintains negative frameworks in his listeners' minds with a
number of linguistic techniques borrowed from advertising and hypnosis to
instill the image of a dark and evil world around us. Catastrophic words and
phrases are repeatedly drilled into the listener's head until the opposition
feels such a high level of anxiety that it appears pointless to do anything
other than cower.
Psychologist Martin Seligman, in his extensive studies of "learned
helplessness," showed that people's motivation to respond to outside threats
and problems is undermined by a belief that they have no control over their
environment. Learned helplessness is exacerbated by beliefs that problems
caused by negative events are permanent; and when the underlying causes are
perceived to apply to many other events, the condition becomes pervasive and
paralyzing.
Bush is a master at inducing learned helplessness in the electorate. He uses
pessimistic language that creates fear and disables people from feeling they
can solve their problems. In his September 20, 2001, speech to Congress on
the 9/11 attacks, he chose to increase people's sense of vulnerability:
"Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any
other we have ever seen.... I ask you to live your lives, and hug your
children. I know many citizens have fears tonight.... Be calm and resolute,
even in the face of a continuing threat." (Subsequent terror alerts by the
FBI, CIA and Department of Homeland Security have maintained and expanded
this fear of uknown, sinister enemies.) Contrast this rhetoric with Franklin
Roosevelt's speech delivered the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor. He said: "No matter how long it may take us to overcome this
premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win
through to absolute victory.... There is no blinking at the fact that our
people, our territory and our interests are in grave danger. With confidence
in our armed forces -- with the unbounding determination of our people -- we
will gain the inevitable triumph -- so help us God." Roosevelt focuses on an
optimistic future rather than an ongoing threat to Americans' personal
survival.
All political leaders must define the present threats and problems faced by
the country before describing their approach to a solution, but the ratio of
negative to optimistic statements in Bush's speeches and policy declarations
is much higher, more pervasive and more long-lasting than that of any other
President. Let's compare "crisis" speeches by Bush and Ronald Reagan, the
President with whom he most identifies himself. In Reagan's October 27,
1983, televised address to the nation on the bombing of the US Marine
barracks in Beirut, he used nineteen images of crisis and twenty-one images
of optimism, evenly balancing optimistic and negative depictions. He limited
his evaluation of the problems to the past and present tense, saying only
that "with patience and firmness we can bring peace to that strife-torn
region and make our own lives more secure." George W Bush's October 7, 2002,
major policy speech on Iraq, on the other hand, began with forty-four
consecutive statements referring to the crisis and citing a multitude of
possible catastrophic repercussions. The vast majority of these statements
for example: "Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world.
The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with time"; "Iraq
could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to
a terrorist group or individual terrorists") imply that the crisis will last
into the indeterminate future. There is also no specific plan of action. The
absence of plans is typical of a negative framework, and leaves the listener
without hope that the crisis will ever end. Contrast this with Reagan, who,
a third of the way into his explanation of the crisis in Lebanon, asked the
following: "Where do we go from here? What can we do now to help Lebanon
gain greater stability so that our Marines can come home? Well, I believe we
can take three steps now that will make a difference."
To create a dependency dynamic between him and the electorate, Bush
describes the nation as being in a perpetual state of crisis and then
attempts to convince the electorate that it is powerless and that he is the
only one with the strength to deal with it. He attempts to persuade people
they must transfer power to him, thus crushing the power of the citizen, the
Congress, the Democratic Party, even constitutional liberties, to
concentrate all power in the imperial presidency and the Republican Party.
Bush's political opponents are caught in a fantasy that they can win against
him simply by proving the superiority of their ideas. However, people do not
support Bush for the power of his ideas, but out of the despair and
desperation in their hearts. Whenever people are in the grip of a desperate
dependency, they won't respond to rational criticisms of the people they are
dependent on. They will respond to plausible and forceful statements and
alternatives that put the American electorate back in touch with their core
optimism. Bush's opponents must combat his dark imagery with hope and
restore American vigor and optimism in the coming years. They should heed
the example of Reagan, who used optimism against Carter and the "national
malaise"; Franklin Roosevelt, who used it against Hoover and the pessimism
induced by the Depression ("the only thing we have to fear is fear itself");
and Clinton (the "Man from Hope"), who used positive language against the
senior Bush's lack of vision. This is the linguistic prescription for those
who wish to retire Bush in 2004. -- Rita R. Handrich, PhD

9 - 16 July (Opening Wed. 9 July, 6 - 8pm)

SIX FEET UNDER
TEAR ME UP TEAR ME DOWN
Curator Amy Davila

Jon Routson

 From T3 to Justin and Kelly, Jon Routson will present his own bootleged
copies of 6 summer blockbusters revealing the barrier between the
audience and the fictional world on film.  Each day a different
bootlegged film will be screened and will offer us a unique view of that
particular story and character's artifice.  Meanwhile the suspension of
our disbelief is pulled down by the sights and sounds of the recorded
audience.  Watch every day as one of our most coveted forms of escapism
collapses before your eyes!

Nice Steve.  In the past I've tried to turn stuff like this into poetry but
the problem has been readers don't understand it, I think.

Does anyone know if the Berkeley journal SYLLOGISM is
still functioning (with forthcoming issues)?

SYLLOGISM No. 5, which I just got from SPD and which
is listed as a 2002 publication in SPD's listings,
gives 2001 as the date in their frontispiece.

Thanks.

In fact it was Clinton/Gore that gave us the heinous Telecommunications Act,
from which Clinton--after the FCC recently stoked it up--now seems to be
backing away, now that it's too late. There are several democrats for whom I
couldn't vote. Joe Leiberman is one, as he's too far to the right.
 However, Frank, what's your solution? If you have one I'm willing to
listen.

I wish I was still east for this...
used to love that album. Was a nice foil for William Blake
and, hell, my southern friends tell me I sound a lot like EC
(and they don't generally mean it as a compliment!)...
but it's even harder logistically to get 4 people 3000 miles
than it is one person...

but, hey, i'm sure you'll find somebody....
Do you know National Stranger (Jed Boyar the singer is friends
with Mike Scharf and Alissa Quart I think if you're in touch with them)?
I'm not in touch with many NYC people these days (alas)...
He might be great for the show if you can get him.

Maybe I'll be able to think of more folks.
Hell, Kristen Stuart (who played Anne Sexton in our Anne Sexton thing
a few years back) might work too...

Tom, this was fascinating.  I think it's right on the nose.  I hadn't
considered the rhetoric.  There is a sense in Brooks' article that Bush is
doing all this quite consciously.  I wonder how much of it is.  It seems
to me that this could also just be his way of handling things, or his
temperament.  He does seem terrified (Bush), and maybe this is what
accounts for the drinking.  He perhaps does feel overwhelmed.  The article
gives a good clear handle on this guy.  I'm especially impressed by his
use of "I," and his use of empty phrases, as you put it.  What doesn't
square with this is that I don't think he abuses his own family, and a
real dominator would do that.  His wife always looks happy and well-taken
care of -- and clearly likes the man much more than say Clinton's wife
likes her man.  She is a librarian, and I really like librarians,
generally.

When you look at the examples of empty language that she offers, -- they
don't seem EXACTLY empty.  For instance, he says that we shouldn't tax
money away in the first place. Isn't that fairly precise?  When he's
talking about frivolous lawsuit, that too has a clear image at least to my
mind.  So I wasn't sure what she meant by empty language.  When he says WE
will answer every danger to America, it contradicts both of her charges --
one that he only uses the term I, and the other that he uses empty
phrases.  It doesn't seem empty.  What he means though is that he might
just overdo it on answering any given charge -- but he did invade
Afghanistan, and now has invaded Iraq.  Is she saying that he won't back
up anything, or substantiate anything he says?  To me, his language is if
anything too down to earth, too simple, and perhaps is lacking in a sense
of the long-term.  Now that we're bogged down in Iraq, and as Stephen
Vincent says, in a very vulnerable position (it's not too hard to spot an
American and kill her or him) -- I wonder how long this is going to last.
And if we pull out suddenly -- there's going to be a disastrous power
vaccuum, just as everyone predicted.

I don't think you can teach 500 years of democratic philosophy -- from the
Reformation through John Locke, Madison, etc. etc. in five years.  Not
that I have an answer.

At any rate, although I think that there is some fishy rhetoric in this
article (she uses simply and to empty synonymously), it was still a good
thing to draw the attention toward.  I think she's right that he does
catastrophize and then say he is the only one who can deal with it.

But I have to say that I can almost never understand anything any
politician says.  Everything is couched and painfully gone over by a
thousand coaches and so on until what it means is so bleached out that
nothing is left.  Carter was really bad with this.  I could never figure
out what he was talking about -- but I did like the smile.

In Europe there are many more meetings between the press and the
politicos, and you get a real feel for what they are saying, and what they
think.  In Finland, for instance, the right winger Toni the Hammer (a
former professional wrestler) just calls the president Tarja Halonen "that
lesbo."  Then the next day he apologises.  Nobody would make such a
blundering mistake here.  In France -- even Le Pen can speak clearly and
well.  For some reason I can't ever understand what our politicians are
saying, even though this is my language.

More studies like the one you quoted would draw the public's attention to
these obfuscations.  Thanks!

Okay Joel. You win. I assume you're playing games with me now. You can't be
this scattered in your stance & be serious. The joke's on me.

I don't have an A#1 solution. What I offered was possibilities. I'm glad you're
willing to listen, because it seems you haven't been. If you had, you wouldn't
be schooling me on Clinton/Gore at this stage of the correspondence. Re-read
the posts. Sayonara. Good luck.

Kazim,

I think that you should be the judge!

I don't have the Anne Finch book in my library to get all the rules of
the ghazal form, so I looked it up, and here's a web-link:

http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~navin/india/songs/ghalib/ghazal.def.html

I almost always screw up something in those addresses, but there is a
good definition of the Urdu ghazal in there.  He claims you can write a
ghazal in any language.

Personally, I think a perverse simplification is ok, but Kazim's the
judge, or the not-judge.  Once he judges, we can then judge his judging,
and then he can judge our judgment, and so on.  Maybe he can dump the
judging off on somebody else that questions his rules.  I am only too
happy to do this to him!

Whatever.  Why not stick with the July 24th deadline (midnight just
before the 25th), unless he says otherwise.  Right now I don't think we
have any ghazals that absolutely match the rules, so that if anybody
were to go through and actually make all the rules function perfectly in
their ghazal they would probably be the de facto winner.  Following all
these rules is a headache but I guess that's the poem in this case. It
is afterall a different world, and a different form could give you
insight into that world.  Or not.

I recently read in a local alternative rag that some physicians have
evidence that new weapons were used by the US in the invasion of Iraq.
Their evidence is DU (depleted uranium) concentrations in water sources
10-1000 times higher than anything ever reported from the use of the DU
shells used in Gulf War I and Kosovo.  DU weapons proved to be a rather
sneaky way for the US Military to get rid of nuclear waste (320+ tons of DU
were deposited during Gulf War I).  And a sneaky way of waging nuclear war,
since radioactive emissions are part of the weapons' lethality.  As many of
you know, DU is the likely causative suspect in Gulf War Syndrome.

Has anyone else stumbled across such information or might know who to ask?
If the concentrations are higher, then possibly the weaponry has changed,
and possibly the volume of DU deposited during this war was much larger than
the last.

Kirby,
     I don't want to take credit for this as it was really copyrighted
reporting on some research which I posted from another list.  I assume it
was okay to do so but if I erred I apologize - I'm not sure what th
guidelines are here.  I guess I should have used fair use quotes from the
original research?

     But to get to the content of your reply, GB is clearly diagnosable but
I hesitate to do so because it's not appropriate to base a disgnosis on
printed speeches which he may not have written.  I do think if you go to the
journals you will be seeing other analyses appearing in the near future but
these are more social psychological research rather than clinical
assessment.

   I think another related issue has just arisen related to deniabilty of
statements made in his state of the union?

Dear friends,

This is by way of requesting your support and help for some friends of ours.

They have just learned disturbing news concerning their adoption of an 8-month-old
baby girl they're in the process of adopting. She was due to come home with them
to the US with them sometime this summer. However, the Guatemalan government
has placed an unofficial "freeze" on all adoptions, while it attempts to change the
laws governing adoption in its country.

This means the following:

     1) no adoptive U.S. parents will be allowed to go to Guatemala to bring their
         babies home.

    2) the babies, now living with nurturing foster families, may be taken from those
        families and placed in orphanages.

Their lawyer has asked them to ask everyone they know to send the following letter
to their U.S. Senators and Representative. I did so this morning, and Lynda will be
doing so later on. You'll need to insert your name in the signature. (FYI -- some
Senators and Representatives have websites; if not, please send via U.S. mail.)
See letter below.

Thank you very much.

July 8, 2003

Dear :

I am contacting you concerning the current instability in the processing of intercountry
adoptions from Guatemala.  I have friends who have been in the process of adopting
a little girl from Guatemala for over a year. We understand that, as a result of changes
in Guatemala, adoptions have been suspended, albeit unofficially, by the new Central
Authority in Guatemala (the PGN)  purportedly until new guidelines meeting requirements
for the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption can be established.

I am soliciting your assistance in urging a timely resolution to this situation.

I specifically request that:

(1) You request that the Department Of State act on behalf of U.S. citizens to request
that all adoption cases in which the Power of Attorney was signed prior to July 1, 2003,
be processed under existing Guatemalan law as enacted by the Guatemalan Congress,
rather than under the new PGN requirements which are intended to implement the Hague
Convention.

(2) You request that the DOS assert “third party status” in the application of the Hague
Convention on Intercountry Adoption by Guatemala until the US has acceded to this treaty.

(3) You lobby the DOS and Consul General’s office in Guatemala to arrange meetings
between U.S. Embassy officials, delegates from the Hague, PGN representatives, Guatemalan
adoption attorneys, adoption professionals, and private hogar (orphanage) directors.  In my
estimation, these meetings should serve to facilitate communication among all concerned parties
in order to develop and apply regulations and policies that are reasonable and consistent with
Guatemalan law and culture, that honor the purpose of the Hague Convention, and that truly
promote the best interest of Guatemalan children.  The Consul General can be reached at:

Mr. Michael J. Jacobsen, Consul General
United States Embassy - Guatemala
Avenida Reforma 7-01, Zona 10
Guatemala City, Guatemala
Phone:  011+502-331-1541
Fax:      011+502-331-0564

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Nouveau Salon

New Work by ArtSalon at the Whitney Mansion

If Los Angeles is the home of showy glamour (but alas shallow) and San
Francisco its bohemian stepsister (sometimes a bit too raggedy) then how
do we get our glam fix here? Our glamour has to be edged with some
deeper meaning--fine art, literature and real conversation. Join
ArtSalonSF, the notorious unbohemian conglomeration of the New
Bohemians, for a deeply glamorous evening of fine art and entertainment
at the Whitney Mansion. Entertainment includes belly dancing by Roz, a
reading by young literati Sasha Cagen, Daniel Cochnear and Jenny Bitner,
live music from Evidence of the King and hors  d'oeuvres. Dazzling
attire or attitude encouraged.

***The War Room/The War Ruin***

As the stunted attention-span of the mainstream-media loses focus on the
remains of "Battlefield Iraq" we felt a place was needed to retain the
memories and feelings of anyone affected by war(potentially anyone).

We created this webpage of war and ruin for your input.

http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/warroom/

Please:
Your experience of war from home or abroad/ Your experience of ruin from
home or abroad/ Have you participated in a war?/ Have you participated
in the ruin of a country?/ Have you ever killed?/ Have you been
wounded?/ Have you lived in a ruined country?/ Would you be willing to
sacrifice your life for your country?/ Do you believe that someone who
does not support the head of your country is a traitor?/ Is your country
at peace?/Is your country at war?/ Do you believe suicide bombers are
cowards?

They're rounding up people in Oak Lawn, IL . . . twenty-five miles or so =
from where I live. Seems that it's now illegal to print anti-government =
newspapers and possess so-called 'secret' cameras. I've stashed my =
secret camera collection somewhere that the Feds will never find it. =
Behind my bookshelf.=20

An Arabic man was arrested and is being held, not for espionage, but for =
disagreeing with U.S. foreign policy and printing a newspaper that says =
as much. As soon as the redneck think-tank can figure out that funny =
squiggly language there'll be hell to pay.

Also, I read this morning in the news that the current administration is =
seeking a Hollywood make-over in time for Georgie's reelection bid. =
Seems that the rest of the world somehow has the idea that the U.S. is =
populated by stupid, illiterate rednecks. How on earth did they ever get =
that idea? Stay tuned to see Bush reach out to the impoverished of this =
world to convince us all that he's really just a snuggle-poo.=20

If you are not a registered voter at this point do so now. The lunatic =

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

dear writers,

there is a new gay-lesbian-queer department in the muse apprentice guild
edited by amy king whose advisor at buffalo was charles bernstein

please share a good thing and notify your colleagues about this new
department

here is amy's excellent introductory statement entitled "After the sum
of scars ..."


_____________________________________________

After the sum of scars .



Trying to articulate our individual realities, we often fall prey to
traditional discourses that speak in umbrella-like terms meant to
clarify what is "gay", "Buddhist", "female", "elderly", etc.  However,
the very plurality of everyone's experiences fails these pigeonholes;
the complexities of personhood spill from, stutter in, evade, fracture,
blur and erode tidy definitions-and so, daily life inherently resists
the narratives that group together, normalize and homogenize our lives,
that attempt fairytale-transparent access to our lives.



Lesbians, gays, transgendered and queers have historically pursued
common civil rights causes and have been rendered one of society's
primary sexual deviant groups, and so consequentially, each participant
is read accordingly.  The stranger on the street "knows" me because
within my hand is another woman's.   But how do I know myself?  The
story I have inherited of two women holding hands does not encompass or
explain my experiences nor does it provide tools to examine them with.
A poetics that resists the pressures of assimilation and works against
the bindings of certain knowledge, a poetics that plunges into,
multiplies and celebrates! our "deviant" label is in order.



The m.a.g. offers a place to recognize, note and use the scars identity
marks us with while locating new methods to expose those limitations,
examine the mechanisms of identification, and moreover, provides the
exploratory space in which we can create and share new identifying
gestures.



"And if, on laying Stein's book aside, we feel that it is still
impossible to accomplish the impossible, we are also left with the
conviction that it is the only thing worth trying."

                                                                  -John
Ashbery

All around the cobbler's bench
The monkey chased the weasel
The monkey thought 'twas all in fun
Pop -- goes the weasel!
Johnny's got the whooping cough and
Mary's got the measles
That's the way the money goes
Pop -- goes the weasel!

A penny for a spool of thread
A penny for a needle
That's the way the money goes
Pop -- goes the weasel!
You may try to sew and sew
And never make anything regal
So roll it up and let it go
Pop -- goes the weasel!

A painter would his lover to paint
He stood before the easel
The monkey jumped all over the paint
Pop -- goes the weasel!
When his sweetheart she did laugh
His temper got so lethal
He tore the painting up in half
Pop -- goes the weasel!

Every night when I go out
The monkey's on the table
Take a stick and knock it off
Pop -- goes the weasel!
Put some pepper on its nose
And you'll make it sneeze-l
Catch it fast before it snaps --
Pop -- goes the weasel!

All around the cobbler's bench
The monkey chased the weasel
The monkey thought 'twas all in fun

I've no time to wait and sigh
I've no time to tease-l
Kiss me quick -- I'm off -- goodbye!
Pop -- goes the weasel!

Gabe's provided the following for anyone who doesn't know how
to connect with their senators and representatives. Also, my experience
is that doing a Google search on their names will bring up addresses
and/or websites for them at the top of the hit list. You'd have to know
their names, of course.

Thanks, Gabe.

=================

Hal, others: here's a way to begin to find the contact info for your
representatives and senators. I've exhausted my limit for the Buffalo list
today, so if you want, Hal, you can forward this to them. Bookmark them.
Use them. I do.

I'd like to add my vote of enthusiasm for what's been posted re Agha
Shahid Ali's Ravishing Disunities: Real Ghazals in English - this
anthology introduced me to the beauty of the ghazal form.  There are so
many wonderful poems in there - thanks to Harriet Zines for posting hers
from it here.

Ravishing Disunities presents some of the fascinating terminology of
ghazals - the rhyme word is called the "qafia" and the refrain the
"radif."  Also, it is often customary for the poet to refer to him or
herself in the third person in the final couplet.

Here is one of my own ghazals:

                        Ghazal, October 2001

I wake uneasy, spy the face of a ghost in the mirror.
Confused stranger's eyes just like my own in the mirror.

"Pigeon's blood children" a phrase from my dream.
Children of loss? desire? war? I'm alone in the mirror.

A cracked plate on tiled kitchen floor.  Pieces pick up
easy, not like these shattered tableaux in the mirror.

"Talk sense, doctor," said the patient, finally, to Erickson.
Word salad news only leaves scrapes and bones in the mirror.

Salmon jump in the river, cormorants swim.  I scrub
the sink, hyper, practice chanting "aum" in the mirror.

Susan, plant lilies to place at the feet of the dead; pray for
pieces of old arabesques landscaped by sorrow in the mirror.

                        Susan Firghil Park

Hi all,

The new issue of the reborn Boog City is almost ready for the printer, who will be getting the file from me a week from this Friday.

As part of our cost-cutting maneuvers until ad sales pick up, I'm borrowing my dad's Jeep and distributing the paper on my own that Saturday, July 19.

Well, not entirely on my own. I can use the help of two of you to help me drop papers off throughout the East Village and Williamsburg. You get to join Brenda Iijima, Rodrigo Toscano, and me in minor physical labor, good conversation, and some lemonade when we're all done, too.

You can email me here or call me at the below #.

Thanks in advance for your help.

as ever,
david

I'm still looking for one more poet or critic to give a talk about food &
poetry at the SUNY-Cortland October 26-28 literary conference.

Patrick Dunagan of Portland will talk about Paul Blackburn at the Dinner
Table.

Kazim Ali will talk about Yoko Ono's Grapefruit.

The talk should be 15-20 minutes.  I have only one more week before I must
present my line-up to the conference organizers.

While there is no money involved in helping to get you there, this is a good
line on a CV and is generally an excellent conference.  People come from as
far away as India and it is a good chance to highlight your own material,
meet people and so on.

I originally hoped that people could talk about aesthetics and ethics, and
about Good Taste at the Dinner Table, but now anything on food and
contemporary poetry would be welcomed.

Thanks,

Kirby Olson

P.S.  The place is only about twenty minutes from Ithaca, so maybe Gabriel
Gudding you could talk about your own poetry and food??  Or would anybody
want to talk about ghazals and food?  Or um, William Carlos Williams or
Charles Olson?

Kirby--I remember reading a fascinating essay many years ago in the
William Carlos Williams newsletter (if I remember correctly) that was a
reminiscence by
Williams's son William Eric Williams (again, if I remember rightly),
involving said son's recollection of the good doctor's intimidatingly
powerful masticating action at the dinner table.

Johnston, Alastair Zephyrus Image: A Bibliography.  Berkeley: Poltroon =
Press, 2003.

=20

The anatomy described above is of AFT type, and names select parts of =
the individual metal letters from face to foot.  While it is obvious =
that letters compose words that in turn may be used to construct =
sentences, paragraphs, stanzas and finally, books, it is too often the =
case that the purpose of a bibliography is misunderstood as a dry, =
totalizing medium situated between the reader and the "actual" text.  =
Words are made of faces--faces facing the eye zooming in on the presence =
and absence of any cultural or textual investigation.=20

=20

Have you left something out:

Negative, says my Gunslinger,

no thing is omitted.

=20

These words from Dorn's Gunslinger Book I serve as the epigraph for =
Zephyrus Image, which arrived in the mail this afternoon.  The positive =
draws on the negative space, zooming out to focus on a constellation of =
characters: "The Zephyrus Image story begins in the early 1970's; =
Richard Nixon was President, Ronald Regan was Governor of California, =
the Vietnam War was raging, and the cultural climate of the USA was =
changing rapidly."

=20

What is utterly humanizing about this bibliography is the astute zest, =
and lively wit of the printers, poets, artists, activists, musicians and =
the bibliographer's careful mapping of the Book as whole-but humor is =
not to be misunderstood as apolitical.  Working beyond (and within) the =
bindings to come closer to the meaning therein, Johnston notes:

=20

"Zephyrus Image-the brainchild of Holbrook Teter & Michael Myers-was a =
Northern California press that operated through the nineteen-seventies-a =
time of great social change in America.  With their own idiosyncratic =
methods, they produced subversive, anarchic works of great wit and =
elegance that lampooned the foolish.  They attacked the Nixon White =
House and took on environmental adversaries, donating their labor to =
worthy causes.  They subverted the gallery system and ignored normal =
channels of distribution open to small presses, taking their work to the =
streets to give away.  Poets Ed Dorn & Tom Raworth were strongly allied =
with them, and they published a varied and eclectic range of work by =
Robert Creeley, Joanne Kyger, Fielding Dawson, Robert Bly, Lucia Berlin, =
Gary Snyder, Stan Brakhage & William T. Wiley."

=20

These names are certainly not unfamiliar to most readers of this list, =
yet their instrumental time and affiliation with the Zephyrus Image may =
well be a mystery-it would seem that Lew Welch's proposition, "Guard the =
mysteries!  Constantly reveal them!"  (also the title of one of =
Johnston's chapters in his recent Alphabets to Order) guides many of =
Johnston's historical investigations.  Teter and Myers' collaborations =
were distributed outside of the institutional frameworks of special =
collections and galleries.  They employed mainstream mediums and =
materials (bumper stickers, paper boxes of "snack-time ranch-raised =
gourmet earwigs", newspapers, etc.).  These ephemeral items combined the =
materials of tawdry and disposable consumer culture with the refined =
skills of design and artisanship often associated with the literary fine =
press.  Their works were often distributed for free in local bookshops, =
at demonstrations, or in the case of the Gary Snyder Brand Pine-Nuts, =
slipped in among the goods at local convenience stores-but this is only =
one among many amusing, yet critically significant instances of Teter =
and Myers' subversive political tendencies.

=20

In spite of the remarkably prolific nature of this press, very few =
articles or reviews exist.  Through a scavenger hunt of Herculean =
proportions, Johnston offers an unprecedented historical narrative =
broken into discrete subsections, drawing heavily upon personal =
telephone conversations, e-mail, and archival materials.  The sense of =
investigative reporting highlighted by Woodward and Bernstein is not =
necessarily coincidently evident here.  In keeping with the press' sense =
of political and social responsibility, Johnston's text demonstrates a =
mature understanding of the "difficult" questions of representation, =
recollection and historicization that have emerged from (or perhaps been =
embraced by?) postmodern discourse.  Johnston's work secures an all too =
rare, yet necessary foothold in the fissures of contemporary literary =
and textual scholarship. =20

=20

This is the third bibliography authored by Johnston.  The first two were =
also written for contemporary Bay-area presses: the Auerhahn and White =
Rabbit, but like works of the presses, the bibliographies themselves are =
becoming increasingly difficult to find.  This, the most recent =
publication from Poltroon consists of 244 pages with 28 photographs and =
101 illustrations of the press' publications.  I imagine that most of =
them have been reproduced here for the first time. =20

=20

Moreover, Johnston is an accomplished printer and poet in his own right, =
and the layout is a work of art unto itself.  His unmistakable sense of =
humor will have you laughing aloud (when was the last time you laughed =
while reading a bibliography?) as the typographic rendering engages with =
the twist and turns of the tales told here-enacting as it explains.  The =
bibliographer's care for the nuances of language cross channels once =
again, making this bibliography hum with the hiss of fresh ink and the =
revolutionary practices that drove the press and the residual integrity =
of the individuals who made it go.  For more information, visit =
Poltroon's homepage at: http://www.poltroonpress.com/



Sorry to have gone on so long!

Limbs


Both the my work and the world fundamentally consist of four types of
Limbs:

Limbs - undefined primitives of which nothing more need be said;

Interstitial Limbs - which appear in the midst of others, therefore
possessing multiple borders, cohesions, and lubricants;

Supernumerary Limbs - which appear as extraneous or useless extensions
from interstitial or phantom limbs, therefore breaking with any
conceivable tradition, and suitably protected from external atmospheric
processes or considerations;

And Phantom Limbs - which are ontologically impaired, peripheral, and
largely responsible for inscriptive, cultural, or other manifestations.

Consider among other things, the limbic, limnology, the limen, the
limner. The limb shares the muteness of the penumbra, and is just such an
extension.

Examine the world: examine the limb.

Has anyone on the list read the new collection about motherhood yet
(just got an ad for readings based on the book)?

Does the book include anything on adoptive motherhood, being a
birthmother, a stepmother, any of the "nonstandard" conditions of
motherhood?

I'll be teaching a course in adoption literature this fall...looking
for material.

Kasey provides a personalized reading of "Skunk Hour" on his blog today. In
it he wonders "what Lowell is going for here" in this stanza:

And now our fairy
decorator brightens his shop for fall,
his fishnet’s filled with orange cork,
orange, his cobbler’s bench and awl,
there is no money in his work,
he’d rather marry.

I don't know, but isn't this the reflexive crux of Lowell on poetry? Doubt
creeps into verse training as (unwitting?) parody of itself here, lending to
the general malaise Kasey notes in the poem generally. Intrudes in this
stanza, then is left behind as too unbearable to dwell on further in rest of
poem -- the poem's narration-friendliness and its subject title attempting
to take attention away from reading this stanza as reflexive comment on a
lineage of poetry-making and on the present act of continuing it. In this
stanza, poetry becomes a "fairy decorator" -- with a touch of quaint iambic
rhythm, line 3; dab of editorialist's syntax, line 4; staid comma, line 5,
formally mimicking the paraphrasing plain-spokenness of its joining
sentences (sentences drained of all social flavor that might evoke the
euphemized "fairy decorator"); and the ensured over-emphasis, in lines 5-6,
of the predictability of the stanzaic rhyme scheme.

There's just no class in the world anymore! - here, working; in earlier
stanzas, monied. Poetry, capital P, falls apart... Melodrama.

But, reading this stanza at the reflexive level, as above, the entire
scenario (the manner in which Lowell admits doubt into the poem) seems
tragic to me. If this is camp ("fairy decorator"??), it's not funny for the
persona, who says so by moving on, not noticing formal reflexive foreboding
in this stanza, treating it instead as mere narrative subject-matter, and
dropping the scene of this stanza for another narrative in the next.

Not to take away from the particularity of the relationship of mother,
child(ren) and the making of poetry, my apprehension here is that the title
& configuration continue to reaffirm an archetype that - at least for some
of us - is retro. In light of the radical reconfigurations of family over
the last three decades, it is a title that misses the consideration of the
father as often a fully responsible member of however parent(s) define and
re-define the equations of parenting, work and the imagination. And,
consequently, within these new family frames, the title ends up seeming to
exclude the rich - and often hotly contested -  territory in which creative
work is impacted by these new configurations of mothers, fathers, children
and the permissions of the muse(s).

It's a title that many fully participant fathers may find dismissive and
possibly hurtful. And mothers - if I may speculate - may find anachronistic
and limiting. On the other hand, not having reading it yet, it could be full
of great essays.  Certainly it is good at all to have a book that explores
the relationship of parenting and the position poets within its demands.


 I suspect others - privately or publicly -  will have much to say on this.

hey you poets out there what was a poem that SHOOK your formative years?

when i was an early teen this little poem made me very happy, and created new ideas for poetry in me back then:

ON THE SILL
by Spike Hawkins, from THE LOST FIRE BRIGADE (1968 edition)

Dust opens
its little
mouth and
Yawns
Silvers
in the
Light

---------
then, 5 or 6 years later i was introduced to this:

excerpt from QUINTETS
by Iliassa Sequin

                       V

would you confound - in dual languor
another artifice of sapped inventions, interred smiles

                                         as if the moon miscarried
                                         her inanimate yellow

elsewhwere 'disburden' from below the desert
a cowered trophy

Most people don't know anything about the poetry scene here in Buffalo; it
is as if it doesn't exist.

Is there a poetry scene or a university? Or put another way, would whatever
poetry scene there is exist without the university?

P.S. One further detail on the Lowell stanza. Lore about the word orange
among rhyming dictionarists is that nothing chimes with it. A flavor of this
word carries into jazz with Mingus's "Orange Was the Color of Her Dress."

Interestingly, Patrick Herron's poem has no orange in it; Kasey's blog is
not "Orange Tree"; there is a Calgary poetry magazine "Orange"; O'Hara's not
a painter because of orange; Tom Orange hasn't emailed in awhile; and they
all, no doubt, have read "Skunk Hour." How is this possible?

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization confirmed
Wednesday that Royal Dutch Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), ChevronTexaco
Corp. ( CVX) and Swiss trading house Taurus have won the 8 million barrel
tender for Basra Light crude oil.

Each company won a 2 million barrel lot, loading July 10-31 at the southern
port of Mina al-Bakr.
+++++

Iraqui, the national vassal and Western oil vessel, it does appear -
notwithstanding all the other on the  ground negatives  - that the petroleum
foundation of the world is getting back to normal and progressing favorably
for the major players.

In case any amongst us - including myself - think  Bush & Company's things
are on the way to radically falling apart!

Steven,

I think I may have seen that same essay in a reader of essays on Williams' work.
Another thing that interests me about Williams that I've never seen anybody work
on is the Martin Luther connection.  In one of the big biographies it says that
Martin Luther was his hero throughout his twenties and thirties, and that he made
a pilgrimage to the Wartburg where Luther went to hide after he had made his stand
against the papacy's selling of indulgences.  WCW wrote a poem there to his soon
to be wife, comparing them to Martin and his ex-nun wife, Kathe.

Here's the twist -- Martin loved his wife, and slept with her sometimes three or
four times a day, bragging endlessly about it, and talking about how beautiful she
was, etc.  He also said that any man who couldn't please his wife deserved to be a
cuckold, and actually invite in somebody who could do the job.

You get the impression that WCW was an adulterer who didn't love his wife.  After
his death, she discovered evidence of this or something, and became quite bitter.
I wish I knew more about this aspect.  The writing in the bios doesn't really
label anything very clearly.

How Lutheran if at all was WCW?

Also, did he cheat on his wife?  Is there any absolutely irrefutable evidence?

There's a good Luther documentary on PBS that is playing this week.

What interests me is how much of a role family plays in Luther and WCW's life, and
how you can compare them.  It's a vague idea.  But it takes off on a post that
Stephen Vincent put in earlier today about the motherhood and poetry question.
What about family and poetry, generally?  It's a crucible, isn't it?  And now with
the father having to play more of a nurturing role (my dad just came home and fell
asleep before the newspaper, but I am reading to the bugs all night and playing
catch, and changing diapers and so on) it seems these roles are changing.

What do people expect from families these days?  You often get the solitary voice
of the poet in much modernism.  Is this changing?  This is sort of a vague
question, but is there a change from women's studies and men's studies to
something like family studies?

Apparently the children of non-exploded families do much better.  And non-exploded
ethnic families (families that stay together, as I think the Asian and some West
Indian  immigrant families do -- every island appears to be different) apparently
are equal with white family incomes within one generation.  The family is a real
source of strength if it works, and maybe is worth celebrating in poetry -- but I
don't know anybody who's really done this.  I don't think Charles Olson directly
mentions his wife or kids in the Max, but the whole poem in a sense is dedicated
to his father, it seems -- through the Gloucester motif, where they summered
together.  The religious references seem to me to be for his mother.  It may be a
kind of abstract love poem for his family.  I'm fascinated by how space becomes
gendered in the poem -- the sea, the churches, etc.

Why on earth would Williams have been interested in Luther since his parents were
Catholics?  Did he have a relative who was Lutheran?  Later on he gives talks at
Wagner College on Staten Island which was then strongly and is still nominally
Lutheran. Did he have Lutheran pastors for pals?  I can't find any info on this.

I only lived in lovely Buffalo for a couple years as a
functioning adult (though I was raised there) but I
have to say the poetry community in Buffalo is way bad
ass--

Just Buffalo Literary Center (while I was there) was a
great, vibrant organization that really supported
local, local writers (off the radar in every way) and
had several monthly readings at which there was a
regular crowd but also many people (and students)
coming in and out.

JB also brought in many great literary figures to read
on a regular basis. Mike Kelleher was involved in
bringing writers like Bernadette Mayer, Michael
Palmer, Cheryl Clarke, Hilda Morley, Yusef Komunyakaa,
and Joy Harjo to Buffalo...

there wasn't much of a connection between the
university and the community (well besides Mike but I
think this was before he joined the poetics program)
but townies definitely went to and benefited from
University sponsored readings.

the poetry scene in Buffalo while I was there was
generous, democratic, and little quirky. you'd have
these sixteen year old high schools reading poems and
then Mrs Baird (as in Baird Hall on the UB campus)
come up and read something. kind of surreal.

there was a public access show (starring this guy who
dressed all in black with black beret and wore dark
sunglasses and called himself "The Unknown Poet") plus
something on the local NPR--there were workshops,
readings series at some of the bars, JB did a "writer
in residence" thing where they'd choose five years a
year in an open reading and give them money to put on
workshops and readings.

i always thought there was a lot of potential for more
connection between the university and the community.
maybe it's happening. there's an amazing community
book store called "rust belt books" that moved to a
bigger location and is now doing a reading series plus
i guess they are starting to do partnership events
with some organizations in Niagara Falls (plus great
bookstore there called....Book Corner I think?)

there are a bunch of literary magazines that get
published in Buffalo not affiliated with the
university including Eclectic Literary Forum,
Slipstream, Earth's Daughters, plus probably a bunch I
am not thinking of.

Any way this post got silly long. Just check out JB's
website at www.justbuffalo.org

There's a sound file of "Love, O Careless Love" being
sung in a 1969 Missouri performance, at [turn on your
speakers]:

http://www.smsu.edu/folksong/maxhunter/0686/0686.ram


I would have thought the use of the word "fairy" in a
1950s poems like Lowell's, or any poem, for that
matter, ("fairy", mark you, compounded into "fairy /
decorator" by the added stereotype of the homosexual
as interior decorator) would be as serious a stumbling
block to a 2003 reader as the use of "Jew" banker or
"nigger" in a T.S. Eliot or William Carlos Williams
poem.

Kasey's disclaimer that he doesn't get "what Lowell is
going for here" would have been an understandable
demur to avoid the whole incriminating subject
altogether and not even touch dirty business like
this.  Louis, meanwhile, wants to turn the fairy
decorator into an ~allegory.~   That seems very
blindered to the reality that Lowell has constructed a
poem with "fairy" smack-dab at the middle of it: the
iconography of emblematic figures of Poetry may be
given something like a rose to hold, usually, but the
finishing touch to their symbolism is never an
~"awl",~ as it is here.  Besides, "Skunk Hour" isn't
an ~ars poesis;~ it's about ~sex,~ "perverse,"
voyeuristic night prowler sex.

What is Lowell doing putting this "fairy decorator"
into "Skunk Hour"?  The fairy decorator has to be
explained/explicated as a ~fairy,~ not as a metaphor.

(A)     Placing the fairy decorator as the last human
silhouette we'll see in the poem before it's overtaken
by only his own guilt and nocturnal animals is a
defense.  No matter what scandal Lowell might have
sunk to with his Peeping Tom parking lot skulking, at
least, the fairy is there to remind us, there are
others that are worse off than him.  Even a voyeur
pervert, as long as he's hetero like Lowell, ain't all
that bad, when you keep in mind and have as a
conspicuous reminder the presence of worse taboos like
being a "fairy decorator."

(B)     The fairy is there not as part of a see-saw meant
to keep Lowell from looking worse, but as an instance
of ~empathy,~ identification, or a fellow rogues'
gallery criminal.  Lowell is counting himself
side-by-side with law-breaking, effeminate inverts.
In his own awfulness, he is establishing solidarity
with other children of the night.  The fairy decorator
is a fellow misfit.

(C)     The influence of Allen Ginsberg's confessional
poetry upon the writing of "Skunk Hour" is one Lowell
well-documented.  With Ginsberg as the titular
figurehead of incipient confessionalism at that point,
though, and with much of Ginsberg's "truth" and shock
value owing to his inclusion of ~"fairy"~ biography,
Lowell is pointedly distancing himself from any
associations, however slight, that confessionalism
might have take on with Ginsberg-style fairy
confessionalists.  He is making the point that,
although Lowell may be sick in the head, he's still
sane enough to show proper all-American male contempt
for interior decorators.  Lowell's transgression
(pecadillo) is at least kept ~private~ and secretive
(until the publication of the poem); the fairy
decorator's objectionable fairyness is constantly
broadcast ~publicly~ by every detail that surrounds
him: his "fishnet" (more colloquially, a type of
ladies' stocking) and his louche taste in colors.

(D)    ?    . . .


Those glosses may not be solely Kasey's and Louis'
straight male avoidance (obliviousness?) to how the
real lingering stench of "Skunk Hour" isn't in the
(anality of the) skunks' spray (a skunk lifts its tail
exposing its anus to discharge its stink: "ostrich
tail").  The first de-personalization was Lowell's,
and they're just following suit: as if in confirmation
of Lowell's claim that "nobody's here", we see nothing
of the fairy decorator himself, we don't know what he
looks like and he isn't described, ~nor~ are the
poem's other characters; the only proof of people's
existence there is in their paraphernalia: the
decorator's orange cork, etc., and a workbench so
distracting that it absorbs all of Kasey's attention
toward the setting and he doesn't even notice/mention
that this segue into a "Hitchcockian" mis-en-scene
includes the Hitchcockian prop of the fairy
decorator's dangerous pointed cutting instrument so
sharp that it can pierce holes through wood, the
decorator's "awl".   The iconography is not that of
Poetry, but of some strange psychological dream
threat.


(. . . "awl", foreshadowed in the previous stanza by
its rhyme, "yawl".  Lowell's onomastic narcissism
makes those images doubly significant: the autograph w
and l in "Lowell" is just below the surface of the w
and l in "yawl" and "awl"; "Lowell", in the wrong
drawl, rhymes with "yawl" and "awl".)



(I'm not a zoologist, but--- about “march on their
soles [what else are they going to march on? . . .] up
Main Street”:

Skunks have ~nonretractile~ claws.  That is, unlike
cats, who can retract their claws and walk silently on
the pads (soles) of their feet, wouldn't the
nonretractile claws of the skunk, which are always
sticking out as it walks along, in fact make a
~grating,~ clicking sound on macadam as they walk
along, so that skunks ~don't~ actually march on their
soles, except in poems like this? They kind of
clipclop back and forth between their claws and their
pads.)

[Please read the blog for more sophisticated formatting:
www.arras.net/weblog.]

Kasey once again puts in the hours on his blog, this time about Lowell's
"Skunk Hour."  I don't have time to read <a
href="http://limetree.blogspot.com/">the most recent post </a>with any
attention, I have laundry to do (and have to get back to my construction
job).

But I caught wind of the followng from Steve Evans' <a
href="http://thirdfactory.net/nb.html">Third Factory</a> there:
<blockquote>Though Lowell leaves me cold after numerous dutiful attempts,
I'd been following Free Space Comix's recent defense of him with interest
and admiration - until I hit the claim about "the tortured, jagged,
compressed rhythms" of "Skunk Hour'" being like "punk rock." I'd as soon
assent to that statement as vote for Bush in 2004.</blockquote>
What I wrote was, of course, quite different:

<blockquote>...because a formal technique is being employed (in his case the
"new sentence," which never, frankly, struck me as radical) hardly spares a
poem (such as his tiring, distracted Roof book <i>N/O</i>) from being
branded as passive -- about language, about society, about issues of
epistemology and genre. What can be more "quietudinous" than a passivity
regarding these issues? In comparison, the tortured, jagged, compressed
rhythms of Lowell's "The Skunk Hour" come off as punk rock.</blockquote>

There's a matter of context -- I would never mistake Lowell for a member of
Black Flag -- and of the verb "come off,” as here means "mistakenly appear
to be".  One can fart on a subway and one can fart in church - in one case,
it's an act of indifference or even (considering the options, such as
vomiting) "quietude," and in another heresy.  Of course, I was being
provocative, but I'm not sure what the point of elliding the subtlety of
this statement is; such activity overripens this discussion, gets it ready
to be old news too soon.  I think it pays to be careful, if one cares.

The 60 so odd pages of "Non," from <i>N/O</i>, are rather listless and, I
say, also tedious.  More importantly, though, you will not find any poignant
societal perspective there even after twenty pages, compared to which the 8
or so stanzas of "Skunk Hour" are like a 1 minute 30 second burst of -
indeed - "negative" energy.  Lowell lines up his targets and then takes them
down; Silliman drifts along -- in a similar quasi-pastoral mode,
paratactically or not -- reminding us periodically of his cred or "lineage"
as a post-Marxist, post-structuralist syntactician ("Schizophrenoform").
The landscape is, at least in <i>my</i> view (I am getting a little forceful
and final in my statements of quality here, I fear), left much the way he
found it.

"The car radio bleats..." (from the "Skunk Hour") has a similar, if not the
same, negatively that Adorno emits when writing about popular culture; it’s
an uncompromising condemnation, modified by a bad mood.  And am I all that
wrong in hearing "I am an antrichirst" in the words "I myself am Hell" -- in
contrast to various "I's" (mostly exhibited as "eyes") we see below?  Drop
the 8 stanzas of "Skunk Hour" into "Non" and I'm sure you will see -- like
dropping Radiohead's "Morning Bell," one of their sweeter songs, into Eno's
“tedious” <i>Thursday Afternoon</i> -- that you will hear compression,
negativity, focus, passion, and noise.

If the issue is class and political viewpoint, it's worth remembering that a
lot of punk rock bands were 1) populated by upper-middle-class renegades
like Joe Strummer, or 2) populated by neo-Nazi skinheads or alluded to Nazi
imagery quite careless of politics.  (I don't think anyone is saying Lowell
is a neo-Nazi, of course.)

The following is from "Non":

<blockquote>Divide wire coat
hangers into
those with cardboard,
those without, those
wrapped in filmy white paper,
whether the hook is formed
by one metal strand or two, design
of the twist at the base
of the neck

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what I like most
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about the Albany Public Library
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that it smells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same as when I was six years old

Schizophrenoform

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there's a dead
cat in the gutter but
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it's been
there all week

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;snoodlenook

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little moths
under the porchlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be with me now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dog in the
distance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barks
compulsively
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds chirp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to greet the
early dusk

the landlady lives at the foot of the stairs
that run down the hill beside the house
so wooded you don't even notice them

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamlike,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the color TV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thru the neighbor's gauze curtain

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ice crackles as it melts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nibbling Cracker Jacks from the
palm of my hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the little man in the blue suit
salutes

the runner forgets to run,
so is easily forced at second</blockquote>

Etc. etc.  It goes on like this (or <i>has</i> gone on like this) for 30 or
so pages.

Is it really a strength of the “new sentence” that a pretty dull observation
about the Albany Public Library, conveyed indifferently, rubs up against
rather bizarre coinages (or perhaps overhead neologisms) such as
“snoodlenook”?  Is it right of me to hear the attenuation of syntax that we
enjoy in WCW’s “As the cat...” poem in the first stanza here, or one of
Marianne Moore’s “precisionist” poems about the structures of animals and
shorelines, but with none of the formal elegance (or “precision”)?  What is
the nature of the irony of “be with me now” in reference to the moths --
just dropping an echo of some other strata of language, some plead to God
one might make in the throes of a distaster?  Why?

But most importantly, beyond these sytlistic issues: where is the urgency
here?   I really <i>do</i> believe that arguments can be made for this sort
of poetics of "drift" -- the "Drifted... drifted precitate" section of
Pound's <i>Mauberley</i>, in the section in which Mauberley is in exile,
echoes through my mind as I write this -- but I'd really like to hear them,
especially related to a politics of "critique.")

Compare "the landlady" and "a dog" to the lengths Lowell takes to make his
figures <i>specific</i> and of his locale, and you'll see why I think Lowell
is much closer to the imagist / Williams aesthetic line than is generally
believed (at least in what is now "our" cyber gopherspace).  "The Skunk
Hour" bears comparison to Williams' "The pure products..." poem -- which I
think is perhaps WCW's greatest single poem and perhaps my favorite of our
long 20th century.

I am not saying I think "Skunk Hour" is as innovative, as "good," at
radical, or productive, etc., just that its author learned his lessons well
from the predecessor poem.  It's a visionary evocation of an American
landscape about which he can say little discursively but whose images -- in
the guise of animals, garbage, shitty music, displaced horniness, etc. --
haunts and oppresses him.  As I claim in a review -- which I will publish
eventually on this blog -- after this you can only go to Ashbery and "Daffy
Duck in America" -- a whole-hearted reclamation of the sublime production
scale of pop culture in the grand metrics of, indeed, the "tradition."  (I
word it better there.)

(On a similar note, has anyone noticed, or thought about, how Ashbery's
early "Portrait of Little J.A." is a defusing parody of the "confessional"
mode, voiced through what I think of as a particularly [male] gay affect of
envisioning oneself as the over-sensitive, delicate flower threatened by the
violence inherent in heterosexual, suburban "normalcy"?  "Normalcy" itself
is coinage of Harding's, one of the few presidents that seem to crop up in
JA's poems periodically.  Anyway, I think the heavy rhymes, the stanzas, the
"there I was" Mary Pickford woe-is-me attidue of the poem suggests some
camping of the heroic "confessional" mode.)

Lowell's phrase "hermit heiress" is far from obvious -- it's actually an
interesting coinage, considering its position in the enjambment.  I always
wonder, reading this, whether one is prodded to sound out the "h" in
"heiress" seeing it come right after "hermit," and where that would take
me -- <i>in the language</i>, geographically and classwise -- to do so.  I
don't find similar changes of speeds in the metrics of, say, Duncan -- the
second line of "Skunk Hour" seems the remains of the explosion caused by the
blockage of "hermit" the previous line, three words that seem just tripping
over each other.  This is a sign of the care I feel Lowell takes in his best
poems with sound patterning -- a sign of his relationship to Hopkins, who
he's written about finely.

I guess my central question is, in these quick notes: which poem is more
focused in its "negativity," more attuned to the properties of language,
more aware that time, indeed, is precious, and that reading (not to mention
writing) should not be a matter of indifference but rather a point-by-point
handling of the opportunities and issues it throws up?

(I'm perfectly aware that fifteen volumes more of boring dross has been
written about "Skunk Hour" than about "Non," or about Grenier and Antin or
Silliman's great other books for that matter, and that some more of the
latter needs to be done.  My argument is for an approach to poetry that can
get past the telegraphing of "lineages" and tell us, with fresh eyes, what
in fact the language is <i>doing</i> in a poem -- after all, one of the
great claims of the poets who are not of the "quietude" is that there's some
sort direct engagement with language as <i>material</i> that other poets are
lacking.  I'm just not convinced that's true -- we are all prone to sleeping
on the job.)

Add this to the mix:

In "Words for Hart Crane," which I read as an homage to Crane and also an
elevation of Lowell, himself, to the status of Whitman, Shelley, and Crane,"
the speaker would have us empathize with
his anger at those who have not properly revered his Crane, his Whitman, and
his Shelley.  However, I am troubled by what I see as Lowell's own obsessive
guilt when he ascribed to his revered homosexual poet(s) sexual predation
which only reinforces the homophobic stereotypes of his era:

"why I took / to stalking sailors"

and

"wolfing the stray lambs"

and the notion that the homosexual poet(s)' admirer "must lay his heart out
for my bed and board."

In addition, earlier on he adds to "dope" (those inferior to Crane who were
awarded Pulitzers) that term "screw," which according to Merriam-Webster has
several plays: 3 : a worn-out horse (suggesting the mis-awarded recipients
were less than worthy?); 5 : a prison guard (suggesting that they guard the
re-hashed versification of old?); 6 : one who bargains shrewdly; also :
SKINFLINT; (suggesting that they calculate to recreate previously desirable
verse); and b usually vulgar : a partner in sexual intercourse (again, the
sexual innuendo, whereas just the one term, "dope," would have sufficed).

Of course, my reading is, among other things, skewed and incomplete: Charles
Altieri provides wider context:  "Lowell learned in "Words for Hart Crane"
that self-analysis and debasement were the preconditions for salvation in
the American Wasteland" (Altieri, from Enlarging the Temple: New Directions
in American Poetry during the 1960s
http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lowell/skunk.htm ).

All good points except the zoological. San Diego is full of skunks, and
more than once I've confronted them (or vice versa) on the concrete path of
my back yard. I can't give details of their gait, but they neither scrape
or clipclop, at least my skunks. They also don'yt move very fast--not many
reasons to if you're a skunk.

Not sure how a book about poet/mothers misses the role
of the father--it isn't a book about poet/fathers.  I
mean, I'm really interested in and invested in all
sorts of parenting/caregiving relationships, but that
doesn't preclude the need (for me, at least) for a
book in which the particular roles/problems/joys of
being a poet and a woman and a mother are discussed.

Remember that only now, only in my generation (of
young poets born in the 60s and later), is there even
an existing generation of more than a handful of women
who are both poets and mothers to whom we can look for
guidance, inspiration, etc., and simply acknowledging
this fact seems an important role of such a book: here
are these very well-established and respected women
poets who are also raising children.  And my
understanding is that poets or no, women still do the
vast majority of the child-rearing in this country,
and even in heterosexual homes where the child-rearing
is "split" between the man and the woman (ie, where
both parents work full-time and parent full-time), the
women still end up spending more time with the kids
than the man does (this according to Naomi Wolf's book
on Motherhood as well as what I know from friends).
This is not to claim that there aren't men who are
taking on the majority of child-rearing, or that there
aren't many other kinds of families out there, but
that a book on what it means to be both a working poet

and a mother is certainly still very relevant and
relatively unexplored.

Certainly a book on male poets who are hard at work
raising children could also be very compelling.  But I
wonder (honestly, not rhetorically) if there are many
men with established poetry careers who are also doing
half or more of the work of raising the children in
their homes? I hope if not now, there will be soon,
and then a book on the subject will be very important.

I was fortunate enough to have Caesar Blake, editor of the Norton
Anthology of Poetry as my first poetry teacher and I will never forget
the Alice Walker + Langston Hughes + Gwendolyn Brooks + Amiri Baraka
poems (often Xeroxed, not in anthology) which he taught despite being a
Emily Dickinson scholar. You should have heard the timid + white Toronto
freshman girls reciting "It's Nation Time!" with exuberant encouragement
from Professor Blake. It was his last class before retirement and I
think he was enjoying himself.

I remember Creeley's "The Ballad of the Despairing Husband" was my first
memorized poem because it seemed easy + rhymed (we had to memorize poems
in Caesar's class). And I remember Caesar forcing us frail university
freshman to read aloud all of "Howl" together -- that being the first
time I was exposed to profanity in literature! Yikes!

for the record, that's bill bissett
and yeah, my first poetry teacher, Warren Tallman (co-editor of new American
Poetry and Poetics with Don Allen)
rocked my world with poems by him --
with his out-lawed, improper, contaminated investigations into language

"the manee n varied langwage notaysyuns/ not as an imitaysyun uv life..."

which first got me thinking about how
language structures become simulacric of social practice.  where his bizarre,
unconventional, and sometimes tortured spelling, orthography  "punktuayshyun"
are not merely idiosyncratic, but directly synecdochic of the gaps, caesuras,
and silences which exist between the language, which is the signifier of
power, and the experience it represents.

A fawning grotesquerie in a certain figure by an illustrator of Grimm's
fairy tales I can't conjure right now but the whiteness around it, or a
picture of Rumpelstiltskin deep in the forest with a light shining on him,
the idea of a man ripping himself in twain like a macabre yogi, and my
father's voice reading Joel Chandler Harris' Tarbaby and talking like Donald
Duck.

But poems never shook me that I know of because the nuns made me read them
and Sister Alberta was more ancient than Caesar's Gallic Wars.

For its playfulness, Service's "The Cremation of Sam McGee," from The Spell of the Yukon, which my Dad found up a tree he climbed as a kid & gave to me c. age 10. For poignancy & parataxis, Pound's translation of "The River Merchant's Wife: A Letter." For immediacy, R. H. Blyth's 4 volume Haiku, but--for a newclueyear explosion--Jack Spicer's After Lorca: book as poem, poem as 'kneebone connected to the thighbone.'
Come to think of it, each these works winds up a Blakean "golden thread" of emotional responsibility as an emergence from the labyrinth of the quotidian. That thread becomes the 'third leg' of the Sphinx's riddle, Michel Serres' 'third man'--the tertium, terse. Or 'verse,' so to say. Oedipus becomes the Sphinx so nobody else has to, but that doesn't become clear till the stony mirror receives its full sheen. Then the poet disappears.

Jeffrey, for what it's worth I think the clearest answer from your list below
is "B" - for better or worse (and not without probematic sexual politics, as
they say) Lowell is empathizing with the fairy decorator.  There is the Hart
Crane connection already mentioned: "there is no money in his work" mirroring
the line "my profit was a pocket with a hole" in "Words for Hart Crane" (again,
I agree with the objections already raised to this latter poem's
characterization of the homosexual writer, but that doesn't mean Lowell wasn't
empathizing - Lowell was himself, after all, full of self-loathing).  But
there's also the fact that the "love-cars" episode is based on an anecdote
Lowell had heard about Whitman.

By the way, the skunk, it has always seemed to me, is also Lowell himself -
"I've been working like a skunk, doggedly and happily since mid August" he
wrote to Jarrell in '57.  The pun on "rich" air at the end is his signal that
henceforth whatever stinks is the stuff of poetry.  Somewhere (quoted in the
margins of my old copy of Life Studies) Lowell writes of the skunks, "the march
of affirmation, an ambiguous one...both quixotic and barbarously absurd, hence
the tone of amusement and defiance."

I'm not saying I buy all this, just trying to point to Lowell's intentions.  As
Brian has discussed at length, Lowell did sort of believe he was choosing a
third way and indeed to an extent he was.  But the quote from Duncan which
Kasey posted at Limetree is right on the money: Lowell's formal innovation is
always executed in a state of fear.  He speaks to the collapse of, especially,
the aesthetic project of Southern Agrarians and the later Eliot.  But he
doesn't do it with cheer as Williams and Ginsberg did.

I have to say again, if you really want to see where the fault lines are,
compare something like "My Last Afternoon with Uncle Devereax" to Edward
Marshall's "Leave the Word Alone."  Here's the Lowell:

My perfection was the Olympian
poise of my models in the imperishable autumn
display windows
of Rogers Peet's boys' store below the State House
in Boston.  Distorting drops of water
pinpricked my face in the basin's mirror.
I was a stuffed toucan
with a bibulous, multicolored beak.

And here's the Marshall (from 1956):

When   I   was   six the boy   out back said my mother   was
        crazy   and I thought he   didn't like my mother
             (present) who is my aunt
                      by marriage
           Vernon -- he heard loose talk from his
               mother but I   always thought Vernon's
                   mother odd and his Sister   Irene
liked to play around with me before I
               understood   sex   and
               Vernon   used to get pleasure   sticking
               paper up my ass and he was   Greek
               American --   Father worked at St. Clair's
                        ice cream shop


Offhand I would say that Marshall, doing projective verse, is able to
communicate all the sexual/familial confusion *aesthetically*, via line and
spacing.  His ease with the line mirrors a refreshing ease with the material --
i.e., he is not confessing but rather telling. [Another masterpiece in this
vein is O'Hara's "Ode to Mike Goldberg ('s Birth and Other Births)"]. Lowell on
the other hand has a lot of confusion to confess but he needs it to stand for
something more, and so everything must be just so.  "I was a stuffed toucan."
And *I* was a teenage nymphomaniac!  So what?  Like I said, I'm with Duncan,
what's interesting about Lowell is that all his noodling seems to come out of
deep psychological need.  That combined with the fact that he seems to piss
interesting sounds and phrases.  It's cracking me up that all us Buffalolistas
are talking about "Skunk Hour"!

Off to the white mountains for a week, adieu, adieu,

-m.

i guess everyone is saying the different ones for the
different motions of their life-changes.

the first poems that made me realize there was a
language system other than the colonizing one that had
been starched into my young mouth that had before
spoken four languages--urdu, farsi, telugu, and
english--as one were "black jam for dr. negro" and
"vive noir" by mari evans.

after that i discovered victor hernandez cruz and
poets of the black arts movement and that was how
poetry came into me.

Hi Kirby,

Are you being ironic with your remark about a "change to "family studies"?
You've got to be kidding!

But let me ask you,
Have you read Dahlberg's essays?

I think he hit the nail on the head and it is so obvious that we Amurrikans
caint (I'm reverting to Poundian flummery here, please excuse)see it
sometimes, even if we've read dahlberg. In fact, we're obsessed by it (see
the posts about Lowell's "fairy decorator" in this list).

I mean, The lack of women <i>traditionally<i> in Am. lit. From Whitman to
Queequeg in his coffin (Did Ishmael and Queequeg have sex in the coffin I
wonder? (Freudian? anal sex and the death instinct?) to Ginsberg (except
mention of his insane mother)and Burroughs (except his william-telled wife
(which doesn't count because he killed her so that he could not write about
her(?))) there aint no presence of women. And if there aint no women you
caint have family studies, right Kirby? Unless you are talking about the end
times and the demise of the family in the "engineered" creation of human
life on earth (why should it be perpetuated except by women?). (My son
recounted an episode on the cartoon channel about a time when the earth has
been taken over by women after they destroyed all the men. He kind of
grinned at me with the absurdity, and did I note a hint of a sense of a
vindication of something in his unfathomable semi-androgynous
consciousness?)

Family Studies would be retrogressive, Kirby. Progress only in the Unified
Stations of Amerika, Kirby. If anything, the next stage in the progression
is anthroposophic studies of adamic and pre-adamic Wo-Man-kind with Woman in
the ascendancy.

So that's why we have gender and women's studies, Kirby, didn't you know
that?

(My good, gay English friend Fr. Francis (before 9/11 and the scandal in The
Church of Latter Day Child Molesting Priests (notice the stories broke
around the same time -- again the American anal obsession and Freud's death
instinct: we get f----d in the you know what by some Saudis with relatively
low tech. means and we go gaga against anybody that ties his head with a
headcloth or wears a soutane) told me once he couldn't understand Americans
and how they must always broadcast what they are and act a certain way,
wearing it on the sleeve all the time; it went along with what he considered
the "banal" American accent he couldn't stand, he guessed.)

One poster was incredulous of another poster's obtuseness in not picking up
on the "obvious" reference to the pejorative term "fairy", thus revealing
both posters' ingenuousness. So what?

My point is quite simple. Why the labelling? Why must Lowell be labelled (I
kind of like that alliteration) as a repressed white male? Repression is NOT
an exclusionary word (I've been reading Norman O. Brown of late). Again, so
what?

Why can't both posters' interpretations of "fairy decorator" be acceptable
(enough with that Protestant obssession with the One Interpretation)?

Here's mine: "fairy decorator" is a personification of autumn (as Jack
Frost)and the gay colors of deciduous trees in the fall. And the fishnet and
the orange cork is the description of the outer and inner bark of the cork
tree. (But I have never read the poem, nor Lowell for that matter, and Jean
Paul, who has read more poetry than me, said reading Lowell would be a waste
of time and John Logan is a better poet anyways.)

Maybe Lowell was trying to make a sincere effort at beat confessional
poetry. He was simply of another generation and couldn't do it, and
consequemtly sounded unwittingly like a repressed white male, to <i> us<i>.
He just couldn't take the persona of what Paul Metcalf in an essay called
Ginsberg's "goofiness." Therefore, easy for us to take potshots at. What
will our children think about our repressions? Quaint.

Maybe it'll all blow over, this hegemony in academe, Kirby. There's hope,
maybe, enshallah, as the Arabs say.

Please Excuse my dovetailing of responses to several posts at once in this
list serve, Kirby. It's getting late and I have to drive the bus.

Matt

I'll throw this out, incomplete to the max, absent conclusions,
implications, etc. I don't know what "side" these observations support, it
really doesn't matter in a way, poking over the details of poetry like
this...

I see the phrase "fairy /decorator" as a disarmingly glaring slight now,
Jeffrey. And the words were literally there in front of me all along!

But they are not literally there in front of me, in a way. Perhaps one
reason why Brian likes Lowell is that Lowell's nouns, here, bounce around
connotatively, indirectly, in comparison to, say, Silliman's, which are what
they are, like Popeye ("I yam what I yam") (a coat hanger is a coat hanger,
direct, even though it may be analytically "parsed" into different kinds,
designating a kind of change over time, namely product change, then
juxtaposed to the unchanging, comforting memory-smell of the public library
he grew up with - both scenarios domestic-orientated, i.e. private: coat
hangers, growing up: unlike the _public_ library, whose fate is left out of
these stanzas that Brian cites on his blog today).

Silliman's nouns are often poised in denotation - like birds on a wire
(thankyou, Leonard). But the proper nouns "fairy / decorator" and "hermit /
heiress" bounce all over in various semantic registers, partly of course
because they are proper nouns (and not nouns proper), and partly (relatedly)
because much of this poem is about symbolizing social rank (in descending
scale, from rich heiress to rich skunks).

There is social evaluation going on in Non as well, and it happens between
the seemingly objective sentences/stanzas - in those gaps. The denotative
level of the noun, and all objective mastery of the stanza organized around
an image, simply, wildly explode into uncontrollable, chaotic figural
registers of the social, when one attempts to understand how the stanzas
juxtapose with each other. In fact with Non (and with The Alphabet in
general), not to ride a cliche of how to read this work too much (there are
other ways, but this one is well known, as you know), most of the reading
happens between the stanzas/sentences, not in the stanzas/sentences
themselves. Without reading for that gap, the sentences/stanzas will fall
flat. That semantic gap is always changing, even when the content of the
stanzas might not change that much thematically (birds, people,
interior/exterior descriptions, etc). In between, the connections are
unpredictable, but, more importantly, they are _unpredicted_ by the author.

In Lowell, the denotative and connotative are not separated levels, as they
are in Silliman (ie denotation at level of sentence and stanza; connotation
as occuring between the sentences/stanzas). In Lowell, they occur more
traditionally in the word, together, as in the "fairy/decorator" stanza. And
this under Jeffrey's "C": Lowell's visit to the Magic Workshop, his liking
to Helen Adam's "pixy" verse, etc. Blaser queering Spencer's "Faerie
Queene." The fairies in Spicer's Holy Grail. Can't these be in there too,
bouncing around in the word fairy? There's no stable image in the stanza, it
seems. I was thrown by the sea, a motif in the poem, in part. Yeats's fairy
stories, linked to the sea, etc. Fisherman/decorator seem to be competing
schemas in the stanza, yes, and no. One is never in doubt in Non, at this
level.

Intriguing lines in _Non_, to me, are the opening ones:

                                        So then go back
                                                  to the old forms
                           as if they were forms at all (9)

Back to the "old forms" of being a perceiver in the New American present
tense (not down to the ships of history, as in Pound)?

_Non_ is dedicated to Jackson Mac Low. Jackson went back to "old forms," in
a manner of speaking (i.e. "as if they were forms at all") starting with,
e.g., _Twenties_.

So too, a little later in _Non_:

                Ted's sonnets
                mimic Jackson exactly (14)

Berrigan also went back to an old form, the sonnet - only to reinvent it
precisely as if the sonnet wasn't ever really mimicable as a form, or ever
really about form in purely the formalist's sense in the first place.

What's Ron, then, going back to? His own "new" sentence. So, in the opening
lines: this is admittedly old form.

This disclaimer about form in the opening lines of _Non_ - that, in other
words, _Non_ is not going to be about new forms - enables him to concentrate
on infusing his given understanding of form sheerly with descriptive social
content, happening in mostly an indistinctly cloudlike, spatially
floatational way across the page (but there is also prose etc).

(As a sidenote to footnote 8 about flarf on the post about retro-chic on
Silliman's blog the other day, for what it's worth, let me say that this
line about Berrigan and Mac Low, above, is what I think flarf is doing.
Chronologically, the Mac Low work in question here is not Twenties,
obviously, but rather his chance-determined stuff, Stanzas for Iris Lezak,
say. Berrigan imitates chance-determination, and in this sense aestheticizes
twice over, like flarf.)

What about this, where the doubt theme surfaces as in my reading of the
Lowell stanza on UBPoetics yesterday:

                                Titles
                are often misleading,
                subtitles seldom are.
                                        Checking
                                 out the driver
                                in the next car
                through my rear view mirror
                                at a stop light
                                 (one never sees
                the lower body),
             thin ebony man
                 with a long white beard,
                         tricolor rasta cap,
             high sharp cheekbones
            that cause the eyes to recede.
                I decide he's a gentle person.
            Rolls of roofing
                        turned upright,
                         black cylinders atop the gravel.
                                                   There comes a moment
                                                 whenever
                                     I read my poem when
                                                 it is apparent
                                     it is terrible
                                                   I'm a fraud,
                                    no one would ever
                                        choose to hear
                                     or to read this,
                 but then this moment of panic passes. (N/O 60)

When you read the sentences as discreet units, it's pretty
straight-forwardly denotational. But, reading the gaps between these
sentences render the sentences completely wild, unpredicted (since the text
is so overdetermined with details, it would be impossible to stay in control
of their interconnections), unconscious even. Here Silliman reads the
"subtitle" of the guy in the car behind him, whose "title" refers to his
physical description: "thin ebony man," etc. So, the guy is black, and is
advancing on the white narrator, but the "advance" (i.e. suddenly we are no
longer in a world of pure, objective-seeming denotation!) is benign ("he's a
gentle person"): one can go allegorical here. This "advance" is benign
probably because the man is old (eyes receding somewhat) just like the
narrator admits of himself (and this ties again to the opening motif of old
form). Now the next juxtaposition: how does one account for it? It has to be
accounted for. The juxtaposition are not themselves arbitrary: the
stanzas/sentences are. The skin color of the older gentleman who is in a car
behind the narrator-driver now becomes (and at the same time importantly
does _not_ become) the black color of roofing tiles!!? This image's social
evaluation is very ambiguous. It is work-to-be-done, of _new_ roofing and of
refurbishing - but, is it regentrification, or evidence of upward mobility
(whose?), or completely unrelated to housing and instead about industrial
expansion (we don't know the narrator's location)? This image becomes the
next "title," and its "subtitle" is the following sentence, which seems to
carry the emotions the narrator experiences at the sight of the roofing
material: self-doubt about his own work-to-be-done as poet. The syntactic
wonkiness of the middle phrases of this sentence ("whenever / I read my poem

Louis,

I think you are reading the Silliman poem (from N/O) a bit heavily. I get
no sense of the "thin ebony man" advancing on the speaker at all. He's just
"in the next car," and this is a casual checking out of another, in
traffic, as we do. Also, in the "high sharp cheekbones . . .cause the eyes
to recede" -- I see no indication in that that this is an older man at all,
as you say. So there is no advance, not necessarily the age, and the man is
"gentle," which is far different than the "benign" in your reading, as only
what was feared to be threatening would then be found to be benign. And I
read the shift, then, to "Rolls of roofing" simply as a movement of the
eyes to something else, with that drop in attention then giving way to a
self-aware moment of panic about oneself. Encounter with other, shift away,
shift to self. Perhaps at most the speaker sees the other as "real" and
then shifts to the real, industrial substance of roofing materials, and for
a moment does not think of himself as "real" in the same way. That doubt is
the moment of panic, not the sense of any threat that turns out to be
benign. You're right that the juxtapositions are not arbitrary, but the
import seems much more personal here than social, in fact a true social
interaction would be quite different than this vision in traffic where one
remains isolated, in the car, disconnected, therefore thrust back on
oneself. Yet just as the driver in the other car will eventually pass or
turn or otherwise not be a part of the speaker's immediate consciousness,
so will the roofing material, and the moment of self-doubt, so in this
sense an emotional sensation becomes the equivalent of the other driver and
the industrial material, as "real" as anything, and as intermittent as
anything. The poem is about such intermittency, the nature of experience,
be it sensual or mental, as much as it is about the self-doubt or the
encounter (really the lack of encounter) with an other.

Maybe the "black rolls of roofing" is referring to the damp-proofing
that goes down before a flat roof is covered in pea gravel and tar. It's
rolled out on the edges to meet, and tuck just under, the flashing.
These rolls are standing up on the roof in "cylinders" wrapped in thin
brown paper. When you roll it out it tends to lick up, "turned up," at
the ends. The fraud here is the poet's knowledge of the process of
roofing which he has inverted by putting the physical pieces of roofing
in an imagined reverse order. There shouldn't be any gravel up there
yet.

The colors of the people would have to be considered in light of roofers
who are generally becoming black as the tar in the kettle, glub glub
drub, and the torch in their hands crispssssssssssssssss them. The break
allows us to forecast the driver's identity as past and the rasta cap as
moving us up on the roof. The breaks are the rungs in the roofer's
ladder.

Well. That's my line.
Chris

From today's Bangkok Post,

Neighbours stone Aids widow to death


Dinesh C Sharma - New Delhi

An HIV-positive woman was stoned to death by her neighbours in a village
in South India's Andhra Pradesh state known for its hi-tech image the
world over.

The attack took place on July 4 in Kuppam, the home constituency of
state chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

Ponnamma, 30, had lost her husband who was suffering from Aids, and she
had also tested HIV-positive. Her neighbours first wanted her to leave
the village, but when she did not do so they killed her.

``On that gruesome day, some persons attempted to carry away the bench
on which she was lying. Sensing that her life was in danger, she tried
to get up and run away. She was then chased, stoned and hit with the
bench, killed and burnt,'' says R Meera of Women's Initiatives (WINS),
an NGO which investigated the case after it was reported in a local
daily.

``This is a glimpse of the dark underbelly of our society,'' observed Ms
Meera.

The incident has been condemned by several organisations working for
Aids prevention in India.

In a letter to President APJ Abdul Kalam, Brian Haill, the president of
Australian Aids Fund Inc, said: ``We ask you to offer your assurance to
the people of India so that such a hideous response to the presence of
HIV/Aids among your people can never be repeated, and we ask for your
comfort for the family of the woman involved and the wide publication of
this appalling event as part of your national response to the Aids
pandemic.''

For India itself, struggling to get to grips with its huge HIV infection
rates, Mr Haill said, this dreadful act would do nothing to do away with
the ignorance and fear associated with HIV/Aids and which must be
confronted head-on for the sake of India's future.

India has close to four million HIV-positive cases, and Andhra Pradesh
is among the states reporting high rates of infection.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

[This article from The Boston Globe is gorgeous. It reminds me distantly of=
=20
an aphorism from Solzhenitsyn that I have favored recently, ""If only there=
=20
were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were=20
necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But=20
the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human=20
being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"]

"Bush's war against evil
By James Carroll, 7/8/2003

IN THE GOTHIC splendor of the National Cathedral, that liturgy of trauma,=20
George W. Bush made the most stirring - and ominous - declaration of his=20
presidency. It was Sept. 14, 2001. ''Just three days removed from these=20
events,'' he said, ''Americans do not yet have ''the distance of history.''=
=20
But our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks=
=20
and rid the world of evil.''

The statement fell on the ears of most Americans, perhaps, as mere rhetoric=
=20
of the high pulpit, but as the distance of history lengthens, events show=20
that in those few words the president redefined his raison d'etre and that=
=20
of the nation - nothing less than to ''rid the world of evil.'' The=20
unprecedented initiatives taken from Washington in the last two years are=20
incomprehensible except in the context of this purpose.
President Bush, one sees now, meant exactly what he said. Something=20
entirely new, for Americans, at least, is animating their government. The=20
greatest power the earth has ever seen is now expressly mobilized against=20
the world's most ancient mystery. What human beings have proven incapable=20
of doing ever before, George W. Bush has taken on as his personal mission,=
=20
aiming to accomplish it in one election cycle, two at most.

What the president may not know is that the worst manifestations of evil=20
have been the blowback of efforts to be rid of it. If one can refer to the=
=20
personification of evil, Satan's great trick consists in turning the fierce=
=20
energy of such purification back upon itself. Across the distance of=20
history, the most noble ambition has invariably led to the most ignoble=20
deeds. This is because the certitude of nobility overrides the moral qualm=
=20
that adheres to less transcendent enterprises. The record of this deadly=20
paradox is written in the full range of literature, from Sophocles to=20
Fyodor Dostoyevski to Ursula K. LeGuin, each of whom raises the perennial=20
question: What is permitted to be done in the name of ''ridding the world=20
of evil''?

Is lying allowed? Torture? The killing of children? Or, less drastic, the=20
militarization of civil society? The launching of dubious wars? But wars=20
are never dubious at their launchings. The recognition of complexity -=20
moral as well as martial - comes only with ''the distance of history,'' and=
=20
it is that perspective that has begun to press itself upon the American=20
conscience now.

Having forthrightly set out to rid the world of evil, first in Afghanistan,=
=20
then in Iraq, has the United States, willy-nilly, become an instrument of=20
evil? Lying (weapons of mass deception). Torture (if only by US=20
surrogates). The killing of children (''collaterally,'' but inevitably).=20
The vulgarization of patriotism (last week's orgy of bunting). The=20
imposition of chaos (and calling it freedom). The destruction of alliances=
=20
(''First Iraq, then France''). The invitation to other nations to behave in=
=20
like fashion (Goodbye, Chechnya). The inexorable escalation (''Bring 'em=20
on!''). The made-in-Washington pantheon of mythologized enemies (first=20
Osama, now Saddam). The transmutation of ordinary young Americans (into=20
dead heroes). How does all of this, or any of it, ''rid the world of evil''?

Which brings us back to that Gothic cathedral of a question: What is evil=20
anyway? Is it the impulse only of tyrants? Of enemies alone? Or is it tied=
=20
to the personal entitlement onto which America, too, hangs its bunting? Is=
=20
evil the thing, perhaps, that forever inclines human beings to believe that=
=20
they are themselves untouched by it? Moral maturity, mellowed across the=20
distance of history, begins in the acknowledgement that evil, whatever its=
=20
primal source, resides, like a virus in its niche, in the human self. There=
=20
is no ridding the world of evil for the simple fact that, shy of history's=
=20
end, there is no ridding the self of it.

But there's the problem with President Bush. It is not the moral immaturity=
=20
of the texts he reads. Like his callow statement in the National Cathedral,=
=20
they are written by someone else. When the president speaks, unscripted,=20
from his own moral center, what shows itself is a bottomless void.

To address concerns about the savage violence engulfing ''postwar'' Iraq=20
with a cocksure ''Bring `em on!'' as he did last week, is to display an=20
absence of imagination shocking in a man of such authority. It showed a=20
lack of capacity to identify either with enraged Iraqis who must rise to=20
such a taunt or with young GIs who must now answer for it. Even in=20
relationship to his own soldiers, there is nothing at the core of this man=
=20
but visceral meanness.

No human being with a minimal self-knowledge could speak of evil as he=20
does, but there is no self-knowledge without a self. Even this short=20
''distance of history'' shows George W. Bush to be, in that sense, the=20
selfless president, which is not a compliment. It's a warning.

In just a while, I'm heading to the mall to a t-shirt shop to have one
or two t-shirts printed up that say, quite simply:

I'm Not Evil

You're Not Evil


No matter who your candidate is, this message has to be out there.  We
have to cut the legs out from under the fear-mongering.

I urge you to go have a similar t-shirt printed up.

Bush considers Iraq uranium issue closed <s/15341>
Not a new idea, obviously, but this seems so obviously the same
psychodynamically as an abusive step-father (Bush) forcibly married (his
Supreme Court backers, or other tribal heads, make the call on his
election/marriage) to unempowered wife ("feminine"/humanistic side of U.S.
society) and responds to further abuse (that's obvious) and request to
discuss feelings/objections (anti-Bush sentiment) with traditional dominator
(http://prometheus.educ.ncat.edu/users/smithtg/guilford/students/applefield/
eisler.html ) male discounting of feelings and patriarchical "control"
("Shutup!  The case is closed.  I do not want to hear anything more about
it.  I'll say what is right and wrong and what is allowed, and I will not
permit anymore complaints about my actions").

I know...  This is extremely obvious...

on reading today's exchange I found the phrase "Orange A Tang" in my head, and
have been trying to think of a rain forest/NASA joke to which it could be a
potential punch line

in what part of the country is "hinge" pronounced in such a way as to rhyme
"door hinge" with "orange" ?????  the "or" "are" distinction I learned forcibly
from laughing junior high school kids when I moved from Denver to D.C.  -- they
also thought it hilarious that I pronounced "Aunt" as "ant" --

y'all know Sorrentino's orange poems?

Charles A,
I was "fairer" than perhaps I should have been, or let's say than I
originally was, before taking stuff out. Trying to emphasize how both Lowell
and Silliman perform, in very different ways, "social evaluations," I see
now thanks to you that I've psychologically "tainted" the Silliman with the
Lowell. The tension in Silliman is always _around_ value, yet the readers'
discussion will be always concretely grounded in the "sincerity &
objectification" of the image-based denotative sentences/stanzas. Whereas in
the Lowell poem, like Brian says, the value judgments are symbolically
explicit (even though I missed it on the word "fairy"!) and arguably
motivate the poem's unfolding (in Silliman, this is reversed: it is the
poem's form motivating any value judgments). Were I to be less fair, all
these shadings of completely different traditions would work their way back
in... Nevertheless, I do prefer reading a text heavily, rather than lightly,
even if it means regretting (as I often do) mistakes and oversights (e.g. I
don't focus on Non's form of the sentences/stanzas at all, for instance, as
I did in that earlier Lowell post: it's not quite, or "simply," or "in its
nature," that Non follows an "old" form of "new" sentence, it's that form is
not understood in the sense of _programmatic_ device, constraints of
Elizabethan sonnet, say [which is not to say there is no form in the work!];
and so this is a huge difference from Lowell, for whom there is a sense of
form as program, and I believe the huge unstated reason why Brian protests
against Non).

I was kidding, as I don't think that family studies is in any way waiting in the
wings to sweep women's or men's or queer studies back off the stage.  But if we
think ecologically, it ought to.  Also, if we are really trying to help poor
people, we have to think about why they're poor.  Most poor people are poor
because their families have exploded.  Stress, pressure, desire for the
neighbor, whatever, all these things can blow a family up.  What keeps a family
together?  This is bordering on kitsch, I realize that.  Looking over the
drug-store counter at Norman Rockwell turf, but what the hell -- all the
sociological studies show that family is still important and there is no other
real crucible of caring in this country at all, and isn't going to be anything
that replaces it in the next century, insofar as I'm aware.  But then I'm one of
the few poets or academics I know who likes his family.  Most hate them, it
seems to me.  For me, life wouldn't function without one.

But to put a nicer spin on this, just to think ecologically would be good, no?
People with families that they like have a source of meaning and strength and
financial support that those without do not.  If this is the maker or breaker of
people, we ought to think more about them.  A lot of poetry celebrates random
desire.  I can't think of much contemporary poetry that celebrates or even
discusses families except in the most vicious way (Sylvia Plath on her dad, for
example).

Although I have to say to Arielle -- I think you're right -- women still bear
the brunt of child-bearing (I don't know of any man who has carried a child for
nine months), and then the nursing, the staying at home, the caesura in the
career, etc. etc.  We should ask Alice Notley and the Berrigans generally.
Also, I do think there is a place for mother/children poetry, and wouldn't want
to say that I need to have a dad in that anthology just for some kind of reverse
affirmative action reasons.  I'm just noodling about with the idea.  But then,
too, don't forget that I'm a Lutheran and all you've heard from Garrison Keillor
is right.  We do like green jello, and holiday dinners with extended families.
So perhaps it's just my values, ok, and the rest is special pleading.  Beats me.

THE LAST CHAPTER

On 12 July of the year 2003
the following news flash circled the earth:
a bomber squadron of the Air Police
will exterminate the whole of humanity.

The World Government, it was reported, had concluded
that its plan to create universal peace
could not be realized in any other way
than by poisoning all those concerned.

To try to escape, it was said, was pointless.
Not one soul could be allowed to survive.
The new poison gas could reach every hiding place.
There was no need even to take one=92s own life.

On 13 July a thousand planes left Boston
laden with gas and bacilli and circling
the globe they committed  the murder
ordered by the World Government.

The humans crawled whining under their beds,
ran to hide in their cellars and in the woods.
The poison hung yellow like clouds above the cities.
Millions of corpses lay strewn on the asphalt.

Everyone thought it possible to somehow escape death.
Nobody escaped death, and the world became empty.
The poison was everywhere, tiptoeing silently all over.
It ran along the deserts. It swam across the seas.

The humans lay there like rotting sheaves.
Others hung like dolls from windows.
The animals in the zoo screamed horribly before they died.
And slowly the great blast-furnaces went out.

Steamboats tottered on the oceans, laden with their dead.
And neither weeping nor laughter was there in the world.
The planes erred, with a thousand dead pilots,
below the heavens and fell burning into the fields.

Now humanity has finally achieved what it wanted,
though the method was not markedly humane.
The earth was finally still and content and totally
pacified it rolled along its well-known elliptic orbit.

"The Grand Permission: New Writings on Poetics
and Motherhood, from Wesleyan"

Look I am sure there are many fine essays in this book, etc.
I am objecting to the title. I frankly cannot imagine too many of our
mother/ poets, and their partner father/poets and/or just fathers as putting
the mother/poet on a pedestal  identified here as "The Grand Permission."
Ouch and again Ouch. I think it's totally contrary to at least my
experience, and I suspect it the case of many, if not most, at least anyone
in a contemporary relationship in which the balance of gender and/or
parenting power (and permission and time to write) is continually negotiated
- and it ain't easy - no matter the gender of the couples etc., etc. At
least, I assume this is familiar territory !

So I see this title as conservative that reconfirms a  stereotype best
instantly buried. I suspect my reaction to this title would be similar to
waking up as an involved father and finding that instead of the Parent &
Teachers Associations (PTA), the organization was suddenly renamed as the
Mothers & Teachers Association (MTA). (Though rightfully or "left-fully"
PTA's ought to be called PTCA's (Parent, Teachers and Children's
Associations!).
God knows - literally - under Bush,  faith-based conservative evangelicals
would prefer MTA's to PTA's.

And this is not to say institutional reality on the ground has progressively
changed that much, making the struggle still hard for much permission,
genders notwithstanding. Traditional family archetypes are ages old and real
tough to crack. And families - including poet couples  break up or almost do
over these contested power issues all the time.

And yes, as a parent writer of either gender, living in this
changing/challenging territory inevitably provokes writing in which these
issues may or may not be a transparent thread - but there if you look, and
if not, provision of the opportunity to take on the frontier and write your
own! Of which I - among many others - have implicitly done a lot!

Stephen Vincent

















My own children I have written about continuously as a part of the
interweave of my daily life and coping with the father issue, partners, etc.
But to make children an imperative part of ones writing is no imperative

Kirby: Don't believe everything you read. Families that are economically
threatened to begin with tend to become moreso if suddenly there's one
breadwinner instead of two, but the divorces of all those hollywood types
didn't bring down malnutrition upon their children.

As to emotional health, there's no real concensus. First, since family has
always meant different things in different populations, it's difficult to
generalize. The nuclear family is a very recent invention (largely, I
suspect, of the real estate developers who gave us the one and two bedroom
apartment), and it hasn't taken over in all circumstances. The extended
families of West Indians (in the US as well as in the islands), for
instance, in which male parental figures may be somewhat transitory, tend
to do a hell of a good job at nurturing. Among the Hopi, perhaps the oldest
coherent cultural unit in the US, divorce has always been frequent, a man
coming home and finding his tools and clothing outside the door (women own
all real property). Even whole neighborhoods in some ethnic groups
(Hillary's "village") function as families, the children being everyone's
concern.

But even the studies that purport to show that the kids of middle class
anglo nuclear families that split up have a harder time as grownups than
those from intact nuclear families are controversial, because they often
lack control groups and almost always lack adequate control groups (as to
size and the existence of other variables).

By the way, I'm another of those guys who made significant sacrifices (and
well worth it) to care for a child. Joan went to law school while I worked
at a series of part time jobs so that I could be at home with Carlos. As to
my career as poet the long hiatus between books and my prolonged
disappearance from the haunts of poets were also because my attention was
focused elsewhere.

In these matters it's very hard to know from the outside what the balance is.

Years ago I went out with a young Lutheran psychiatrist who liked to grab
my genitals during church services--the transgression and my discomfort got
her off. Garrison Keilor, who if I remember correctly wasn't raised
Lutheran, hasn't got around to talking about her yet.

Forgive me, but what makes the category of poet any
different than worker when it comes to women and
mothering? Do you really think poets are so special
that they have more refined experiences than other
working women who have children?  And yes, there are
some experiences of parenting that are unique to
mothers, but your generation doesn't have some
exclusive and unique perspective.  you just think you
do.  There have always been creative women who worked
and raised children, frequently alone.  They just
didn't get famous.

I seem to be on the kitsch thread today.  I remember reading once that
Grandma Moses, the amazing painter, didn't start her artistic career
until she was 88 because before that she was so busy with kids,
grandkids, etc.  It was only at 88 that she got free of it all.

I never really write about my family, unless I do it in a closed door
session.  I prefer to write about things like street lamps and door
knobs and ants.

There are emotional traps in writing about the family -- black holes
where you can disappear into the kitsch.

The emotions are so big you can't really concentrate on them.  And those
people who do write a lot about families -- like John Irving or Garrison
Keillor -- seem to disappear into the black holes of kitsch really
frequently.  There's Dylan Thomas' poem to his dying dad.  But how about
just dinner table poems?  Do those exist?

Maybe it's not a big enough event -- like the extinction of the world by
the German poet that Pierre has posted.  That's a poem-sized event, put
off into the future far enough that it could be got into perspective.

Most Lutheran poetry is kitsch.  It reminds me of the little girls with
big eyes in black velvet paintings.  Even pictures of Christ often fall
into that category.  What is kitsch anyways?  Kundera defined it as an
art that tries to hide the shitty side of things.  This is in the
Unbearable Lightness.  But I don't remember that he ever risks writing
about delicate feelings unless they are heavily charged with eroticism.
He's got that modernist playboy thing down.

Is it possible to write about families well?  I can't think of anybody
who's ever done it.

Me, I'm sticking with doorknobs and street lamps.

It was broken, like my grandfather's fob-watch, that I took apart,
after so many hands, and could not restore. Then again

I was just seven, but now IT was powdering
into crumbs of coherence, into strained webs of collapse.

Generations persist, and fall. Hugh Masakela says

on every happening day.

Somewhere something ticked. Tocked.
Conscience it was, surviving like a clock.

Ace of Clubs


We have made peace possible? Not in our lifetimes, by George

"or whether to hang tight to the supple way a newborn flipper can move
in the sand, grabbing and stroking, knuckles working under the shiny dark
skin"

"old bony man came dragging by again, washing his hands of
the whole deal. Nobody paid us much mind at first. The aides
went off to the Nurse's Station, leaving us standing in the day"

It was beginning to look like the American public was never going to notice.
They have done a tsunami job keeping Americans from paying attention
about the absolutely moribund manufacturing sector, about the decline
in employment (except in the government, where jobs are blossoming like
dogwoods)

Hard to pin down the life of time, without a heart beat.
If I had a medal, if I had a metal plate
screwed to my synapses, if international conflict
transformed consciousness, I'd enlist now, I'd end.
Unscheduled, unrepentant, the train formed its own tracks

"breached but declined to elaborate.
the information could have been acquired.
There were a number of identity theft cases
being investigated where the common denominator
appeared to be that they all were blood donors.
dispatchers couldn't trace the call and listened helplessly while he begged
for his life"

The answer in the stitching, these mountains
are waiting, child of the wind. They're catching
up to him, new crop of reality, invulnerability
disappeared. Is there a safer place
to put the gas? I'm too busy watching smoke
come out of every orifice in your head,
buses still running in Baghdad

Here in Buffalo we pronounce orange : moww-anngg-hen, or sometimes in winter
or the odd festival week it is pronounced as : kn-oqu-elante; but that is
getting to be old hat.

Don't throw those words out, Geoff. Poets have a better chance of rhyming
them than orange.

By the way, why hasn't anybody mentioned "Then Blue Silk," which is the rest
of title tile of Mingus's "Orange was the color of her dress"?

Orange was the color of her dress, then blue silk
But all the colors changed when I spilled a glass of milk
on it.

Definitely much easier for rhyming.

All,

Wondering if anyone would be willing to help me out with some readings. I'll
be in San Diego towards the end of August and reading in San Francisco
around the 24th...does anyone have any connections w/ radio stations in San
Diego? or for that matter anywhere else?( I live in Western MA, but would be
willing to make some sort trips) I ask because I've got a book coming out in
August called The Frequencies, which uses FM radio frequencies as a sort of
organizing principle, and I'd love to read from it over the air... (please
b/c: noaheligordon@hotmail.com)

some samples are here:

Does anybody know when the idea of the family first started?  You know, mom, pop
and a few kids?  Is this a recent invention, as Mark Weiss says?

It's there in Louisa May Alcott -- which is nineteenth century.

Let's see, going back -- it appears to be there in Shakespeare -- in Titus
Andronicus, for instance, or in Hamlet, or in King Lear.

It seems already to be pretty strong in Homer -- Odysseus, Penelope, and
Telemachus.  And it's outraged by Agamemnon.  All those who go against the family
appear to die as early as that -- the wife-stealers, and all the others.

I think in Indian literature it's also very strong, especially more recently.

It's NOT there in a lot of lyric poetry from Baudelaire at least forwards.  But in
longer stories, and plays, it seems to be there.  This is just off the top of my
head.  Has anybody worked on this?

The whole idea of Jane Austen seems to be to try to find a suitable person to start
a family with.  Mark, could you say more about Hopi practices?  How are the Hopi
doing these days, by the way?

However there is a word which rhymes with 'orange' - it's 'morange' used
in the midlands in England -

"Compost Heaps and Moranges

Several people have asked me to define the difference between a compost
heap and a morange.

A compost heap is an organised affair based on well-researched scientific
principles. The aim of a compost heap is to rot organic material down in
such a way that internal heat destroys most weed seeds while retaining the
nutriments plants have taken from soil and air. Ideally all the material
needed for the creation of a compost heap should be added at the time of
its creation in several layers of different consistencies. Some of those
layers may consist of kitchen waste and even animal remains if the heap
can be protected from foxes and rats. The addition of saved buckets of
urine will hasten the rotting process. A compost heap should be covered to
retain heat.

A morange is a much simpler affair. It consists solely of weeds, ideally
added in layers, leaving time between each layer for rooted weeds to dry
out. A morange will not kill off weed seeds. In the best moranges there
should be no weeds that have reached flowering stage."

This is from
http://www.landofbrokenpromises.co.uk/garden/archives/2000_07/july.htm

Here is more from the writer - Margaret Penfold - who I stayed with in
Nottingham while speaking at Incubation -

"The English word "morange" you used to illustrate a dialect word, is the
only one I know of in English, to describe the casual heaps of weeds left
to decay in situ for recycling.  Any good gardener will tell you this is
certainly not a compost heap, so I would suggest that 'morange' is not a
dialect word but a main stream word even if it has been woefully neglected
by the dictionaries.

And now I need to close down my computer and  get myself into holiday mood
from which I will return a septuagenarian."

  SATURDAY NIGHT READINGS
  Once a month
  Beatnik Bob's Cafe
  at City Museum
  http://www.citymuseum.org/

Set in the third floor of a downtown warehouse, this old-timey 80-seat
theater is a very popular and fabulous independent venue for music,
film, and poetry. The museum itself contains hundreds of St. Louis
architectural and cultural artifacts, as well as a multi-story slide
and several HUGE concrete whales. The tenor of the reading is
accordingly ironic/carnivalesque, generally speaking, though we're
open to any kind of literary spectacle. Some readings will include a
musical act--a local fiddler, banjoist, slide-guitarist or the like.

If you would like to read, or know a poet who would like to read,
please contact me at aaron@belz.net. We are already booked through
August.

Thanks.

Kirby, I never said that the family is a recent invention, I said the
nuclear family is. A very different proposition.

But as to the examples you give--family doesn't always mean the same thing.
In Homeric times, for instance, family was also the primary political unit,
especially among the ruling class, and extended family included many not
related by blood--remember the old shepherd who greets Odysseus upon his
return?  The rules of honor had little to do with affection and a lot to do
with the structure of society. Agamemnon's children would have barely
remembered their father but had to kill to right the social balance.

Traditional Hopi culture is matriarchal and matrilocal, and a great many
Hopi (I don't have the figures, but it's a substantial percentage) remain
traditional, to the extent of eschewing tourist income by forbidding or
restricting entry by outsiders, even to many of the plaza dances that used
to be tourist staples.

I had the good fortune to be invited to an informal party at Polacca. A lot
of food, a lot of happy noise, and a constant drift of people, mostly women
and children. The grown men sat in the corners very subdued. I asked a few
of them whether women still owned the houses and gardens and the old
divorce rules still held, and they affirmed that among the traditional they do.

It's not hard to read official Hopi ambivalence about the impositions of
the outside world into the following from
http://www.hopi.nsn.us/Pages/Government/Hopi_3.htm:

>In 1936 a constitution was prepared for the Hopi Tribe by the federal

This, remember, is the official line as stated by the non-traditionals. The
facts on the ground are more contentious.

There are an enormous number of books about the Hopi. I don't claim
exhaustive knowledge, but I'd recommend the circa 1940 "Sun Chief: The
Autobiography of a Hopi Indian." The protagonist was removed from the
reservation and sent to an assimilative boarding school by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs as a a child; as an adult he returned to traditional life.
The narrative includes an inside view of the conflict within the villages
after 1934.

The locus classicus is Frank Waters' "Book of the Hopi," which means it's
both universally read in the field and subject to revisionism.

A lot has been made (by Whorf among others) of the fact that the Hopi
language has, if I remember correctly, no past or future tenses.  This
became in the minds of some an indication of a special Budda-like
sacredness. All of this should be taken with not a grain, but a mine of salt.

The Hopi suffer from the poverty afflicting most Indian tribes. They're not
likely in the near future to try to ameliorate their condition with massd
tourism or casinos--too alien to their culture. On the entire reservation
there are two motels, total rooms less than 30, and, if memory serves, one
campground with no facilities. There are a lot of jewelry, kachina doll and
pottery shops.

Hopi was never conquered. When the Spanish tried to the Hopi rolled
boulders off the cliffs where they lived and the Spanish gave it up. The
hopi never fought the US and retained by treaty significant control over
their own internal affairs. So Christianity is recent and, as in the other
puebloan cultures, a decidedly mixed thing--there are a couple of churches,
but there are kivas everywhere, and the old ceremonies thrive.

The hopi figured out earlier than most tribes that they needed good
lawyers--they've successfully reversed an 1895 US ruling dividing the
territory between Hopi land and the Navajo reservation that surrounds it.
This has created no end of chaos, especially for the Navajo.

The hopi have by and large done better than most Indian tribes.

how Coyote created straw

One harsh winter when few sycamore seed pods were hanging and stepping on
the ground was like stepping on dismembered Lego zoids with bare feet and
cornstalks shivered in the wind like anorexic cornmaidens Coyote was
freezing his balls off like the sycamores their seed pods. Coyote stopped
and looked up at a great wall like a shard of grey sky stuck upright in the
ground blocking his aimless wandering. The wall was the back of the JAS
Plastic extrusion factory in an industrial park in Hilliard, Ohio. He had
wandered off his usual mappe mundi bounded by Mudsock at Roberts and
Alton-Darby Creek, and he wound up beyond Buckeye Yard where the great iron
horses grazed on the coin-bending tracks. O is my bongara getting cold in
its box, he moaned, for his balls were ready to break if he did not
ejaculate. It was third shift, graveyard shift, and warmth and light
emanated from the factory entrance and Coyote slunk in the open door propped
by a shimmy from a splintered pallet. Palate, like the retro-flexing tongue
lolling in Coyote's mouth as he sat panting in the middle of the work floor.
The great prepuce extracting machine had broken down and needed adjusting.
Coyote unwound his bongara from its box and from around his neck like a
garden hose and stuck it in at one end of the long trough filled with warm
water that cooled off the hot plastic strung out the length of it before it
entered another hole on the other side of which the flywheel with a razor
blade cut off the hardened plastic into neat lengths of drinking straw or
those little stirrers used to stir the cream from Lilliputian cups poured
into coffee in the morning. Coyote's bangara had just about warmed  up when
it came to the second hole and, Motherfuck, the dammed thing is cutting my
bongara up into little pieces so people can suck me off for eternity or
until at least the oil industry falls through and we have to go back to
making moonshine.

Imagism often heightens confusion.  The eye often deceives.

Around these here parts we call oranges "testicles."

In a native spirit I had my testicles removed and replaced with limes.
Limes are of the same genus as "oranges" and roughly shaped like testicles.

They were simply not big enough and lacked authenticity.  So I replaced them
with oranges.

Around here, when you want to squeeze someone's oranges, you say, "I want to
squeeze your balls."

Or when we want to drink orange juice we say, "I want to drink some testicle
juice."

Or, "suck my balls."  Goes over quite well at the kids' soccer games.

I was born here. Coughing
unused cigarette smoke
into the creep of
a fan. I was born here

once again at this edge of
not knowing, Killed
slovenly by your
tucked-in hours, ashamed:

with amber light taut and
frigid as memory around
my throat. Born, not breathing;
breached by your promise, your

glint of orange and yellow of
forgiveness; so that here, four
hundred miles away, I flip

to the error of belly-soft and
talon-poised, just to hear you
coo for me, to break our wings on
water frozen closed. The air

has no parentage, no progeny;

I love its loneliness even as I grip
your ghost in moaning, drill

through my breath clear to
my father's grave, attached
by umbillical to this live feed
not found of myself, of myself

all fondness and mercy. Sentient beings
are numberless, I vow to liberate them all;


with a tiny slit in my mind I have
flattened my breath to fit
into my birth; and I spin.
I spin the air all over you.

Call for papers, presentations, and experimental texts for

Re-Reading Louis Zukofsky=B9s Bottom: on Shakespeare
A symposium for poets, scholars, students and teachers

On October 31st and through November 1st, 2003 Poetics at Buffalo will =
hold
a two-day symposium on Louis Zukofsky=B9s seminal work of criticism, =
Bottom:
on Shakespeare. In addition to readings and presentations by Bob Perelman,
Mark Scroggins and others, this symposium will comprise two workshops
organized to discuss new approaches to this difficult but dazzlingly
suggestive work, recently republished by Wesleyan University Press. The
first session, to be moderated by Bob Perelman, will focus on Bottom as a
work of criticism; the second, co-moderated by Gregg Biglieri and Louis
Cabri, will address Bottom as an extension of Zukofsky=B9s poetic =
practice.

The larger goals of the symposium are as follows: to provide an initial
bridge between existing scholarship on Bottom and work being produced by =
up
and coming poets, scholars and students; and to discuss ways in which
re-reading Bottom may resituate Zukofsky, one of our most important
modernist writers and poetic thinkers, within a variety of new contexts.

Questions to consider for the first session might include the following:

- How does Bottom compare with other modernist experiments in criticism?
How might we read Bottom alongside such citation-based critical works as
Walter Benjamin=B9s Arcades Project, or the paratactically constructed
Aesthetic Theory of Theodor Adorno? What is Bottom=B9s place among similar
works by poet-scholars such as Charles Olson (Call Me Ishmael), Robert
Duncan (The HD Book), Susan Howe (My Emily Dickinson), and others?

- What are the perils and benefits of quotation as a specifically critical
method? To what extent does the tissue of citations in Bottom, from Henry
Adams, Aristotle, Bach, Marx, Spinoza, Wittgenstein, and others as well as
Shakespeare, constitute an "argument"? What is the relation of paratext to
citation in this work?

- What correlations can be made between Bottom, various musical forms, and
forms of writing?

- How might we read Zukofsky=B9s use of ellipses to highlight cited =
passages
from his source-texts, and how does his marking of passages challenge
conventional ways of reading?

- What might be ways of teaching Bottom as a text of and about =
Shakespeare?
(Here we welcome accounts of teaching the text or of encountering it in a
class.) In what ways can Bottom be read as a particularly valuable
contribution to Shakespeare studies?

Questions to consider for the second session might include the following:

- How does the role of quotation and index in Bottom shed light on their
presence in "A" and other works?

- To what extent does Zukofsky complicate notions of "authority" through
his positioning of himself and others alongside Shakespeare? Does Bottom
work to destabilize traditional conceptions of authorial identity?

- How do we account for Zukofsky=B9s formulation of the relation between =
eye
and mind in Bottom, and does this poetics of vision extend or complicate
earlier such formulations in Zukofsky=B9s poetry?

- Given that Zukofsky is throughout his career invested in pun, wit, and
wordplay, to what extent should Bottom be read "sincerely"? What is the
relationship here between "sincerity" and "ambivalence" (as Charles
Bernstein puts it in his essay "Words and Pictures")?

Abstracts of up to 250 words should be emailed by September 1st to the
following address: tdonovan@acsu.buffalo.edu. For those accepted, short
texts of 1500 words or less will be due by October 1st. All written
materials will be made available prior to the symposium.

This may be a truly interesting development, and kudos to Larry for
setting
this up. But of course we have no idea whether Howard Dean will be the
actual person at the keyboard. Given my experience with politicians (and

I've worked on a presidential campaign), it's quite likely that a
tech-savvy staffer will do the typing and Dean may review the text
before
it's posted. I have no personal knowledge of the situation so this is
just
an educated guess, based on the demands on a presidental candidate's
time.

If I'm right, this exercise becomes much less interesting. As Larry
says,
campaigns are all about "meeting different groups and talking about
ideas."
But at least in person, you know who's talking.

For all the reasons described in the cover e-mail below, that might

>For all the bloggers in the house, "Howard Dean" joins the fray.

At best it's interesting that someone in Dean's campaign thinks this
is an important way to position his candidacy.

Looking at the prospect seriously, given the amount of deleted,
unclear, mistyped, re-edited, re-entered, misunderstood, and
otherwise screwed up blog entries and exchanges among bloggers in the
poetry world (people for whom verbal expression is supposed to be
extremely important, right?), I'm not sure that I'd want a president
who spent that much of that kind of time online.

So someone else from his office presenting his ideas & positions in
some kind of online format might be just fine.

BILL GATES’:  KILLING AFRICANS FOR PROFIT AND PR. MR. BUSH’S BOGUS AIDS OFFER
Monday July 14, 2003

Bring back Jayson Blair!  The New York Times has eliminated the scourge of plagiarized journalism by eliminating journalism altogether from its front page.
Check this Sunday’s edition:  “Bill Gates is no ordinary philanthropist,” gushes a Times reporter named Stephanie Strom, re-writing one of the digital diva’s self-loving press releases. Gates has saved 100,000 lives by providing vaccines to Africans, gushes Stephanie, according to someone on the payroll of … Bill Gates.  And he’s making drugs for Africans, especially for AIDS victims, “cheaper and easier.”  Stephanie knows because she asked Bill Gates himself!

Then we get to the real point of this journalistic Lewinsky: “Those who think of Mr. Gates as a ruthless billionaire monopolist … may find it hard to reconcile that image with one of a humorously self-deprecating philanthropist.”

Actually, that’s not hard at all.

Stephanie, let me let you in on a little secret about Bill and Melinda Gates so-called “Foundation.”  Gate’s demi-trillionaire status is based on a nasty little monopoly-protecting trade treaty called “TRIPS” – the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights rules of the World Trade Organization.  TRIPS gives Gates a hammerlock on computer operating systems worldwide, legally granting him a  monopoly that the Robber Barons of yore could only dream of.  But TRIPS, the rule which helps Gates rule, also bars African governments from buying AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis medicine at cheap market prices.

Example: in June 2000, at the urging of Big Pharma, Bill Clinton threatened trade sanctions against Argentina for that nation’s daring to offer low-cost drugs to Southern Africa.

Gates knows darn well that the “intellectual property rights” laws such as TRIPS – which keep him and Melinda richer than Saddam and the Mafia combined -- are under attack by Nelson Mandela and front-line doctors trying to get cheap drugs to the 23 million Africans sick with the AIDS virus.  Gate’s brilliant and self-serving solution:  he’s spending an itsy-bitsy part of his monopoly profits (the $6 billion spent by Gates’ foundation is less than 2% of his net worth) to buy some drugs for a fraction of the dying.  The bully billionaire’s “philanthropic” organization is currently working paw-in-claw with the big pharmaceutical companies in support of the blockade on cheap drug shipments.

Gates’ game is given away by the fact that his Foundation has invested $200 million in the very drug companies stopping the shipment of low-cost AIDS drugs to Africa.

Gates says his plan is to reach one million people with medicine by the end of the decade.  Another way to read it:  he’s locking in a trade system that will block the delivery of cheap medicine to over 20 million.

The computer magnate’s scheme has a powerful ally. “The president could have been reading from a script prepared by Mr. Gates,” enthuses the Times’ cub reporter, referring to Mr. Bush’s AIDS plan offered up this week to skeptical Africans.  The US press does not understand why Africans don’t jump for Bush’s generous offer.  None note that the money held out to the continent’s desperate nations has strings attached or, more accurately, chains and manacles.  The billions offered are mostly loans at full interest which may be used only to buy patent drugs at a price several times that available from other nations.  What Africans want, an end to the devastating tyranny of TRIPS and other trade rules, is dismissed by the Liberator of Baghdad.

We are all serfs on Microsoft’s and Big Pharma’s ‘intellectual property.’  If Gates’ fake philanthropy eviscerates the movement to free Africans from the tyranny of TRIPS, then Bill and Melinda’s donations could have the effect of killing more Africans than then even their PR agents claim they have saved.  And for our own Republic, we can only hope that when the bully-boy billionaire injects his next wad of loot into the Bush political campaign, he uses a condom.

Herb,

Your post suggests that you may not understand that bloggers are a protected
species under the Environmental Poetics Agency. One mustn't criticize such
practice in any way, especially on a listserv.

By the way, kids, that discussion about "Skunk Hour" was something totally
unsuspected on the Buff List, and, thus, exemplary. It also made me take out
the old Farrar, Strauss and Giraux paperback of "Life Studies"/"For the
Union Dead" (1964, $2.25) and read the poem to my houseguests, Joanne Kyger
and Donald Guravich, famed summer instructors at Naropa. The discussion
reached a quick consensus that Lowell was pretty clearly engaging in
scurrilous (but not for the time) anti-gay commentary, much as the recently
revealed Truman diaries engaged in scurrilous (but not for the time?)
anti-Jewish commentary.

Looking at the prospect seriously, given the amount of deleted,
unclear, mistyped, re-edited, re-entered, misunderstood, and
otherwise screwed up blog entries and exchanges among bloggers in the
poetry world (people for whom verbal expression is supposed to be
extremely important, right?), I'm not sure that I'd want a president

Hi Mark,

I think there were probably very strong strictures regarding who owed what to whom
in the ancient Greek family system -- and border-line slaves like the old man who
comes out to meet Odysseus is part of the family in the way that perhaps a
life-long worker in a Japanese company is part of the family?  I don't think that
this would rule out actual affection, though, between he and Odysseus, especially
after a twenty year absence.  There was certainly affection of some kind between
Odysseus and his son Telemachus?  As there was not between Agamemnon and his wife,
since he had sacrificed their daughter to get a favorable wind from Diana.

That's another world, but it is still recognizable, as the Hopi system isn't, at
least not to me.

The family plays a very strong role in cartoon series -- Simpsons, Flintstones,
Jetsons, even the more contemporary Powerpuff Girls.  But in poetry we have to go
back to epics to get this strong sense of a family.  The amazing web of loyalty
oaths that are taken in by Agamemnon and Menelaus when they set about to revenge
the abduction/betrayal of/by Helen and Paris is part of the story.  Then there is
the web of loyalties among the gods -- the Cyclops having been one of Poseidon's
sons.  Often Zeus is backing blood-kin over others in many of the epics -- he backs
Perseus for this reason, while his wife Hera tries to get him because he's not her
son.

Another famous family mess from the period is Antigone with that huge roster of
layered bonds and wills-to-power all tightly rolled up within family roles and
obligations, combined with the problematic incest of the previous generation.  Some
myth scholars see all this as the turn from Aphrodite as the central goddess to a
more patriarchal system -- with Aphroditean times as being no links except by
desire, and the more patriarchal times -- Zeus forward -- as being the introduction
of a higher law.

JL Bachofen, the great myth scholar who was a friend of Nietzsche, wrote a book on
this called Mother Right (Mutterrecht) that attempts to see a paradigm switch
TOWARD family -- at about 5000 BC.  Many feminist scholars of the eighties tried to
turn this around and praise the prior system.  New books come out on this every
year so it's all still up in the air, as you probably know.

And you're right that it's a long way from Homer to Homer Simpson, but somehow
there is a lineage there of something important being worked out.

The Judeo-Christian thread is totally different in origin but is now intertwined
with the Greco-Roman thread of family bonds -- with the ancient Judaic peoples in
the OT with many different wives, concubines, etc.  The NT with St. Paul narrows
down to one marriage bond.  Is this better for women??  By law it's still our law
in spite of Mormon resistance.  Where exactly does the nuclear family start?  I
can't put my finger on it exactly, but it's before Homer Simpson, wouldn't you
agree?

The sixties saw a reemerge of Aphroditean sensibilities, and a new upsurge of
interest in the laws of desire.  I think this struggle marks our time.  It's
amusing to watch it play out.  The reason many started to hate Clinton is that he
broke this pact.  Nader isn't playing.  I think many sympathize with Bush in spite
of the lot of his drunken daughters because at least he appears to be playing this
monogamy game.

These thoughts are off the top of my head -- but this issue of what is a family is
somehow extremely sensitive -- going back for at least two thousand years, and
maybe more.  I see even Homer as trying to clarify this issue, and certainly
Sophocles.  Now Matt Groening is working on refining the nuclear family, no?

Thanks for the link to the Navajo idea of harmony in the Hillerman novels.  That's
a totally separate sensibility I would guess, and hasn't had any impact on America
outside of that tribe.  The Hopi, too, would be completely separate.  It's amazing
that their systems would survive.  The matrilineal is what the Aphroditean myth
scholars like Gimbutas want to bring back -- with desire as the only law.  I wonder
how much the Hopi can be compared to ancient Cretan societies, or if it can be
done.

Friendship isn't like family in that there are no obligations, and friends can be
thrown to one side.  Family, can't, at least not without massive psychic
disruption.  Am I right?

Last night in Oakland was a kind of seminal return visit of Ron Silliman to
the Bay Area where he was joined by Mary Burger in a reading at Gallery 26.
A warm evening: a fans-on initially stifling heat inside the large space
that was practically filled partly to honor  the now rare visit and reading
of the former homeboy!
I don't have time to say too much about Mary Burger's reading. She began by
reading work within rather tight and implicitly analytical Stein frames and
grammatical formulae - gradually opening up to oppose the frames from within
and then by end of the reading- opening up in much more felt sense and
vision of a dot.com Bay Area landscape in ruins. She has a highly refined
and compelling intelligence, and an authoritative & rhythmic percussive
delivery of the line. My suspicion is that the work will become more
engaging as she relaxes the semiotic critical hinges - where the language is
composed primarily in analytical measure -  and as it becomes more embraced
by the inherent, less predictable velocity of her materials.

Ron was terrific. I don't say that easily. I have been finding his blog
presence difficult - at its worst, full of pontifical drift, intellectually
flat, and factually imaginative in its historical omissions. Frankly, it
reads late night, tired, and compulsive - maybe worried that history will be
claimed by others, configured "badly", whatever. In an ironic way - no pun
intended - he perhaps unfortunately sets himself up to be a whipping boy by
the young and aspiring, rather than letting trust and silence speak his
literal now published volumes. His work is already a more than adequate and
on-going critical sign post in the textual culture.

Ron read from VOG (Voice of God - from the evangelical radio in the fifties
or contemporary Voice-over-Guy)- in the on-going saga d'alphabet. Real poems
- with tops and bottoms - were read in sequence. My own reading of the
Alphabet series has been various over the years - after first being knocked
by a couple of very early break through  works, Sunset Debris and Bart (the
one where he rides and writes non-stop on the Bart transit system through
out the Bay Area), then of course, Ketjak and Tjanting.     In VOG, as in
the early works, the eye is constantly operative. In the 1850's, shortly
after the emergence of photography, there were a group of photographers that
actually formed what they called "The Eye Club" - of which an earlier
version of Ron - I am sure - would have been a member! Indeed he uses his
eye as a pencil combined with an inveterately analytical topping. Yet,
different than a stationary photograph and more in the manner of cinema the
images keep wheeling forth in a montage of gradations and juxtapositions. If
I were to compare Ron to a photographer, it would be Gary Winogrand, who
probably possessed the quickest visual intelligence to ever shoot with a
35MM camera and whose prolific, abundant output probably compares with that
of Ron. In any case, Ron's VOG sentences seem invested in the big loop -
where they start with an image, drill down to the related images - toilet
seat down or up and then right down to the residual urine drops - and then
swoop into the issue of the consequences of when men leave the seat up or
down. Not necessarily revolving that mixed-use bathroom issue, but making
the evidence and predicament as tangibly visible as possible. The manner abd
delight of Ron's "realism" constantly plays  in opposition to a recurrent
choral refrain in the text of the "the electronic handshake" (which, of
course is a manual "digital" joke and probably a comment on the futility of
"virtual" contact.")
I won't try to paraphrase the landscapes that enter this world - that vary
from family, to dream, to air plane seat to office, to waiting for the kids
to take the bus in the morning. Ron clearly takes some of his visual markers
from Reznikoff and, implicitly, a Whitmanian reach into terms of covering by
implication the entire country. If Johnny Appleseed set out to fill the
American landscape with trees, comparatively, Ron is a farmer at harvest, a
man obsessively bent on plucking images from primarily urban and now more
suburban terrain within which the text provides a smart stock/harvest
analysis. Yet, the gathering in VOG - in contradistinction to the early
works - is divested of an inherent political optimism. The Whitman
inheritance here is full of decay, partial ruins ventilated by the
claustrophic presence of electric fans, lights, computer gadgets and
programming languages each of which appear more likely to trump growth
rather than foster it. Yes - apart from the drive of the language - I get
the impression more of a man trying to accommodate the ruins rather than
plough forth with optimism - Strom Thurmond considerably outlives Kathy
Acker the text bemoans, albeit with a tinge of dark humor. What does that
tell us (him)?
So the work, it seems, becomes more Augustan(?), eighteenth century in its
witness? I am not sure. But something in WOG seems to pull back from
revolutionary resolve  - the early belief that language will move us beyond
"this".

Appreciate your patience if you got this far. I mean - interestingly enough
- Ron's come to an odd point in his career where his strengths and limits
are being thrown up against Robert Lowell's "Skunk." Never would have Ron -
I suspect - thought the day. And yet - the interest Brian Steffans' query
essentially about Ron's absence of personal vulnerability and its corrolary
pathos and self-examination   - brings up the issue of whether or not Ron's
work is actually going towards a tragic or quietundous view of the location
of his future work. Is a darker curtain falling? And are the young wanting
the positive textual veneer to crack and see what breaks through - and what
kind of language may emerge, at the risk of engaging/confronting a possibly
impending and/or  overwhelming pathos. Is there the ghost of a Lowell under
Silliman? I am not instantly ready to imagine.
But maybe that's the new work of others, including "the young." (?)

Last night "les blogistes" were out in force so be sure to check out - if
you are interested - Stephanie Young and Kasey S. Mohamad's reviews, and any
others.
In the meantime, honor to Ron for keeping his flames on.

The nuclear family  is defined as mother, father, one or two kids, living
apart from and making decisions independent of the extended family. This is
a very recent invention and still largely limited to modern industrial
societies, and it's not universal in those.

The Greek, or for that matter the Roman, family is only recognizabvle if
you don't look too close. Upper class Romans gave their sons to other
families to be raised. In pre-industrial Europe middle- and working class
male children were separated from the family at 13 and bound in
apprenticeships.  Girls were often let out to service even younger and were
married while in their early teens. Except among the very poorest, whether
among Romans or later Europeans, the couple itself had no say in the marriage.

A docent at the Stonewall Jackson house piously explained that slaves were
really part of bthe family. So were Odysseus' servants. The lord or owner
had complete authority, and the servants/slaves were completely dependent.

In a different culture, remember the haindmaids of Rachel and Leah. The
wife's servants were erotic property of the husband, and the children had
the same status as the other kids.

It's very hard to know what affections between blood relatives or husbands
and wives described in older literature are ceremonial in nature. Royal
couples are almost invariably portrayed as amorous, for instance, whereas
we know that that was often not the case.

That matriarchy-patriarchy shift isn't taken too seriously by many
scholars. There's no evidence for it, and it's probably not finally
knowable one way or the other. The categories are anyway on the leaky side.

There is, on the other hand, an enormous amount of research on the forms of
family. Very little of it finds much commonality beyond the breeding and
nurturing of children. With all the available information there's little
need for a lot of idle speculation.

Incidentally, I don't know how ancient Greeks would have felt about the
designation Graeco-Roman, but I can tell you how I feel about
Judeo-Christian. The term originally meant pre-Pauline Jerusalem
Christians, who still saw themselves as Jewish, then it became converts to
Christianity and Jews for Jesus. Since the 30s it's been an attempted
antidote for antisemitism, on the part of Christians initially and then on
the part of some Jews. For most Jews the connection is one-way
only--there's precious little that's come from Chritianity into Judaism.
Christ of course is revered by Moslems as a prophet, so maybe when a
predominantly Christian power does something horrific enough to Moslems
we'll start having Islamo-Christians as an expression of regret.

a poor attempt...

Interviewing with the NSA Ghazal


I seriously thought the interviewer might be an alien:
when he asked: “do you plan to marry your enemy alien?”

He and I were almost an expired item
But he was “mon Stephane,” not a dangerous alien

“And the others?” the interviewer asked watching the wires
and bands which ran all over me, an alien

a cyborg, mechanical, electrical, easy to judge
unlike the hands of an unknowable alien

“You must list them,” he said, every one that you fraternized
“I had friends who were tan,  they weren’t googly-eyed aliens”

After hours, they released me, and I knew they wouldn’t hire me
good riddance! I ran from these androids and aliens

I couldn’t forget that they asked about thoughts
not just deeds I had planned but mere whisperings of the alien

and we’re none of us pure, and I don’t like the president
am I next when they come to ban all the aliens?

Mark Weiss and others interested in families/poetry:

Mark appears to think the idea of the family is historical rather than inherent or
as a given, and I would have to agree that his tight definition of the family as an
autonomous unit is recent.  However, Mark, I also feel that you are arguing that
the family is highly limiting and in some way that you have defined it as injurious
and that you are implicitly proposing an alternative.  You seem to think the Hopi
method is an improvement.  Is that your choice?  Women can simply put your things
out, and that's it?

I'm just curious if you can think of a better, um, unit?  A network of pals?  Who
is taking care of the children in this case?  In the Hopi system, if the woman puts
you out, what happens to the kids?  Are the children held in common?  How would
this work in the suburbs?  Have you thought of a better system of some kind?  If we
were to totally scrap the nuclear family, how would you raise children in some
better way?

Are you arguing that a matrilineal system is somehow better?  How do you see this
working?  I want to get back to a basic question here.  The stuff about
matriarchal/patriarchal, and its historicity is unquestionably questionable, but as
myths they continue to operate -- within certain neo-pagan feminist communities
they inspire ideas of community whether they are based on a real past community or
not.  And the patriarchal system continues to run many families -- you actually get
conservative Christians who argue that the father should make every decision in a
family.  Both of these systems are somewhat grotesque to me.  The nuclear family is
all I was given as a model.  The sixties tried communes, but I don't think any of
these are still an inspiration to younger people, and certainly not to me.  I like
privacy. So do most people, I suspect.  So most people are going to continue living
in the nuclear family.  But have you thought out an alternative?  I am almost
certainly lacking in imagination on this!  Fourier, anyone?  For all his reading of
Fourier, to my knowledge Andre Breton remained a nuclear family man, with
occasional forays into the realm of prostitution (then still legal in France, but
now I believe against the law although still practiced).  Could anyone else
respond: what is the best vehicle now for the transmission of love and protection
of the children of said love for, um, poets?  Ideas?  I've heard in San Francisco
there are "marriages" of up to dozens of people, and they rotate beds in a counter
clockwise motion -- women going one way and men in the other.  They're not aiming
at children, however, in the one commune I read about that practices this, and
after twenty years of it, no tots.  Somehow I think we have to include tots in the
equation, or else it's not a family -- but the tots can be adopted -- they don't
have to be biological children of the elders.  Breton's one child was left for
years at a time to other people, as I recall, for instance, when he went to Mexico
to meet Trotsky.

Just some comments on what Loius had written about Ron's poem a few days
back.  He is comment on the following from NON:

                                Titles
                are often misleading,
                subtitles seldom are.
                                        Checking
                                 out the driver
                                in the next car
                through my rear view mirror
                                at a stop light
                                 (one never sees
                the lower body),
             thin ebony man
                 with a long white beard,
                         tricolor rasta cap,
             high sharp cheekbones
            that cause the eyes to recede.
                I decide he's a gentle person.
            Rolls of roofing
                        turned upright,
                         black cylinders atop the gravel.
                                                   There comes a moment
                                                 whenever
                                     I read my poem when
                                                 it is apparent
                                     it is terrible
                                                   I'm a fraud,
                                    no one would ever
                                        choose to hear
                                     or to read this,
                 but then this moment of panic passes. (N/O 60)

LC writes:

"When you read the sentences as discreet units, it's pretty
straight-forwardly denotational. But, reading the gaps between these
sentences render the sentences completely wild, unpredicted (since the text
is so overdetermined with details, it would be impossible to stay in control
of their interconnections), unconscious even. Here Silliman reads the
"subtitle" of the guy in the car behind him, whose "title" refers to his
physical description: "thin ebony man," etc. So, the guy is black, and is
advancing on the white narrator, but the "advance" (i.e. suddenly we are no
longer in a world of pure, objective-seeming denotation!) is benign ("he's a
gentle person"): one can go allegorical here. This "advance" is benign
probably because the man is old (eyes receding somewhat) just like the
narrator admits of himself (and this ties again to the opening motif of old
form). Now the next juxtaposition: how does one account for it? It has to be
accounted for. The juxtaposition are not themselves arbitrary: the
stanzas/sentences are. The skin color of the older gentleman who is in a car
behind the narrator-driver now becomes (and at the same time importantly
does _not_ become) the black color of roofing tiles!!? This image's social
evaluation is very ambiguous. It is work-to-be-done, of _new_ roofing and of
refurbishing - but, is it regentrification, or evidence of upward mobility
(whose?), or completely unrelated to housing and instead about industrial
expansion (we don't know the narrator's location)? This image becomes the
next "title," and its "subtitle" is the following sentence, which seems to
carry the emotions the narrator experiences at the sight of the roofing
material: self-doubt about his own work-to-be-done as poet. The syntactic
wonkiness of the middle phrases of this sentence ("whenever / I read my poem
when / it is apparent / it is terrible") mirrors its subject, self-doubt."

It almost seems to me that Ron went back and changed the first "black" to
"ebony" in order not to have the words appear twice in two successive
sentences.  If we were to read this as a social text the way you would
choose (your reading reflects some elements of Jeff Derksen's idea of
"rearticulation" as a development of the new sentence), then you would have
to read the word "Ebony" (capital "e") in the use of the word -- i.e. this
guy has somehting to do with the magazine.  The use of "ebony" just stuck
out at me here as more a matter of creating a euphemism rather than a
stylistic flourish, since there's so little here that represents an interest
in stylistic flourishes of this sort -- it's all kind of "Man pounds rice"
language.  Just like the "the landlord" and "a dog" in other parts of the
poem.  (Ron's turn to a belle-lettrist tone on his blog is curious to me for
this very reason -- he never seemed to have an interest in elements of what
might be called "fancy" in his prose or even poetry, but all of a sudden
there is this range of affects.)

When nouns and noun phrases get pared down like this they can often,
ironically, become quite riddled with symbolism, and indeed your reading of
this slab of NON points to all sorts of correspondences between the
sentences and stanzas that are nearly as intricate as what is often said to
occur in "Skunk Hour" (or Eliot's Four Quartets, whose language is nearly
devoid of adjectives that serve a visual purpose).  I've never been much of
a symbol guy myself -- the thing is quite often the thing to me, so if the
use of the word "ebony" doesn't let me get closer to what it is Ron is
seeing -- and my claim here is that he is seeing *less* because he's had to
use a quick replacement word to get away from using "black" twice (merely my
suspicion, of course) -- well, I guess I just don't see how "ebony" improves
upon what it is we're seeing here.

Take "Fairy decorator" as a contrast -- I never read this as a reference to
the decorator's sexuality but I see it now, I always just heard "fairy
godmother" and assumed it was a comment on the privileged status of those
for whom all things appear to be gifts -- despite the semantic slippage
Louis writes about elsewhere, I somehow *see* this a whole lot more.  Maybe
it's just synaesthesia -- I have a tendency to see color in a lot of
phrasing that is technically "colorless".  I'm also, like Jeffrey (?), not
sure how cheeks make the eyes recede, though I understand this as a
painterly flourish -- and unspoken "as if."  (Ron often suggested in early
interviews that his new sentence prose was an attempt to work into the space
of a novel, so I wonder why he doesn't encourage some more novelistic traits
in his writing -- wouldn't Nabokov have really tried to nail this visual
detail?)  But the following observation from WCW which just drops out of the
sky really impresses me:

                (the

grapes still hanging to
the vines along the nearby
Concordia Halle like broken
teeth in the head of an

old man)

The very frailty of these words hanging in the stanza (an isolated by me
here) suggest these grapes also.

Anyway, curiously, your reading of this stanza goes up against what I
thought were some of the prinicples of the New Sentence, which is that the
sentences were paratactic and would not be subsumed under a montage type of
functionality -- we see the titles, the titles appear on the cab, the man is
black, the tiles are black, etc... -- but rather thwarted narrative and
syllogistic connections.  The line "I decide he's a gentle person." seems to
suggest that the poet wants us to play with a cause-and-effect determination
here, a game I like.  So I guess the new sentence doesn't have to be
entirely "paratactic" (I think it works best when there is wavering), but it
seems to me that if such an overdtermined matrix of social meanings as you
present here were underlying such passages of the New Sentence, then rather
than the author permitting a play of meanings for the reader in his or her
poem, asking the reader to be creative, the writer is merely making it much
harder to see this matrix of meanings by not elaborating the connex.

I don't think this passage is so carefully written as to suggest that --
connections are happy to occur, but you see some counter-charges within the
mass -- "ebony" slipping in to show that he author is aware of lexical
repeats -- the phrase "Titles are often misleading, subtitles seldom are"
seems vague to me (so "President" is misleading because because the person
is not actually presiding, but they "Hey you jerk!" under a flurry of
Spanish curses is accurate?) -- etc.  I like the line about the doubt and
the way it comes in after all of this detail from "outside" -- ok, I know it
sounds like I'm just harshing on Ron's poetry but it's really just this poem
and how it relates to his ideas, especially what he's writing these days.

Thank you for debunking the myth, Alan. At least somewhere in the world,
someone can write a line that rhymes with orange. I'm having a hard time
imagining the subject, though. So, instead of using the inverted partial
title of Mingus's song, we can phrase it directly, and rhyme in the
sentiment the discussion by this time deserves :

The color of her dress was orange.
She wore it each night at the morange,
It didn't stink
the way you'd think.
She let it air out on the door-hinge.

Now that I've piled this particular remnant of the dead horse onto the
compost heap, as opposd to the morange, I'm going to listen to Mingus play
the real thing.

New Yorkers and/or anyone who'll be in the area at the end of the
week should definitely try to make it to one of Jaap's gigs.

He draws on influences from free improvised music and sound poetry
(in poetry contexts, he often performs his own works AND some
classics from the field) & he's a great performer and a real goods
guy. With three chances to see/hear him, all y'all should check him
out.

Bests,

It's not my definition, it's a standard definition of a particular kind of
family. And I made no argument in  favor of or against any kind of family
arrangement, and certainly not the hopi. Family arrangements tend to be
adaptive to their circumstances within the possibilities offered by the
given cultures, and they tend to do a reasonably good job of rearing
children to be members of their societies. If one imagined a neutral social
context, one that would potentially support  any of the possibilities
humans have generated or will generate, then one would notice advantages
and disadvantages in each. But no such context is possible.

Matrilineal means descent from the mother and nothing more. It's a system
of inheritance and family and clan identity. Jews are Jews if their mothers
were Jewish, and the child of the Japanese empress is presumed to be the
child of the emperor. It doesn't have any necessary connection to
governance within the family and beyond, and it's not synonymous with
matriarchy (ask the Japanese empress).

Why do certain groups of women need the validation of a presumed neolithic
social model, even if that involves distorting the past? (we know the
answer for fundamentalist christians for their version of patriarchy--it's
in the book). Suppose they were inventing something as novel as the nuclear
family, and history be damned?

You might want to read some serious anthropology or sociology. You'd be
amazed at the range of possibilities.

 Joe,
   You might say briefly why you and your houseguests reached your consenus
on Lowell and the fairy decorator and so quickly, given that
other contributors had reached different conclusions and given their
reasons.

Herb,

Your post suggests that you may not understand that bloggers are a protected
species under the Environmental Poetics Agency. One mustn't criticize such
practice in any way, especially on a listserv.

By the way, kids, that discussion about "Skunk Hour" was something totally
unsuspected on the Buff List, and, thus, exemplary. It also made me take out
the old Farrar, Strauss and Giraux paperback of "Life Studies"/"For the
Union Dead" (1964, $2.25) and read the poem to my houseguests, Joanne Kyger
and Donald Guravich, famed summer instructors at Naropa. The discussion
reached a quick consensus that Lowell was pretty clearly engaging in
scurrilous (but not for the time) anti-gay commentary, much as the recently
revealed Truman diaries engaged in scurrilous (but not for the time?)
anti-Jewish commentary.

Looking at the prospect seriously, given the amount of deleted,
unclear, mistyped, re-edited, re-entered, misunderstood, and
otherwise screwed up blog entries and exchanges among bloggers in the
poetry world (people for whom verbal expression is supposed to be
extremely important, right?), I'm not sure that I'd want a president
who spent that much of that kind of time online.

Brian,

It seems you hold a lot of stock in an idea's ability to generate a 'kind'
of writing or a writing practice. To hold such high stock makes sense to me
only in the current context of writing that uses programmatic - as in,
pre-determined - forms. But, in the context of The Alphabet, begun in the
early 80s, or of any of the writing associated with Language poetry from
Ron's generation, well, how much programmatic form is there? I don't think
much. You might say David Bromige's Red Hats and Bob Perelman's a.k.a. were
attempts to write from an idea of the new sentence (and you might like these
books precisely for this reason).

If by "novelistic" you mean a narrative unfolding through linear time, then
there is plenty of that at the level of the line, to me, in for instance the
passage from Non that we've been discussing. One example:

                                       Checking
                                 out the driver
                                in the next car
                through my rear view mirror

The colloquial expression "checking out" can go many ways, and its direction
is only specified after the first comma (which works like a colon) in the
sentence, for the driver turns out to be:

             thin ebony man
                 with a long white beard,
                         tricolor rasta cap,

Three good reasons why the narrator will decide that this person is
"gentle".

In this sentence, one literally watches desire undergo a transformation.
First, it has no object at all, and as such is, as the phrase suggests
("checking / out"), optimistic about prospects. But then, the subject's
desire passes through a heavily-coded pop-cultural icon -  the read view
mirror! Hitcock is apropos. Affect switches from optimism to apprehension.
Apprehension is then overturned after the first comma, when we discover
details about who is driving the car, including these:

             high sharp cheekbones
            that cause the eyes to recede.
                I decide he's a gentle person.

There are three good reasons why this person might be gentle, as we already
know, but before the decision comes down, a final contrast is made. Eyes
characteristically (in fiction, borrowing heavily from Romanticism) are the
well of emotion and truth, but here they recede, so you can't get that final
confirmation of what the guy is like. Nevertheless, there's enough to go on,
and "I decide," etc. - formal contrast, then, and decision not to elevate
the figure of sight as final truth-test.

What you call "man pounds rice" phrasing speaks exactly to a typicality in
Silliman's nouns that is quintessential to Realism - the novel's genre,
after all. If Lukacs were able to read Silliman, he would have completely
revised his theory of modernism!

"Ebony" is an interesting word choice, I agree. Obviously "black" can't be
used twice in so close proximity, especially when you want to adjectivize
both a man and roofing product. Balzac, a practical writer, would have
appreciated this dilemma. (I don't see why "ebony" is euphemistic, though.)
There's two lines on Non's first page:

        What is the import of detail?
        How do we stake that claim?

Here I take the writer to be self-reflexively posing just such a question
about these sorts of word-choices (ebony/back, or e.g. "delicate elderly
Korean lady" on first page - what does it mean to choose
nationality-as-racialization to describe this lady? etc). It is "we" who are
staked in such claims because they implicate the reader as well in how to
interpret those decisions of the writer. The question of detail of
perception ties this text right back to a non-programmatic understanding of
form developed by NAP.

So I'm reading lots of intricacy in these observation-based lines, lots of
"fancy," too, in the non-derogatory sense (which is obviously how you mean
it). For baroque sentences that delight in their own complicatedness, you
have to read Skies (it's in (R)). Skies is all about, only about, the sky,
but the sentences are virtually non-identical to each other.

So finally, I think a lot about Lowell of late *actually* has little to do
with Lowell, and more to do with an understanding of form as programmatic -
the neat way, for instance, one might read the clothes hanger stanza in Non
via Williams's cat poem, which to me is like reading both as an animated
Gif. To put this another way, it's a computer-based program lineage that's
perhaps making reading nonprogrammatic forms based on perception an
irritating reading experience, especially forms based on gaps as moments of
negativity, moments where in other words the seemingly flat denotational
levels of everyday commodified life explode into a million figural fragments
as the reader attempts to join them into a totality (the totality between
any two stanzas/sentences). It's an observation I'm making (and proposing),
that's all.















Craig Dworkin's anthology on <ubu.com> aestheticizes to the max what once
was a devastatingly profound critique of the centered subject (with
repercussions for "western" culture, etc).



On your blog, you say that "I had really meant to deal with Louis' writing
about form in Silliman's Non but found what he wrote a bit confusing in the
end."

Louis,
Please pardon my intrusion into your conversation, but I see an entirely =
different story in the poem:

Here are the facts as they unfolded in the real world: the driver in the =
car behind, a chap with an appearance of gentility, turned out to be a =
member of the car hi-jacking team.  He was called the "dupe."  His job =
was to lure unsuspecting drivers into that false sense of security they =
feel when, late at night, afraid of the real world, they create an =
imaginary one in which they feel safe.  And ninety nine times out of a =
hundred, they arrive home untouched and unharmed, not having been =
attacked from either the front or the rear...but on this ill fated day, =
the rasta cap proves to be no more than a cover up for a bad hairdo and =
some slick pomade.  And then of course, we all learn one should never =
judge a man by his appearances nor a poem by the what it is "explained" =
to be essay. =20

  It seems you hold a lot of stock in an idea's ability to generate a =
'kind'
  of writing or a writing practice. To hold such high stock makes sense =
to me
  only in the current context of writing that uses programmatic - as in,
  pre-determined - forms. But, in the context of The Alphabet, begun in =
the
  early 80s, or of any of the writing associated with Language poetry =
from
  Ron's generation, well, how much programmatic form is there? I don't =
think
  much. You might say David Bromige's Red Hats and Bob Perelman's a.k.a. =
were
  attempts to write from an idea of the new sentence (and you might like =
these
  books precisely for this reason).

  If by "novelistic" you mean a narrative unfolding through linear time, =
then
  there is plenty of that at the level of the line, to me, in for =
instance the
  passage from Non that we've been discussing. One example:

                                         Checking
                                   out the driver
                                  in the next car
                  through my rear view mirror

  The colloquial expression "checking out" can go many ways, and its =
direction
  is only specified after the first comma (which works like a colon) in =
the
  sentence, for the driver turns out to be:

               thin ebony man
                   with a long white beard,
                           tricolor rasta cap,

  Three good reasons why the narrator will decide that this person is
  "gentle".

  In this sentence, one literally watches desire undergo a =
transformation.
  First, it has no object at all, and as such is, as the phrase suggests
  ("checking / out"), optimistic about prospects. But then, the =
subject's
  desire passes through a heavily-coded pop-cultural icon -  the read =
view
  mirror! Hitcock is apropos. Affect switches from optimism to =
apprehension.
  Apprehension is then overturned after the first comma, when we =
discover
  details about who is driving the car, including these:

               high sharp cheekbones
              that cause the eyes to recede.
                  I decide he's a gentle person.

  There are three good reasons why this person might be gentle, as we =
already
  know, but before the decision comes down, a final contrast is made. =
Eyes
  characteristically (in fiction, borrowing heavily from Romanticism) =
are the
  well of emotion and truth, but here they recede, so you can't get that =
final
  confirmation of what the guy is like. Nevertheless, there's enough to =
go on,
  and "I decide," etc. - formal contrast, then, and decision not to =
elevate
  the figure of sight as final truth-test.

  What you call "man pounds rice" phrasing speaks exactly to a =
typicality in
  Silliman's nouns that is quintessential to Realism - the novel's =
genre,
  after all. If Lukacs were able to read Silliman, he would have =
completely
  revised his theory of modernism!

  "Ebony" is an interesting word choice, I agree. Obviously "black" =
can't be
  used twice in so close proximity, especially when you want to =
adjectivize
  both a man and roofing product. Balzac, a practical writer, would have
  appreciated this dilemma. (I don't see why "ebony" is euphemistic, =
though.)
  There's two lines on Non's first page:

          What is the import of detail?
          How do we stake that claim?

  Here I take the writer to be self-reflexively posing just such a =
question
  about these sorts of word-choices (ebony/back, or e.g. "delicate =
elderly
  Korean lady" on first page - what does it mean to choose
  nationality-as-racialization to describe this lady? etc). It is "we" =
who are
  staked in such claims because they implicate the reader as well in how =
to
  interpret those decisions of the writer. The question of detail of
  perception ties this text right back to a non-programmatic =
understanding of
  form developed by NAP.

  So I'm reading lots of intricacy in these observation-based lines, =
lots of
  "fancy," too, in the non-derogatory sense (which is obviously how you =
mean
  it). For baroque sentences that delight in their own complicatedness, =
you
  have to read Skies (it's in (R)). Skies is all about, only about, the =
sky,
  but the sentences are virtually non-identical to each other.

  So finally, I think a lot about Lowell of late *actually* has little =
to do
  with Lowell, and more to do with an understanding of form as =
programmatic -
  the neat way, for instance, one might read the clothes hanger stanza =
in Non
  via Williams's cat poem, which to me is like reading both as an =
animated
  Gif. To put this another way, it's a computer-based program lineage =
that's
  perhaps making reading nonprogrammatic forms based on perception an
  irritating reading experience, especially forms based on gaps as =
moments of
  negativity, moments where in other words the seemingly flat =
denotational
  levels of everyday commodified life explode into a million figural =
fragments
  as the reader attempts to join them into a totality (the totality =
between
  any two stanzas/sentences). It's an observation I'm making (and =
proposing),
  that's all.















  Craig Dworkin's anthology on <ubu.com> aestheticizes to the max what =
once
  was a devastatingly profound critique of the centered subject (with
  repercussions for "western" culture, etc).



  On your blog, you say that "I had really meant to deal with Louis' =
writing
  about form in Silliman's Non but found what he wrote a bit confusing =
in the
  end."

Coda: Other kinds of writing might involve an entirely different
relationship to and understanding of "close reading," which is obviously,
according to my last take, what Silliman's text "classically" evokes. Close
reading is very important as many have argued on this listserv, has been
neglected of late in the academy, etc. I'd say it is actually coded into
Silliman's text. But, I don't think that's what all texts are necessarily
asking us to do. To use another example from Silliman's same generation and
milieu, are Andrews's texts coded for the reader in this sense of "close
reading"? I'm not sure.

Ok, after putting sidereality 2:3 together, I’m a bit on

reviews, 4 articles, and 1 interview in the July-September
2003 issue. Let me know what you think of it.

I am now reading for sidereality 2:4 and 3:1, and will be
responding to backlogged submissions during the second
half of July.

Please feel free to forward this newsletter to any and
all interested parties. Enjoy your summer!

Best wishes,
Clayton

The Computer Not Boughten
(after Robert Frost's The Road Not Taken)

TWO computers diverged in a technological haze,
And happily I would not buy both
And as one digital artist, long I brood
And customized deep one as far as I should
To where it crashed in the subroutine;  =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
=A0
Then bought the other, as just as fast,
And having perhaps the better aim,
Because it was shiny and had software;
Though as for that the coding there
Had developed them really about the same,       =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
=A0
And both that morning equally parsed
In data no calculation had yet to debug.
Oh, I left the PC for another day!
Yet knowing how innovation leads on to user base,
I doubted if I could ever switch back.  =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0
=A0
I shall be emailing this with no apprehension
Somewhere versions and chips hence:
Two computers diverged in R & D, and I=97
I acquired the one with more innovation,
And that has made all the difference.=

There's a big color photo of Tuli Kupferberg and Ed Sanders as part
of a NY Times article on the current re-union performances of the
Fugs, the band they formed in the mid-1960s. Much mention of the
overall scene from back then as well as their writing, including the
only kind of mention that Sanders' magazine from back then, Fuck You:
A Magazine of the Arts, is likely to get in the Times any time soon.

one shudders (with pain? with joy? with creative overdrive
approaching sublime orgasmicity) to contemplate all the uses for beer
bottles, and all the poetry they will spawn...this is just the kind
of thing i love to bring in to classes to demonstrate the uses of
poetry.

brilliantly clumsy; just my kind of writing.  but you don't mention
the beer bottles embedded in the garden structure at dreamtime...any
way to fit that in?

I will be leading a writing workshop in the Buffalo Olmsted parks over the
next six Saturdays.  If you know of someone (in Buffalo) interested in
taking a writing workshop, or in learning about Buffalo's Olmsted Parks, or
simply looking for something different to do on Saturdays, please forward

Summer writing workshops in the parks! Co-sponsored by the Buffalo Olmsted
Parks Conservancy

Developed during the second half of the nineteenth century by the well known
landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the Olmsted
Park System in Buffalo is the oldest coordinated system of public parks and
parkways in the United States. It was a visionary attempt to create islands
of tranquility in the growing bustling city.

just buffalo, in collaboration with the Olmsted Parks Conservancy, is
offering a six-week writing workshop designed to explore outdoors writing in
the Olmsted park system. Classes will meet each Saturday beginning July 19,
in a different Olmsted Park: Front, Delaware, Martin Luther King, Cazenovia,
Riverside and South Park.

DEMOCRATIC VISTAS: WRITING IN BUFFALO'S OLMSTED PARKS

In this six-week writing workshop, we will explore the Olmsted Park System
as well as the "ecopoetic" possibilities and questions of outdoor writing,
visiting a different park each week. Emphasis will be on plein air writing
exercises, short readings from Olmsted's own writings on city landscapes, as
well as from poetry and nonfiction by a range of authors. Discussion themes
will include: nature writing techniques, ecology, urban design and politics,
experimental and investigative writing, border living, Buffalo's various
city cultures, as well as the pleasures and paradoxes of Olmsted's unique
park system.

Writing exercises will accommodate a variety of genre interests: poetry,
essays, nature journals, letters to the editor, prose fiction and other
mixed forms. Beginner as well as experienced writers welcome; each student
will be encouraged to work at his or her own level. Writings produced during
the workshop will be geared toward eventual publication and gathered into a
chapbook. All meetings will be held on Saturdays, at alternating times in
order to accommodate the different moods of the day (please pay close
attention to the schedule).

1) Front Park, Saturday 7/19, 4-7pm. Lake Erie and the Niagara River;
Olmsted's vision for Buffalo; 'descriptive' nature writing; Romantic vistas;
industrial contrasts; arboreal poems in the 'dialectical' landscape.
Readings: Baudelaire, Hopkins, Olmsted, Williams, Smithson.

2) Delaware Park, Saturday 7/26, 10am-1pm (class will end with free visit to
the Albright Knox art gallery) "The Park" : the picturesque; people
watching; Olmsted and the growth of American cities; 19th Century American
visions; landscape art.  Readings: Whitman, Hughes, Olmsted, Smithson.

3) Martin Luther King Park, Saturday 8/2, 4-7pm. (class begins with optional
visit to Buffalo Museum of Science; price of museum admission not included
with fee). The politics of open space; science and creative writing;
investigative poetics; East Side views. Recommended viewing: "Claiming Open
Spaces," by Austin Allen (documentary film available at just Buffalo in the
week preceding the meeting).  Readings: Ponge, Sanders, Dillard, Olmsted.

4) Cazenovia Park, Saturday 8/9, 10am-1pm. Urban wildlife; literary
environmentalism; South Town views. Readings: Dickinson, Leopold, Carson.

5) Riverside Park, Saturday 8/16, 4-7pm. Rivers and cities; the shoreline;
the indigenous perspective; border living. Readings: Johnson, Kenny, Silko.

6) South Park, Saturday 8/23, 10am-1pm (class includes a visit to the
botanical gardens)  Natural history and avant-garde poetics/ experimental
writing. Readings: Ponge, Finlay, Mayer, _ecopoetics_.

(Note: three hours have been scheduled for each class, but this can be
shortened if students so desire.  Meeting times can also be adjusted to
accomodate the group's needs.)

Students supply own writing materials; readings available online or as a
photocopy at just Buffalo. Classes will be held rain or shine: please bring
appropriate gear (rain jackets, sweaters, umbrellas, walking shoes). In the
event of a torrential downpour, however, we'll meet at just Buffalo instead
of the designated park. Readings include work from Walt Whitman, Emily
Dickinson, Charles Baudelaire, Gerard Manley Hopkins, E. Pauline Johnson,
Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Aldo Leopold, Francis Ponge,
Robert Smithson, Bernadette Mayer, Ed Sanders, Annie Dillard, Ian Hamilton
Finlay, Rachel Carson, Maurice Kenny, Leslie Marmon Silko, and the journal
_ecopoetics_.

Jonathan Skinner, who hails from New Mexico, edits _ecopoetics_ in Buffalo,
NY where he misidentifies birds along the Niagara River and is currently
completing his dissertation on ecology and poetry for the SUNY English
Department. His chapbooks include Political Cactus Poems (Periplum Editions)
and Little Dictionary of Sounds (RedDLines).

2-5 classes: $25 each, $20 for jblc and O.P.C. members

This course sounds great, Jonathan. For the benefit of this list,
particularly those of us into walking, Cities, the lit of the urban, etc.,
is it premature to share the specific books or works on your reading list?

I pry
a cream and needle
s
ky from you, when my voice
nodes with yours, and twin
stained
bruises billow loosely through
our bites.

I rode my bike to see you. I rode my bike through the
pained branches of midsummer. There was a place I
wanted to get to. Your hands stitched your words to
the air. You roll out against me, tenderest jelly. I
rode my bike straightaway through your face, and
landed amply in these pools.

In Mingus's title, "orange" rhymes with "blue silk."  (The full title,
from memory: "Orange Was the Color of Her Dress, Then Blue Silk."
Spending an afternoon and then an evening with a woman in the city.)

for Digital Writers and Artists working with New Media Texts

Monday 10th November - Friday 14th November 2003

Writers for the Future
trAce Online Writing Centre
Nottingham Trent University, UK

This week-long workshop is the first of its kind in the UK, offering writer=
s and artists working with new media texts an opportunity to work together =
intensively in a supportive creative and critical environment. The TEXTLAB =
workshop is part of Writers for the Future, funded by Nesta. TEXTLAB aims t=
o increase public understanding of New Media Writing, enable collaboration =
and interactivity, and change the traditional view of literature as a print=
-based linear form.

During the residential week participants will operate individually and in g=
roups to develop their projects without any pressure to produce a finished =
piece. The emphasis is on freedom to explore and experiment in the company =
of highly-experienced new media writers. Professional development advice wi=
ll also be available to help you realise and promote your project beyond th=
e workshop, and the group will continue online until Spring 2004

***7th New Media Writers' Workshop: The Message in New Media at Hypertext '=
03

You don't have to be an attendee at the main Hypertext Conference to come t=
o this one-day live face-to-face workshop on Saturday August 30th in Nottin=
gham, UK.
It costs just =A350 to include refreshments and lunch. Payable in advance o=
r on the day - but advance booking is essential.

New Media Literature provides a unique testing place for hypertext theories=
 and concepts. New media writing explores content and contextual relationsh=
ips between linking, imagery, navigation, structure, and motion to provide =
 a richer set of meanings. In an age when new media has become increasingly=
 professional to what extent can an individual produce work of a high enoug=
h standard including text, graphics, animation, sound, programming etc. etc=
? How can the writer's message be expressed in new media?

If you can't join us for the day, you are welcome to our Online Chat on Sun=
day 17th August 9-10 pm UK time.
The online chat is part of the Forum Live series organised by the trAce Onl=
ine Writing Centre and the Eliterature Organisation with participants from =
around the world.

There will be an asynchronous web workshop at the trAce Forums from August =
17th through to September 30th to discuss the issues and further develop wo=
rks in progress.

You're correct about the title. I'm not sure Mingus  intended "blue silk" to
represent a "rhyme" for orange. I always thought of "blue silk" as a verbal
segue analogous to Mingus's stream of consciousness or his multi-themed
compositions. I can't find the record jacket that tells the story behind the
tune, so I can't comment beyond what I've just written.

I'm just making a little argument for extending notions of rhyme.  I
can't remember
if he ever gave any info about the title.  I would be interested.

I gave a second look, and found it on Mingus's "Changes Two," on which the
song's title is "Orange was the Color of her Dress, Then Silk blue." Mingus
revised his titles and retitled his compositions almost at whim. Mingus
wrote the piece as part of a film score. Here's a quote form Nat Hentoff's
liner notes: "'The story,' Mingus recalls, 'was about a rich girl who
supposedly fell in love with a piano player. She liked to bug him and so she
bought an orange dress and told him to write a song dedicated to her dress,
figuring that no one could find a word to rhyme with orange.'"

Obviously, the woman had never visited the English midlands.

Subject:      new moveon action regarding WMD lies
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

More and more Moveon.org is being recognized and respected as a
representative lobbying force. They're looking for 350,000
signatories/letter-senders by Wednesday. If you haven't already heard about
it, please consider going to this very easy, automated website and sendign
a brief note to your representative.:   http://www.moveon.org/wmdpledge/

Here is their letter to prospective helpers :
Dear friend,

The President took the nation to war based on his assertion that Iraq
posed an imminent threat to our country.  Now the evidence that
backed that assertion is falling apart.

If the Bush administration distorted intelligence or knowingly used
false data to support the call to war, it would be an unprecedented
deception.  Even if weapons are now found, it'll be difficult to
justify pre-war language that indicated that the exact location of the
weapons was known and that they were ready to deploy at a moment's
notice.  With a crisis of credibility brewing abroad and the integrity
of our President and our foreign policy on the line, we need answers
now.

Rep. Henry Waxman has introduced legislation to create an independent
commission to investigate the Bush administration's distortion of
evidence.  Please ask your Representative to pledge his or her support
at:

    http://www.moveon.org/wmdpledge/

A President may make no more important decision than whether or not to
take a country to war.  If Bush and his officials deceived the American
public to create support for the Iraq war, they need to be held
accountable.

Thanks.

NUDE SIREN
poems by Peter Richards

Dean Young writes: "Using descriptive intensity as a form of imaginative
liberty, these poems come from the blast furnace of a new idiom, what
‘Coastal People’ calls ‘a June-fed incinerator.’  . . . The force of
these volatile lyrics comes in part from an articulation pushed beyond
the combinatory explosiveness of surrealism toward a vatic brilliance,
and their darkness is utterly convincing because it is so full of comets
and scars."

MONKEY TIME
poems by Philip Nikolayev
Winner of the 2001 Verse Prize, selected by Lyn Hejinian

John Kinsella writes: "Philip Nikolayev is a subverter of form and
language. He is starkly innovative, but in an unpredictable and non
'school'-oriented way. His is a poetics in 'cahoots' with a self-created
idiomatic Russian-American English . . . . Richly ironic, sensitive, and
variable in voice, these poems are barbs from a place few of us see, but
most of us would like to visit."

HOW SMALL BRIDES SURVIVE IN EXTREME COLD
poems by Steve Shavel
Clumsy acrobats tumbling through the circuses of philosophy,
architecture, politics, religion and just about anything else you can
think of, Steve Shavel's wild meditations drift and whirl with spastic
brilliance among language's most earnest and playful coincidences.

Louis,

I would really like to know what you mean by "most of the reading happens
between the stanzas/sentences, not in the stanzas/sentences themselves".

I have read Silliman's The New Sentence only once, and I am familiar with
his Toner, having a copy of it, and have recently lent his In the Am. Tree
to a friend and found some parts of it interesting, in particular an essay
in there, (or is it in The New Sentence?) about the difference, syntacticly
speaking, between surrealist poetry and language poetry.

I originally read The New Sentence because of the essay about Spicer in it
who I'm really intrigued with. (In fact I did a little library research on
Spicer and found an article he co-authored with a linguist at Berkeley about
northwestern Ohio speech dialects that Spicer helped, apparently, with the
statistical analysis of.)

Anyways, I'd like to be informed in particular of the meaning of the term
"parataxis". I'm not familiar with that term at all. Could you explain it?

Matt

Only "premature" in the sense that the detailed and complete reading list is
still under construction!  I will be happy to forward as it materializes.

Robert Smithson's essay "Frederick Law Olmsted and the Dialectical
Landscape" is a good place to begin.  His "A Tour of the Monuments of
Passaic, New Jersey" is also a great text for, what shall we call it,
pedipoetics?

[Two Smithson notes:  has anyone else heard that he was "delivered" by WCW?
(Or was Dr. Williams just the family pediatrician?)  Also, apparently Spiral
Jetty reemerged from the evaporating waters of the Great Salt Lake this
winter.  Anyone been to see it?]

Olmsted himself you can dip in just about anywhere, for a taste of his
florid but impassioned advocacy.  An excellent paperback collection is
_Civilizing American Cities: Writings On City Landscapes_, ed. S.B. Sutton.
"Public Parks and the Enlargement of Towns," an essay published by the
American Social Science Association in 1870 (and included in this volume),
is probably his most comprehensive statement.

Baudelaire has at least one great 'park poem' set in the Luxembourg Gardens:
the prose poem "Les Veuves" (The Widows) from Paris Spleen.

Then there's big chunks, it seems, of Paterson . . .


In fact, I'd been meaning to query this list:

*what are examples of poems written in parks, or of poets writing in and
around parks?*


(And don't everyone say Cole Swensen . . . )


I know there's the English country house tradition (Marvell, etc.) and the
French baroque chateau poets with their fountains and bubbles (La Fontaine,
Malherbe) but I'm particularly interested in American examples.

Which can and should, of course, extend to poems-in-parks or poems-as-park
in the manner of I.H. Finlay.  I myself have found that for the "poetics of
parks," as of landscape in general, it's easier to turn to the visual arts.
At the same time I have the sneaking suspicion I'm missing lots of great
examples right underfoot!

Thanks for any ideas . . . and I promise to share mine when I get them all
on one page.

Hello kari

I must confessed I am puzzled about your piece on Fulcrum, the moreso
puddled, as we say over here, as I've liked your posts but don't understand
the apparent animosity in your message, or am I misreading it? I'll own up
to the fact that I'm one of the contributors to Fulcrum and am awed by the
resources that are available in the USA to literary mags in contrast to
cash-strapped Britain. Anyhow, this is just a note of puzzlement, keep up
those interesting posts.

All the Best

for Renee



I'd never dreamed
I could be so enfolded

until I mistakenly slid
from illness through your nights
bathed in thickets of real-life case files and the
humor we
wore to deflect our pasts.

You're so goddamned advanced
you figure it out. All I've
had for years is
reflections of these
weed-serrated houses, and
tonight four hundred miles
away from you I walk
until I've
hammered all the sweat out,

the scream of my body sinking
into this dirt I was born in.
Have you ever seen
so many fences in one fucking
town? At the same time,

I don't know how deep he goes, asleep
where we shattered a thousand old
bones, crying among the retired,
hospice tense, and growing
new frames to laugh at during
South Park.

By myself, I would probably use the phrase
"cultural landscape" and forget about it, though I
bury here what
I won't bury in you. And sometimes
I think about the eyes of the roses.

This site somewhat misleadingly defines parataxis as "the juxtaposition of
syntactic units without use of a conjunction."

This is true of you except the conjunction 'and' which, because it is
additive rather than subordinative, is constitutive of parataxis. Check out
the King James version of Genesis or Pound's early Cantos for examples of
parataxis using 'and'.

Announcing the imminent publication of my book 'Painting Without Numbers' by
my bone-idle publisher Robin Hamilton's 'Phantom Rooster Press'. This will
also mark of the event of an actual book under the imprint, which is fast
attaining mythic status, I am also sending this message to spur the lazy
bastard into doing something outside his customary confetti of excuses,
self-poured I hasten to add. People will even be able to purchase copies,
via the negligent demiurge, although of course I have no idea of the terms,
after all, I only wrote the stuff, who am I to complain?

[This entry has been revised since I first posted it yesterday.  It's been
adjusted to fit your screen.]

I'm taking a break from this whole shebang as I'm preparing for a trip to
Toronto -- waxing the moustachios, loading up the paint gun, that sort of
thing -- and the debate's spawned such a variety of forking paths, many of
which lead to a defense of Robert Lowell, which, in isolation, raises a lot
of issues (as in Steve Evans' poignant "well why don't we write about James
Schuyler") that I'm not sure how to proceed or if it even matters.

My point was to argue (grouchily but hoping to make a serious mark) with a
set of terms being tossed about on Silliman's Blog (which I view as an
effective act of criticism) -- "school of quietude" versus an unnamed
something else, the idea of a "third way" as a "death wish", the continued
relevance of a battle against the British (except Raworth, of course) and
their "dead" meters, the use of an ascertainment of "lineage" as a stand-in
for "deep reading," etc.  I think of these as strategies of "Balkanization"
that are not useful, are blind politics, and seem terribly dated.

Worse (I've just thought of this), these concepts don't really give us tools
to look at literatures that are not primarily white, and not primarily
American.  For example, these lines in the sand don't exist for Australian
literature -- though there was a New American-style rebellion in the
sixties, it produced very stanzaic poets like John Forbes, Martin Johnson
and John Tranter, and radicalism was still tied to some form of Surrealism
due, I think, to the Ern Malley incident -- nor does it is exist in Asian
American poetry, which I learned when working on <i>Premonitions</i> with
Walter Lew.

They do exist in some ways, but it's more complex than saying that Theresa
Cha and Gerry Shikatani reflect an interest in big-M "Modernism" that poets
like Arthur Sze or David Mura don't immediately have.  If the argument is
for a thing called "Asian American poetry" -- and I've argued that such a
thing might not exist -- but if so, then the universe of that poetry must be
incredibly diverse and rich, heterogenous and electric, not just depicted as
a rivulet departing from the so called "avant-garde" line.  Asian American
poetry is not "better" because "we" are no longer just "telling our
stories" -- that historical determinism (expressed in one of RS's essays)
has always seemed offensive to me, for obvious reasons, but also
simple-minded.

What has come out of this debate, to me, is that more poets of the
"alternative" current are very astute and willing "deep readers" in a
standard (not necessarily "New Critical") sense, and that these methods of
deep reading have only been somewhat problematized by the changes of reading
tactics advocated by poststructuralism, etc.  Certain readings of Silliman's
<i>Non</i> have utilized tactics that are not that different than those used
for "Skunk Hour," even if the conclusions as to the "content" (or just what
side of the political coin one is) are different.  And these tactics have
been effective, if not getting "us" closer to what "good" writing is without
stylistic prescriptions.

But for example: the Battaillian excessive flows of McCaffery's reading of
bill bissett in <i>North of Intention</i>, with its stress on the ludic and
excess, have rarely if ever been evoked, or if so in the somewhat less
rigorous form of polysemia -- which in other terms can simply mean
"ambiguity," a word one associates with William Empson.  I haven't read
Empson, however, so I can't say more.  The Brechtian "v-effekt," which
Bernstein writes about in "Artifice of Absorption" (Silliman blogs about
this, also) is also not being used critically -- so has the critical
approaches of Language poets really made their mark?  Likewise for
Projective Verse: are any of "our" poets really taking a stand against the
"verse that print bred"?

I still think that, often, linguo-Marxist strategies of understanding the
<i>material</i> of language can be more usefully applied to a "conservative"
poem like "Skunk Hour" -- or "Having a Coke with You" -- than can often be
applied to "avant-garde" poems, and that these are better poems because of,
not in spite of, their narrative attributes and relationship to the history
of poetic form.  Spatializing the words "Polish Rider," "coke," and "Frick,"
however effectively done and giving us a sense of language's "materiality"
(a term I rarely use myself), does not quite provide us with the meat for a
precise hermeneutic strategy that gets us closer to the <i>world</i>.  The
poems in Ashbery's Tennis Coart Oath or Coolidge's Space have emotional
nuances that are rarely written about.  And pomo reading strategies, in my
naive view, were created for reading narrative and "linear" poems, and don't
necessarily argue for the need to break away from these forms.

On a more selfish note: I (along with a few others) have been trying for
several years (quietly) to come up with a language for describing poems --
in my reviews for <i>Boston Review</i> and <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>, the
"little reviews" series on this blog and on arras.net, on <i>Jacket</i>, in
<i>Rain Taxi </i>and the <i>St. Mark's Newsletter</i>, etc. -- that try to
focus on specific effects in poems in spite of where an author might have
gathered his or her experience with language, and to introduce new, mostly
non-US American, names into the mix (admittedly mostly Scottish, British and
Australian), not to mention a way to describe poems that don't rely on one's
knowledge of, and unquestioned reverence for, the esteemed American
avant-garde masters.  In fact, finding a way to modify these appreciations
without causing wild dismay has been another project.

(I'm monolingual -- with the exception of being able to sing most of "Die
Ballade Uber die Sexuelle Horigkeit" at the drop of a hat -- and go in fear
of translations, but it would be a great thing to see some convincing
writing on non-English language poetry -- something that makes the work
exciting and not merely good for you as a taste of the "other."  My only
real attempt has been something on Christophe Tarkos in the Little Reviews.)

So it's seemed, reading parts of Silliman's Blog, like a shuttling back to a
(golden) stone age to see that someone is actually <i>dissuading</i> readers
from reading British poetry (claiming the meters are flat or adherent to a
dead heritage -- the "past"), or reading <i>outside</i> of a presumed
counter-formation, or railing against a lineage that includes Bryant and
Holmes (my American Library <i>19th Century American Poetry</i> volume is
quite fascinating to me, actually), etc., as if that's <i>better</i> for
you, one, we, it, and has something to do with the future.  I'm probably
exaggerating, but I'd like to hear the arguments otherwise, if only just to
hear them made fresh again, and thereby reflect favorably back on the entire
"avant-garde" project in the US (which methinks, still, was "quiet" compared
to the French one -- so there).

Thanks everyone who chimed in about these minor rants, on the poetics list
and elsewhere.

<i>Punch Drunk Love</i> was great, by the way.

                    two in parks by Philip Whalen


GOLDEN GATE PARK

A row of blossoming flowers a row of people
2 lines of people several hundred yards apart
        moving in the same direction.

The space between the individuals in each of the lines is interesting.
The speed of the walkers in each line seems to be the same.

                                                            25:viii.63


---------------------------------------
JAPANESE TEA GARDEN GOLDEN GATE PARK IN SPRING


                                1.

    I come to look at the cherryblossoms
                   for the last time


                                2.

    Look up through flower branching Deva world
                   (happy ignorance)

                                3.

   These blossoms will be gone in a week
   I'll be gone long before.


That is to say, the cherry trees will blossom every year but I'll
disappear for good, one of these days. There. That's all about the
absolute permanence of the most impossibly fragile delicate and
fleeting objects. By objects, I mean this man who is writing this,
the stars, bakedham, as well as the cherryblossoms. This doesn't
explain anything.

                                                        2:iv:65

Hello all poets and friends:

I am looking for an apartment, and thought, what better way to get the word out. Hope no one minds the non-poetic nature of such a post. Ideally: a studio or 1BR in Ft. Greene, Red Hook/Navy Yard, Prospect Heights, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Greenpoint, Williamsburg, LIC, Sunnyside, Woodside, or Astoria (obviously--I'm flexible on location) for about $800-900.

If ANYONE knows anything coming up for/around Sept. 1, please let me know. I'm a 24 y/o old F writer--currently employed at Brooklyn Academy of Music and looking forward to working at St. Mark's Poetry Project as Program Assistant this coming fall (hey, that's official; FYI, anyway!). I have good references, credit, no pets, no smoking. Am quite creative and generally, people like me. :)

Thanks so much. Please feel free to pass this on to your friends and neighbors!

Best,

Corina Copp

Matt,

Analogies from linguistics. You could say (as Brian suggests) that the way I
rhetorically positioned, as the opening lines of my quotation from Non, the
following three,

                Titles
                are often misleading,
                subtitles seldom are,

was in order to read them hypotactically (hypo means beneath), letting this
statement about titles and subtitles inform my reading of the rest of the
quotation from Non, as if it lay beneath the next few sentences as an
interpretive guide, subordinating them to its title/subtitle logic. In the
19C century novel (Balzac) that I was referring to, you could think of (as
Silliman does) characters, chapter titles, the plot itself, etc. as
hypotactically organizing/suibordinating the elements of language (letters,
words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs). Silliman argued that hypotaxis takes
a reader’s mind away from noticing language as language, words as words (let
alone letters as letters): you get caught up in the story and forget that
you’re reading, you walk through the materiality of language like it was air
to be taken for granted. Parataxis (para, beside), on the other hand, like
Scott says, occurs when language is not subordinated in this way. Parataxis
doesn’t mean you don’t read for connections between stanzas/sentence,
though, only that the connections are subtle and registered at a minute
level of letters, sounds, words, as well as at the level of the sentence and
line, and, stanza.

I can’t write more, have to get back to work. But I ask you, don’t you think
figuring out how these sentences/lines connect is equally if not more
important than reading them in independent succession with only a Don’t
Worry, Be Happy approach (not that you're taking that) to why/what they are
where/as they are:

        Meet my personality.
        A dead man’s whistle
        could seem inexact.
                I don’t
               want to get my
        feathers hot.
        Bag lady stands in (opening stanza from Toner)

Realism is words in situ, he says somewhere in Toner.

This has been a pedagogical moment brought to you by Idle Minute. Idle
Minute: when the stern face of hypotaxis beckons Work! take a paratactic
moment out of your day, and give an Idle Minute.

Corso's park poem that Daniel Zimmerman noticed begins:

In this park
    the children speak Italian
and do not
    mind the naked statues
as did the children
    who spoke French in another park
    making jokes at Hercules.
But the same with all children in all parks
    -- bouncing balls with yawns.

THE poem then continues for about fifty lines.

A similar genre of poem is the walk in nature poem, such as Coleridge's great
"This Lime-Tree Bower my Prison," in which Coleridge has spilled boiled milk on
his foot and so can't go for a walk up to a bluff overlooking a sea with many
islands and ships past ravines and natural flower beds.  It's addressed to
Charles Lamb, who's on the walk.  Lamb's sister just killed their mother, so
Charles is a little depressed, and Coleridge imagines his friend cheering up:

and not a swallow twitters,
Yet still the solitary humble-bee
Sings in the bean-flower!

Coleridge is asking nature to do its best to help out his sad friend by turning
up the aesthetics to the brightest pitch

Kindle, thou blue ocean!

I've had students write imaginary walks for depressed friends in which they get
to see stuff like moose and bear and couples making love, and silver bats.
It's not a bad exercise in terms of what you get.

A similar kind of walk poem is Wordsworth's Michael -- again it is not a park,
but a rural area that you get a tour of --

Weren't there also some parks in the Buffalo area that were made or set aside
by Robert Moses, who built so much in this state?  There is this melancholy
little poem by Sara Teasdale, who committed suicide in Greenwich Village in
1933.  It begins:



Gramercy Park

The little park was filled with peace,
The walks were carpeted with snow,
But every iron gate was locked,
Lest if we entered, peace would go.

We circled it a dozen times,
The wind was blowing from the sea...

She also has miserable little poems about Coney Island, Riverside Park, etc.
The point is to play the beauty off her miserable state of mind, I think.

Thanks for bringing up this idea.  I think the whole deal about parks, and
walkability -- is related to the places to live thread that we opened a while
back.  Beaverton is one of the least walkable towns in America -- while
Portland just ten miles away is one of the most walkable.  That's I think what
makes Paris such a great city for poets -- its walkability.  There's plenty to
see -- one isn't overwhelmed by traffic.  It's perfectly possible to walk ten
hours a day in Paris and almost never notice it.  Some people love to hike in
the countryside, but I like a walkable city.  We haven't got very many of
these.  What are the most walkable cities in America?  I've heard that Houston
is not walkable.  There is nothing to see because the skyscrapers go right down
to the sidewalk with hard blue glass that you can't look into, and some places
there's no sidewalk at all.

I have a feeling that Cambridge would be walkable.

Is there any park in America that tops NY's Central Park for walkability -- and
when you're tired you can get a soft pretzel or an ice cream cone or sit and
look at how well people's pants fit their bodies -- butts, the looseness of the
legs, whether they have the right length.  It's pretty rare that pants fit, I
find. Another interesting thing is to look at how well noses fit faces.  You
need a lot of distracted people walking past, and Central Park is very good for
that.

Portions of my "Inside the Skull-House" was written in Forest Park,
Portland, OR., which, at 5000 acres and growing, with forty miles of trail,
is the largest urban park in the country, more forest than park. Some texts
of my work there begin at:

Tom Savage's poem "Nightwalk in Tompins Park" (the title maybe slightly
different) is a fantastic poem.

They are finally breaking it to us (below)  (surprise) complete with Para
tactical  - no conjunction required - Vietnam analogs.
It is curious to be in a generation (mine) to have this happen twice. The
only thing special is that "we" are responding much quicker this time.
Unfortunately Iraq is a much deeper quagmire.
It is going to be more and more curious and so ironic to see this country
crawl back to the United Nations begging for some kind of rescue scenario.

Course with these neo-con artists,  it could be out of Iraq and on to North
Korea.

U.S. forces are facing a "classical guerrilla-type war situation" in Iraq
against opponents ranging from members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party to
non-Iraqi fighters from terrorist groups, the new American commander said
Wednesday.

The statement from Gen. John Abizaid was the first acknowledgment from a to=
p
military official that the attacks on American forces were anything more
than scattered, sporadic incidents. He said attackers were becoming better
organized.

Abizaid also said U.S. troops should be ready to spend a year on duty in th=
e
region, though military planners are working to bring home some units
quickly, such as the Army's 3rd Infantry Division.

"Looking at what I contemplate being the force levels for a while, probably
for the next 90 days, we need to probably say to our soldiers, sailors,
airmen and Marines, 'Here's the maximum extent of your deployment. If we ca=
n
get you home sooner, we will,'" Abizaid said in a briefing at the Pentagon.

Yearlong deployments, a norm during the Vietnam War, have been rare in
recent years. The 1st Armored Division served in Bosnia for a year during
the 1990s, Abizaid said.

"So we've done it before, and we can do it again," he said.

Stephen,

Been watching it all day (internet).  "Good" to see, as it were -- i.e., the
questioning of socios getting tougher, the news articles getting more
demanding (like Meet the Press grilling Rumsfeld last Sunday, more and more
cornering him, I think).  (Incidentally, I don't know how many readers here
check out Yahoo on a regular basis, but there is one small (maybe very
small) but hopefully effective thing I do there.  I "rate" all the newspaper
articles Yahoo puts out -- "1" equaling Won't Recommend and "5" for "Highly
Recommend," -- and of course rate the articles that can be interpreted as
Anti-Bush as 5's and those that I infer as Good-for-Bush as 1's.  It's
obviously a very small gesture, but I believe a lot of people are doing it,
more and more, and I think it may have a small, useful effect (at very least
providing Yahoo and other news sources what kind(s) of articles are getting
read and recommended and which are "not selling"); it beats feeling of
powerlessness.  Anyway, it's something small but perhaps useful that folks
who have to work on computers all day long or like to get news from the
internet in "leisure" hours might find meaningful.

By the way, your post on the Silliman/Burger reading was excellent.  Would
like to have been able to attend (and surely would have were I in SF area).
You're right on, imo, in you assessment of RS's merit and the notion that
his texts will stand for a long, long time.  You know, he gets the archetype
Zukovsky's "sincerity" into, or should I say throughout, his poetry book
after book AND he gets subject matter(s) infinite that are informed by much
of the most advanced "thought" of our times.  (What more can a reader ask
for?)  I could say a lot more, but it behooves me to similarly find ways to
make improvements of my own writing that slacks off into "burden" (Williams)
too easily (if not in a lot of cases "fundamentally").  What does Duncan
say, that "neither our virtues nor our vices advance the poem," or something
to that effect.  And yet there is still a "division between truth (?) and
beauty (materiality, "sincerity") that I'd like to get beyond once and for
all (for myself) someday (probably a "division" that is only my illusion,
admittedly).  Ah, but I'm already saying a lot more than I intended.
Oh, and I've added Mary Burger to my must read/buy list(s), too, following
reading that RS had recommended.  (Others are probably already properly
familiar with her writing.)

Sincerely...  :)  Steve

Subject: U.S. Election Security Scoop Of The Century.... VERY IMPORTANT

Dear All,

Apologies about the BCC, this is going out to a very select and very
powerful list of individuals and I do not want the list distributed more
widely.

I am writing to you because you are either a reporter, columnist, list
owner or website who has in the past dealt with Scoop.co.nz. You are our
friends and we want your help.

We have just broken probably the biggest story in the history of Scoop and
possibly one of the biggest stories in the history of the Internet. We want
your assistance and attention.

To cut to the chase, working with Bev Harris we have just revealed a hole
in the U.S. Electoral system through which you could drive a mack
truck.  The details follow below and are at the following two links... with
pictures....

This story is extremely sensitive and potentially explosive.

There can be no doubt whatsoever that powerful commercial interests will be
acting swiftly to either put a lid on this story, neutralise it via
misinformation or take legal action. It is vital therefore that it receive
as much exposure as possible as quickly as possible.

Here is what I want you to do.

If you are a columnist or reporter:
Please either write about this yourself - perhaps linking to our source
materials - or bring this to the attention of your editor(s) and attemptto
get your news organisation to carry a matching or followup story.

If you are a webmaster:
Please either repost the stories linked below and included at the foot of
this email, or post links to them.

If you are a list owner:
Please post an item on this to your list and encourage your list members to
further distribute this story;

Finally, and I appreciate we are asking a lot here. Can I encourage you all
to talk about this story with your colleagues and email it to friends and
acquaintances, particularly politically active people in the United States.

Thanks and regards

Dear All.

A followup story on the Voting machine story. This article is useful as it
fills in some of the gaps in the logic in the first one.

Firstly it shows that Diebold is in the habit of lying about its systems to
election supervisors.

Secondly it shows - quoting people working on the Georgia election system
installation programme -  that the FTP site from which the data is now
available was being used extensively in the run-up to the 2002 mid-term
election.

Thirdly it illustrates that "quality control" and "testing" are dirty words
at Diebold Elections Systems.

TRUTH ABOUT ROB-GEORGIA

Someone needs to get their story straight.

Diebold voting machines are used in 37 states. The entire state
of Ohio is considering dumping its old system to buy Diebold.
Georgia already did.

The Diebold files, supposedly secret voting machine files left
on an unprotected web site for nearly six years, are unlocking
the truth.

Official stories about voting machine security, acceptance testing
and last-minute program changes are beginning to slide around
like hot grease on a Georgia griddle.

What was the program patch known as rob-georgia.zip used for?
What were they doing with that ftp site, anyway? Hang in for
the first part of this article, the finger-pointing and obfuscating
part, because it concludes with a straightforward explanation
of what went on in Georgia that has never been made public before.

**************

DO ANY OF THESE PEOPLE TELL THE TRUTH?

"We protect the Bill of Rights, the Constitution and the Declaration
of Independence. We protect the Hope Diamond," [Diebold CEO Wally]
O'Dell told The Plain Dealer in May 2002. "Now, we protect the
most sacred treasure we have, our secret ballot."

If they can't tell us the truth about simple things like "does
it connect to modems," can we really be confident that they are
protecting our vote?

CNBC asked Diebold CEO Wally O'Dell this question on election
day, Nov. 5, 2002: "How tamper proof are these voting machines?
That seems to be a concern of some who feel that it only takes
one person, one hacker who can screw up an entire election. How
valid is that criticism Mr. O`Dell?"

"Well, there`s always risks," replied O'Dell, "but, you know,
these things are not connected to the Internet. They`re individual
precinct by precinct, location by location. They`re double checked
before they`re sent out. We think the technology is fabulous
and very bulletproof. (Come back here after reading rob-georgia,
ask him to repeat this.)

"The GEMS computers are not connected to any communication system,
including the Internet, and contain no software other than the
Windows operating system and the Global Election Management System
object code," wrote Dr. Brit Williams on Apr. 23, 2003. He is
the official voting machine certifier for the state of Georgia,
and a key member of the panel that chooses national Independent
Testing Labs for voting machines.

Lies.

"The central host system (GEMS Software) is generally a stand-alone
system so that no physical access via network is allowed...This
computer can download files for the Internet with dial-out only
capability, but is generally not allowed to be linked to the
Internet for obvious security concerns. This, in documents submitted
during a purchasing decision, answering questions from Santa
Clara County, California on Feb. 7, 2003.

If the GEMS computer isn't connected to anything, why is the
following diagram found in a file named GApresentation3-02.zip,
found on the Diebold ftp site? This diagram depicts the GEMS
computer connecting directly to the Internet on election night.




CLICK IMAGE FOR BIG VERSION

Not connected to any communication system are they, Dr. Williams?
I spoke with James Rellinger, the technician who installed all
159 GEMS host computers in Georgia.

Harris: "I understand that you worked for Diebold Election Systems
in Georgia. Can you tell me what you did?"

Rellinger: "They contracted us here in Georgia to basically follow
a recipe book and we ran down and built these things."

Harris: "By 'build these things' -- I think of build, like a
hammer and a screwdriver -- What do you mean by build, what were
you building?"

Rellinger: "Oh, that's a good point.  There were 159 of these
servers that went out.  All we did was run through a series of
tests to make sure they could log on and communicate and make
sure everything jived with the touch screen.

"When you say build they were actually just a Dell server and
we added some hardware to it for instance CD burners, a tape
came in them already, but we'd add things to make them modem
capable.

"When you say build a server it's not physically assembling a
hardware. We added a component or two to make it do what we needed
to do, modems, we load the Windows 2000, put the software in
then we test it against their touch-screen machines."

Let's look at just how big a whopper Dr. Williams told when he
said they aren't connected to anything: Sandy Baxter, Elections
Supervisor for San Juan County, Washington, also says she had
modems and Internet capability:

"I think it was about 1999 we bought a new server. They gave
us recommendations for servers, like Dell. They had Dell ship
them to McKinney, Texas and they loaded the systems on and various
modems, digiboards and stuff...The server can handle multiple
PCs, but I only have one at this time, so my PC is also my server...I
have two modems. I have a modem that is for going out and it
is not connected to the GEMS system. So I can go to the web.
I have what's called a digiboard on my server that allows multiple
modem connections. I have a second modem on the GEMS system but
its only for the AccuVote systems. My precincts modem me the
results on that. The second modem is the only one that goes to
my GEMS system. It doesn't have the capability to go in and out.
I just plug it in when I use it."

The User Manuals are filled with references to modems, ports,
uploading, downloading, TCP/IP protocols, transmissions, and
ways to use "JResults" to upload to the web continuously on election
night. Technical specifications, including manufacturer's components
lists, show that not only are there modems, but wireless communications.


All right, so they lied to us about modem hook-ups. Shall we
let this cloud our trust in everything else they are telling
us? Consider this:

Diebold's official spokesman, Joseph Richardson assures us that
the open ftp site was inactive. In interviews with Salon.com
and the Baltimore City Paper, he said the site was old and the
files were out of date. Was this the truth?

Not at all. The site was taken down on Jan. 29, 2003. The most
recent file on the ftp site is dated Jan. 23, 2003. How much
information was in the files? See for yourself by visiting the
download site at the top of this article.

Michael Barnes, of the elections division with the Georgia Secretary
of State's office, said "That ftp site did not affect us in any
way shape or form because we did not do any file transferring
from it."

Let's have Dr. Brit Williams weigh in. In Feb. 2003, he said
"I'm not familiar with that site." On April 23, he wrote a letter
that was a bit more precise:

"Apparently, there was an FTP site that Diebold employees used
to store and transfer versions of the system that were under
development. The contents, or even existence, of the 'rob georgia'
folder has not been established. However, for the sake of this
discussion, we will assume that the FTP site existed...
This would have had absolutely no effect on the election system
as implemented in Georgia. The State does not obtain its election
system code from an FTP site or even from Diebold."

Dr. Williams went on to outline an elaborate scheme whereby he
claimed that the program files are obtained solely from ITAs
(Independent Testing Labs).

What about the Secretary of State? A memo by Chris Riggall, spokesperson
for Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Cox, stated that last minute
"patches" were installed on all 22,000 voting machines in Georgia.
Dr. Williams admitted to me that they were never examined --
not by a testing lab, not by him, not by anyone outside of Diebold.
Suddenly, no one could get their stories straight on the patches
either.

The patch was from Microsoft and it was for Windows, said the
Secretary of State's office. But wait -- Dr. Williams says it
came directly from the ITA. What does Diebold say? Diebold says
they have no indication there ever was a patch.

We're going to meet one of the guys who actually installed that
patch in a minute, but first let us observe the art of evasion
from Diebold's Joe Richardson:

Harris: "Did you say, when interviewed by Salon.com, in reference
to whether patches were put on the machines in Georgia, "We have
analyzed that situation and have no indication of that happening
at all."

Richardson: "Well, that is what I said at the time, however,
we have continued to investigate the matter and ... (very, very
long pause) Yes that is what I said to Salon.com."

Harris: "Do you stand by that now?"

Richardson: "We have continued to look into the matter."

Harris: "As you have continued to investigate this, do you have
any new information as to whether patches were put on in Georgia?"

Richardson: "No."

Harris: "Has anyone thought to just call them up and ask? The
Secretary of State's office?"

Richardson: "I can't say."

Harris: "What was the rob-georgia file? Who is responsible for
it?"

Richardson: "I'm not privy to that information."

Harris: "Who would be able to answer that question?"

Richardson: "I can't tell you. I can look into it."

Harris: "Yes, could you do that please? In two publications,
you are quoted as saying that the information on the open FTP
site was old and out of date. Yet, I can tell you the most recent
file on it was dated January 16, 2003. Did you do any checking
to see whether the site had been used recently when you made
that statement?" (A more recent file, dated Jan. 23, was later
discovered.)

Richardson: "The site had already been taken down."

Harris: "Surely Diebold has access to its own site?"

Richardson: "I'm saying I didn't have access."

Harris: "Did you ask anybody?"

Richardson: (sound of shuffling papers) "Our ongoing investigation
has found no merit to the insinuations of security breaches in
our election solutions."

Harris: "So if there were up to 20,000 files including hardware,
software specs, testing protocols, source code, you do not feel
that is a security breach?" (more files have since been discovered
inside a mammoth zipped directory, bringing the estimated total
up to nearly 40,000 files)

Richardson: "Our ongoing investigation has found no merit to
the insinuations of security breaches in our election solutions."

And now, Dr. Brit Williams on the Georgia patch:
Harris: What was the security around the creation of the cards
used to implement the patch?

Williams: "That's a real good question. Like I say, we were in
the heat of the election. Some of the things we did, we probably
compromised security a little bit -- Let me emphasize we've gone
back since the election and done extensive testing on all this."
Dr. Williams latest 180 degree reversal (This link leads you
to a forum discussing files from the ftp site, which contains
several absurd statements from Dr. Williams).

And now, Michael Barnes on the Georgia patch:
Barnes: "Wyle said it did not affect the certification elements.
So it did not need to be certified." (at the above-referenced
link, you can also find information from a Freedom of Information
Act request, in which officials admitted they did not have any
certifying documents on the patch).

Harris: "Where's the written report from Wyle on that? Can I
have a copy?"

Barnes:  "I'd have to look for it I don't know if there was ever
a written report by Wyle. It might have been by phone."

The Truth About Rob-Georgia

Everyone assured me they knew of no one named Rob. Move along.

But I received an e-mail: "I think I may be the Rob in rob-georgia,"
it said. And now I know why they didn't want us to interview
him. I think you'll agree that his interview is worth the length,
for the picture you get of what was really going on. If you prefer
to skim, check the sections in blue. Citizens, meet Rob Behler,
straight talker:

Harris: What was the FTP site for?

Behler:One of problems we had was an issue with the GEMS database.
They had to do an update to it, so they just post the update
to the web site.

Harris: What was rob-georgia?

Behler: I believe what that file was for, I did a -- well, there
were a ton of holes with the programs on those machines. When
they all came into the warehouse, I did a quality check, this
was something I did on a Saturday. I found that 25% of the machines
on the floor would fail KSU testing --

Harris: "What is KSU testing?"

Behler: "Kennesaw State University. We knew basically what they
would be testing and the trick was to make sure the machines
would pass the testing. So I went and checked a pallet and found
it was bad. And I checked another, and another, and I knew we
had a problem."


Harris: "Was that both you and James Rellinger?"

Behler: "James dealt with the network, but I was dealing with
the touchscreen machines themselves.

Harris: "What kind of problems were you seeing?"

Behler:  "...One of the things we had wrong was the date wasn't
sticking in the Windows CE. The real time clock would go to check
the time on the motherboard, and it would have an invalid year
in it, like 1974 or something, and basically the machine would
continue to keep checking. Every time it checked, it saw that
the date was not right and this put it into a loop.

"They had to do an update in CE to fix all those dates. So the
way we did that in the warehouse was, they would post whatever
the update was  on the FTP site. James would go get the file
and put it on the [memory] cards. Because you load everything
through the PCMCIA cards. You boot it up using the card and it
loads the new software.

"This was done in the warehouses -- once the machines were sent
out to the county, these updates were done just to make sure
the machines were running correctly. I went over to Dekalb [County].
We updated 1800 machines in basically a day and a half. I still
remember ol' Rusty, down at the warehouse, we ended up touching
every single machine off the pallet, booting 'em up, update it,
we had a couple hundred machines done when in comes a new update
over the phone.

Harris: "You mean you used a modem or they called you on the
phone?"

Behler:  "No. A phone call. They'd say 'Oh no no, the way we
had you do, that's not going to work, here's another thing to
do. Okay, we just did a few hundred machines, now we gotta do
it this way -- But we got it done.

Harris: "Did you personally ever download anything at all from
the FTP site?"

Behler:  [it was] mostly James.

Harris: "Did you work for Diebold, or James Rellinger?"

Behler:  "I worked for ABSS. So did James."

Harris: "What about the rob-georgia file?"

Behler:  "I think they put it out there for me when we were doing
the Dekalb thing, but I was busy managing the whole crew so,
I had my laptop out, and one of the engineers used my laptop
-- or maybe it was James -- one of them had to go in and get
it from the FTP, put it on a card, make copies of the cards and
then we used them to update the machines."

Harris: "So one of the people downloaded the patch and then made
copies of it?"

Behler:  "They use my laptop. It was not secure, either. They
just used the laptop to repro the cards. Diebold never gave us
anything with a PCMCIA slot, then they'd tell us, 'Go download
this,' so we'd have to get out our own laptop to do it."

Harris: "Who instructed you about the FTP site?  Was it a Diebold
employee?"

Behler:  "It was Diebold."

Harris: "Was it the people in Ohio or the people in Texas?"

Behler:  "The people in McKinney [Texas]."

Harris: "Who were some of the Diebold people? Do you remember
any names?"

Behler:  "Ian. I remember one of the guys, Ian, I can't remember
his last name. One of the main guys we dealt with was a guy named
Ian. He was actually involved in the design of the motherboard.
He was very much involved in trying to figure out how to fix
the problems. So they sent us upgrades, but then after we did
it KSU still failed a ton of machines."

Harris: "As I understand it, they send the system to Wyle labs
for certification, and also to Ciber to test the software. But
from what you are describing, I can't understand how the machines
got through what they are telling us is 'rigorous testing.'"

Behler:  "From what I understand they ended up figuring out that
the cards that we were loading that fix that Diebold provided
for us, well they were never tested, they just said 'Oh here's
the problem, go ahead and fix it.'

Harris: "So what is your opinion about the certification testing?"

Behler:  "No, it's not just that. NOBODY even tested it! When
I found that out -- I mean you can't not test a fix -- I worked
for a billing company, and if I'd put a fix on that wasn't tested
I'd have gotten FIRED! You have to make sure whatever fix you
did didn't break something else. But they didn't even TEST the
fixes before they told us to install them.

"Look, we're doing this and 50-60 percent of the machines are
still freezing up! Turn it on, get one result. Turn it off and
next time you turn it on you get a different result. Six times,
you'd get six different results."

Harris: "Can you give me an example of different results?"

Behler: "Meaning the machine does something wrong different each
time you boot it up. One time and it would freeze on you, next
time it would load the GEMS program but have a completely different
type of error, like there'd be a gray box sitting in the middle
of it, or you couldn't use a field."

Harris: "Was this all due to the clock?"

Behler:  "I don't know for sure. They [the machines] were not
originally doing it. Then they fixed the real time clock, and
it was supposed to make it work normal. It fixed the clock problem
-- the clock problem had caused it to come up and not show the
battery at one point. It was supposed to say either 'low battery,'
'high battery' or 'charging.' But when the real time clock was
messed up, you'd boot the machine and it would say 'No battery!'
I mean, you don't have the machine plugged in, you boot it up,
and it starts, and says it 'has no battery.' That's like saying,
'this morning I got out of bed and I stood up and I had no brain.'

"And that's how they ended up finding it, the problem. What it
was doing was it was checking for the right time, and kept going
back trying to get a better time, and while it was doing that,
it was supposed to get the battery status but it was still busy
trying to get the time.

"And then when we loaded the software to fix that, the machines
were still acting RIDICULOUS!

"I was saying, 'This is not good! We need some people that know
what this stuff is supposed to do, from McKinney, NOW! These
machines, nobody knows what they're doing but Diebold, you need
some people to fix them that know what's going on! They finally
brought in guys, they ended up bringing in about 4 people.

"When they left, they still did not know why it was still sporadic.
My understanding is, after I was dismissed, they came back the
following week. That's when they figured out what the real problem
was. But they'd already had us do their 'upgrade' on thousands
of machines by then."

Harris: "How did this work? Did Dr. Brit Williams get the machines
first and do acceptance testing, or did you guys get them first?"

Behler:  "When the machines came in, they came to us first. They
were in the warehouse. We assembled them. They'd come in a box
with a touchscreen, and another box with the booth. We assembled
the machine and we ran it though series of tests. We'd check
the power cord, boot up the machine, check the printer, bar code
it, update Windows CE,  then send it on to Brit. He did the KSU
testing the L&A [Logic & Accuracy] was done at the county level,
right before the election."

Harris: "So...the L&A was not done at acceptance testing?"

Behler: "It got so there wasn't time. They did it before the
election."

Harris: "How long does it take to do a Logic & Accuracy test?
Doesn't it take like, 15 minutes per machine?"

Behler:  "When we did the updates in Dekalb, they kept saying
it would take a really long time. But they don't think about
the different overlapping things. You can update a bunch of machines
simultaneously. Same thing with an L&A test. You have a whole
group of cards, they have to touch every machine. What we had
done before, we had 10 material handlers throw the machines up
there, use the key to open it up, stick 10 cards in, boot 'em
all up which installs the patch."

Harris: "But what about the L&A testing?"

Behler:  "The L&A testing -- You would just enter, like, one
vote and -- you just choose one -- you don't need to be specific
on which one. When they did this L&A testing, that's when they
did the FINAL update to the software."

...
Harris: "So the touchscreens came and had to be assembled?"

Behler:  "Of course you have to have the touchscreens assembled
in the warehouse, and do some testing. It turned out that there
were a lot of problems that needed to be dealt with, and they
simply weren't dealing with them."

Harris:  "How long did you work there?"

Behler:  "They let me go only one month into it. The Project
Manager let me go. He didn't like my management style. I'm very
matter of fact. If this is wrong, fix it. I'm a simple person
--  if something is broke, do you stand around and talk about
why its broke for a month, or do you solve the problem?"

Harris: "After your experience with Diebold, how confident are
you that the machines count votes accurately?"

Behler:  "If you were to ask me to tell you how accurate I thought
the vote count was, I'd have to say 'no comment' because after
what I saw, I have an inherent distrust of the machines.

"I was absolutely astounded that they functioned at all in the
election. Here's me, I'm at the polling place looking around,
waiting for someone to get frustrated...

"I took this because of  James, who is my friend, and because
I'm A-plus certified. But when I came in there was a bunch of
internal bickering. They had no inventory control in the warehouse.
I guarantee you that the state of Georgia can't accurately reflect
where each machine is.

"Diebold was impressed with what I accomplished, and asked me
if I was available for some other states they'd be doing...

"The problem, what they were doing with the inventory on the
machine was this: Inside the case is the serial number. They
would hand write the serial number on a post-it, stick it to
the front of the machine, and there would be a sheet hand-written
from that list. Now, you've got 20 machines sitting on a pallet.
The guy making the list would look at the post-its and he'd record
all the post-it numbers on a list. Look, if you're writing numbers
by hand, twice, by two different people, there is a real good
chance you'll transpose some numbers.

Then, they used the list for bar codes, but I would say probably
1-2% of the machines are incorrectly bar coded. They couldn't
track them in the Access database, because they'd punch in and
it would say 'that number's already been used.' Then they'd check
the machines, and they had the right number, so the wrong bar
code was sitting on some machine that had already been shipped
out to the counties.

"Ironically, they would send a spreadsheet of all the numbers
of the machines that they shipped straight from the factory.
This was from the same computer that generated the labels. They
had copies of it all along. I said, 'Hey guys, if you check these
when they come in the door you'll never miss a label.'"

"I was very down on Diebold, because they were very sluggish
and didn't move well. I worked there from mid-june to mid-july.
The whole time they were upgrading the software and doing some
sort of fix to it. This was supposed to be prior to KSU testing."

Harris: "What about the program patches begun in August?"

Behler:  "Aug 20,  they started to put these teams together and
go out and update the machines. You have to understand that the
patching all started when I did the first quality check that
Saturday. They'd never have done it. They had shipped us 6,000
machines and NO ONE had ever done a quality check. I'd come in
on a Saturday, I had two of my sons with me, and I thought I'm
going to just look. And it was bad.

"Then first thing Monday morning I raised the question, I said,
'Hey guys, we've got a problem -- there's 20-25% of the machines
that are palletized that are failing, and then  they had a new
update come out and I was doing an update, and then they sent
a new one. I updated a whole bunch of machines. Then they finished
about the time I left. But later they put in another one, I guess.
In August.

"You've gotta go take care of this JS [junk shit] equipment,
I told them. Finally, I raised it as high as you go, I raised
it to Bob Urosevich, he's the head of it. I told him personally,
'This is bad, I don't see us putting an election on with these
machines!'

"That's where they finally assembeld the teams. They got some
big ol' vans we loaded up as many people as could fit in.

"They were actually swapping parts out of these machines that
were on site. They'd cannibalize a machine with a bad printer
or whatever, they'd grab the screen off of that to put on another
machine with a failing screen, they'd retest it. They were not
just breaking them down, they were taking pieces off and putting
it back together.

"Even the machines that are updated, that had the right release
of the software, exactly like the company wanted it, you'd boot
it up and all kinds of crazy things would happen. That led to
my belief that when voting took place, there would be problems."

Harris: "Do you remember what release number it was? What version
of GEMS?"

Behler:  "Release -- I don't remember the number because what
they did was it was always the date. I had to take it to the
level of these testers, they knew that the machine either did
pass the test or didn't. We'd check the date to make sure it
was the right version.

"The date was...let me see...June 28. No, the last one, the date
that was supposed to be on there was July 5. (Note: a patch labeled
Georgia062802.zip is on the ftp site, and when you review it,
you will see that it contains much more than just the "Windows
updates" claimed by Georgia officials.)

"There was about three updates, the CE software, the date that
would come up would be the last. After that they came up with
another fix, that's the August one at that point.


"I told Darryl Graves, the Project Manager, I told everyone at
Diebold, 'I have zero confidence in the ability of these machines
to perform.'

Harris: "I understand that they go through Wyle testing labs
and so forth. How in the world do so many critical errors get
through certification?"

Behler:  "When I was handling these machines, they were coming
straight from a factory in North Carolina. That's where the actual
touch screen was manufactured. Booths came out of California.
We assembled the booth with the machine. That's all I know."

Harris: "What do you know about the ROM chip, or whatever?"

Behler:  "There's the eprom, or the flash as they call it. A
lot of the fixes they did they could do in the flash memory.


"If they said they tested it I'm going to tell you right now
the software that I installed on the machine myself, they found
out that that was NEVER tested. Okay, I don't want to get other
people involved, but you should talk to Rellinger.

"Anyway, that they had never tested it, that made complete sense
to me, watching what was going on.

"This is an example we did: We would plug it in, boot it 3 times,
unplug it, boot it three more times. I wrote a sheet on this.
This guy came in from McKinney, he was about the second in command.
He's a good friend of Bob Urosevich. About second to Bob, at
least now, he got a promotion. Greg? Something like that. He
flew in and I went to Dekalb and I tested and together we went
through, and we wrote down every single error, and he booted
them himself, and was looking at the results and seeing how sporadic
they were. and we found out of the machines we tested, about
75% of the machines had different sporadic things. He was working
with me and we were writing them down, we literally wrote everything
down."

Harris: "Do you have a copy of that?"

Behler:  "I don't think I have it. I have some email. I'd have
to look. I know we came back and he copied it and he -- Greg
Lowe (spelling?) is his name. I drove him out there. Brit was
there, KSU was doing their testing. They were bombing these machines
out left and right."

"I'm telling him, 'They're all like this.' At this time I was
working 150 hours in 2 weeks I was there all the time with these
machines, that's the reality of it. The techs were working overtime
trying to fix them. We couldn't get enough from the factory because
so many were bad. You'd get a shipment of 300, but 75 were bad,
they couldn't put them out fast enough to replace all the defects.

"It was the software, not the hardware, that's where the problem
was.

"If they're telling you they tested that, well they did NOT test
the fixes that they did to the windows CE software.

Harris: "Do you know who was writing the fixes?"

Behler:  "He had a weird name. He came out of Canada."

Harris: "Guy Lancaster? Josh ...Talbot Iredale?"

Behler:  "That's it! Talbot Iredale would actually fix it and
say, 'Oh, here's the problem,' and stick it on the FTP site we'd
grab it stick it on the card and make a bunch of copies and use
it." (NOTE: You'll see the initials "tri" in the source code
files. Talbot R. Iredale is one of the main programmers, and
has been a stockholder.)

Harris: "So you took the patches right off the FTP site and installed
them on the machines?"

Behler:  "That's what we did, he'd FTP it, and tell us to grab
it, we'd put it on a laptop,  copy it and when you boot the machine
--  it's just like a computer that looks at the "A" drive --
these machines look at the card and then erase the flash, reprogram
with whatever they said needed to be fixed -- I say, erase it
and reprogram it with crap -- and then the whole thing would
start all over again.

"My understanding was that they figured out what was conflicting
and James told me that Tab, well the team that came out after
I left, they figured out what was going on, they figured out
that when they fixed the real time clock problem they had never
tested their fix.

"The only people that that cost was Diebold, who had to pay all
kinds of extra expenses. The rumor around the office was that
Diebold lost maybe $10 million on the Georgia thing. I mean,
they only sold the machines for what, $2,000, or $2,500, and
then you have to build them and then you're paying people $30
an hour and you are out touching 22,000 machines FOUR TIMES --
there's no way they didn't lose money on this deal.

Behler:  "You know one of the main things that really just made
me so upset, they were just like, 'This Brit guy, don't even
speak to him, it's a political game, you've gotta play the politics.'
Well, he walks in and says 'What are you guys doing?'

I said, 'We're putting in an update.' He said, 'Will it change
what it does?'
We said, 'Just do your normal test, we're supposed to get the
machines ready for you.'

He tells someone at the office and they freaked out. They were
like, 'What the heck are you doing???'

"I wasn't supposed to talk to him at all, I guess. The guy had
a flannel shirt on, he was kicking it and he was very genuine
and open and there we are in the same room together, but because
I actually spoke to him I got reprimanded. They said, 'If they
ask you any question, you gotta say 'Talk to Norma, to one of
us.''

"And then you know, ironically, later on right before I exited,
they were scrambling for a date, they were trying to get us,
the teams, into Fulton County to do Fulton County's 1,900 machines.

"They were in the most horrific spot. The place they warehoused
them was like 1900 machines in a little office space, there was
no way we could get at them. The machines are like 58 pounds,
and they had to bring them in unstack them off the pallet, restack
on the pallet, talk about labor, talk about wasted money! It's
like a warehouse and offices off 75, in Atlanta, I'm talking
to this guy he's a great guy, he's from Fulton County. Him and
I were scheduling this, figuring it out how to get to these machines
and do the update before KSU has to test them. We cannot be doing
this at same time as KSU because there was NO ROOM for that.

Brit had been down there, he knew this. I'm talking to the Fulton
County guy. He opens this one last door and here's this huge
giant empty warehouse. Why didn't they put the machines out here?

He says, 'Well you see over there's these boxes of county material,
you can't be out here because there may be some sensitive stuff
in these files. They don't want anybody near 'em. His name was
Barney, the only Barney I've met who's black. He said, "Yeah,
they were talking about putting a fence out here."

"We could just get all the testing done at once, I thought. Whatever.
Maybe someone could just get a security guard to watch us and
make sure we don't get into the boxes. I go back to the office.
Brit was there, and he says 'What's it look like for Fulton?'

I said 'There's no way were going to able to get to Fulton County
by Thursday.' I said we could probably be out there by Friday
or Saturday. He said 'There's no way we can do it at the same
time, you know that.'

Behler:  "I think a lot of the problems they had ---- I've worked
in billing software, and it's common to have this little thing
wrong -- a simple little hardware change, you have to put some
little line of code in Windows CE to make it work better. But
the thing that blew me away was when I'm told me they'd NEVER
TESTED THE FIX.

"They produced it and got it to us in 24-48 hours. If I'd known
they hadn't tested it I simply wouldn't have installed it! My
background tells me that's a no-no.

"I went into this Diebold thing with no real knowledge of the
voting industry. When I left, I not only had a complete grasp,
but I had a complete disrespect for these machines.

"And with the folks in the office who were so -- you know, 'I'm
the political person, you have to know how the system works'
-- they were so much more concerned about their own self importance,
they were losing track of DO THE MACHINES COUNT THE VOTE PROPERLY!

"Because that's what the people in Georgia need. And I'm one
of them!"

Harris: "Who are some of the names working in that office?"

Behler: "Norma Lyons and Wes Craven -- they're from Diebold,
and Keith Long. Norma and Wes live in George, Keith was in Maryland
before, then here, I think.

"They sat in the weekly meetings on Monday. Norma had been a
county worker doing voting for 10 years. She knew all these people
in several counties. She was the liason between Diebold and the
counties. They [Diebold] would tell you something important,
and she may or may not tell you because she wouldn't know how
important it was.

"Wes was the kind of guy who needs to work for Sprint or a big
company..."

Harris: "How secure were the machines, from what you saw?"

Behler:  "I'll tell you something else -- we didn't have badges
-- people could just walk right in and get to the machines."

Harris: "And that FTP site, anybody could walk right into it
also. Even Diebold's competitors."

Behler:  "Anybody who's in voting, you leave one company you
go over there. Ooh yeah, we'll take you on. Someone comes in
and says, 'By the way, I uploaded the source code, want to grab
it?'"

Harris: "Were there any protections to keep you from duplicating
memory cards, or to have them serial numbered or whatever?"

Behler:  "The memory cards, you can just duplicate them. You
have to have the proper info on the card, for the machine to
boot up, but you can just make copies of the cards."

Harris: "Were there any passwords on those FTP files?"

Behler:  "No."

Harris: "Any passwords on the files themselves? Or the site?"

Behler:  "What we got never had passwords. You just pick it up
and use it."

Harris: "Do you still have any records?"

Behler:  "Emails. And James downloaded to his personal laptop,
it's probably still on his. And probably still on mine too. Diebold
didn't provide us with anything with a PCMCIA slot so we had
to use our own laptops to transfer the files when they told us
to.

Harris: "When I asked Diebold if there was anyone named Rob in
Georgia, they said no. Did they know about you?"

Behler: "They knew me and they knew me well. I met Bob Urosevich
a couple different times, and Ian, and then Greg Lowe, he got
promoted to like almost the DFO, he was basically Bob's right
hand man."

"If you would have realized the scolding I got for actually speaking
to Brit. The whole quality control issue, I kept having to remind
them, I'm the one that pointed this out -- we want this to be
right -- my goal is to just get it fixed and move on.

...
Harris: "Do you think anybody could have tampered with a machine,
if they wanted to?"

Behler:  "Well, when we did the quality control check we'd open
it up, they have a little box for the printer. We would find
the key still in the printer. Someone could literally take that.
We found cards left in the machine. I wondered what would happen
if the wrong person got it."

Harris: "I understand they did a big demonstration during the
summer, with the machines."

Behler:  "I was there when they told me I needed 1100 machines
for a demo. I thought, 'The trick is coming up with 1100 machines
that actually work.

Thomas Kinsella's "Phoenix Park," in _Nightwalker and Other Poems_ (1967),
an important poem in his transition toward more adventurous,

Louis,

Quite interesting, this way of looking at ("reading") language poetry, hypo-
and paratacticly. I've been reading Toner today and no longer consider it so
potentially banal (as you said, I believe in another post) since I'm reading
Silliman now without making the connections and at the same time (or at
"different" "other" "undisclosed" times) suspending the connections and,
finally, making the connections in some sort of inchoate or incipient state
in my mind (i.e., the nonsubordination of words by other words called
parataxis such as in Pound's "and went down to the ship..."--, that 'and'
not connecting anaphoricly with anything, and the 'so that' at the end of
Canto I not cataphoricly connecting with anything unless its the second
Canto) and later to emerge from that incipient inchoate state, or not ever
until maybe a later reading I make of it.

However, I cannot help but think that this is what in a way the
Metaphysicals did (that violent yoking) and the Surrealists in their way
(the chance meeting of umbrella and sewing machine).

How does Silliman differ from the latter?

Obviously, reading Charles Henri Ford's Om Krishna I I can see the
difference in terms of form or the sentence. However, the difference is not
that obvious because, perhaps, Om Krishna I could be broken up in the way
Silliman does in Toner.

But, then, Ford's vocab. is much different and just breaking up his lines
would not result in Silliman.

The basic question is though, I think, where does this parataxis lead or not
lead to?

If Chomsky is right in saying that language is a mental organ, quite
literally speaking, then, given the Whorf-Lee-Sapir Hypothesis, Silliman's
world is seen through his language. A kind of prismatic kaleidoscopic world
in which, in a way, say, that bag lady crops up several times in Toner, or
boogers and snot.

Golden Gate Park in San Francisco has come up a couple of times today - wit=
h
the beauties (poems) by Philip Whalen. Though I have not read the late
William Dickey in a while, he spend many an hour in and wrote of the Park's
wonderful "Arboretum."  GG Park I believe emerged as a Park in the 1880's -
tho John McLaren was the chief architect, I believe he was advised by
Olmsted, who also did public works in the Bay Area, including a graveyard i=
n
the Oakland Hills (which I have not visited). GG Park was ascendant in the
public both in poetry and many other kinds of events - the infamous '67 "Be
In" and numerous psychedelic music events - being right there on the edge o=
f
the Haight and includes a still heavily inhabited and drummed "hippie" hill
not far from the edge of the neighborhood. Zen, Ecology, Nature etc. each
coalesced around the Park during that era - and much poetry was a natural
outcome from the association. The Park remains, of course, a central City
and community treasure - where an incredible diversity of kinds of folks
gather and certainly a place where I frequently walk. In human terms - if
not those of Walter Benjamin -  it's probably one of the best places to get
a profile of city folks variously 'acting out their souls'.  Here's a piece
I wrote in the context of entering the new millennium:
=20

Saturday, July 24, 1999

Walk with Andrew Moss. 1:45 =AD 3:45. Golden Gate Park. Start from Lincoln
Drive near Sixth =AD a high fog broken into parts - the sun flush on to the
horizon of trees on the western edge of the sunken baseball field =AD quickly
down across Martin Luther King Drive =AD go the north-side, a trail down and
up beyond the bleachers to the small beige concrete building with the two
interior handball courts: inside, through the little square criss-cross mes=
h
wire window, two Latino men, the fierce rivet sound, ball to floor to wall
to floor to wall (sweat, sweat), up the slope and down across Middle Drive
East into a trail between bushes into the Shakespeare Garden: the large
Asian wedding, piles of ripe purple grapes on trays on white table cloths,
the photographer and the videographer, the bride, the groom, the maids on
one side, the men on the other, each with an orchid in hand, profile of sui=
t
and walnut color faces on the green, cut grass against the trees, the sun
illuminating white shirts and pale plum lavender gowns. Exit through the
gate, cross Martin Luther King Drive into the Arboretum, a German couple
with a big Nikon camera, =B3Please, will you take us=B2, focus, trigger, lens,
shutter, snap, up the slight slope of the large lawn, the French seeming
fountain: tall, thin, sun illuminated flutter white water, a geyser to the
sky, hair pin curve down thread north, down and across the wooden bridge =AD
in the water and on the little mud beach, the inevitable dirty, big yellow
billed bright white ducks and green ochre Mallards - up and through the
north Gate, across the road to the trail outside the Japanese Tea Garden,
beside the stone stairway up to Stow Lake, the stray scattering of old,
dirty white, =B3orphan=B2 1893, Hearst imported, monastery stones, several
curled inside the black roots of an old, fallen Oak tree - up and around th=
e
northern edge of Stow Lake, to cross the bridge to the trail around the
interior island, on the water below, the pale, blue foot-pedal propelled
boat - the man inside in a dark tank-top, undecipherable blue and red ink
tattoos on his arms sitting beside his large shouldered mom in her baby blu=
e
blouse, his thin wife in a black-top leans forward to divide the two - over
the south stone bridge, its gentle curve up and down on to the trail back
beside the lake, back down the stairs, east on Martin Luther King, a fork
off to the east to the Band Shell at the top of the Concourse between the
Aquarium and the De Young, the bunch of body-throbbing, stationary young
dancers on stage, while on the ground below, the DJ working under the
sun-illuminated, lime green awning with the word BRAINDROP: the electric
drone, bass whump music, the dancers in their teens - violet, green and red
dyes in their hair - in the trance, trance, trance , music echo, walk up th=
e
Concourse to the east, the sculpture of Columbia, with thin horns for ears,
needling high into the blue sky, now through a tunnel out of the Concourse,
the trail elevates, the green bronze sculptures of Goethe and Schiller,
hands sharing a wreath of laurel, on to a trail through Rhododendron bushes
-  no longer in pink spring bloom- back across the Middle Drive East to edg=
e
of the baseball diamond around the wide, somewhat steep trail up the hill,
parallel to which five young Latinos in tank tops in a bicycle carriage
scream and careen out of control down the grassy slope on to left field;
take one last look across the Diamond over the trees into the blue horizon,
the short way back to Lincoln Drive and the parked car.

Sip in, with muster, signals;

glaciations within your dowry

so that I may sweat with a bad belly
and breasts, signature of cancer:

the scorpio toll that wages
in gestures almost scars pours
through those pinhole glimpses
of somewhere very bright where
behind the sky we kiss again,


 lay down


with the accomplishment of shadows
is skill, oh baby what kills me

in your cute is the usual gradations,
the stuff that fumbles me when
reaching out through your utter trust
I grab everything that isn't mine,

break it down into my component
fantasy, smother me in shit up
and take notice of you, burning up
every room you smooth with thoughts
about sand and its noise in my throat;

you're talking to the uninitiated, baby,
 syntax like a last cigarette in a pack of
clouds, in my mouth, tan


and dead with motors; do
you see now what starving?

A quick note to folks to say

1) my website with the Prynne bibliography & promotional stuff for _The Gig_
got killed when Sprint dropped their webhosting service; I've temporarily
relocated to http://www.geocities.com/ndorward/index.html (sorry about the
ads).  It's time for a serious website overhaul but this will do for now,
getting you the basic info & restoring the Prynne bibliography.

2) I'm away from this afternoon till August 2nd.  I'll best be reached at
nd_away@hotmail.com for the interim.

3) Been a lag in mailing out some of the copies of the Raworth collection,
especially to US subscribers, because I was away for two weeks shortly after
publication, & then ran out of the bookmark tip-in (which is printed by Tom
himself) & had to wait till I'd received a shipment of more of them.  My
apologies!  This afternoon I mailed out the rest of the copies I owed
people, so if you haven't seen it yet you should see it by next week.

all best,

Matt,

        Meet my personality.
        A deaf man’s whistle
        could seem inexact.
                            I don’t
                   want to get my
        feathers hot.
        Bag lady stands in


Humorous first line sets a tone. What -- Is he carrying his personality
under his arm like a friggin pet? What does a personality look like, anyway?
Personality is hard to pin down, it's somewhat insubstantial, yet everyone
wants it -- apparently, according to the 1946 pop hit, "Personality" where
it is a euphemism for sex-appeal (itself a euphemism for [fill in the lack]
etc) (sung in different versions by Johnny Mercer, and [in the movie, The
Road to Utopia] Bing Crosby and Dinah Shore). What sexist lyrics,
http://ntl.matrix.com.br/pfilho/html/lyrics/p/personalityjm.txt,
but the refrain is fucking with my brain! Is that the song's own personality
coming through?

You're born with personality, they say (that's the received idea). Think of
it as a unique music of one's being, then.
But (following this analogy to music) what if one were deaf -- one still has
personality?
Does one then have a "defective" personality, like one can have a tone-deaf,
or "inexact" whistler?
I refuse to let these questions ruffle my feathers (so to speak)!
Ok, I'm pretty fucked up. Oh, but forget about me. Look at that bag lady.
She's worse off than me! She's actually *wearing* feathers -- feather boa,
anyway (she must have found it some place). There, but for the grace of
*personality* (that refrain again!), go I. She's standing in for me here, as
I write about her.

I thought people might be interested in this little fact, I discovered today
that Isaac Newton wrote a 3 million word essay based on the Book of
Revelations which calculates that the world will end in the year 2060.
Fortunately, by then, if still alive, I will be so gaga that I won't have
the faintest idea of what's happening. Ironic grins apart, it did strike me
that the power of 'script', of the written word, to turn reality on its head
is so immense.

All the Best

Stephen,
Thanks for the walk through the park. Also, Golden Gate Park regularly
occurs in Whalen's fiction, You Didn't Even Try and Imaginary Speeches of a
Brazen Head. I used to have a shop in the glass house conservatory in Golden
Gate Park .  Over the years I helped them develop their bromeliad and orchid
collection with plants from my greenhouse (Shelldance, now a part of the
Golden Gate Recreation Area) in Pacifica. Michael McClure used to come out
to the conservatory to visit, a couple times a week for years, and we would
tromp all over the gardens.  Margo Patterson Doss, journalist, one of the
queen bees of Bolinas life, friend to all those poets on the Mesa, used to
write a weekly column for the SF Chronicle called "Bay Area At Your Feet",
encouraging people to take "discovery walks of the park" as well as other
regional parks. She was always bringing poets together and introducing them,
or housing poets who were coming through town, like Olson and Whalen. Her
book Bay Area At Your Feet is good resource for parks in SF Bay Area. Maybe
the most awesome feature of PARKS in the Bay Area is The Golden Gate
National Recreation Area (GGNRA). It's the largest urban national park in
the world. The total park area is 75,398 acres of land and water.
Approximately 28 miles of coastline lie within its boundaries. It is nearly
two and one-half times the size of San Francisco. It includes Pt. Reyes
National Seashore, Muir Woods, Angel Island, Alacatraz, The Presidio, Ft.
Funston, Ft. Baker, The Marin Headlands, the beaches on Great Highway,
Sweeney Ridge(now includes tShelldance), Mori Point, San Pedro Mountain.
Though it is a National Park and one thinks about National Parks differently
than PARKS, it is important to see how it interweaves with the city and is
used by the city in a daily, strolling way, the wayo one thinks of a local
park. It is one of the things that makes San Francisco livable, providing
this three county long greenbelt. Most people in the town don't realize that
it is one huge system because it was was designed to consider the various
neighborhoods it touched.

Golden Gate Park in San Francisco has come up a couple of times today - with
the beauties (poems) by Philip Whalen. Though I have not read the late
William Dickey in a while, he spend many an hour in and wrote of the Park's
wonderful "Arboretum."  GG Park I believe emerged as a Park in the 1880's -
tho John McLaren was the chief architect, I believe he was advised by
Olmsted, who also did public works in the Bay Area, including a graveyard in
the Oakland Hills (which I have not visited). GG Park was ascendant in the
public both in poetry and many other kinds of events - the infamous '67 "Be
In" and numerous psychedelic music events - being right there on the edge of
the Haight and includes a still heavily inhabited and drummed "hippie" hill
not far from the edge of the neighborhood. Zen, Ecology, Nature etc. each
coalesced around the Park during that era - and much poetry was a natural
outcome from the association. The Park remains, of course, a central City
and community treasure - where an incredible diversity of kinds of folks
gather and certainly a place where I frequently walk. In human terms - if
not those of Walter Benjamin -  it's probably one of the best places to get
a profile of city folks variously 'acting out their souls'.  Here's a piece
I wrote in the context of entering the new millennium:


Saturday, July 24, 1999

Walk with Andrew Moss. 1:45 ­ 3:45. Golden Gate Park. Start from Lincoln
Drive near Sixth ­ a high fog broken into parts - the sun flush on to the
horizon of trees on the western edge of the sunken baseball field ­ quickly
down across Martin Luther King Drive ­ go the north-side, a trail down and
up beyond the bleachers to the small beige concrete building with the two
interior handball courts: inside, through the little square criss-cross mesh
wire window, two Latino men, the fierce rivet sound, ball to floor to wall
to floor to wall (sweat, sweat), up the slope and down across Middle Drive
East into a trail between bushes into the Shakespeare Garden: the large
Asian wedding, piles of ripe purple grapes on trays on white table cloths,
the photographer and the videographer, the bride, the groom, the maids on
one side, the men on the other, each with an orchid in hand, profile of suit
and walnut color faces on the green, cut grass against the trees, the sun
illuminating white shirts and pale plum lavender gowns. Exit through the
gate, cross Martin Luther King Drive into the Arboretum, a German couple
with a big Nikon camera, ³Please, will you take us², focus, trigger, lens,
shutter, snap, up the slight slope of the large lawn, the French seeming
fountain: tall, thin, sun illuminated flutter white water, a geyser to the
sky, hair pin curve down thread north, down and across the wooden bridge ­
in the water and on the little mud beach, the inevitable dirty, big yellow
billed bright white ducks and green ochre Mallards - up and through the
north Gate, across the road to the trail outside the Japanese Tea Garden,
beside the stone stairway up to Stow Lake, the stray scattering of old,
dirty white, ³orphan² 1893, Hearst imported, monastery stones, several
curled inside the black roots of an old, fallen Oak tree - up and around the
northern edge of Stow Lake, to cross the bridge to the trail around the
interior island, on the water below, the pale, blue foot-pedal propelled
boat - the man inside in a dark tank-top, undecipherable blue and red ink
tattoos on his arms sitting beside his large shouldered mom in her baby blue
blouse, his thin wife in a black-top leans forward to divide the two - over
the south stone bridge, its gentle curve up and down on to the trail back
beside the lake, back down the stairs, east on Martin Luther King, a fork
off to the east to the Band Shell at the top of the Concourse between the
Aquarium and the De Young, the bunch of body-throbbing, stationary young
dancers on stage, while on the ground below, the DJ working under the
sun-illuminated, lime green awning with the word BRAINDROP: the electric
drone, bass whump music, the dancers in their teens - violet, green and red
dyes in their hair - in the trance, trance, trance , music echo, walk up the
Concourse to the east, the sculpture of Columbia, with thin horns for ears,
needling high into the blue sky, now through a tunnel out of the Concourse,
the trail elevates, the green bronze sculptures of Goethe and Schiller,
hands sharing a wreath of laurel, on to a trail through Rhododendron bushes
-  no longer in pink spring bloom- back across the Middle Drive East to edge
of the baseball diamond around the wide, somewhat steep trail up the hill,
parallel to which five young Latinos in tank tops in a bicycle carriage
scream and careen out of control down the grassy slope on to left field;
take one last look across the Diamond over the trees into the blue horizon,
the short way back to Lincoln Drive and the parked car.

Kan. Mom Says Work Banned Gay Rights Talk


Thursday July 17, 2003 3:19 PM


By JOHN MILBURN

Associated Press Writer

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - A public library employee says she was reprimanded=20=

after she talked openly at work about gay rights following last month's=20=

U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down anti-sodomy laws.

Bonnie Cuevas, a board member of the Kansas Unity and Pride Alliance=20
and mother of a gay man, said two administrators at the Topeka-Shawnee=20=

County Library verbally reprimanded her for talking about the case and=20=

told her she was prohibited from discussing gay rights at work.

They cited a complaint from a co-worker who felt the subject was=20
creating a hostile work environment. Cuevas had discussed the case on=20
the phone and with a co-worker.

The American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to the library=20
Wednesday, asking officials to reconsider their prohibition on Cuevas'=20=

ability to discuss the case, without the group resorting to legal=20
action.

David Leamon, director of the library, said he recently returned from=20
vacation and was not aware of the situation. If anything, he said,=20
Cuevas would have been told not to use the telephone for personal=20
matters and that the library doesn't take sides on issues.

``The subject is not an issue at all,'' Leamon said.

Leamon said the staff complained that Cuevas, 54, was being disruptive=20=

because of the frequent, impassioned telephone calls. ``We never issue=20=

gag orders,'' Leamon said. ``The library is on neutral ground and we=20
don't take positions on issues.''

Following the high court's decision, Cuevas, an events coordinator for=20=

the library, spoke by telephone to friends and reporters about the=20
decision and how it affects her family. She also talked about the=20
decision to a co-worker who approached her for information about the=20
decision, she said.

Ken Choe, staff attorney for the ACLU in New York, said he was=20
optimistic the library would remove the restriction.

``If there was a concern about spending too much time on the phone for=20=

personal reasons, that's one thing,'' Choe said. ``All Mrs. Cuevas is=20
seeking to do is talk about this landmark Supreme Court decision as any=20=

employee has the right to talk about matters of public concern.''

Cuevas was quoted in USA Today the day after the Supreme Court struck=20
down anti-sodomy laws, including the one on the books in Kansas. She=20
told the paper how her son, now 27, nearly died when he was beaten=20
while leaving a gay bar with his boyfriend.

The interview lasted just a few minutes, Cuevas said, and she also=20
received brief telephone calls from supporters. The next day, she=20
received one more phone call and was approached by a co-worker, who=20
said the ruling was important to him.

She was then told in private by supervisors that not everyone agreed=20
with her views and she was verbally reprimanded, Cuevas said. ``I was=20
just flabbergasted. I couldn't believe it,'' Cuevas said.

Hey guys, get a load of this from the Guardian:
<block quote>The OSP [Office of Special Plans, the shadow intelligence
agency set up by Rumsfeld to circumvent and ostensibly supercede the boys in
the State Dept.]was an open and largely unfiltered conduit to the White
House not only for the Iraqi opposition. It also forged close ties to a
parallel, ad hoc intelligence operation inside Ariel Sharon's office in
Israel specifically to bypass Mossad and provide the Bush administration
with more alarmist reports on Saddam's Iraq than Mossad was prepared to
authorise.

"None of the Israelis who came were cleared into the Pentagon through normal
channels," said one source familiar with the visits. Instead, they were
waved in on Mr Feith's authority without having to fill in the usual forms.

The exchange of information continued a long-standing relationship Mr Feith
and other Washington neo-conservatives had with Israel's Likud party.

In 1996, he and Richard Perle - now an influential Pentagon figure - served
as advisers to the then Likud leader, Binyamin Netanyahu. In a policy paper
they wrote, entitled A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm,
the two advisers said that Saddam would have to be destroyed, and Syria,
Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iran would have to be overthrown or destabilised,
for Israel to be truly safe.

The Israeli influence was revealed most clearly by a story floated by
unnamed senior US officials in the American press, suggesting the reason
that no banned weapons had been found in Iraq was that they had been
smuggled into Syria. Intelligence sources say that the story came from the
office of the Israeli prime minister.

The OSP absorbed this heady brew of raw intelligence, rumour and plain
disinformation and made it a "product", a prodigious stream of reports with
a guaranteed readership in the White House. The primary customers were Mr
Cheney, Mr Libby and their closest ideological ally on the national security
council, Stephen Hadley, Condoleezza Rice's deputy.

In turn, they leaked some of the claims to the press, and used others as a
stick with which to beat the CIA and the state department analysts,
demanding they investigate the OSP leads.<end block quote>

Pat Buchanan's Jewish Cabal raises its head. Do you wonder why the Muslims
consider it the Crusaders (Zionist and Christians) against them?
I'm not joking here in the Middle West (Ohio) where the Vineyard Church
(located in Westerville, the home of the Temperance Movement during the
Prohibition era) are "prosper" Christians who have been granted by the grace
of God to have financially prospered, and whose pastor is a convert from
Judaism.

Also, get a load of this from Guardian:

<quote>Mr Sawers also rejected suggestions in the British media that Britain
and the US had set up a puppet government. "If it was a hand-picked American
council I do not think you would have found the secretary general of the
communist party, or the leader of Iraqi Hizbullah, or the leader of the
supreme council for the Islamic revolution in Iraq on the council. The fact
is they are on the council because they are significant political
figures."<end quote>

Ergo, you get the Islamic radicals in there and then we go back to topple
them to install, in turn, a nephew of the former Shah or some nobodaddy like
that. Does anybody remember recent history of Algeria?

And finally get a load of this:

Most Iraqis want troops to stay, says poll

Michael Howard, Baghdad
Thursday July 17, 2003
The Guardian

A majority of Baghdad residents feel US and British troops should stay in
Iraq for at least a year, according to the first attempt at an opinion poll.
The You.Gov poll results were released as news emerged that a ground-to-air
missile was fired at a US military plane near Baghdad airport.

The poll said 31% wanted troops to stay "a few years", while 25% said "about
a year."

Only 13% said they should leave now, while 20% said they should go "within
12 months".

The survey also found that half thought the US-led coalition was right to
invade.

You.Gov said there was no certainty that the 798 respondents were a
representative sample and that several interviews were conducted with
gunfire in the background.<end quote>

Don't you like the qualifier 'most' in the title?
Also, this 'most' 31% want the troops to stay 'a few years'

Who's laying bets on Abizaid eventually being installed over Rumsfeld's dead
body?

Prithee my fair dearest list mates -


I humbly offer my services for readings or other general patterns of
entertaining abuse in the greater Northeastern United States of America (I'm
disambiguating locations so as to avoid confusing the Canadian Poet
Laureate) around 04 August - 12 August 2003.  Cities to be visited include
Washington DC, Philadelphia PA, and New York City NY.  Not necessarily in
that order.  I will also be in Minneapolis, MN from 22 July - 29 July.

If you will not allow me to read or are unable to provide a humble
suggestion for permitting me to foist my prams off upon the unwitting,
please sally forth and suggest an occasion for us to share a drink or three.

I promise you I am infinitely more sane than it might appear on paper.  Mr.
Sondheim and Mr. Stefans may vouch for the measured balance of dispassion,
Atticism, and zeal in my temperament.  Sorry to disappoint those who might
have suspected otherwise.


Mr. Patrick Herron
Carrboro Poet Laureate

P.S.: I am the proud recent recipient of a seat of laurels.  The usual size
does not fit my cranial dimensions of course.  My head is not unlike a Macys
Thanksgiving Day Float.  I am glad to now possess something upon which I may
now rest.

This is a fascinating article in the British Independent about US
corporations that are taking it in the wallet as global consumers resent the
NeoCon imperial agenda,  vote with their wallets and reject corporate brands
(Microsoft, CocaCola, Nike, you know the drill).

http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=424992

The cynic in me suggests that in the short run this will give rise to pseudo
branding where these corporations establish impersonator brands to keep
their distribution channels flowing. There will still be Nike shoes but they
will bear new names (like "Lance" or individuals whose heroic reps have not
been compromised by imperial dry drunk madness and recklessness. Gosh wasn't
Tony Blair's "ends justify the means anywhere" speech more than a little
stupefying - as if the fibers in body should determine the nature of Brit-US
actions).

More realistically I assume corporations are going to have to get behind a
softer, kinder image and leader. For all appearances, I suspect George (and
Cheney) will be looked upon as intractable and their "terminator" roles are
about to canned before the next four year season.

Whether the Democrats can pull somebody out of the current can that will
reshape the "American image" is going to require a deep inner-search and
major re-birthing pains!

I am not about to take bets.  But enough of my take, it's an illuminating
article.

Been doing a little research on this and here's the clearest account of
Newton's 4500 pages I've come across:



"The most definitive date he set for the apocalypse, which he scribbled on a
scrap of paper, was 2060.

Newton's fascination with the end of the world, which has been researched by
a Canadian academic, Stephen Snobelen, is to be explored in a documentary,
Newton: The Dark Heretic, on BBC2 next Saturday.

"What has been coming out over the past 10 years is what an apocalyptic
thinker Newton was," Malcolm Neaum, the producer, said.

"He spent something like 50 years and wrote 4,500 pages trying to predict
when the end of the world was coming. But until now it was not known that he
ever wrote down a final figure. He was very reluctant to do so."

Thousands of Newton's papers, which had lain in a trunk in the house of the
Earl of Portsmouth for 250 years, were sold by Sotheby's in the late 1930s.

John Maynard Keynes, the economist, bought many of the texts on alchemy and
theology. But much of the material went to an eccentric collector, Abraham
Yahuda, and was stored in the Hebrew National Library. It was among these
documents that the date was found."

for Renee

I pick fragments of my face out of us. I slip edge
against edge, sole judge of this beauty. I am all
gorgeous scars, for you to trace your fingers through.

As if in cupping rainwater from shattered clouds you
find your hands, so aching, while Jesus laughs and
pulls another spit of sun through my nipples. It's
slick here against the cross, two thieves flanking
her, two thieves who shatter and contract when I touch
what used to be you there. Icarus would want a neater
sentence, but tongues shower the desert in gelatinous
light, with granules of dust I steady this place in me
that was once yours, knowing too that hoping for a
stop to the movement is no hope at all, just space
between both of us and the promises, the goddamned
promises in the hall. Since you left me I walk at
night to gape at that worn-out moon.

What can you do when all the light in the room is
tired of you, and Jah laughs like a drunk freshman,
knocking down each and every wall you put up for
protection? Just beyond you see the brightness
promised by the end of the hall; you reach for it, but
two thieves swoop down from nowhere, the sky maybe,
slowly bloodied, and freeze your face like that, just
when a fresh tide of crying breaks.

what strikes me is the --uh, anti-semitism --of the last paragraph.
as if the hebrew national library were some kind of eccentric, out of
the way, obscure and inappropriate place --more so than a trunk in
some earl's house or the private collection of an economist.

Hi all,

I'm going to press with Boog City at 2 p.m. today and need some quick help:

I need neighborhoods for Melissa Anderson, Liz Brown, Sarah Manguso, and
Edwin Torres. Since we're a community newspaper, I prefer to put East Village
instead of Manhattan, Park Slope instead of Brooklyn.

If you know the nabe, or know any of their email address (which I may have
elsewhere and am looking for) please respond backchannel to this here e-dress.

Also, I need to contact Nick Piombino, and need his location. So if anyone
has his location and/or email address, please backchannel.

THANKS!!

as ever,
david

Yesterday evening I visited The Cantor Center -  Stanford University's
beautiful new Museum - for a good new show called, The Changing Garden: Four
Centuries of Europe & American Art, curated by Betsy Fryberger, accompanied
by a very good & visually packed Catalog (paintings, photographs, original
designs) with several essays,  now published by the University of California
Press.
I don't have the time to go into any detail - but just on the level of of
the comparison of gardens with formal poetic practice is worth its weight in
interesting gold. How different ages/eras invest themselves in the formal
articulation and individual or social relationship to the use of "natural
space" etc.  (Olmsted, naturally(!) one of the players here in.)   The
contrast between American and European counterparts informative.

To go out after to the nearby and restored "Arizona Garden" first planted at
Stanford in the late 19th century - abundant with the sexiest most opulent i
configurations of cacti imaginable (the Victorian imagination managed to get
it way out there in ways that make much contemporary erotica seem a little
mundane or constrained -  well, that's a plug!)

"Walking and thinking, to breathe the site..."   (quote from an essay  on
Richard Hargeaves, Landscape Architect, in San Francisco he put together the
new configuration of Crissy Field along the Bay towards the Golden Gate
Bridge)

Maria--
i think you have misread the paragraph in question
it says that the collector is eccentric, not the museum
eccentric collectors are so  both in truth and in popular tropes
it's a comon phrase and one often said fondly
having managed a new/used/rare record/tape/cd store for seven years at one
point
i can assure you the world is filled with many eccentric collectors
(participated gaily and madly in it myself)
and many eccentric collectors in all fields have donated their collections
to museums, libraries, various institutions
it's a very generous move to make--from an eccentric individual quest to
sharing it with the public
many events daily show that it is dangerous to jump to swift conclusions
from misreadings--
of documents, people, happenings--
how many people are shot by police on a misreading of a gesture . . .

There's a good article in The Literary Guide to the Bible edited by Frank
Kermode on the reception of Revelation.  The article was written by Bernard
McGinn of the U. of Chicago.  It traces the history of this reception from
Augustine through Luther up through Newton and down to our own day.  On p. 537,
McGinn briefly writes about Newton, "The great age of English commentary on
Revelation did not end with the Restoration, but there was little innovative
thought.  Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, defended Mede's views against the
rising tide of more critical scholarship, and Isaac Newton perfected the
mathematical approach to prophetic calculations of world history with a monotony
that led Voltaire to remark that 'Sir Isaac Newton wrote his comment upon the
Revelation to console mankind for the great superiority he had over them in
other respects.'"

France bans 'e-mail' from vocabulary

Friday, July 18, 2003 Posted:  12:35 PM EDT (1635 GMT)

Protecting the language is normal, but e-mail's so assimilated now that
no one thinks of it as American.

-- Marie-Christine Levet, French Internet executive

PARIS, France (AP) -- Goodbye "e-mail", the French government says, and
hello "courriel" -- the term that linguistically sensitive France is
now using to refer to electronic mail in official documents.

The Culture Ministry has announced a ban on the use of "e-mail" in all
government ministries, documents, publications or Web sites, the latest
step to stem an incursion of English words into the French lexicon.

The ministry's General Commission on Terminology and Neology insists
Internet surfers in France are broadly using the term "courrier
electronique" (electronic mail) instead of e-mail -- a claim some
industry experts dispute. "Courriel" is a fusion of the two words.

"Evocative, with a very French sound, the word 'courriel' is broadly
used in the press and competes advantageously with the borrowed 'mail'
in English," the commission has ruled.

Calling it artificial

The move to ban "e-mail" was announced last week after the decision was
published in the official government register on June 20. Courriel is a
term that has often been used in French-speaking Quebec, the commission
said.

The 7-year-old commission has links to the Academie Francaise, the
prestigious institution that has been one of the top opponents of
allowing English terms to seep into French.

Some Internet industry experts say the decision is artificial and
doesn't reflect reality.

"The word 'courriel' is not at all actively used," Marie-Christine
Levet, president of French Internet service provider Club Internet,
said Friday. "E-mail has sunk in to our values."

She said Club Internet wasn't changing the words it uses.

"Protecting the language is normal, but e-mail's so assimilated now
that no one thinks of it as American," she said. "Courriel would just
be a new word to launch."

It seems to be an appropriate response to "Freedom Fries" :-)

Hi Listserv members:

I am working with Yusef Komunyaaka, Charles Rowell, Sonia Sanchez, and ot=
hers
to motivate a literary and artistic response to the AIDS crisis in Africa=
.
We are having a Marathon reading at Bowery Poetry Club (308 Bowery St. an=
d
Houston St.) on September 2 (Tuesday) from 5 PM to Midnight. We would lov=
e
to involve poets and readers from the list. We will completely understand=

if you are not able to be involved. If interested, please contact me dire=
ctly
at 212-723-4125 or devineni@rattapallax.com .

Some of the poets who will be reading are Yusef Komunyaaka, Sapphire, Gra=
ce
Schulman, Glyn Maxwell, Meena Alexander, Timothy Liu, Minnie Bruce Pratt,=

Tory Dent, Willie Perdomo, Bob Holman, William Pitt Root, Karen Swenson,
Regie Cabico, Edwin Torres, F.D Reeve, Todd Colby, Cecilia Vicu=F1a, Jack=
ie
Sheeler, Anselm Berrigan, Douglas Martin, C.A. Conrad, Nathalie Handal,
Daniel Nester, Yerra Sugarman, Prageeta Sharma, Bonnie Marcus, Daniela Gi=
oseffi,
Fl=E1via Rocha, Maggie Balistreri, Karma Mayet Johnson, Claudia Alick, Je=
sse
Alick, Guy Sharar, Aracelis Girmay, Isabelle Balot, Bill Kushner, Elaine
Schwager, Jeet Thayil, Ron Price, and others.

I realize poets will not find a cure for AIDS, but we hope that we can mo=
tivate,
educate, and raise funds for organizations working in Africa. The lack of=

interest in Africa has caused 10-20% of the population being infected wit=
h
AIDS in some African nations. We are working closely with the Ghana Educa=
tion
Project (GEP) and other organizations on several levels.

1.      Raise funds for GEP to build libraries and train volunteers as Interna=
tional
AIDS Instructors through the International Red Cross.
2.      Send a delegation to Ghana*
3.      Setup readings in the U.S. and Africa to motivate people and develop
dialogue.
4.      Produce a literary/world music CD on AIDS and donate ALL the proceeds
to GEP.
5.      Work with the UN on World AIDS Day programs.
6.      Setup international exchange program with African poets.

We will be asking audience members for a $10 suggested donation and in re=
turn
they will get to stay as long as they like and get books from Rattapallax=

Press valuing over $20. All proceeds will go to GEP.


Thanks
Ram Devineni

*One major thing we plan to do is send a delegation of leading poets and
writers to the West African nation of Ghana.  The delegation will visit
the Korle-Bu hospital fevers unit and communities devastated by AIDS and
meet with President Kofuor. GEP website is: http://www.ghanaeducation.org=

Of course, no one can fork a fork without at least one fork getting forked,
of course

Announcing The Subday Press Pre-Release Reading

Friday, July 25th, 8PM, Left Hand Books

Boulder, CO

Newly founded Subday Press invites you to the inaugural reading to
celebrate the upcoming release of books of poetry by



                                    Melissa Benham (codeswitching)

                                    Matt Langley (     (...)    )

                                    Sean MacInnes (Critical Series)

                                    Summer Rodman    (a train  came   by
and     slowed)

                              and Teresa Sparks.    ( untitled )





We hope you can join us to celebrate the emergence of five recently
graduated Naropan writers and one fledgling press onto the literary
scene.

All five poets will be discussing their projects and reading from their
work.  Refreshments will be provided.  Discounted rates will be
available for all volumes (these will be advance orders).  With any
luck, a book or two may be back from the press.





Subday Press was founded by kyle kaufman in a bar in Lousiville shortly
before xmas, and is happy to be releasing five volumes of poetry this
summer.  Our thanks to Left Hand and Laura for offering to host.

I lost the backchannel address of the person to send ghazals to - anyhow, why
not brave another here?

Ghazal Improvisation

My expositional brain working to grasp at thought
develops eggshell cracks, hence, leakage of thought.

So many spins of the carousel, riding uncountable rounds,
so dizzy I don't catch the brass ring of a single thought.

As the dock creaks your figure sways.   I gaze
nonplussed at the foamy tracks of your thought.

Sky a gray canvas.  Call a breeze to daub fantasy clouds
where we stand among wild poppies, lost in thought.

Whatever I say whatever I do fails of any success:
Oh Charlotte, self-detractor of pride in poetic thought!

of course one ~can~ speak with a forked tongue,
but a tongue is a sandwich meat unless of course
its pastrami which is eaten with the fingers and not a fork
and it's just plain weird to eat a sandwich with a fork
unless its open faced and I of course keep my face closed

These comments about Silliman's blog indicate to me how Brian is super
attentive to the outer limits of a sociological code that Silliman has
(among others associated with LP) imported into poetry. Without question,
the outer constitutive limits of the code, which point to structural faults
and such in the very code itself, are in constant need of adjustment and
revision, not defense.

What could, and I think should, be defended, though, but not as in any way
integral to either an aesthetics of reading or to the direct making of
poetry, is the sociological code itself in poetry. I think it's a great
achievement and a productive, healthy one for the life of multiple poetries.

If one admits that such a code is worth defending, then contesting the
value-neutral word of any statement (since no word is truly neutral) goes
hand-in-hand with defending a kind of principle of objectivity that any
proposed value neutrality needs to be founded on.

So what interests me is how we get from adjustments and revisions at the
level of an aesthetics of reading, to adjustments and revisions of the
sociological code in poetry. Or at least, this I think is a serious
challenge.

I sometimes think Silliman's comments are read as proposing an aesthetics of
reading (which you might love, or hate), rather than as proposing inevitably
self-limiting value-neutral statements. But another way to read Silliman is
as arguing, ultimately, for a kind of principle of objectivity, a principle
that is, of course, in constant need of adjustment and revision by everyone
including Silliman himself (since no word can be value-neutral, after all!).

So, I have a difficult time understanding why anyone would want to turn
Silliman/LP into the very essence of the mainstream - in every sense of the
word mainstream (class, race, gender, etc), out-Lowelling Lowell, as it
were. I can only understand this move as part of an aesthetics of reading.
It is not yet an adjustment and revision of the sociological code as
practiced in poetry.

To repeat, in this, a crucial point above, the sociological code in poetry,
pro or con, perhaps has little to do, I think, in any direct sense, with
making poetry. It's presence in poetry is a response to the situation in
which poetry finds itself in the broader culture. Poets sometimes feel
compelled to wear these other hats.

I think Brian is pointing in both directions, towards an aesthetics of
reading, and towards improvements and adjustments on the sociological code
in poetry.

Does Anyone know of a good anthology of poetry by poets who are not baby
boomers but are gen x and gen y? As I search all the anthologies of
"contemporary"poetry include poets who were "contemporary"in 1n 1960

Yeah

the article didn't strike me as being anti-semitic as the emphasis was on
the individual eccentricity of the collector, if anything I'd say the
particular slant was on Newton's oddities of mind, my response, as an
Englishman myself, was to chuckle at it: yup, this country is populated by
nutters!

I just realized one thing. I think all the gazels sent to the list repeat the
last word of the second line. In the gazel form the ends of second lines
rhyme with each other, not repeat the last word. Why is that?

I think the way Agha Shahid Ali was teaching the form
in English, the ghazal couplets *end* with the same
word, and repeat an *internal* rhyme somewhere in the
line.

Obviously this is easier to do in Urdu and Arabic in
which many of the words rhyme easier; in Urdu
particularly (I don't know if this is true in Arabic
or Persian) the form takes on specific unity: the last
word of a syntactic sentence is generally the verb

so I guess one version of an English ghazal that would
respect the *intensity* of the Urdu ghazal might be
one that used the same *verb* in each couplet and not
the same final line.

As always, they're in the little magazines.  Hard to find.  But increasingly
evident as they publish more.  I edited an anthology of mostly east coast
poets soon to be out from Potes and Poets Press that has a substantial
number of poets born, say, after 1960.  Which is just to note that such
anthologies might either be currently in the works, or somewhere down a
short line into the future.

The current screening of _Decasia_ on the Sundance Channel might be of
interest to those who have access. I saw it at Zeitgeist in New Orleans a
few months ago. Awesome. Screening times are at the end of this message.

DECASIA

directed by Bill Morrison

YEAR
2002

66 MINS, Color

Appeared at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival

Although film deterioration is a serious threat to the cultural legacy of
the 20th century - 50% of all American films made before 1950 have been
lost - filmmaker Bill Morrison proves that even from tragedy, profound art
can result. Compiling scenes from badly deteriorated archive films,
Morrison has created a highly original experimental film in which the
subjects on screen live in a world of shifting shapes, blobby monsters and
ubiquitous clouds of debris. Likened by one critic to an antiquarian
KOYAANISQATSI, DECASIA is a beautiful, challenging and mesmerizing
meditation on time, mortality and man's longing to transcend his physical
existence. The hypnotic minimalist score was written by Michael Gordon, one
of America's leading young composers and co-founder and co-artistic
director of the new music festival Bang on a Can. TVPG Stereo/BW/Subtitles

Chris Stroffolino, don't say that about your own book!
 It's very good!

But since then, Kevin Prufer has an anthology (through
SIU press?) called New Younger American Poets which
I've used in classes a few times and like very
much...it's a nice range of aesthetics, not all
experimental, but good.  And Carnegie-Mellon put one
out, too, of writers born in the 60s and later which I
like pretty well.

Thanks to Kazim and Murat - I just looked up Agha Shahid Ali's discussion in=
=20
AN EXALTATION OF FORMS (Ed Finch & Varnes).  My previous try of simply=20
repeating end word of second lines was off the mark:   ghazal form also requ=
ires a=20
rhyme, set up in the first couplet, just before the duplicated end word or=20
phrase; last couplet to include poet's name or pseudonym in some way.
So, a new "improv" -

SUMMER GHAZAL

Unusual to breathe honeysuckle breeze in July,
listening within green-leaf rustle, at ease in July.

Ozone lost, we parch in a planetary greenhouse.
Skies boom rainless thunder--an out-of-season July.

Eyes closed, chin in hand, what do I dream to acquire?
A blue-sailed ship across level seas in July.

And milking the goat, do we deprive her kid?
The nursling=E2=80=99s weaned--no guilt to filter cheese in July.

Settle down, wash your hands, pour tea over ice.
All backyard manners of delight are C=E2=80=99s in July.

Jack Myers has done some anthologies--New American Poets of the 80s and New
American Poets of the 90s--that may work for you.

Check out the journal 26, published sort of by people in or associated with the

published out of good old Austin, TX.

The ghazal must have been a formula originally for attaining a higher
state of consciousness.  Why and how they worked out the precise pattern
of repetition is beyond me, but there must have been some sense of the
mathematics focusing the mind into a specific fist that would punch
through the walls of of of... hoonk, for lack of a better word.

Does Ali talk of this?

I started this discussion of ghazals, but all ghazals should be sent to
the list.  The competition, and discussion of ghazals, will continue
until July 24th at midnight, after which there will be no more
discussion of ghazals, and no reception of them.

dear kirby,

there is a new ghazal department in the muse apprentice guild headed by
a writer who has been working in this form for a decade - if you know
other ghazal writers they are invited to submit their ghazals for the
fall issue of the m.a.g.

sincerely,

LOL


LOL lots of love to you and you and you! and wonderful day for you and you
and you! LOL laugh out loud at you and you and you! laugh and laugh out
loud!

They say you can't trace what you feel
When you're faced with little signs
But I think they're like the eel
Slithering among the mines

Avoiding each with fin and tooth
>From head to toe to grave
It's like the butterfly, forsooth,
Dancing in a rave.

But seriously, folks, do these acronyms really work? More and more our
children are faced with 160 character screens and no place to spell out
more than abbreviated feelings.

Which as Freud says, sticks emotion to the symbol. The result is the
atrophy of emotions, a neutral or darkly plain face, perhaps with
sunglasses, staring out uncomprehending the world. What to do? Remember,
the greater the screen size, the more delicate the emotion:

The whole world is our screen! Our emotions fill the skies!

Let us at least use L1 for LOL and L2 for LOL and we will be able, once
and for all, to differentiate between love and laughter!

I just returned home from the Idyllwild Arts Poetry Festival.  I had a
ghazal workshop with Richard Garcia...So expect a few ghazals from me.  I
really like the form, and have worked in it a bit.

Best,

Richard Garcia said that per Agha Shahid Ali, the rhyme comes in the second
line just before the repeating prepositional phrase.

Native Books in Honolulu is an invaluable resource for those of us who
live in Hawai`i.  They've long supported Tinfish Press's endeavors, and
sell our products overseas (over many seas...).

They're consolidating stores and having a sale.

The sale (20% of all books in stock) is available to mainland
supporters from September 15 and the 30th.

Phone 808-845-8949
Fax 808-841-1819
nativebk@lava.net

Or contact my friend there, Ron Cox, at coxr@hawaii.edu

aloha, Susan M. Schultz

PS  Be sure to send your orders to me or to Native Books for the NEW
LINH DINH BOOK!

Waking and sleeping and thinking
And open and closed and awake
And beside and inside and outside
And winter and summer and fall

And eating and talking and laughing
And having and tasting and talking
And people and walking and walkways
And humming and singing and song

And open and closed and open
And many and others and few
And wonders and angels and leaving
And touching and dreaming and you

Peace,

If a Man

Visits the street
Along which his
Childhood home stands

If he, standing still,
Looks hard at where
He once grew

If his mother is gone
If his father is gone
If his children are grown

If a man is
All the songs and seasons
Gone past him

Let him stand
Just let him stand
And let him be a man

<<there's gotta be something better....>>

aren't anthologies instruments entirely inefficient toward redressing
literary disappearances and deficiencies, and they multiply rather than
indemnify the losses? aren't anthologies are inherently rapacious and
unjust? Where is the Emma Goldman of Literature? -- who iwll help us stand
against them? The ideology of anthologies is such that anthologies must be
stood against --and that we must stand against htem with a better anthology
-- can't you see the vicious bicycle??

We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether
sought or unsought, by the anthologico-critical complex. The potential for
the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will continue to persist. --
The anthology by its nature breeds contention. Critical dispute is the
health of the anthology. If an anthology coudl, it would bomb other books.
War is the health of the anthology, especially anthologies that bomb other
anthologies.

Yes, let's have the hegemony of gen x and gen y supercede the hegemony of
the baby boomers.

And, may the baby boomers who were passed up, or by, join the gen xers and
yers in their fight

(gen xers and yers will never win because boomers had more babies than xers
and yers will ever have, like the gods are greater)

The new avantgarde? What about it?

If it's new and avantgarde it can't be avantgarde (avantgarde is not
iterative, it's only been made repetitious)

The post-modern actually means pre-historic as Olson said

piece of advice: don't believe what the boomers feed you about the
avantgarde, there is none, we are merely in an age of consolidation (read
Virgil Thompson on this)

like Spicer said simply be sceptical

like Pound, don't trust what is written up

what is called PR and spin these days


so simply, why would you even want to be in an anthology and what difference
does it make to you anyways?

Here's my attempt at a ghazal as described how to write in this list serve,
more or less:

why, my Love, do bees suck the peach
in holes beetles dug to make a breach

and ants in foraminiferal delight hasten to feast
between rims of the cratered peach

when peach trees are not seen for miles around
then one alone finds one alone makes love beyond reason's bound

that it is beyond any one's love's reach to find
like the moth the penumbra of light it breaches then round it winds

or a dog to a bitch in heat it leeches doesn't mind
to hearken to a pheromonic chemical bark

the beetle flies to the peach's meat it breaches
like a car caroming to a screeching halt to one in park

Read Ali's work.  He collected material to present the ghazal as it is
traditionally known.

This is a new project by the Superheroes of Humanities. I created the
SOF to represent another aspect of my work that is different from the
work by the Worldwide Literati Mobilization Network and the
International Belles Lettres Federation.

This first project by the SOF is called Alphanumeric Labs. The solo
member of AL is Howard Fineman who is a creator of visual poetry.

The first series is entitled "Explore Your First Sexual Experience,
Describing All The Details You Can."
So far there are 38 pieces.

Click on the box that is titled "EXPLORE"

One modification still needs to be made. The current version of
Alphanumeric Labs is designed for a 19-inch screen because of the size
of the pieces. But the window is adjustable.

Alphanumeric Labs is at www.alphanumericlabs.com

Please see my new work. I am hoping that people will enjoy it. This is a
new direction for me and I am eager to hear what people think of this
new work.

Thank you.

sincerely,
august highland

I heard today that Tolkien's first job was doing a two-year stint on the
completion of the first edition of the OED, his speciality was words
beginning in 'w', his work on 'waggle' and 'want' was much admired, but most
of all his exhaustive investigations into the etymology of 'walrus' brought
him accolades.

Just thought you all might want to know that.

All the Best

Very clever Gabriel.  Plus, they cost too much now that publishers see a
perfect market for them in academia.  They promote a certain canon, they
indoctrinate literature and writing students, they make it too easy for
instructors to simply "go by the book," as it were.  It's a pain to have to
make up a reader, and perhaps a certain violation of the writer's rights, but
if a course is going to introduce a number of poets/writers to students (which
is what anthologies do for the general public, aside from their shortcomings),
the xeroxed reader works better and more personally reflects the aesthetics of
the instructor. When I assign books, I assign ones written by single authors.

On the other hand, I still have my Norton Anthologies of English Literature
after all these years.  And at Naropa, during Ginsberg's last summers, he
would read from them and discuss poets who interested him, having made
extensive preparations for his seemingly informal lectures.

Best, Gloria Frym

  thought of you yesterday when i was stuck behind a bus...which
advertised..Btn/Providence..8.75...14.75 round trip...these are chinese jitneys and
remarkably cheap...so should be seeing you in Soho now all the time..

 Anyway..thot i'd share this..from a glitzy/psychedlic brouchure for a
late 60's group...called the HAPPENINGS..."They (the boys) all come from
Patterson, N.J, but for you more mature fellas n' gals it is NOT the Patterson
exemplified by W.C. Williams in that naughty five-book poem...."

  Hope your new surroundings find you well...

The fawn munching lilies looks into the house,

Dozens of red trilliums grow deep in the woods.
Each blooms safe from prey in its own metal cage.
He who revolts against train and plane schedules
rides locked to the highway in his own rolling cage.
She climbs from the car on the run from her spouse,
Gaunt, haunted, and amazed to be free from her cage.

"Why is it that one who is having sexual intercourse, and also a dying
person, casts his eyes upwards, while a sleeper casts them downwards? It
is because the heat going out in an upward direction makes the eyes turn
in the direction in which it is itself traveling, whereas during sleep
the heat collects in the lower part of the body and so inclines the eyes
downwards? The eyes close because there is no moisture left in them."
(Aristotle, Problems, IV, 1, trans. Forster.)

"At Scotussae in Thessaly they say there is a little fountain from which
flows water of such a kind that in a moment it heals wounds and bruises
both of men and of beasts of burden; and if any one throws wood into it,
without having quite broken it, but having merely split it, this unites,
and is restored again to its original state." (Aristotle, On Marvellous
Things Heard, 117, trans. Dowdall.)

"The bird-fly of Florida, for similar reasons, prefers the vignonia. This
is a creeping plant, which finds its way to the tops of the highest trees,
and frequently covers the whole trunk. He builds his nest in one of its
leaves, which he rolls into the form of a coronet; he finds his food in
its red flowers, which resemble those of the fox-glove: he plunges his
little body into them, which appears in the heart of the flower like an
emerald set in coral; and he gets in sometimes so far, that he suffers
himself to be surprised there and caught." (Williams, The Vegetable
World.)

"Since each step in the food chain involves a loss of energy, if one is
interested in an end product such as fish it is obviously important to
have a short food chain in order to utilize the maximum amount of energy
in synthesizing the desired product." (Brock, Biology of Microorganisms.)

"From all we have said, it becomes more and more clear that science is
fundamentally a well-organized aggregate of ideas, a theoretical
structure, and that the scientist is basically a thinker, a theorist, and
only secondarily an observer. All that precedes this state of theoretical
organization of phenomena is pre-scientific." (van Kaam, Existential
Foundations of Psychology.)

"Before refrigeration, when seafood might be kept a few days in a chilly
basement, this phenomenon of glowing decay was observed and noted. Charles
Dickens, in A Christmas Carol (1852), likens Marley's face in the knocker
of Scrooge's door to a glowing lobster: 'Marley's face...had a dismal
light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar.' How may nonmicro-
biologists have passed over that line unable to decipher what image
Dickens had in mind?" (Dyer, A Field Guide to Bacteria.)

"So much for worldly things, for the pleasures of vanity; I went into
detail because they are very rare for me, who have a sensitive soul and an
avaricious father, and because I have need of being disgusted with them in
order to give myself up entirely to my love for Victorine and THE FAME;

Hi Martha:

I'm a novice, but as I understand them, I've made a few comments.
1. The title usually includes the object which the ghazal addresses
2. RG via Ali states that the repeating phrase "should be" a prepositional
phrase that remains as consisten as possible.  So, your prepositional phrase
could be; "in the cage"
3. the internal rhyme is just before the prepositional phrase in the
couplet's second line.  It doesn't have to be a perfect rhyme.  You could go
for assonance, partial rhyme, etc. I see your rhyme scheme is with "play,
prey, highway", etc.  Rearrange in order to place it right before...(e.g.,
play in the cage; display in the cage, etc.)

Hope that helps!

Terrie

To me it is striking that richard Garcia's explanation is in terms of English
syntax. This is incomprehensible to me for several reasons. First, more than
anything technical (rhymes, mid rhymes, etc.), the gazel form has to do with a
speciic sensibility, that of Sufism, with its infinite variations -something
which requires a perceptual stretch rather than metrical techniques.

Different languages (and different poets) have variations on the form, the
main idea being an sound obstinato underlying endless variations, a divine
spiritual unity (essentially based on love) underlying all multiplicity.

Innterestingly, recently the idea of gazel comes to the North american
culture through India, a touch of new wave, Daniel ladinsky, maybe, Richard Garcia,
etc.

The central poet of the gazel form is Hafiz. Both Goethe and Emerson were
heavily affected by his work, which basically has to do with "light," more than
rhyme structure of couplets.

That's an interesting way of putting it, David. We've published Fulcrum
2 off our Mastercard. Just back from vacation to discover amid piling
bills that our checks have been bouncing while we were away. I am
currently jobless, my wife works for $9 per hour, and our four year old
doesn't get paid for going to daycare. Some resources.

And then protracted silence on the part of our readers. Is anyone
reading us out there, or are all those copies just sinking without trace
into the literary quicksand? What do y'all think?

My first geezer.com poem is now available for $5.75
Gayle,
    Thanks for the call.  Here is the text of the poem I want to sell:


You said your first "nope"



Today to me when your
Mother asked if you wanted
To talk to me on the phone
And I was disappointed
As I wanted to talk to you

And Kobe Bryant cried on national TV
Only to have his tears which did seem real
Snatched out of his mouth by the media
As they descended to add in some sensation for us to consume.

At the same time your "nope"
Quickened my heart as I knew you
Were starting to come into your own
Wonderful you, wonder what you could be?

It will be a limited edition. Numbered, signed, handwritten with the marker
my granddaughter, Alexis, used to mark up one of my walls.

Here's what I think of Fulcrum:

I have been an admirer of Philip's writing since I first googled him in 1999
or 2000 and came across a poem called "Bohemian Blues."  Innovative yet
appreciative of the fundamentals of poetry, with a sense of history in his
diction yet able to choose words that are very today.  And drama too.  And a
sort of selflessness in it.  One poem revealed a poet who can "do it all,"
who is no one-trick pony.

Philip's work is perhaps the epitome of creative synthesis.  Philip's got so
many influences on-board, from his linguistic/polyglottal abilities to his
knowledge of history and philosophy.  And so on, a man of letters in the old
sense, but one who rushes towards the vanguard in the new sense.  Sorry
Philip, I'm fawning and you're perhaps a bit embarrassed.

I found that sort of superhuman spread of knowledge, sensibility,
ridiculousness, and adventure in his _Dusk Ragas_.  And I've just acquired
his new _Monkey Time_ which is a recent Verse Press Prize winner.  I haven't
yet read it (got it yesterday) but I expect a great deal from it....

But Fulcrum, yes, Fulcrum...

Fulcrum issue 1 was a stupendous debut for a journal.  Loaded with great
essays and some phenomenal poems.

But the current issue goes beyond stupendous.  The issue explores the
intersection between philosophy and poetry.  Starts off with a blazing essay
on poetic anarchism from the editors (Katia Kapovich and Philip).

It's a yearly, and there's some engaging material in there to keep you busy
until the next issue.  As I leave for vacation it will travel with me along
with Philip's new book (oh and _Wolf Tongue_, the new collected works of
Barry MacSweeney from bloodaxe...had to order it from amazon.co.uk since it
is apparently not distributed to the USA).  An interview with Billy Collins
shares space in an issue with an interview of Bernstein by Perloff.  There
are very charged cross-currents all over the issue.

And Philip takes risks, all of them good ones I think.  The work of some
relatively unknown but very talented poetry from listmates Dave Bircumshaw,
David Baratier (I hope David knows I am a fan of his Estrella's Prophecies
series), and Francis Raven appears.  Good going!  And "Bad Food Day" from
Steve Shoemaker is a fucked-up and disturbing hoot of a poem.  And the poems
from WN Herbert are astoundingly lush.  I've only flipped through it and
read a few pages here, a few pages there, and already I can say that this
issue blows away issue 1.  I'd say it blows away just about any print poetry
pub out there.  I think it merits comparisons to John Tranter's Jacket and
outdoes Jacket in some significant ways (fortunately it isn't a competition
and there's room for both pubs).  Fulcrum is no mere experiment but instead
the polished delivery of a swirl of so many influences.  Philip and Katia I
think try to "cover it all" and their editorial ambition pays off.  (And
that payoff best not be mastercard debt.)

Michael Palmer has an essay which starts with nothing and ends with Pessoa's
"Autopsychography" and leads me feeling justified in my own efforts and the
efforts of a few others to explore the "fakeness" of the surfaces of poetry
and the myths surrounding poets and their voices.

BUY IT FOLKS!  Believe you me, if you have to buy this issue out of some
sense of charity, it is an act of charity that benefits *you*.

That's an interesting way of putting it, David. We've published Fulcrum
2 off our Mastercard. Just back from vacation to discover amid piling
bills that our checks have been bouncing while we were away. I am
currently jobless, my wife works for $9 per hour, and our four year old
doesn't get paid for going to daycare. Some resources.

And then protracted silence on the part of our readers. Is anyone
reading us out there, or are all those copies just sinking without trace
into the literary quicksand? What do y'all think?

Dear Philip

I do apologise, I assumed a publication on that scale had some kind of
institutional support. Your achievement in producing is all the more
remarkable in such circumstances, I am agog with admiration (and currently
jobless meself, so I know how that feels and is)

Deep Regards

I and two friends are looking everywhere for any information on The =
People's Victory Orchestra... including discogography, line-ups, etc.=20

We've loved their records for years (I found my first one over 20 years =
ago), but during all that time we've never run across anyone who really =
knew anything definitive about them.=20

We've heard that they were musicians who were under contract and used =
the P.V.O.C. guise to record their own stuff on the sly. We're not sure =
we believe this, though: we suspect this is just a rumor based on =
somebody's guess as to why they were so studiously anonymous. The other =
rumor we've heard, which we find marginally more credible, is that they =
were high school (and or grammar school) music teachers  -- which could =
partially account for the large number of musicians that pop up on their =
records (after all, there's virtually an orchestra on the third): some =
of the musicians could be their students. (Of course, rumor #2 could =
simply be based on the fact that one of their records is called "The =
School.")

We've always assumed that the address on the labels was their own =
address, and hence that they were from New York....

Any direction, assistance would be most appreciated.

Thank you.

listen the ghazal doesn't care about your deadlines,
mortal.

the ghazal is beyond time and space.

the ghazal is what "is before you and what is behind
you"

of all the things that exist in the three worlds, that
is the ghazal.

and those things that do not exist in the three
worlds, that too is the ghazal.

the ghazal is not the sonnet that you can just follow
a particular rhyme pattern to get.

Garcia's interpretation of ghazal rules seem
needlessly complicated and I think not necessary.

Murat is right first, and Kirby is also right: the
ghazal's real "form" is the mental form. Is about
drunkenness and ecstasy.

Ecstasy means: out of sense.

Thanks Gloria. In addition to the famous phrase from the radical writer
Randolph Bourne who said war is the health of the state etc, I slightly
altered some of Dwight D. Eisenhower's January 17th, 1961 farewell speech
to the US nation for the below screed, as well as a favored aphorism from
Thomas Jefferson -- and I did so because I feel, as do many, that political
language,especially that language concerning national defense and debates
regarding power and social influence, conforms with some ease and almost
perfectly, frankly, with language sufficient for the discussing of
anthologies (for reasons many have written about thoroughly already, the
ideology of nationalism/nation/native and the generation etc etc).

Let's Blame Canada
By MAUREEN DOWD

They were wrong, of course. Soldiers should not go public in the
middle of a conflict and trash-talk their superiors or ask for the
resignation of the secretary of defense.

But it was inevitable that their gripes would bubble to the surface.
Many American troops in Iraq are exhausted, and perplexed about the
scary new guerrilla war they're caught up in. And they have every
right to be scared, because the coolly efficient Bush commanders have
now been exposed as short-term tacticians who had no strategy for
dealing with a war of liberation that morphed into a war of attrition.

The Third Infantry Division, which spearheaded the drive to Baghdad
and has been away from home the longest, has had its departure date
yanked away twice. Last week, some soldiers from the Third in Falluja
- a treacherous place where many Americans have been killed by
guerrillas, including one on Friday - griped to the ABC News
correspondent Jeffrey Kofman. One soldier said, "If Donald Rumsfeld
was here, I'd ask him for his resignation."

The complaints infuriated some in the Bush administration, and the
new Tommy Franks, Gen. John Abizaid, suggested that field commanders
might mete out "a verbal reprimand or something more stringent."

Somebody at the White House decided not to wait. Matt Drudge, the
conservative cybercolumnist, told Lloyd Grove, the Washington Post
gossip columnist, that "someone from the White House communications
shop" told him about the ABC story and also about a profile of the
Canadian-born Mr. Kofman in The Advocate, a gay publication. Mr.
Drudge quickly linked the two stories on his popular Web site, first
headlining the Advocate piece, "ABC NEWS REPORTER WHO FILED TROOP
COMPLAINTS STORY - OPENLY GAY CANADIAN." Eight minutes later, he
amended the headline to read, "ABC NEWS REPORTER WHO FILED TROOP
COMPLAINTS STORY IS CANADIAN," leaving readers to discover in the
body of the story what the Bush provocateur apparently felt was Mr.
Kofman's other vice.

Now that the right wing's bête noire, Peter Jennings, has gotten his
American citizenship, conservatives may have needed another ABC
Canadian to kick around. And the Christian right is still smarting
over the Supreme Court's telling police they could no longer storm
gay bedrooms in search of sodomy.

Scott McClellan, the new Bush press secretary, said that if Mr.
Drudge's contention about his source was true, it would be "totally
inappropriate." He added, "If anyone on my staff did it, they would
no longer be working for me." He said he had no way to trace an
anonymous source.

But Bush loyalists regularly plant information they want known in the
Drudge Report. Whoever dredged up the Advocate story was appealing to
the baser nature of President Bush's base, seeking to discredit the
ABC report by smearing the reporter for what he or she considers sins
of private life (not straight) and passport (not American). Let's
hope the fans of Ann (Have you no sense of decency?) Coulter aren't
taking her revisionist view of McCarthyism too seriously and making
character assassination fashionable again on the Potomac.

What we are witnessing is how ugly it can get when control freaks
start losing control. Beset by problems, the Bush team responds by
attacking those who point out the problems. These linear, Manichaean
managers are flailing in an ever-more-chaotic environment. They are
spending $3.9 billion a month trying to keep the lid on a festering
mess in Iraq, even as Afghanistan simmers.

The more Bush officials try to explain how the president made the
bogus uranium claim in his State of the Union address, despite the
C.I.A. red flags and the State Department warning that it was "highly
dubious," the more inexplicable it seems. The list of evils the
administration has not unearthed keeps getting longer - Osama,
Saddam, W.M.D., the anthrax terrorist - as the deficit gets bigger
($455 billion, going to $475 billion).

After 9/11, this administration had everything going for it.
Republicans ruled Congress. The president had enormously high
approval ratings. Yet it overreached while trying to justify the
reasons for going to war.

Even when conservatives have all the marbles, they still act as if
they're under siege. Now that they are under siege, it is no time for
them to act as if they're losing their marbles.

actually, was there ever a selected writings from _Mother Earth_
anthology?

i.e., Goldman published a journal which contained poems, and it seems to
me it was a very "who's in, who's out" affair, much more so than
Margaret Sanger's press & journal(s), say

Be well,

LLAW Press Release

LLAW 9  by TNWK (cris cheek and Kirsten Lavers)  July =AD Sept. 2003

LLAW is a two year project curated by Brigid Mc Leer and specially
commissioned by Tanya Peixoto, for the outside wall of bookartbookshop in
Hoxton,17 Pitfield Street, London N1.

The project consists of invitations to a number of  writers and artists to
write or devise a text specifically for the exterior wall of the shop and i=
n
that text to address in some way, their own relationship to language,
writing and this new context of public address or display.

Over a two year period, from February 2002 to February 2004, 12 texts are
being presented on bookartbookshop wall - one every two months. Each text i=
s
oriented to the proportions of an A4 sheet (portrait) and is then enlarged
to double A0 size through a simple photocopying process. These sheets are
then pasted onto the wall and as such they are open to degradation,
interference and destruction - but they are also renewable. So the play of
the wall and the (l)law is also invited. The law that might instruct that
they be taken down, the law of the street, that might reclaim that space
again as a graffiti artist=B9s tagging site and the internal law of the work
that decrees that these texts are there and that they will be protected or
replaced.

Also, the =8Cllaw=B9 - inversely in the =8Cwall=B9 - is the law of language; its
structure and authorities, its traditions, histories and pretensions.  The
title also raises the question of whether language is in fact a wall - a
barrier, a boundary, a protection - a physical structure to be broken down.
The first text was launched in Feb 2002 to coincide with the official
opening of  bookartbookshop and was by Jane Rendell, an architectural write=
r
and theorist based in London. Subsequent texts have been written by Gillian
Wylde, Jennifer Winters, Debbie Booth, Caroline Bergvall and Sharon Kivland=
.
March 2003 saw the beginning of the second year of LLAW with texts by Redel=
l
Olsen and AS Bessa. Forthcoming texts later this year will be by Wes White
and Peggy Phelan.

In March this year, to celebrate this project and bring it to wider
attention, Brigid Mc Leer and bookartbookshop organised an exhibition of al=
l
the LLAW texts thus far in The Foundry (a bar and exhibition space) along
with an evening of readings, performances and showings by many of the
participants of LLAW. We also produced a limited number of A1 posters of th=
e
texts produced, available for =A36 from bookartbookshop.

If you would like further information on LLAW or any of the artists or
writers who are contributing, please contact Brigid Mc Leer at
mcleer.bridge@virgin.net or call bookartbookshop on 020 7608 1333

Dear Kazim and Murat and others in the ghazal thread,

Yes, I think this is all about love, but doesn't love have to take place
in time and space?  If we shrink the time limit then this brings the
love up to a point.  I insist therefore on the deadline, and feel that
anyone who brings up ghazals after the deadline is a taboo-breaking
kamikaze pilot against love and beauty.

I want to talk about beauty again, and not just assert that it exists,
but recover the enormous dialogue concerning it since Thomas Aquinas at
least!  Beauty as theophany.  I'm quoting from the Harvard philosopher
Elaine Scarry:

"When I say that beauty has been banished, I do not mean that beautiful
things have themselves been banished, for the humanities are made up of
beautiful poems, stories, paintings, sketches, sculpture, film, essays,
debates, and it is this that every day draws us to them.  I mean
something much more modest: that conversation about the beauty of these
things has been banished, so that we coinhabit the space of these
objects (even putting them inside us, learning them by heart, carrying
one wedged at all times between the upper arm and the breast, placing as
many as possible into our bookbags) yet speak about their beauty only in
whispers" (p. 57, On Beauty and Being Just -- Princeton, 1999).

There is an interview with Elaine Scarry at

http://www.salon.com/books/feature/1999/11/09/scarry/

Sorry if I screwed up the link.  I generally do.  I liked her book,
although it is not as good as Kant by any stretch it is an attempt to
bring back the discussion of beauty.  Another great book is the U. of
Minnesota philosopher Marcia Eaton's Aesthetics and the Good Life,
Fairleigh Dickinson 1990.  Both defend beauty as the beginning of taking
an interest in the real world, and they both claim that aesthetics is
the mother of ethics.  Eaton, of the two, is far and away the better
philosopher of beauty.

There has been a lot of talking about the justice and politics of the
war of late on this poetry board, but almost never do we talk about
aesthetics.  A poem is not good because it is just.  I thought decades
back that women would avant-garde the discussion of beauty, but they
turned to ethics.  Historically women have been among the best to talk
about beauty -- as far back as Sei Shonagon -- the things she says are
still spot on a thousand years later.

I am not sure why it is that many feminists have turned so strenuously
against beauty.  I have the feeling that some feminists like Andrea
Dworkin don't even like flowers!

The ghazal form is all about beauty, and shouldn't be a matter of strict
rules.  It has to bloom and freak in its own way.  There are no rules
that can make something beautiful.  Beauty is a kind of aberration,
something utterly new in the world, unprecedented.

============

quick ghazal on the manx pub


she steps a pint across

the hockey game again,
game six.

named for the island, cat

her kathleen edwards t-shirt

===========

quick ghazal on bank & gloucester streets


the immediate world exists
at right angles

the intersection where the bank,
office towers, tim hortons

in the throes of service -- public
& private -- plastic picture tags

on strings

the rain puddles out
to biblical proportions

what cabs tear by

- 2 suggestions

1) an interview with Canadian poet Douglas Barbour about, among
other things, the ghazal & his influences, such as Phyllis Webb
& John Thompson, can be found at:
        http://www.jacketmagazine.com/18/c-barbour-iv.html
2) a note written by Canadian poet Andy Weaver on the ghazal
can be found at: http://www.poetics.ca/weaver1.html

by myself at: http://www.poetics.ca/weaver.html

The suggestion to explore Hafiz's ghazals is excellent.  This URL
contains eight translators' rendering of Hafiz's first ghazal.  The range
of tone, form, and meaning is fascinating, given that these are
translations.

Thanks to Kirby for starting this thread.  I will, of course, abide by
the deadline to cease discussing this topic.

In some ways I feel a bit odd making this post because the approach of the
book I'm suggesting may be at odds with the poetics often found on this list.
But for those who might be interested in a spiritual approach to writing, one
of my teachers, the poet Peter Levitt, has a new book out:  FINGERPAINTING ON
THE MOON: WRITING AND CREATIVITY AS A PATH TO FREEDOM.  He links writing with
creativity as one of the most basic of human impulses and activities.  A
practicing Buddhist, Peter explores many religious, mystical and spiritual sources
as inspiration and guide for creativity.  He also offers practical techniques
for connecting to that part of any of us where creative inspiration may be
found.  For those who have found use in books by Natalie Goldberg and Dorothea
Brande, you'll get a lot from Peter's book, too.

Find it at:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609610481/welcometoholl-20  or local bookstores.

Having reread Agha Shahid Ali's piece in An Exaltation of Forms, I offer the following:



GHAZAL AT FIRST SIGHT





Whenever the couple thought to commence

they wondered whether they ought to commence.



Consider them angels and, as such,

on heaven's template wrought to commence.



Wingless, they hesitate:

whence, after all, were they brought to commence?



Dimming their gleam, they contemplate:

under what master taught to commence?



Breath catching breath, gaze catching gaze,

frozen in silence they fought to commence.



How could their longing have grown so adept,

innocent of what they sought to commence?



Shining in darkness, they ponder the trust

Daniel mustered with naught to commence.

   The Head of God


   P12:5, 0:9.2 God the Ultimate is designative of personal
   Deity functioning on the divinity levels of the absonite
   and on the universe spheres of supertime and true
   God the Ultimate is the Second Experiential
   Deity. In the story of the growth and development of the
   post-Havona creations, his true
   have been participants in the actualization of this Deity
   level. Transcendence of the finite can lead only to
   ultimate attainment. God the Ultimate exists
   Each of them hold a part of the Ultimate
   Deity. Now everywhere. There is nothing that
   does not have a little of a God or a Goddess in it.
   God the Ultimate is the second experiential
   Deity. What the Supreme is to finite growth, the
   Ultimate is to absonite growth. What true
   God the Ultimate is the Second Experiential
   Deity. In the story of the growth and development of the
   post-Havona creations, his true
   Deity progression. The experiential Deities; God the
   Supreme. Summary of evolution of
   Supreme. God the Ultimate
   of that supreme God. Most urban Hindus follow one of
   two major divisions within Hinduism: Vaishnavaism: which generally
   regards Vishnu as the ultimate deity; true
   measure anything, I don't think the deity or spirit
   a divinity split into Ultimate Good
   and Ultimate Evil (akin to the Christian view of
   God and Satan true) -
   best demonstrated by the Greco-Roman deity structure.
   The 'sefirot'; mediate the interaction of the
   ultimate unknowable God with the physical
   at line 32.

last week about U.S. troops' morale problems in Iraq by alerting a

this confirms my suspicion that poets born between, say, 1960 and 1966
are lost on the generational radar -- i was born in '64 and can safely
say that i am either some kind of late-blooming boomer or an early
avant-x-er (according to the census-takers, that is; at heart, i'm
decidedly more Talking Heads than Dead Head) -- a Time magazine article
i read back in the early 90's referred to us as "tweeners" -- hardly
fitting for an anthology cover, but those of you (if any) born in that
time span, please backchannel for commiseration -- maybe we can find a
press...somewhere...

Perhaps the Yale Younger Poets Anthologies would be a help in finding poets
born between these years.

I am sorry if yesterday my reply was slightly
incoherent--it was actually swallowed twice and then I
couldn't post more as I exceeded the "limit".

See I am feeling a little raw with awful news of
Reetika
Vazirani's death.

I feel glad and gratitude that folks want to learn
about the ghazal and work in this demanding form
(which is truly the form of mind) a poetic meditation.

But sort of unsettled (accentuated by RV's
death which of course lances old grief at Shahid's
death) that writers might just "copy down the rules"
and it will be the "new thing" for everyone to
"try out"

What would be unfortunate the most to me on the day of
her death would be for people to feel like oh after
the deadline no more ghazal for me, or for this thread
to just wick and wick and fray away.

I don't want the ghazal to be so apprehendible by a
set of rules Shahid (or Richard Garcia) or anyone just
sort hashes out together and then works with (or
against for that matter).

The question of "whether" or "how" the ghazal
"coheres" or doesn't cohere is fundamental to the
mindset not just of the literature but of the entire
culture. I don't want us to work it out or not work it
out by "July 24" or really "ever". The tone of
discussion started out a little "ghazal is this
strange beast from the Arab world" and went into "this
what the ghazal is: this this and this" and I think
I'm reacting against that.

There should be no deadline. There should be no
winner.

Write and write it and see what it does to your brain.
Read Shahid Ali but don't let him be the last word. He
was a particular writer coming from an (admittedly
very ecumenical) aesthetic view, but he's not the
final word on the "ghazal in English." Be respectful
of the cultural space this form developed in, but
explore its purposes and possibilities.

Read also any writer of the Arab world. Ghazal
sensibility (if not form) seeps all through Darwish's
new book, Saadi Youssef, Venus Khoury-Ghata (who does
not write in Arabic), Fatia Faqir, El Sadaawi.

Bhanu Kapil Rider's intense and life-affirming book
"The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers" has the
oddest strain of ghazal-sensibility to me. And this
book is prose. Ostensibly.

Be a heretic.

Ali's book "Nostalgist's Map of America"
called by him "free verse" has deep ghazal
sensibility.

But only writing the rules down from someone and
writing a little ghazal because this month that's what
we going to do would be like reading June Jordan's
essay on Black English and everyone trying to write a
"Black Arts Movement" poem.

I hope everyone takes this post in the generous
generous spirit it is intended.

Anyone who takes up digital writing is by default at least creatively young.
So much to learn that one forgets one's age! I'm usually surprised when I
learn someone's age, because voices speaking electronically sound younger
than the writer's age usually turns out to be. Age, then, is measured by the
depth of one's work; maturity, that is. While its inventiveness adds the
bloom of youth.

AS IN EVERY DEAFNESS

Graham Foust's first collection sounds the depths of need and loss=20
through narcotics and the bleak interiors of winter. Although suspended=20
in indefinite, sometimes desperate states of desire, these spare poems=20
move toward an honest recognition of the damage incurred: "Welcome,=20
autumn, / to my room / of empty things. // Welcome to a room / like you."=20

"Though As in Every Deafness recalls the wintry meditative intensity of=20
William Bronk, it's a new millennium: 'Our economy proceeds / as if life=20
were an unlearning.' Graham Foust has an unerring sense of the exact contour=
s=20
of a particular thought and is able to express them with mathematical=20
precision and emotional delicacy; yet pushing against lyric constraint is=20
wildness, uneasiness, sometimes terror."  -- Susan Howe

Thanks for that one, Joel. I don't qualify for Yale Younger Poets, or Poets
Born After 1966, but I feel that I'm hitting my stride and have some years
left in which I can still explore and improve. The only problem I have with
younger writers receiving their due is that I wasn't one of them. But being
one of them might have locked me into creating working much narrower in
scope than I'm doing. And the corporation-dominated book industry has
"virtually" forced a younger (in spirit), more adventurous literary culture
to publish its work online. So, at least I'm affiliated with the young in
spirit. And it rubs off.

>BACKGROUND:  Under the USA PATRIOT Act, passed in fear during the weeks
>immediately following the terrorist attacks of September 11, the FBI can
>initiate secret surveillance of a library or bookstore's public computers
>and can demand library circulation records and bookstore business
>records.  In order to get a warrant for this surveillance, the FBI applies
>to the secret Foreign Intelligence Security Act (FISA) court.  To obtain a
>FISA warrant, the FBI does not have to show probable cause of criminal
>activity or show that the targeted individual is connected to a foreign
>power.  It is much easier to get a FISA warrant than a wiretap warrant
>under criminal law.  The FBI just has to certify to the FISA court that an
>individual linked to "terrorism" or a "terrorist organization," terms with
>very flexible definitions.  Initial surveillance of a library or
>bookstore's public Internet usage and circulation or business records can
>be triggered by a target individual's library use.  However, after the
>initial intercept, the warrant attaches to the library or bookstore's
>computer and location in addition to remaining with the targeted
>individual.  Then the FBI can monitor use of that facility by not only the
>targeted individual, but by anyone using the computer - terrorist or
>innocent citizen.  Under the USA PATRIOT Act, the librarian or bookstore
>owner served with a FISA warrant is subject to criminal prosecution if
>they refuse to obey the FISA warrant or share the existence of the secret
>warrant with anyone other than the library or bookstore employee who will
>actually respond to that warrant.
>
>Section 215 allows the FBI to perform secret surveillance of a library's
>public computers, to demand library circulation records, and to review
>bookstore records and public computer use - all without notice to library
>patrons or bookstore customers.  Even the records and usage of law-abiding
>patrons and customers can be secretly reviewed.  And, the FBI can get
>permission for secret library or bookstore surveillance under section 215
>of the USA PATRIOT Act without evidence of probable cause of criminal
>activity.
>
>The Fourth Amendment guarantees protections from unreasonable searches and
>seizures.  The Sanders-Otter-Conyers Amendment will prevent the government
>from engaging in unconstitutional searches of library and bookstore
>records.  The FBI has been aggressively using its new powers without
>providing Congress with explanations about its activities.  A University
>of Illinois survey shows libraries were targeted at least 175 times in the
>year after 9/11 -- yet the FBI refuses to offer any explanation of these
>investigations.
>
>Under the Sanders-Otter-Conyers Amendment, the FBI can still keep tabs on
>dangerous individuals at libraries and bookstores, using the legal
>procedures used before the USA PATRIOT Act was enacted.

A new brand of eco-graffiti appears in the City. Wide diameter pink and
powder-blue chalk on the wide concrete double stair-steps up into Dolores
Park, there in front of the big bronze bell at the east, 19th Street formal
entry. In nice big cursive second grade style letters:

(2nd Step/ Pink) EMBRACE THE ECSTATIC    (Love in a heart shape) YOUR MOTHER


The wiccans are busy  - bless their hearts!


Just a Foreign Policy Thought, in the absence of WMD and the other thought
to be rational reasons for pre-emptive assassinations and "Occupation
optimism", I am thinking, the Admins might just revert to calling the Iraq
affair a "Faith Based Initiative" - though, in that case, I suspect many
denominations will strenuously object.
As to assassinations, and the Rumsfeld & companies near delirium "kill" the
enemy mantra (mirrored by Sharon & Co. in Palestine), I fear when this
gangster policy and strategy of murder comes back to haunt our own shores.
Like whatever happened to the mantra of "Bring X to Justice", and the
worldly - and the considered civilizing benefit of trials, most notoriously,
for example  of hearing out Nazi crimes at the Nuremberg trials. Is this
process only reserved for Europeans and not considered applicable to, for
example, Arab "infidels."

"Infidels" versus "Faith Based Gangsters."

Kazim,

I share the same sentiments. Americans get carried away with technique and
re-inventing the wheel. As if a form could be reduced to a technique that
then can be key-punched and quickly manufactured. Like Idries Shah's paradox
of the cardboard of a cereal box that has more nutritional value than the
contents of it. Form is but an extension of content is not really true.
There must be substance, nutrient value for the mind (I like what you wrote
"the ghazal and work in this demanding form (which is truly the form of
mind)"-- not in the packaging or formula (or writing the ghazal for the sake
of saying that I wrote a ghazal).

You may think that Pound did not teach us anything,-- what with the persona
and all that (you said that whether a ghazal coheres is not merely a matter
of formula, but of an entire culture, as Pound got drunk on the troubadors
(who were drunk on the ghazal spirit in Spain)).

So, again, please excuse the ingenuousness, for that is what it is. A bit
too enthusiastic, like a child's, but no patronization intended.

I think you mean that ghazal is like Lorca's duende, right? Perhaps, more
than duende.

In writing about Arabic poetry Omar Pound has this to say:

At first a pious poetry developed, written in praise of Allah, the prophet,
his mantle, and the achievements and blessings of Islam. This religious
fervor shows itself particularly in the mixing of the sacred and profane in
a single poem, as in Donne. In Western poetry the religious and secular tend
to be kept apart, but to the orthodox Muslim no dichotomy appears to exist
since every aspect of life is part of God's will and therefore sacred.

I hope in quoting Pound's son I am not being patronizing to presume that
Pound's son, a Westerner, could explain this, but I have no one else to
quote and I think Pound's latter point, the separation of the sacred and the
secular, is more important to the discussion of the ghazal and the
foreigness of the ghazal to the secular mentality that we have here in the
U.S. (It just occured to me, what about Juan de la Cruz? Maybe Pound was
just making a point to an English readership when he referred to Donne.)

Funny that Pound's son became a Persian and Arabic scholar. Is there some
poetic justice there? Pound's anti-Semitism and then, Pound's son's
embracing of a Semitic literature.

Recalling the muezzin's call-to-prayer calls me back, I'm planning to return
to that part of the world.

There is nothing more beautiful then to hear the call-to-prayer at dusk,
that initial time I heard it in passing a mosque in Riyadh.

There is more I want to say, but I must review my Arabic script.

Matt

Hey Kazim,

How about one that wasn't written to be cool? And is trying desperately to fit
the form, in order to contain emotion? If it sucks, that's because I'm kind of
bent out of shape at the moment. The events alluded to are probably already
notorious after a week.

How and why? how and why? we feral pigeons mourn
Only you know what was torn at the end

A cloth maybe once both of you could have worn
Enchanted scarf, your son made unborn at the end

Pictures, the dark-eyed, nothing words could adorn
A savage dark-gold unicorn at the end

A maddening simoom, a beast with just one horn
A single and perfect rose-thorn at the end

When the storm came my wing could not shelter you, born
mortal as I am, forlorn at the end

1970...what's worse, lying to the nation about having had oral sex =
performed on you in the oval office, or lying to the nation about the =
nefarious antics of a chap who bested your father in a previous war and =
at whom you target your personal and familial anger  =20

Vote here:

Oral sex lies are worse:
Nefarious antics lies are worse:

Just curious, but I thought the matter worth voting on...

I'll count the votes and report with honesty...honest!

Surely you jest...
Nefarious antics in an attempt to up the ante are far worse than oral sex
with a married man...Why do people get so caught up with the relative
issues...<G>  I have a T-shirt from Kramer Books and the Afterwords Cafe
that reads:  Subpoened for Book Selling...I had coffee there once.  It's
hard to not think about oral sex in a book store...

Ter

Poets of the world, I ask you, even those of you born after 1970...what's
worse, lying to the nation about having had oral sex performed on you in the
oval office, or lying to the nation about the nefarious antics of a chap who
bested your father in a previous war and at whom you target your personal
and familial anger

Vote here:

Oral sex lies are worse:
Nefarious antics lies are worse:

Just curious, but I thought the matter worth voting on...

I'll count the votes and report with honesty...honest!

you give me a lot to think about. i didn't know
pound's son became a scholar.

you hit the heart of a lot of my thinking when you
write "you may think Pound didn't teach us anything"
(or something like that?)

i think wrestling with modernism v new postromantic
etc is the heart of my thinking and my poetic practice
(of course by no means am i alone in that--Susan Howe
is clearest major example I can think the same of)

Howdy folks,

Just letting you know that my serial work "My Angie Dickinson" now stands at 90
poems - and that my mystery webmeister has, to my surprise and delight, added
dozens of new photos (almost one to a poem), stranger by the minute.

I'm hoping to head up to San Fran for the weekend of the Oxygen Bar
reading (Aug 3) along with my partner Octavia -- can anyone recommend a
place/area (in the vicinity or not) for relatively cheap lodging? and/or
strategies for finding same?

His discussion - much to my 'established' formal oppositional nature &
practice - I find fascinating. I recently wrote the following piece, and
someone immediately called a ghazal, though that was not a conscious part of
its making. But maybe we sometimes call poems into a particular genre as a
way of making comfort with the process of reading them. Similar to in the
west (usa) - to stretch a story here - when Indians first encountered single
white women living near their communities - say riding by on a horse - they
first would say nothing, not even feign a greeting, until one day an Indian
-  who had been 'abroad' called out "school marm", and then the women gained
an identity, whether or not they were teachers, but were publicly accepted.
But here goes:

When I said I had no rhythm,

 She said she would find it.

When I said I had no heart,

 She said she had it.

When I said I was half way in the grave,

 She said there is no bottom.

When I am compelled to praise her,

 A dark dove is a shadow in the window.

When I ask her the origins of my name,

 She speaks in an ancient Arabic.

When I ask her has there always been a war,

 She says the strongest words are scraped in torment.

When I ask what about desire,

 She speaks in a calligraphy of constant fire.

When I say what is that,

 She does not speak and points her finger:

The marble tablet in the bush,

 Its upturned words are each one burning.

Hi all,

Boog City, the East Village Community newspaper, is an affordable way to reach likeminded New Yorkers who would be interested in your offerings.

We come out monthly, with a print run of 2,000, and are distributed primarily in the East Village and Williamsburg, as well as some select locations in Philadelphia and other parts of Manhattan.

We have very reasonable rates for small presses (got to take care of my own) and can also design your ad.

Backchannel to editor@boogcity.com or boogcityny@aol.com for more information and a rate card.

Thanks,
David

m:

the idea of logging an extended poem series with the use of a blog
strikes me as being a kind of form in itself, in some ways the process
& technology of writing a long poem that way lays down a footprint of
what the poem will become.  making the poem dependent on a very
specific piece of software, a particular way of entering the text, a
very specific audience, etc.  so I wonder if it feels different to be
writing a poem that way.  & wondering if there are other poems that are
happen that way....

& these are known as Blong Poems? ... portmanteau of blog + long...

Summer afternoon in a quiet apartment tarnishes
quickly as the corrosions air will swallow lonely in
an annul in way. Plumes and pulp leopard-print raw
mind there, without thrall. Anenome moans, almost
porous with mis-typed nouns; facile with wraiths these
edges of new talking to her. You earn the nursing.
Running just beneath respiration, arid drawers that
sambo and clatter.

Bitter thunder, a virtue chorus a fungus, garages with
dips to accept or the corollary: capital pacifies,
oceanic: blood like a lizard, dervish or delicacy.
Your anemia shouldn't frown, because a mouth is so
much less without her. Earthful.

We like the troubling drums.

If I could tremble, ledged somehere fine beneath her,
in thirds would be enough? Here? Somewhat turns all
the colors down on rainy days. Able to, like
lengthwise upturned, as if not knowing any judgement
definitely a reqium somewhat. Desensitized to orgasm,
as if a saggiterraneous.

The motherfuckers in charge, it's kill or be killed.
Yellow hose sore. It's wholly erotic, off-centre but
necking, hardcore; SummerQuiet on a within of gross
remark. You think I'm just fucking with you? Pins with
cloud eyes won't know a hurting night of hungry
nothing: no: just reflecting.

Loose, but scuffling: judicious dross.

Some words just don't belong together. You've never
looked at a wall peeling with paint, you said; you've
never desperate traded. Keep me in the loop.

WinterMute always had to repeat himself when he
explained it to them. Across the backyard, in the
narrow swatch of grass that seperated the two, one man
had coated his window with tinfoil. Leslie
hypothesized he was growing weed. And yet every window
you tried in the place was dark; WinterMute could feel
them buzzing to get in.

"I must have watched that yellow hose for hours. To a
beat," WinterMute was telling them, all the light in
the empty room weighing his smile. She wouldn't
understand him, quagmired as she was in him. Sometimes
she would flail, held so close there, and sometimes
she would even fly. "I remember," he was trying so
hard to smile. "You were there, and you, and you."

"Goodnight," she said. She'd never been that good at
decisions. "Don't stay up too late." In the dark you
messed up, all the time. WinterMute thought about the
war. Who were these people, he wondered. Why?

EXHIBITION NEWS

Not by the Book

Love and/or Terror Exhibition at UA Museum of Art

Triggered by current events, the University of Arizona
Museum of Art invited fifty artists to respond to the subjects of love
and/or terror in the form of a book. These amazing artists=92 book will be=
 on
view at the UA Museum of Art from August 3 =AD September 21, 2003.

Artists often assume the role of challenging commercial and conventional
forms of expression. The artists in the Love and/or Terror exhibition
experiment with our notions of what a book is. These books are made with
unexpected materials from handmade papers to feathers and fish scales. They
are not standard storybooks sandwiched between covers. There are flipbooks,
round books, books that stretch accordion-like for many feet and books that
are paperless. There are books without words, and books with one word. There
are books that do not open and books that do not end.

How these books are made and the stories they tell overlap. There are
intricately folded books about love and loss, digitized books about memory
and distance, hand-knitted books about the weather in Minnesota,
photographic books about biblical text,and flip books about kisses and
winks.

Visit the UA Museum of Art and spend some time with these artists=92 books
that are definitely not by the book!

well

i guess what i mean by "postromantic" (i really just
made that phrase up, i think

is those writers who seem unconstrained by
conservative strictures of language (what a "line" is,
what a "stanza" is, what a "form" is, what a "page"
is, what a "poem" is, etc etc) but are still haunted
by an attachment to "identity" that seems unaware or
unproblematized by (or perhaps *sufficiently
unproblematized by*) any theoretical developments in
language after 1913 (dated to lovely "Black Square" by
Malevich (also haunted I think by the same questions)

does that make any sense? i really don't mean to be
speaking in tongues. really do want to be making
sense. that's part of it too

Kazim,

I think Pound is crucial, at least for me anyways. He is my guide in all
matters of poetry.

I have the same struggle, I think, with, shall we call it, not "new
postRomanticism" (but I think I understand what you are saying), but another
wave of Romanticism (since what date?) with respect to the "new" Classicism
(dare I say language poetry is a new Classicism?), given that Romanticism
seems to alternate with Classicism, right?

I mean, given my understanding of what Kenner says in The Counterfeiters (a
valuable little book of criticism, I believe), Romanticism manifested itself
initially (and I'm excluding from this category of Romanticism that period
further back, of chansons de gestes or the Song of Roland, whatever you want
to call it, or as Graves defines Romanticism in The White Goddess) as a
reaction to the industrial age, the Augustan age, during which you have
Swift dealing with the empiricism and all that.

(Language poetry is not Romantic (unless you take its resemblance to
surrealism as making it Romantic) because it embraces the computer and all
that the computer implies for language.)

Perhaps, you mean that the new Romanticism is reacting to language poetry,
whatever that means. I should know what it means, because I took courses in
linguistics in grad. school, but I'm not sure why language poets are doing
what they are doing except as a way of manipulating language (sentence
structure, syntax, even morphology (like Joyce does in Finnegans))in a very
sophisticated way, perhaps (given that there are always poseurs who are the
"followers of crazes", as Pound referred to the phenomenon).

(Is language poetry experimentation for the sake of experimentation, tout
court?)

I say I'm not sure why, but I think I know how they are doing what they are
doing. My lead on this was Spicer, and then I read Silliman's essay on
Spicer, who obviously he claims as a precursor of language poetry, though he
is not the sole. (There is Ashbery, who embodies clearly the Latin dictum,
ut poesis ut pictura, and got his inspiration from the French, especially
Raymond Roussel and his Impressions d'Afrique.

And, I'm not sure that language poetry is all that different from surrealism
which I think is suspect, especially after reading Spicer's line that
surrealism is the business of poets who cannot benefit from it. In other
words, it's a dead end (or a means to something else), as far as I'm
concerned, though I think there is no doubt Charles Henri Ford has written
some beautiful poetry, to mention just one American surrealist.

In other words, just as surrealism had an agenda, language poetry has an
agenda, but I get lost in all the theorizing, which I enjoy just as much as
I enjoy reading about modern art (Duchamp especially).

In short, I think you mean that the new post Romanticism is not concerned
with form and stanzas and technique so much because it is in reaction to all
the concern of not following a form that language poetry touts as not being
concerned with, but which it paradoxicly is highly concerned with, because
when all is said and done, all that the content is, in language poetry, is
the form of formlessness. In other words, the dictum form is but an
extension of content has become no poetic content or substance at all (no
duende or ghazal spirit), which leaves one with all form as in a painting or
picture.

I hope that makes sense.

But, I'm rambling. My original intention was to write about Pound in this
message to you.

Matt

as long as i continue writing, i am still alive. every word i write is
proof of my existence. i have not contracted with anyone else to write me.
to write me would be to write my existence. to write to me would be to
await a portent. portents stop before existence stops. the imminent before
death is that of the sign. the sign wavers, exhausts itself, and is gone.
these are signs i am writing, these are signs.

i'm not 100% that is the exact quote; but it is the
final line of the section that takes place in the
houghton library, located near the middle of the book,
called--i think--"overlook"

3.

Within anomie, notice
in a way of seeing

cat slinks from the back
of the sofa crying. She says

hear me hear me, into placements
of water.

With the fucking
war in the back of
his throat, cooling all
movement, your amigo

gone, and yet still at
every edge
of every finger I

feel her.

That summer the crisis
greens the leaves. Anenome

in the dark, amid the barks
of howls. The summer's
quietude rubbing her hair.

Nothing should follow the unforgettably affecting poem of grief for his
beloved Reetika's loss - although I never knew of her, that ghazal's emotion stays
with me.

Nonetheless, on this "deadline" day I offer a very different try--may wry
humor belong in the esthetic?

GHAZAL ON A DAY OF MEDICAL FAST

Fasting empties the brain as well as the stomach.
Hunger for eclipsed names impels as the stomach.

Gold hoops of navel rings bobble along 5th Avenue,
hip-slung jeans chiming la belle as the stomach.

The waist of my prom gown refuses the zipper.
What organ expands as many cells as the stomach?

Two frat brothers, portly after decades, connect
via belt buckle--hail/farewells at the stomach.

Once upon a skyscraper summit, Diana poised with bow--
each quivering muscle show-and-tell as the stomach.

Thanks to all on this thread,
Charlotte

Subject:      Blong Poems
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

In reply to mIEKAL's query about Blong (long, blog) poems, my own experience
of writing Copy (findable at www.sonofissue.blogspot.com) is that the major
difference is being able to 'publish' straightaway, which is both a good
thing (your work is 'out there' instantly) and a bad thing (your work is
'out there' instantly). I try to post daily, so the obsessive rewriting that
might accompany any other long work goes by the wayside (I'm not sure myself
whether Copy IS a long poem, or simply a string of shorter ones, or how long
I'm going to keep writing it - I try to regard the ongoingness as part of
the process).

I'm not enough of a technophile to make full use of the blogger format
(unlike, say, the lovely photos on the M.A.D. site - congrats to Michael, by
the way, for turning 92), so I'll leave the issue of whether 'blong'
represents a new form to others better qualified.

As for audience, I have no idea if anyone actually reads Copy, which in
itself is strangely appealing: sending stuff off into the void like messages
in bottles....

All the best,
Rob

Hi all,

As many of you might now, the Allen Lomax archive has recently shut down, causing the poet Aaron Kiely to lose his job as a photo archivist. (Poet-artist Tracey McTague was also let go during the closing.)

Aaron asked me to let everyone know that he is looking for work, ANY work. Long-term is cool, but there is also an urgent need for immediate cash work.

This all being said, yours truly, David Kirschenbaum, is still unemployed and in need of work, so you can apply all the above to me as well.

You can email boogcityny@aol.com or editor@boogcity.com, or call (212) 842-2664. I will forward any missives or messages directed to Aaron to him. (If you have his aaron7k@hotmail.com e-dress he's asked that you not use it for now as he is trying to keep this strictly as a looking for work account.)

Thanks for your help.

as ever,
David

4.


Wipe your feet of me
on the way to your bliss.
Sleeping in London with

yourself leaves me as
mute as winter trees.
Remember to wash your hands

in the dazzle of all you see. I'll

unblot from your skin
in time, in time I'll be

a vanishing trace of your mind.
That's what it's like
losing your shadow:

to walk across a sunlit parkinglot

balancing clouds on your head

on your way to the village
pregnant with water. Nothing
in you whispers about
the earth. None of us sacred.

Robert Smithson was very intrigued by Olmsted and wrote a piece on him and
also a very good one on Central Park as it existed in the Sixties,
contrasting contemporary photos with ones from Olmsted's time.
In one of the Olmsted parks here in Milwaukee, the diaries of Arthur Bremer
(the man who stalked Nixon and then shot George Wallace) were found.  They
formed one of the bases for the film TAXI DRIVER.
An interesting twist on park literature--hidden documents!
Olmsted had a vision of the park as creating a democratic space, where
people of all classes would mingle, and the new immigrant learn more of the
American experience, as well as being accepted into it.
Henry James writes very interestingly of this, from a turn-of-the 19th/20th
century point of view in THE AMERICAN SCENE.
Reading again Hamsun's HUNGER and Strindberg's INFERNO, struck as always
with what a large role parks play in so many modernist works of alienation.
Approrpriately--Colin Wilson lived in Hyde Park while writing THE OUTSIDER.
At various times of homelessness in various cities in USA and abroad--parks
always a place to inhabit, meet people, read and write, eat and sleep--and
endeavor to avoid police--
The Olmsted parks here are very beautiful and know many of their
denizons--people who have set out to live in them--
Good places to write and make rubbings from various sites--and read poetry
aloud to trees and passersby--
or shout sound poems in direction of Lake Michigan--
In the first decades of the 19th Century in many American cities,
cemetieries were thought of and created to be another form of park, as well
as an intermediate zone between the overcrowded cities and the new suburbs.
The cemetery/park (the city cemeteries had grown too full to allow for
further "inhabitants") was thought to be an uplifting place morally and
spiritually--one could meditate on eternity and other "timeless subjects"
for example--and as well take in plenty of fresh healthy air and walk among
flowers, statues, towers and tombs.
An excellent example is Mount Auburn Cemetry, which links Cambridge, MA with
Watertown and has lovely winding paths and roads, a myriad of forms of
scultuprual and architectural styles of gravestones, tombsand vaults, a
tower from which to view the surrounding area atop a hill, and quite a
variety of flora, exotic and local.
Mary Baker Eddy is ensconced there in a vault which contains a telephone.
You can try giving her a call.  I have tried numerous times and never
received an answer.
Who knows--perhaps you may!

There is an Asian American woman who was working at New York Foundation for the arts in NYC (it's a state-wide agency which is now headquartered in NYC), and she said she is leaving her job on August 21.  The position will be open, and they are taking resumes for it right now.

There is information at http://www.nyfa.org

This is a state-run agency that runs various funding schemes for twenty or more different disciplines in the arts.  The young woman Aimee Lee looked no more than about 24.  She was giving advice on how to apply for grants having to do with urbanism and the arts.

Her phone number is 212-366-6900 ext. 216, and her email address is

alee@nyfa.org

Good luck.

To write a ghazal is to invite love and beauty to enter your life.  It's
autotelic -- a reward in itself.  They are like prayers on the wings of
doves.  After midnight tonight I have proposed that everyone cease to
post ghazals, but I have not outlawed commentary on them.  So far we are
getting a lot of ghazals but not much appreciation for them or
commentary.  Commentary is also important!  After midnight let's begin a
discussion of the ghazals we've seen, and perhaps some tentative
discussion of their merits.  Personally, I don't think they make any
sense at all in English.  They are like orchids, yes, but what good is
an orchid?  In the humanities today everything turns on economic
determinism.  What good is an orchid in this climate?  Did anybody read
the ghazals?  I liked them, but some were very abstract, and others just
simply political.  I liked the one by Harriet Zinnes best, but I can't
say why, exactly.  It was the first one sent in.  I was excited by that,
and by the language that was both passionate and precise.  I liked the
political ones, but I am just so tired of politics, as I feel it is just
a pose.   There are those who say let a hundred ghazals bloom!  But I
say, why, if nobody is going to appreciate them, or comment on them?  So
what I say is: Let a hundred Harold Blooms flower as we near the
deadline.

"It is true that some people look upon such woods merely as troublesome
encumbrance standing in the way of profitable use of the land, but future
generations will not feel so and will bless the men who were wise enough to
get such woods preserved. Future generations, however, will be likely to
appreciate the wild beauty and the grandeur of the tall fir trees in this
forest park...it's deep, shady ravines and bold view-commanding spurs, far
more than the majority of citizens of today, many of whom are familiar with
similar original woods. But such primal woods will become as rare about
Portland as they now are about Boston. If these woods are preserved, they
will surely come to be regarded as marvelously beautiful." John Charles
Olmstead and Frederick Law Olmstead, Jr., "Report of the Park Board."
Portland, Oregon, 1903.

In the discussion of Olmsted, have I blown past mention of the National
Zoo? I believe he designed the whole thing, and one of the trails in it is
named for him. Despite what seems almost a Biblical curse on it over the
last year (feed thy zebras wrong, and lo, they shall croak in winter), as
a member, I go oftener than most. Sometimes I admire the audacity of
Olmsted's design in the hilliest bit of Rock Creek Park. Sometimes I
struggle up a tall hill, trying simply to get the hell out of the zoo, and
curse his name.

Does anyone have any information, thoughts, contacts, etcetera for =
people doing poetry/video installations/performance work with video or =
video/word constructions messing with or otherwise altering notions of =
narrative forms and poetry/poetics?

I think there is much of this work at various poetry/film festivals in =

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance. Please b/c responses.

From the Google scholar hard at work amongst us:


While in the park I sing, the listening deer Attend my passion, and forget
to fear. --Waller.=20
(I wonder if Waller sang before he pulled out his archery gear!??)

It's curious in all the dictionary definitions given below, that nothing in
the way of the "sacred" is broached. I suspect in this country, the use of
parks, depending on where or how they are constructed, are frequently
blended with the idea of a "sacred ground" where, for example, an experienc=
e
of "sublimity" is fused with the activity of the eye, the way one walks, a
form of solitude and prayer, or, alternatively other kinds of communion wit=
h
others, or one other, separate from secular play or work. When Bierdstadt
painted in Yosemite, he called it "God's workshop." Even City parks, such a=
s
the Arboretum in San Francisco's Golden Gate, has unique groves and
meditation areas that clearly provide a space to commemorate the memory of
the dead in the flourish of the natural present.)
Also when I think about contemporary professional City sport's stadiums,
their self-contained designs seem bastardizations or a separation from the
traditional City Park, in that they have totally eliminated the natural
component, and may be best called "commercial parks."  Before game
"Tailgate" picnics are forced to take place on the unkind asphalt parking
lot. And capitalism clearly has a captive audience inside the gate. Etc.
Kezar Stadium, which is part of Golden Gate Park, used to be the home of th=
e
SF 49ers until Football became a real business in the sixties.  Fortunately
the stadium has been beautifully rebuilt, the grounds in full view whether
or not you go in and watch a high school game from the bleachers.


\Park\, n. [AS. pearroc, or perh. rather fr. F. parc; both being of the sam=
e
origin; cf. LL. parcus, parricus, Ir. & Gael. pairc, W. park, parwg. Cf.
Paddock an inclosure, Parrock.] 1. (Eng. Law) A piece of ground inclosed,
and stored with beasts of the chase, which a man may have by prescription,
or the king's grant. --Mozley & W.
2. A tract of ground kept in its natural state, about or adjacent to a
residence, as for the preservation of game, for walking, riding, or the
like. --Chaucer.

3. A piece of ground, in or near a city or town, inclosed and kept for
ornament and recreation; as, Hyde Park in London; Central Park in New York.

park =A0=A0 (=A0P=A0)=A0=A0Pronunciation Key=A0=A0(p=E4rk)
n.=20

1.    An area of land set aside for public use, as:
a.    A piece of land with few or no buildings within or adjoining a town,
maintained for recreational and ornamental purposes.
b.    A landscaped city square.
c.    A large tract of rural land kept in its natural state and usually
reserved for the enjoyment and recreation of visitors.

2.    A broad, fairly level valley between mountain ranges: the high parks
of the Rocky Mountains.
3.    A tract of land attached to a country house, especially when includin=
g
extensive gardens, woods, pastures, or a game preserve.
4.    Sports. A stadium or an enclosed playing field: a baseball park.
5.   =20
a.    An area where military vehicles or artillery are stored and serviced.
b.    The materiel kept in such an area.

6.    An area in or near a town designed and usually zoned for a certain
purpose: a commercial park.

Mosaics=20
(CIPA - Centre Interdisciplinaire de Po=E9tique Appliqu=E9e; University of
Li=E8ge, Belgium)

In November 2004 the "Centre Interdisciplinaire de Po=E9tique appliqu=E9"
(CIPA, Interdisciplinary Centre for Applied Poetics) will be holding its
third international symposium at the University of Li=E8ge (after "Poetry
&/In Music" in 2001 and "Foundations in Poetics" in 2002). The question
which will be considered within the framework of the 2004 symposium focuses
on what Lucien D=E4llenbach recently described as "un object esth=E9tique =
=E0
rebondissements"  (a rebounding aesthetic object).

Without doubt interdisciplinary work involves procedures and processes
which are at once inventive and risky. Given this, and the fact that a
major aim of modern poetics is to explore the specific and irreducible
aspects of all artistic practice (such as, for example, the famous and
ever-pertinent "literarity of literature" as expressed by Roman Jakobson),
an urgent question arises: should this multi-levelled exploration use
points of comparison as map co-ordinates? This is, of course, an open
question. Yet it points to one of the pitfalls that threaten every
interdisciplinary approach: when it attempts to compare fields that may,
all things considered, only be superficially comparable, analysis is
condemned to mere approximation and reduction, to building bridges that may
prove to be rickety and insubstantial - in short, an interdisciplinary
approach often unwittingly falls prey to the "demon of analogy".

In order to avoid such pitfalls strict binary comparisons between artistic
practices must be abandoned, and attempts to find those aspects that enable
us to say that various artistic practices are similar must not overlook
their differences, their particularities and their points of tension or
friction. It is even highly likely that, to a great extent, the most
interesting questions lie precisely in those friction areas. As a result it
is necessary to think not in the static terms of simple comparison, but
rather in the more overtly dynamic terms of a transversal approach - and to
recognise that the interest lies less in the comparison itself than in the
vibrating and oscillating images and objects it produces, animated rubber
balls or questions that bounce and ricochet between this or that artistic
form.

This tension between static comparisons and tracing dynamic and volatile
trajectories leads us to consider the mosaic, which can be usefully
considered as both a frozen kaleidoscope and an extremely ontologically
dialectical object.  In a groundbreaking work that will certainly pave the
way for further lines of investigation Lucien D=E4llenbach has demonstrated
both the tricky nature and the extreme richness of the mosaic: an antique
and forgotten object which paradoxically so manifestly haunts contemporary
practice that it crops up in any investigation in the realm of compared
poetics.

With the mosaic the boundaries between art, technique and craft become
blurred (without considering that the mosaic leads us back to the prickly
issue of the so-called "decorative arts"), and design, drawing, painting
and architecture intertwine. This "in-between" position is also found on a
more restricted and local scale: tensions between the figurative and the
non-figurative; virtual tensions, between the fragment and the whole, and
finally, the stresses and strains between stroke and colour, between the
line and the object which it traces, etc.

The symposium will bring together participants who extend and expand
D=E4llenbach's founding ideas. The mosaic may be regarded, stricto sensu, as
a practice. It may also be regarded, lato sensu, as a notion, the principle
of which is based on a metacritical approach which unravels the mosaic's
meaning, even on an ideological level. Above all, it is necessary to
examine the conditions to which the mosaic must submit in order to become,
strictly speaking, an issue; to examine what specific dynamics mobilise it
as a powerful analytical device, a general and transversal problematic, and
the conditions that make it available to rigorous formulations in different
artistic fields (architecture and literature as well as cinema, music,
comic strips, video art, multimedia, digital art, etc.).

Here is a non-exhaustive list of possible approaches.=20

Visual Arts
A mosaic is, first of all, a visual artefact: a representation to which a
variable coefficient of mimetic power has been allotted. In this way, the
mosaic is spontaneously called into dialogue with all other images,
regardless of their nature (pictorial images, photographic images,
cinematic images, electronic images, etc.). It seems that the mosaic in
particular incites and invites confrontation with images of a fundamentally
composite character: images made up of fragments, images made up of minute
shards, of odds and ends, heterogeneous and divided images, split and
shattered images. In this regard the mosaic allows us to reconsider issues
as varied and as fundamental as collage (Dadaist, surrealist and beyond),
photomontage, found footage (films made exclusively from fragments of other
films) or even divided images (in painting, photography, cinema, etc.).

Architecture
It is probably because of its links to architecture that Adolf Loos did not
consider the mosaic as a "crime" and indeed used this technique to "adorn"
the ceilings of his most beautiful villas. But is the mosaic still seen as
an ornament? When the mosaic is considered, does not the lazy dualism which
opposes the "noble" to the decorative arts become deconstructed? This would
explain why the word, which takes us back by metonymy to ancient palaces
and Byzantine churches, may be seen as loaded with historical meaning while
at the same time as a bearer of "modernity"=85
However, it is in the figurative sense of the word that the mosaic appears
today as one of the dominant motifs of architectural and urbanist theory.
In this respect the symposium will work to evaluate the significance of the
mosaic as a metaphor for architectural composition in the broadest sense,
from design to urban planning.
This possible re-reading should allow what are essentially very different
problematics to be seen in a new light and perhaps even linked. For
example, and at random: (1) disjunction, the theory elaborated by Tschumi
and put into practice at le Parc de la Villette, favouring repetitiveness
and the unit/fragmentation relationship; (2) the PHOTOSHOP concept that Rem
Koolhaas deemed worthy of copyright protection and which he defines, with
reference to the software package of the same name, as an ultramodern
"architectural and urban production" model using cut-and-paste; (3)
architectural mutations concerning new technologies and virtual
architecture in particular; etc.

Literature
Since its distant origins, text, an art for which the concept and
experience of time is fundamental, has also been thought of in terms of
spatial metaphors: from the "theatre of memory" (in oral literatures),
through ideas of "networks" (in the literatures which are being launched on
the internet), to images as varied as the jigsaw puzzle or the tapestry.
Also, over the millennia texts have been written on a variety of materials
which literally transform them into curious and fascinating objects. The
end of the 20th century seems to have had a marked preference for the
mosaic, which looms large as a textual metaphor (the same is also true of
literary works of the past), but is also very active as a concrete model of
the new forms of electronic writing which have begun to emerge in our age
and times. A number of questions arise from these observations. Some
concern the mosaic as an image of textual production (What is the value of
such metaphors? What are there heuristic and hermeneutic strengths and
weaknesses? What relations does the mosaic have to other spatial metaphors
concerning text?). Others relate to the mosaic as a practical model of
composition (is writing on and for a screen based, first and foremost, on
the model of the mosaic? Does the mosaic help in understanding other
literary practices that use the "cut and paste" technique? In practice,
what does it mean to compose/read a text as a mosaic?).

La mosa=EFque, c'est comme un kal=E9idoscope =E0 l'arr=EAt, un objet=
 hautement et
ontologiquement dialectique. En elle, se brouillent ainsi les fronti=E8res
entre art, technique et artisanat (cela dit sans compter que la mosa=EFque
engage =E0 reprendre, mine de rien, l'=E9pineuse question des arts dits
d=E9coratifs) ; en elle, s'entrecroisent et se dialectisent dessin, peinture
et architecture. Mais cette posture d'entre se v=E9rifie tout aussi bien sur
un plan plus serr=E9 et local : tension entre le figuratif (ordre de la
repr=E9sentation, de la transitivit=E9) et le non-figuratif (versant de la
tache, de l'=E9clat, de l'opaque) ; tensions virtuelles, entre le  fragment
et l'ensemble, entre la partie et le Tout (la tesselle comme fragment, le
fragment comme question) ; tiraillements, enfin, entre le trait et la
couleur, entre la ligne et l'objet qu'elle a pour vocation de d=E9limiter,=
 etc.=20
Il s'agira donc, dans une perspective transdisciplinaire, de nous r=E9unir
autour de Lucien D=E4llenbach et, autant que possible, d'=E9toiler et de fai=

tant que notion, redevable, en son principe, d'une approche m=E9tacritique
qui en d=E9plie tous les enjeux, y compris sur un plan id=E9ologique. Mais i=
l
importera surtout d'examiner les conditions auxquelles la figure mosa=EFque
est tenue de se soumettre pour devenir, =E0 proprement parler, une question,
un puissant op=E9rateur analytique, une probl=E9matique g=E9n=E9rale et
transversale, susceptible de conna=EEtre une formulation rigoureuse au
travers de diff=E9rents champs artistiques (architecture, litt=E9rature, mai=
s
aussi cin=E9ma, musique, photographie, bande dessin=E9e, art-vid=E9o, multim=
=E9dia
et art num=E9rique, etc.). Petite cartographie non exhaustive :

Arts visuels
Pour aller =E0 l'essentiel, une mosa=EFque, c'est avant tout un artefact
visuel, c'est d'abord une image (imago :  " portrait ; ombre d'un mort ;
copie ; comparaison ; apologue ; " - Le Grand Robert), c'est une
repr=E9sentation affect=E9e d'un coefficient variable de puissance mim=E9tiq=
ue.
En cela, la mosa=EFque est comme spontan=E9ment appel=E9e =E0 dialoguer avec=
 toutes
les autres images, de quelque nature qu'elles soient (images picturales,
photographiques, cin=E9matographiques, =E9lectroniques, etc.). Plus
particuli=E8rement, il semble que la figure mosa=EFque incite et invite =E0 =
une
confrontation avec toutes les images =E0 caract=E8re fonci=E8rement=
 composite :
images constitu=E9es par fragments,  images en petits morceaux, faites de
bric et de broc, images h=E9t=E9rog=E8nes et divis=E9es, images cliv=E9es ou
pulv=E9ris=E9es. A cet =E9gard, il n'est pas interdit de penser - et c'est b=
ien
cela, entre autres choses, que nous chercherons =E0 v=E9rifier - que la
mosa=EFque permet de reprendre =E0 neuf des questions aussi fondamentales et
vari=E9es que celles du collage (dada=EFste, surr=E9aliste et au-del=E0), du
photomontage, du found footage (films =E9labor=E9s exclusivement =E0 partir =
de
fragments d'autres films) ou encore de l'image divis=E9e (en peinture, en
photographie, en cin=E9ma, etc.).

Architecture
C'est probablement parce qu'elle fait corps avec l'architecture que la
mosa=EFque n'est pas consid=E9r=E9e comme " un crime " par Adolf Loos, qui=
 en "
orne " d'ailleurs les plafonds de ses plus belles villas. Mais pr=E9cis=E9me=
nt,
s'agit-il encore d'ornement ? Avec la mosa=EFque, le dualisme trop commode
qui oppose les arts (majeurs) aux arts d=E9coratifs (mineurs) ne fait-il pas
l'objet d'un travail de d=E9construction? Ce qui expliquerait pourquoi ce
mot, qui renvoie par m=E9tonymie aux palais antiques et aux =E9glises
byzantines, serait =E0 la fois charg=E9 d'histoire et porteur de " modernit=
=E9 "=85
Toutefois, c'est au sens figur=E9 que la mosa=EFque nous apparait aujourd'hu=
i
comme l'un des motifs dominants de la th=E9orie architecturale et
urbanistique. Dans cette perspective, il s'agira d'=E9valuer la port=E9e
heuristique de la mosa=EFque en tant que m=E9taphore de la composition
architecturale prise dans son sens le plus large, depuis les cr=E9ations
multiformes du design jusqu'aux projets urbanistiques contemporains.
Cette possible relecture devrait nous permettre d'envisager sous un jour

Theoretically


Still haunted by an attachment to "identity"? Unaware of any theoretical
developments
in language after 1913, the year of the lovely "Black Square" by Malevich?

Perhaps this is why it took you years to finally say "Uncle Clyde" and
mean it. Only then did you realize "Uncle Clyde" was attached to your
identity.  What changed was the total lack of words or names for his
haunting, his yearning to give you a plasmatic slap on the face and say,
"Complete me!  Break the friggin milk bottles and burn those musty papers!"

The problem was you didn't want to go back to 1913 for the name, and
instead floundered in the late 70s.  Had you been aware, you would have
noticed that "Clyde" and "Uncle" had been in use all along, though not
timeless. On the streets and in the playgrounds, "Uncle" was as common
as a cigarette butt, "Clyde" somewhat problematic as you'd never been on
a farm, nor met anyone who would admit to the name.

Now you're free and can theoretically go about your business.
What's-his-name is gone and all you can see is a pair of overalls and
some long underwear on a clothesline wherever they still have real
clotheslines and a dozen or so clothespins waiting.

JS,

Ah, I thought I was the only one odd enough to think this was a great idea.

3 years ago I shot 2 hours of source video with friends of mine from an
=B3Acting for the fun of it=B2 class at Suny purchase.  I then took a prose poe=
m
of mine [=B3This is my favorite part=B2] with a clear narrative and shot 60
minutes of video.

Unfortunately after shooting the source video I got distracted while loggin=
g
[by the processing of publishing 12,000 copies of a book and the related
marketing efforts] and before editing, so the projects is still to be done.

But I have ideas for a full DVD of adaptations of my work that I want to
work on in the next year.  And since advances like G5s, After Effects 6 and
Final Cut 4 with Live Type making cool poetic videos should be a lot easier
and a lot cooler.  For most non prosey poems heavy use of tools like =B3Live
Type=B2 [part of Final Cut 4] will likely prove very useful.  And now poets
can burn their own DVD projects at home.

But, bottom line, it is cool to hear other stuff is going on with this
realm.   And I certainly plan on actually doing what I set out to do years
ago.

Thanks for reminding me I need to get back to that.  And I look forward to
see what other poets do with this new genre.

Not to my knowledge. I did fail to mention the Aids Memorial Grove (which
may have a more accurate name), which is quite extraordinary. If you Google
around you will find it in pictures, history, etc. Which is not the "real"
thing - that will be a sad day when people turn monitors into anything
comparable to a well made park memorial site or, to be liberal, let's say a
challenge.

"Flaming Nuts" used to be the name of a local punk band!

Sorry, just made that up.

UB Poetics Discussion Group: I wonder if anyone here has
information regarding the history, roots, eym. of the
English-language word "booger." I was surprised to hear my
father, an 82-year old American, utter it this morning,
over breakfast. My mother suggested that it's a word that
her grandmother would have been familiar with, which would
push it back into mid-late 19c Brooklyn or Newark at
least. Also curious about change in pronunciation of first
syllable.

Thanks, David, for this lovely summation de City Parks
Where does the Smithson essay on Olmsted appear?
Curiously, re the Olmsted in Milwaukee- given all my connections with walks
and parks - I wrote an extended poem entitled "The Ballad of Artie Bremer"
(Momo's Press, 1974). I did not know Bremer - who was young, bright,
brimming with contradictions and full of so much sorrow - was ever to find
any solace anywhere, let alone an Olmsted Park. That is probably another
"good" area of exploration - murderous deeds performed and/or imagined Parks
- the Hawthorne, Poe "apprehension of nature" side of the Am. Lit standard
equation - which you hint here in the role of 'alientation'.

And Joel, that's a great Olmsted quote on the forests around Portland -
which, as you probably know, are the on-going sites of devastation aka
'clear cutting'. If you have a chance,  check out the Robert Adams'
photographs of such. Elegies.

As to different pronunciations of booger,
I've mainly heard Brits (esp. Mancunians)
& Canadians use the long oo (on the model
of snooker?); kids, too, to emphazise disgust.

Park enthusiasts may be interested in a digital diary (now more than
100 000 words) which I write most days out of doors on a hand held

Um, well, not quite ...

The bugger of this is that there are (at least) two distinct boogers,
originating separately and converging.

The two earliest recorded uses would be "booger" for nasal mucus (US, late
19thC on), less prissily a lump of snot, relating to the English "bogey"
(1930s on) and distinct from another "booger" which, in one aspect, is an
American variant pronunciation of the English "bugger" (rhyming with
tree-hugger).  The earliest meaning of this (early 18thC England) is simply
a person, a meaning which still exists in the UK (as in "silly bugger")
despite the later sexual overlay.

Probably the word "bugger" derives ultimately from Latin "Bulgarus", a
Bulgarian.

The other major strand (airbrushed out in the quote above from
yourdictionary) is "boog[er]" both *as* part of Black American slang (with a
range of referents), and as a term *for* a Black American.

There seem to be lots of overlaps and extensions (myself, I tend to say "Oh,
bugger!" rather than "Oh, shit!" as a generalised expression of annoyance),
but that for starters.

The following ghazals were posted to the Poetics board between July 6, =
2003 and
July 24, 2003 when the contest officially closed.  Any commentary on any =
or all
of them would be interesting.  I would like to discuss them.  Let's try =
to keep
the discussion from being too dogmatic or harsh, or to indicate that =
your
viewpoint is the only possible one, as that turns everybody off.  =
Appreciative
or perceptive and illuminating conversation, like illuminating poems, is
exploratory, and approaches the elephant of the ghazal from the =
viewpoint of the
three blind men -- which began as a Sufi parable.

Thanks so much.

GHAZAL ON A DAY OF MEDICAL FAST
By Charlotte Mandel



Fasting empties the brain as well as the stomach.
Hunger for eclipsed names impels as the stomach.

Gold hoops of navel rings bobble along 5th Avenue,
hip-slung jeans chiming la belle as the stomach.

The waist of my prom gown refuses the zipper.
What organ expands as many cells as the stomach?



Two frat brothers, portly after decades, connect
via belt buckle--hail/farewells at the stomach.

Once upon a skyscraper summit, Diana poised with bow--
each quivering muscle show-and-tell as the stomach.

Gwyn McVay

How and why? how and why? we feral pigeons mourn
Only you know what was torn at the end

A cloth maybe once both of you could have worn
Enchanted scarf, your son made unborn at the end

Pictures, the dark-eyed, nothing words could adorn
A savage dark-gold unicorn at the end

A maddening simoom, a beast with just one horn
A single and perfect rose-thorn at the end

When the storm came my wing could not shelter you, born
mortal as I am, forlorn at the end

the immediate world exists

the intersection where the bank,
office towers, tim hortons

in the throes of service -- public

Ghazal

By

Martha L Deed


Rules of the game form a comfortable cage.
Are those who don't play in or out of the cage?


The fawn munching lilies looks into the house,
watches people drink tea on display in their cage.


Dozens of red trilliums grow deep in the woods.
Each blooms safe from prey in its own metal cage.


He who revolts against train and plane schedules
rides locked to the highway in his own rolling cage.


She climbs from the car on the run from her spouse,
Gaunt, haunted, and amazed to be free from her cage.


M writes her stories with passionate care.
His raging dismay puts truth in a  cage.

why, my Love, do bees suck the peach
in holes beetles dug to make a breach

and ants in foraminiferal delight hasten to feast
between rims of the cratered peach

when peach trees are not seen for miles around
then one alone finds one alone makes love beyond reason's bound

that it is beyond any one's love's reach to find
like the moth the penumbra of light it breaches then round it winds

or a dog to a bitch in heat it leeches doesn't mind
to hearken to a pheromonic chemical bark

the beetle flies to the peach's meat it breaches
like a car caroming to a screeching halt to one in park

Ghazal Improvisation

My expositional brain working to grasp at thought
develops eggshell cracks, hence, leakage of
 thought.

So many spins of the carousel, riding uncountable
rounds,
so dizzy I don't catch the brass ring of a single
thought.

As the dock creaks your figure sways.   I gaze
nonplussed at the foamy tracks of your thought.

Sky a gray canvas.  Call a breeze to daub fantasy
clouds
where we stand among wild poppies, lost in thought.

Whatever I say whatever I do fails of any success:
Oh Charlotte, self-detractor of pride in poetic
thought!

Interviewing with the NSA Ghazal

By Millie Niss=20


I seriously thought the interviewer might be an alien:
when he asked: "do you plan to marry your enemy alien?"

He and I were almost an expired item
But he was "mon Stephane," not a dangerous alien

"And the others?" the interviewer asked watching the wires
 and bands which ran all over me, an alien

a cyborg, mechanical, electrical, easy to judge
unlike the hands of an unknowable alien



"You must list them," he said, every one that you fraternized
"I had friends who were tan,  they weren't googly-eyed aliens"

After hours, they released me, and I knew they wouldn't hire me
good riddance! I ran from these androids and aliens

I couldn't forget that they asked about thoughts
not just deeds I had planned but mere whisperings of the alien

and we're none of us pure, and I don't like the president
am I next when they come to ban all the aliens?

Ghazal, October 2001
by Susan Firghil Park


I wake uneasy, spy the face of a ghost in the mirror.
Confused stranger's eyes just like my own in the mirror.

"Pigeon's blood children" a phrase from my dream.
Children of loss? desire? war? I'm alone in the mirror.

A cracked plate on tiled kitchen floor.  Pieces pick up
easy, not like these shattered tableaux in the mirror.

"Talk sense, doctor," said the patient, finally, to Erickson.
Word salad news only leaves scrapes and bones in the mirror.

Salmon jump in the river, cormorants swim.  I scrub
the sink, hyper, practice chanting "aum" in the mirror.

Susan, plant lilies to place at the feet of the dead; pray for
pieces of old arabesques landscaped by sorrow in the mirror.

How Many Bouquets

By Harriet Zinnes
=20

The lover holds the letter in the palm of his hand.
Unread it flutters as it wilts in his hand.

There are oceans to cross but the harbor is sealed.
Why not, she said, pick up shells from my hand?

Bejeweled the queen makes a tragic false start.
Her consort, resigned, plays the card in his hand.

It is bewitched, the child cries out to her nanny,
Who laughs as the parrot eats from her hand.

There are eels, a dead whale, a voice in the sand.
Will Poe kiss the unringed, quivering, ghostlike hand?

She is cold in her bed and the butler with tea
Wavers once, wavers twice, spills the tea on her hand.

It is the story of the rose.  How many bouquets?
The tide slaps the oozing sand.  Unmanned, he slaps her hand.

GHAZAL

By Daniel Zimmerman


Soldiers have always sought loot 'n booty
or loot enough at least to purchase booty

Odysseus, chronically indifferent to swag,
at length grew tired, too, of booty

Alexander, philanderer, minted coin
& left his troops to divvy up the booty

King Charles's minions: left holding the bag
despite all that puritanical booty

Napoleon, rolling in simoleons,
considered only Josephine his booty

Warriors all, eyeing a beauty,
contemplate the joys of booty

Mathematical Beauty

By Kirby Olson

Divide the sun by beauty
And you get mathematical beauty

Add a cup of sherbet to long division
& up jumps mathematical beauty

Give the goose a flair for algebra
A feather in the cap of mathematical beauty!

Tie up traffic with Euclid's geometry
& you'll sniff the bouquet of mathematical beauty

Everywhere you look there's a cube or a square
But it's rare to see mathematical beauty.

Now that our world has been taken over by red-assed

Those who are not will still want to act like
red-assed baboons.

Ask for a little mercy, ask for some sense
You're sure to be shouted down by a choir of red-assed

We few cowed humans left when we meet each other
Can't even bring ourselves to say the words "red-assed
baboon".

Comments: To: cartograffiti@mindspring.com

The parks issue is incredibly huge if you get into the administrative side of
it.  I'm half-way through the giant biography of Robert Moses -- a man who
literally administrated a thousand parks in the New York City area for decades.
How he got this power, and the power that gave him, is the subject of Robert
Caro's Pulitzer prize winning critical biography.  You get lots of minute
details about how bills are written and passed in Albany, and how different
agencies compete for funding.  Aside from parks, there are also things like
hospitals, light rail, etc., etc., that must be considered.  Moses was the best
bill drafter in New York state and would often sneak an innocuous sentence into
a bill on p. 196 that would give him power to control for instance the moneys
from the Triborough bridge authority in perpetuity, making it possible to ram
the Henry Hudson parkway through Spuyten Duyvil -- one of the last small towns
in Manhattan, and cream the last remaining wetland.  He built parks all over
wealthy white areas, and built one or two parks for Harlem -- and the one he
built he designed with monkeys all over its grill work to humiliate and insult
the blacks who would use it.  The administrative side of parks, etc., is boring,
and yet important for poets to know more about.

Portland's parks have made it a new place for people with trust funds to
gravitate toward but it has killed the chances of a lot of others to find a
livable city there.  The pressures of the money issues have driven many out.
The issues are beyond me, and I can't always understand them.  I'm too busy with
many other things, and seemingly innocuous sentences can hide misery for decades
for those who have been chased out or killed by them.

Check out this page for a shotgun blast of ideas about Portland:

http://www.stopmetro.com/saneportland/

Also in Portland are a lot of really great young people -- there's a guy whose
name I forget who wants to put a sculpture of Diogenes on the front of the light
rail -- Diogenes holding a lamp as he went through Athens searching for a true
man.  This is a brilliant idea, but so are hospitals and soup kitchens and
affordable housing.  It's very hard to balance all these things.  Somehow I
think that the city is the frontier of poetry -- and that poets should try to
become learned about these things and help to legislate -- become the
unacknowledged legislators that Shelley wrote about.  But this requires getting
deeply into the nuts and bolts of city and state government, as Charles Olson
tried to do in Gloucester.  To pose a different set of values, but a deeply
informed one as well.  Ed Sanders does this in Woodstock.  He interviews police
men and the people who spread salt in the winter, and it all goes into his
community newspaper.  It's an interesting niche for a poet to take up, and
integrates the poet back into the life of the polis.

Dear Patrick!

If I am "embarassed," it's only so very slightly: mostly I'm mightily

work. Thank you very much for your heart-warming appreciation. Such

Here's what I think of Fulcrum:

I have been an admirer of Philip's writing since I first googled him in
1999
or 2000 and came across a poem called "Bohemian Blues."  Innovative yet
appreciative of the fundamentals of poetry, with a sense of history in
his
diction yet able to choose words that are very today.  And drama too.
And a
sort of selflessness in it.  One poem revealed a poet who can "do it
all,"
who is no one-trick pony.

Philip's work is perhaps the epitome of creative synthesis.  Philip's
got so
many influences on-board, from his linguistic/polyglottal abilities to
his
knowledge of history and philosophy.  And so on, a man of letters in the
old
sense, but one who rushes towards the vanguard in the new sense.  Sorry
Philip, I'm fawning and you're perhaps a bit embarrassed.

I found that sort of superhuman spread of knowledge, sensibility,
ridiculousness, and adventure in his _Dusk Ragas_.  And I've just
acquired
his new _Monkey Time_ which is a recent Verse Press Prize winner.  I
haven't
yet read it (got it yesterday) but I expect a great deal from it....

But Fulcrum, yes, Fulcrum...

Fulcrum issue 1 was a stupendous debut for a journal.  Loaded with great
essays and some phenomenal poems.

But the current issue goes beyond stupendous.  The issue explores the
intersection between philosophy and poetry.  Starts off with a blazing
essay
on poetic anarchism from the editors (Katia Kapovich and Philip).

It's a yearly, and there's some engaging material in there to keep you
busy
until the next issue.  As I leave for vacation it will travel with me
along
with Philip's new book (oh and _Wolf Tongue_, the new collected works of
Barry MacSweeney from bloodaxe...had to order it from amazon.co.uk since
it
is apparently not distributed to the USA).  An interview with Billy
Collins
shares space in an issue with an interview of Bernstein by Perloff.
There
are very charged cross-currents all over the issue.

And Philip takes risks, all of them good ones I think.  The work of some
relatively unknown but very talented poetry from listmates Dave
Bircumshaw,
David Baratier (I hope David knows I am a fan of his Estrella's
Prophecies
series), and Francis Raven appears.  Good going!  And "Bad Food Day"
from
Steve Shoemaker is a fucked-up and disturbing hoot of a poem.  And the
poems
from WN Herbert are astoundingly lush.  I've only flipped through it and
read a few pages here, a few pages there, and already I can say that
this
issue blows away issue 1.  I'd say it blows away just about any print
poetry
pub out there.  I think it merits comparisons to John Tranter's Jacket
and
outdoes Jacket in some significant ways (fortunately it isn't a
competition
and there's room for both pubs).  Fulcrum is no mere experiment but
instead
the polished delivery of a swirl of so many influences.  Philip and
Katia I
think try to "cover it all" and their editorial ambition pays off.  (And
that payoff best not be mastercard debt.)

Michael Palmer has an essay which starts with nothing and ends with
Pessoa's
"Autopsychography" and leads me feeling justified in my own efforts and
the
efforts of a few others to explore the "fakeness" of the surfaces of
poetry
and the myths surrounding poets and their voices.

BUY IT FOLKS!  Believe you me, if you have to buy this issue out of some
sense of charity, it is an act of charity that benefits *you*.

That's an interesting way of putting it, David. We've published Fulcrum
2 off our Mastercard. Just back from vacation to discover amid piling
bills that our checks have been bouncing while we were away. I am
currently jobless, my wife works for $9 per hour, and our four year old
doesn't get paid for going to daycare. Some resources.

And then protracted silence on the part of our readers. Is anyone
reading us out there, or are all those copies just sinking without trace
into the literary quicksand? What do y'all think?

Derek,

This one counts!  I went through and looked for the heading of ghazal, and
tried to forward them all to Terrie.  It was a monumental task taking at
least seven minutes.  If you didn't use the heading of ghazal, I didn't
look  in it as there have been hundreds of messages.  Yours is an
interesting perversion of the ghazal sensibility.  I like it.

Well, Mark, Beale/Patridge notes, with regard to "Bulgarus", '... the

... but I hadn't realised that the general, non-pejorative sense of
bugger=person comes so much before the negative sense, or at least seems to
be documented earlier.  There seems to be a hell of a lot stirring around
the boog(er)/bugger/bog(e)y/bogeyman/buggabo/you-name-it nexus.  But there's
not that much on the inter-relations in either Cassell or Patridge/Beale,
and I don't have access to a decent dictionary of American slang.  I can't
even get at the OED at the moment, as I can't seem to get it running under
Windows XP.  <sigh>

So if someone would like to pick up the baton?

I feel it is time for the one true authority to chime in upon this discussion.

Our columnist-at-large, the poet-publisher Greg Fuchs, starts most emails to me as Booger, and answers all calls from me, through the power of caller ID, "What's up, Booger."

So ladies and gentleman, I define Booger as me.

"Pledge marches me on your boat"? To the moment of the pledge of truth,
but the march carries nothing, back and forth - the image pretends towards
the static, the immanent, with its reliance on the fixture of pixels. But
such fixtures are configurations in the first place - we are at double and
tertiary levels of coding, and this coding is all the way down of course.
Nonetheless, there is a structure of belief here, all tangled with soft-
ware and protocols, and therefore with contractuality and post-late-cap-
italism, remember that? :"Your palm is blasphemy unto the Lord."? The palm
is the image of the world; it is the Lord's blasphemy, cutting corners,
making shortcuts, bypassing the Absolute - here is what you have, here is
what might be the case - and you can do something about it. "Your boat
shall convert in truth and not in false demand"? Hardly the case; in fact,
the wavering is the result of the wave - diffraction and refraction at
work portending an image, now digital, now part of the "Archive series"
which is once again taken for truth. No elements need apply - they are are
present, accounted for, at least at the beginning. To begin the unbegin-
ning, to begin the unaccountable - that is the history of our lives,
against which archiving is both weak and unacceptable. :"The Transform and
Freedom of the Natives"? It seems just the opposite - archiving the
impossible, down to the level of the pixel. Even in Run-time, this goes
nowhere at all. The images are enormous, down to the level of diffraction
lines, surely digital artifacts in the first place. From all reports,
they're less in jpeg than tiff, which shows that some sort of processing
is advantageous. Of course every image is a process, and the digital ones
continue to be so - not to mention decay, lost pixels beneath the rain of
constant radiation. ::

"How would you define your palm"? - not by defining I would say, not by
palm-up or palm-down. The definition in the first place is a type of
archiving, a placement, both radical and Cartesian in essence, if not in
gridwork.

Does "The Transform and Freedom of the Natives"? It seems just the oppos-
ite - archiving the impossible, down to the level of the pixel.  Even in
Run-time, this goes nowhere at all. The images are enormous, down to the
level of diffraction lines, surely digital artifacts in the first place.

Death spreads her asshole open; Tiffany is within.
Death says: The ghost will suck us together!

Tiffany bleeds from the hole of Death.
Tiffany leaves from the cunt of Death.
Death looks at you with his cock throbbing and cunt wet.
Her body offers you every sort of pleasure, and
you offer your holes to death.

Death says: I'll dissolve you in my fluids, hurl them into you!

Suddenly Death expels you from her body, you feel strange as you
pass through the hole, into the open air, through flesh and blood
before you finally stop inside another body. You call this a name,
a building. It seems vaguely familiar...

That is what happened to Alan.

This is what happened to Clara.

Kill Clara.
What ? Attack yourself ?
Drop clitoris. Ok.
You are in the cloaca of Tiffany. There are no exits.
Clitoris and 10 gold coins...

That is what happened to Clara.

Calif. Senate OKs transgender protections
Ellen Maremont Silver, Gay.com / PlanetOut.com Network
Friday, July 25, 2003 / 05:06 PM


The California Senate passed a groundbreaking bill on Thursday that
makes it illegal to discriminate against transgender people in housing
and employment. AB 196 adds "gender identity or expression" to sex and
other characteristics that are already protected by the state's Fair
Employment and Housing Act.

The bill, passed by the Assembly in April by a 41-34 vote, now goes to
Gov. Gray Davis, who is expected to make a decision in approximately
two weeks. The Senate vote was 23-11 along strict party lines: All in
favor were Democrats, all opposed were Republicans.

Assemblyman Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, authored the bill. Equality
California, the state's GLBT advocacy organization, worked closely with
the five-member legislative GLBT caucus to achieve passage of the bill.

Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, one of the bill's co-authors and a
caucus member, called AB 196 "a simple matter of civil rights.
California law already protects against hate crimes based on gender
stereotyping, and protects students and teachers from discrimination or
harassment on this basis. ... We should not tolerate such arbitrary
discrimination that can lead to the problems of unemployment and
homelessness among those who are perceived as different."

The San Francisco Department of Public Health reported 70 percent
unemployment among transgender people in 1999, according to the San
Francisco Chronicle.

AB 196 allows employees to dress consistent with their gender identity
as long as they meet reasonable workplace appearance standards. It is
endorsed by more than 50 business, religious and civil rights
organizations, from the California Labor Federation to the California
Apartment Association. As expected, conservatives have criticized the
measure.

If Davis signs the bill into law, California will join Minnesota, New
Mexico and Rhode Island in explicitly prohibiting gender identity-based
discrimination. Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New
York and the District of Columbia have statutes that have been
interpreted to protect transgender people in certain circumstances. No
federal law protects GLBT individuals in the workplace, but activists
and organizations including the Human Rights Campaign are developing
one.

It's curious in all the dictionary definitions given below, that nothing in

blended with the idea of a "sacred ground" where, for example, an experience
of "sublimity" is fused with the activity of the eye, the way one walks, a
form of solitude and prayer, or, alternatively other kinds of communion with

Kezar Stadium, which is part of Golden Gate Park, used to be the home of the

the stadium has been beautifully rebuilt, the grounds in full view whether

Iliad of Clara


Clara's tired. Clara goes home. Clara goes to Clara's hole.
Clara goes to Clara's double hole. She can get back to the church
this way but she doesn't want to go there. She doesn't want to
see Alan or the ghost of Alan.

Clara wants to be by herself. She's tired of everything. Alan doesn't
think she's carrying anything. Clara, oozing blood, smeared with
symbols of shit and cum, totters home. Where is Clara when I need her?
I'm obsessed with Clara. I'm obsessed with Clara

I'm obsessed with Clara. I'm hardly here. I'm hardly here at all.

You've reached the jetty. waves roll in, your wounds sting in the
salt air, cunt and cock freezing. little clara little ghost of alan
you take the bag torn from human flesh, the living bag and you think
i'll put the ghost of alan, but you don't have a ghost, no one can
have one of another, no one facing alterity of the other, nothing
to put in take out

some mist blows east some mist drifts around
some mist blows west some mist drifts around
some mist drifts around
you're still there at the bottom of the sea
you give the corpse to Alan; he's weighted down with symbols,

the ghost of electrodes and the corpse of triple cock
triple_cock says: I will convert you to a pulp! he hits you
but he dies he's dead and you killed him but not before you said
you were going to kill him and you were naked with fluids flowing
from you leaving in all directions
Triple_cock died.
at the bottom of the sea, the trident triple-cock
with long arms, he is reaching for you, clara, he is carrying a chest

Alan looks at the electrodes. alan looks at the electrodes.
he sees nothing special. he's carrying nothing.
some mist blows west and he's at the bottom of the sea.
Clara takes the electrodes. Were these the corpse of Man?
Was the corpse of WoMan the corpse of Man? of WoMan?

Clara gives the electrodes to Alan.
Alan is a gatherer of corpses. Do an inventory, Alan.
Alan, you are a ghost who has nothing.
The corpses disappear, there are no more corpses.
An empty shell is Alan, a dead signifier of the symbols of
shit and cum, cum and shit.

WoMan says: Spread his legs!
WoMan says: Spread his legs!
WoMan says: What is that boygirl doing here!
WoMan says: Fuck him!
Man grazed you.
Man missed Clara.
You hit Man hard. It's returned (i.e. the Man hits you hard.)
WoMan says: Fuck him.
The man died. You killed him. You take the corpse.
Give the corpse to Alan in the mist

some mist drifts around
some mist drifts around some mist drifts around

i took the corpse of Honey but I couldn't eat it. So I gave it to Alan.
I thought Alan might use it.
Honey died. Clara took her corpse and gave it to me.
I am a ghost; what am I to do with it?
Honey tickled you in the stomach. Honey died. You killed Honey.
You cannot take Honey. She is not here. You cannot look at Honey.
There is no Honey here.
Honey had hit you hard but you had returned it.
the ghost of alan furiously drives you
you are hunted by no one

some mist around here some mist north there is some mist in the south

Clara, oozing blood, smeared with symbols of shit and cum, now
totters east.

some mist drifts around She is not in good shape. A quicktyper
not in good shape.
You try to take the quicktyper. You fail.

Honey opens her labia and comes on you. Some mist blows around
Some mist blows north
Some mist leaves
You are now hunted by Honey

You can not take that!

You can not take that!
More than anything... more than the Glass Slipper... more than
the pool of blood... more than the Magic Wand...
You can not take that! You can not take any of them!

Clara says: you are talking to a wraithe
Clara says: you are speaking from a wraithe
{from the position of a wraithe}
{from an unreasonable position)

ghost of Alan says: Clara I have tried to kill you.
ghost of Alan says: Over and over I have tried to kill you.
Clara totters in, oozing blood, smeared with symbols of shit
and cum. But why symbols? One remembers the Parmenides...
ghost of Alan. "A small clearing. There are trees all around you."
You wipe your holes with blades of grass. You eat the grass.
You lie down in the weeds. The sun b akes you. You shove branches
into you. You think of returning. You are learning. You think
about the trees. They are sparse in the north.
Alan enters the game. some mist blows north. (We'll follow the trail)
Blood red clotted plain. There are clots to the north,
too deep for your embedding. Blood flows freely across your
clotted holes and eyes.

This ghazal I believe is quite good and has the ghazal feeling, too.  I do think it's point could be better made if the last two couplets were cut.  The last two couplets don't move the erotic charge forward.  Pruning roses, anyone?

Kirby,

The retardation of the erotic charge, in fact, lies at the heart of this =
ghazal, in the double meaning of "commence" as both to begin and to end. =
Caught between time (meeting) and eternity (consummation), the lovers =
embody the Tierra del Fuegan word "mamahlapinatapei," which means =
'looking into each other's eyes, each wishing to do what both desire but =
neither chooses to commence,' as Howard Rheingold defines it in They =
Have a Word For It (I chose the word 'commence' from that definition). =
The penultimate couplet contemplates the paradox of the imperfect =
expertise of innocent desire (cf. Shakespeare in " The expense of spirit =
in a waste of shame"), and the final couplet analogizes their =
Hamlet-like courage in the spititual context of the lion's den (imagine =
the dilemma from the lions' point of view!), while also mentioning =
myself by name, in the ghazal tradition. The predicament of the lovers =
mirrors the 'retardation of eternity' discussed by Henry Corbin as =
affecting the relationship of the believer and his angel in various sufi =
narratives which inspire many of the poems of Hafiz, Sana'i and Rumi, =
among others.=20

I appreciate your interest in inviting poems in this form, and your =
interest in my effort especially. Perhaps others would like to comment =
on the perspective(s) underlying their ghazals, too?

Best,

Dan

Michael rothenburg,

You're an old hand at this linkage of poetry/parks, then.  I'm a relative
newcomer.  Very interested in this new field of Environmental Aesthetics, but
also in all the swirl of thought around public policy and parks/recreation.
Your note on your own activism provides a clear lineage that I think a lot of
younger people would like to know about.  I have a friend who was like a
Greenpeace 007 -- he'd climb up on battleships in Portland (they would come up
the Columbia) and he'd climb up on them with webbed feet and drape a big banner
across them in the middle of the night saying Nuke Free, or something, but I
feel that this sort of thing irritates (as fun as it must have been) but doesn't
really accomplish anything concrete.  Walking a bill through legislation, and
getting to know the big wheels and how they turn is much more concretely useful
in the long term.  Can you say what role poetry has had in this for you?  Is it
a kind of galvanizing effect?  You have to be careful not to veer into
agit-prop, I imagine?

jane,
   i am a performance poet/video artist living in portland, oregon...your
e-mail struck me because i am currently working on a poem/video installation
for an organization in town called pacific switchboard. the project is called
"ghosting" and it is based on a chapter from giambattista porta's book "natural
magick"...a bit of renaissance esoterica that was widely read by obscure "new
science" philosophers and alchemists. porta devoted this particular chapter to
constructing different methods of concealing writing, making writing
invisible...by writing letters on pieces of thread, lines of skin,
eggshells...or by sending them by pigeon, hiding them underneath rocks, etc. i
am planning on filming myself conduct porta's invisible writing experiments...i
will uncover invisible poems using porta's methods, and the the film medium
itself will be shielded by a palimpsest of lines of the actual text. other
layers of the project involve a cultural history of ghosts, especially those
circulating in hamlet. on the whole, it will be a study of invisibility and
history...

Hi all,

I am (sort of) back from my long weekend away. And was
thinking about ghazals and our thread as I drove the
lovely stretch of Thruway from Albany to Buffalo and
into Canada. (Bonus of my trip to the cousin's wedding
was the sidetrip to an Indian grocery in Oakville
supplies)

I gave a copy of Ali's "call me ishmael tonight" to a
cousin who grew up in India very much immersed in
literary culture there. We talked after she read it.
She was shocked: after hearing ghazals her whole life
she had never realized their were a set of formal
rules!

It was always (she explained) a performance between
the poet and the audience--the poet always giving the
first line several times until the audience clamored
for the conclusion, or shouted out familiar refrains.
I guess poet and audience together enter the
linguistic space of "visions"--of speaking in tongues
really.

Ideally one wouldn't apply standard thoughts of
revision to a ghazal, as the recent discussion of Mr
Zimmerman's poem: "do the last two couplets disrupt
the energy" etc because in a ghazal the couplets are
really separate from each other--only formally linked,
perhaps only chronological link is that they are
spoken at the same time by the same person. they are
not really couplets constructing a "poem" in a very
Western sense. Sit down and read all fifty pages at
once of the Forche/Akash translation of Darwish's "The
Mural" (collected in the new UC Press book) and see if
you can get a sense of what I mean.

(I have no knowledge of whether Darwish writes the
poem formally as a ghazal in Arabic--my sense is that
he doesn't; it's certainly not translated to be read
formally).

I feel like I have been doing a very weak and
inadequate job of expressing the complex ideas behind
the form. I feel unsure about speculating about Agha
Shahid Ali's intentions regarding his (strenuous)
efforts to introduce the ghazal to Western writers,
but my sense is that he did indeed understand that he
was really only introducing formal qualities of the
form--sort of cosmetic, but I bet his hope was that
the actual writing might inspire some of the
thinking--deep thinking--that creates/is created by
the form itself and the way it fits into
Arabic/Persian/Turkish/Urdu literary tradition.

I do think this is probably one case in which the
famous "form is never more than an extension of
content" hits its limit: it's just not true about the
ghazal. it's not true of a lot of literature but
that's a whole separate thing I think.

form extends content. form allows content. form
contradicts content, contravents content, contrajects,
contrafolds, contraverse, contra-incorrigible,
incorroboratable, incontrovertible, controvertible,
convolute, combobulate, come back you jerk. form what?

um sorry

like i said: I'm really the last person who can
explain any of this. I hope a couple of things made at
least a little bit of sense. Well that's partly the point.

Hi, Kazim.

What a fascinating story about the way Indian audiences respond to ghazals
(& perhaps to other formal poems as well?)! It sounds like fans at a Dead
concert (though perhaps I misread the spirit). Your point about revision
made sense to me, though Kirby may have suggested it because my poem didn't
sufficiently manage to keep each sher distinct enough, and so imparted a
narrative stroll where stepping stones alone ought to have broken the
surface of the stream. The idea of resistance to narrative -- a sort of pure
parataxis? -- appeals very much to me, though I wonder  whether audiences
accustomed to ghazals resist, if they do, applying their own individual
narrative glue to the couplets. Can you think of a Western analogy to that
kind of listening? Does the call-and-response you mention insulate the
audience from the temptations of narrativity? Does the issue even come up?

I had an interesting time writing in this form, and would like to understand
it better by further exploring its dynamics. Sadly, I don't read any of the
original languages, though I have seen some transliterations, which help me
with the musicality. I wonder how rigidly one should repeat metrical forms
and/or line lengths (by syllable count or by 'quantity'), and to what
degree, for example, a pronoun in one couplet can refer to a noun in another
without  establishing a narrative. I varied line lengths in my poem,
switched meters to some extent, and linked couplets grammatically while
trying to keep each separate thematically or poetically. Does that seem
legitimate?

On the one hand, I like some of the relative looseness of  a site like
http://www.ghazalpage.net/ but, on the other, I also feel somewhat chary of
presuming to write in a form deeply rooted in a culture (or cultures) not my
own (though that has never stopped me from writing haiku).

I hope you'll have an opportunity to share your thoughts.

Dan Zimmerman

Dear Kazim Ali

But surely the content should dictate the form.  What appears in a sonnet
should have a different feeling from what appears in a ghazal  Rhythms, rhymes,
formal structures are the demands of feelings not of structures.

I really think that Kazim has hit on something important here.  It helps to
explain some of my uneasiness at Korean and Japanese forms of poetry
transplanted into English as well--most notably haiku, and the rafts of it
being written by people who know nothing of Japanese and Japanese context.
I've come to the conclusion that some forms of poetry simply don't "fit"
English, and the cookie cutter imposition of them onto English results
in--well, not real ghazals and not haiku to be sure--but those cosmetic
efforts that Kazim speaks of here.  I've seen some successful English
language Pantoums--or at least interesting English poems that result from
the imposition of that form...

It's easier, I believe, to trade forms among the Romance languages and have
an effective English language poem as the result.

This from the last section ("Hope: An Elegy") from "The Bob Hope Poem"
in Campbell McGrath's *Spring Comes to Chicago* [Ecco Press, 1996].

Would you believe it, if I told you, that even now, as I write these lines, as I
        dance this little caffeine-buzz shuffle,
word comes over the radio that Bob Hope has passed over to the great
        beyond, gone to fetch his eternal reward,
retired at last to vaudeville Valhalla, that heavenly Pro-Am, that never-
        ending celebrity roast in the sky?

What matter if it's true, if it is inevitable?
If not today, tomorrow; if not tomorrow, yesterday.
Who among us can predict the future?

For that matter, who can predict the past,
except to say that this, too, shall surely pass,
that death is nothing if not absolute?

Already I see his picture
on the cover
of *People* magazine,

young and beautiful Bob, smiling his smile of purest mastery, leering the
        leer of an era untroubled by doubt or uncertainty.

Bob agog with Bing on the golf course, Bob playing kissy with second-
        string starlets.
Bob pushing Pepsodent, Bob shopping Oscars, Bob selling war bonds with
        Eleanor Roosevelt.
Bob in the jungles of Guadalcanal, Bob raising the flag on Iwo Jima, Bob as
        Coyote, Bob as Loki, Bob in the ashes of Nagasaki.
Bob as cook, Bob as Darwin, Bob as Columbus, Bob as Buzz Aldrin.
        the Museum of American History, Bob teeing off in the Sea of Serenity.
Bob the body and Bob the shadow, Bob the echo and Bob the call.
Bob the imperial envoy of the American System, Bob the corporate
        janissary, Bob the mad jester of cultural hegemony.

THANKS FOR THE MEMORY!

So long. Farewell. Good-bye,
sweet Bob.
Adios, adieu, aloha.

Sayonara,
as Bing would say.

Sayonara on a steel guitar.

when I think of "content should dictate the form" I
certainly think of Mr Olson and a certain postmodern
picture of a western (or let's say "global") writer
well versed in various forms and poetic
traditions--beginning the scratchy notes in the
notebook, following the "content" to the appropriate
form: like

1) oh this seems to want to be a sonnet or
2) famous story about E Bishop changing "One Art" from
a prose essay into a villanelle or
3) the writer friend (or workshop teacher) saying
"have you investigated the ghazal form or the
pantoum--they are suited to highlighting an
"obsessive" quality (this last was actually said to me
once)

but what if I writer is working within a specific
tradition--or even no tradition at all. what if the
writer is investigating her own quirks--her own
authentic way of voice. i think of
1) dance therapy called "authentic movement" in which
the patient is blindfolded and set loose in a
studio--allowed to move as they like and is observed
carefully (and protected) by the therapist who'se
watching and perhaps notetaking the whole time. the
dancer is developing her own "vocabulary" of movement
completely uninhibited. didn't the form of B.K.
Rider's "vertical interrogation of strangers" develop
something like this?--women in a room alone with paper
and pencil to write spontaneous answers to the set of
given questions. (strongly recommend this book by the
way)

2)postmodern writers influenced by Olson (I think most
clearly of Alice Notley) who move restively and
restlessly through forms in order to search out deeper
meaning. Is it really fair to say of "Descent of
Alette" or "Disobedience" that form is "never more
than an extension of content"? In both of those books
qualities of "form" and "content" blur completely. Why
give primacy to one over the other?

3) for the true elimination of "form" and "content"
try listening to Ono music. I'll recommend a couple of
compositions: "Airmale" or "You" on the second disc of
the "Fly" album, "Mulberry" on the "Blueprint for a
Sunrise" album, or "Cambridge" (with John Lennon) on
their album "Unfinished Music #2: Life with the Lions"

HZ I'm not sure I'm contradicted anything you've said.

Thackray, who set up the reading.

the opening line is a reference to my comment that it was scalding here in
st. john's

KAH:

Do you mean "scalding" in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word, "performing like a skald"?  Well, it was "skalding" here on Monday night.  Angela's reading was great.  We had about 35-40 out, mostly young people.  The response was good, and a number of audience members have since told me how much they loved it--especially the impact of Angela's voice.  Angela is a very polished reader/performer.  She read mainly from material available on her web-page, but the translation from hyper-text to performance was nicely handled.  She introduced a couple of the pieces as attempts to simulate the effects of internet reading procedures in an oral form--self-interrupting, fragmented, processual pieces of pieces which flirted with the listener's attempts to make connections.  Some listeners probably found the fragmentation off-putting, but Angela's preoccupation with the erotics of language helped to keep everybody attentive.  She read from sections of "wide slumber," from "LOGYoLOGY," and!
  paid tribute to H. Sakatura and Berrigan by opening and closing with poems by each respectively.  In all, as I said above, it was a polished, nicely performed, sexy 30 minutes.  She's more subdued than Bok or Wershler-Henry, but has learned from their methods.

As to the English  correlative, see the work of John Carley, Denis Garrison,
et al (zips and crystallines, for two examples).I could also point you to
the World Haiku Club, chaired by Susumu-san Takiguchi.

Here's the final, unedited version of Darren Wershler-Henry's and my exchan=
ge (in a series of 250-word paragraphs) about the website Circulars, which =
yet lives even if we treat it here as a dead project.  The exchange meander=
s into a discussion of blogs, group authorship, appropriation, the public s=
phere, intellectual property, etc. and we get a little argumentative at the=
 end -- not quite Freddy vs. Jason, but enough to create wrinkles. This exc=
hange forms the third part of a three section essay on the website to be pu=
blished in a forthcoming MIT book.

<I>BKS:</I>  I've come up with an awkward, unsettling title for this essay:=
 "Circulars as Anti-Poem." I'm sure cries will be raised: So you are making=
 a poem out of a war? The invasion was only interesting as content for an e=
soteric foray into some elitist, inaccessible cultural phenomenon called an=
 "anti-poem"? (There is, in fact, a lineage to the term "anti-poem" but I d=
on't think it's important for this essay.) This legitimate objection is to =
be expected, and I have no reply except the obvious: that a website is a cu=
ltural construct, shaped by its editors and contributors, and more specific=
ally, Circulars had a "poetics" implicit in its multi-authored-ness, its ad=
mixture of text and image, its being a product of a small branch of the int=
ernational poetry community, etc. Of course, the title also suggests that t=
his website has some relationship to a "poem," but perhaps as a non-site of=
 poetry=E2=80=94as it is a non-site for war, even a non-site for activism i=
tself, where real-world effects don't occur. But my point for now is that t=
he fragmentary artifacts of a politicized investigation into culture=E2=80=
=94Gramsci's Prison Notebooks for example=E2=80=94has an implicit "poetics"=
 to it, but standing opposite to what we normally call a "poem." This sugge=
sts roles that poets can play in the world quite divorced from merely writi=
ng poetry (or even prose, though it was the idea that poets could contribut=
e prose to the anti-war cause=E2=80=94as speech writers or journalists, per=
haps=E2=80=94that initially inspired the site.=20

<I>DWL:</I> Hey Brian: what are you using to count words? MS Word says the =
previous paragraph has 254 words; BBEdit says 259 (me, I'm sticking to BBEd=
it). Poets=E2=80=94particularly poets interested in working with computers=
=E2=80=94should be all about such subtleties. Not that we should champion a=
 mechanically aided will to pinpoint precision (a military fiction whose ep=
itome is the imagery from the cameras in the noses of US cruise missiles dr=
opped on Iraq during the first Gulf War), but rather, the opposite=E2=80=94=
that we should be able to locate the cracks and seams in the spectacle ... =
the instances where the rhetoric of military precision breaks down. As such=
, here's a complication for you: why "anti-poem" instead of simply "poetics=
"? Charles Bernstein's cribbing ("Poetics is the continuation of poetry by =
other means") of Von Clausewitz's aphorism ("War is the continuation of pol=
itics by other means") never seemed as appropriate to me as it did during t=
he period when Circulars was most active. The invocation of Smithson's site=
/non-site dialectic is also apposite, but only in the most cynical sense. I=
s the US bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan the equivalent of a country-wide e=
xercise in land art? In any event, the relationship is no longer dialectica=
l but dialogic; the proliferation of weblogs ("war blogs") during the Iraq =
War created something more arborescent=E2=80=94a structure with one end anc=
hored in the world of atoms, linked to a network of digital nonsites.

<I>BKS:</I> I hesitate to tease out the "non-site" analogy=E2=80=94the <i>s=
ite</i> itself is too variable: for me, I was thinking of Circulars as bein=
g the non-site of activism, not just a corollary to the sweat and presence =
of people "on the streets" but a vision of a possible culture in which thes=
e activities (otherwise abandoned to television) can exist, not to mention =
reflect and nourish culturally. That is, are our language and tropes going =
to change because of the upsurge in activity occurring around us - in the f=
orm of poster art, detourned "fake" sites, maverick blogging? I admit that =
some of what we've linked to is nothing more than glorified bathroom humor,=
 but nonetheless if the context creates the content for this type of work a=
s a form of dissent, I think that should be discussed, even celebrated. I h=
aven't read too much about this yet. Thinking of Circulars as the "non-site=
" of the bombing itself is both depressing and provocative: it's no secret =
that one of the phenomena of this war was not the unexpected visibility of =
CNN, but Salam Pax's Dear Raed blog, written by a gay man from the heart of=
 Baghdad (even now he is remaining anonymous because of his sexuality). I c=
ould see Circulars as a "poetics" but I prefer to think it as an action <i>=
with</i> a poetics, my own tendency being to think of poetry as the war sid=
e of the Clausewitz equation, simply because poetics seems closer to diplom=
acy than a poem.

<I>DWL:</I> The variability and heteroegeneity of the site, was, I think, p=
artly due to the infrastructural and technological decisions that you made =
when putting the site together, because those decisions mesh well with the =
notion of coalition politics (I=E2=80=99m thinking of Donna Haraway=E2=80=
=99s formulation here). The presence of a number of posting contributors wi=
th varied interests, the ability of readers to post comments, the existence=
 of an RSS (Rich Site Summary) feed which allowed anyone running a wide var=
iety of web software packages to syndicate the headlines, a searchable arch=
ive, a regular email bulletin=E2=80=94these are crucial elements in any att=
empt to concentrate attention on the web. Too seldom do writers (even those=
 avowedly interested in collaboration and coalition politics) take the effe=
ct of the technologies that they=E2=80=99re using into account, but they ma=
ke an enormous difference to the final product. Compare Circulars to Ron Si=
lliman=E2=80=99s Blog: on the one hand, you have an deliberately short-term=
 project with a explicit focus, built around a coalition of writers on a te=
chnological and political platform that assumes and enables dialogue and di=
ssent from the outset; on the other hand, an obdurate monolith that present=
s no immediate and obvious means of response, organized around a proper nam=
e. Sure, the sites have different goals, but Silliman=E2=80=99s site intere=
sts me because it seems to eschew all of the tools that would allow any wri=
ter to utilize the unique aspects of the web as an environment for writing.=
 And sadly, that=E2=80=99s typical of many of the writers=E2=80=99 blogs th=
at exist.

<I>BKS:</I> I haven=E2=80=99t been too bothered with those aspects of Silli=
man=E2=80=99s Blog for the mere fact that it would double his time having t=
o respond to the comments, many of which could be vicious flames. I=E2=80=
=99ve deleted some of the comments on Circulars, in one case because the po=
ster was making scandalous allegations (drugs, child molestation) about the=
 head of an advertising agency, and another because the poster, in American=
 <i>fatwa</i>-esque fashion, deemed that I should have a rocket shoved up m=
y ass. Of course, your point is well taken=E2=80=94Silliman=E2=80=99s Blog =
could use some real-time play-by-play; I=E2=80=99m sure a diagnostic essay =
is forthcoming. I did set Circulars up with the intention of there being su=
bsets of discussion on the site, separate groups of people who would engage=
 with each other over some time=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Ccommittees=E2=80=9D of sor=
ts, with their own story threads. This happened for a brief period=E2=80=94=
there was a lot of heat generated by one of Senator Byrd=E2=80=99s speeches=
 against the war, and there was a discussion about Barrett Watten=E2=80=99s=
 =E2=80=9CWar =3D Language.=E2=80=9D I was prepared to develop new sections=
 of the site if anyone so requested, though I confess to being dictatorial =
about the initial set-up, basically because I know more about the web than =
most poets and I hate bureaucracy. I was hoping that some of the more frequ=
ent poet bloggers who were writing political material would send their more=
 considered material for posting to Circulars, but most simply posted to th=
eir own blogs without telling me.

<I>DWL:</I> I=E2=80=99m not suggesting that blogs and newsforums should be =
about the abrogation of editorial control=E2=80=94far from it. It=E2=80=99s=
 always necessary to do a certain amount of moderation and housecleaning, w=
hich, as you well know, takes assloads of time. During its peak, I was spen=
ding at least 2 or 3 hours a day working on Circulars, and I=E2=80=99m sure=
 you put in even more time than that, even with the help of the other indus=
trious people who were writing for the site. Which takes me back to the val=
ue of the coalition model: a decent weblog NEEDS multiple authors to work e=
ven in the short term. The classic example of a successful weblog is Boing =
Boing <www.boingboing.net/>, a geek news site that evolved from a magazine =
and accompanying forum on the WELL in the late 80s/early 90s. Mark Frauenfe=
lder, the original editor, has worked with many excellent people over the y=
ears, but the current group (including Canadian SF writer/ Electronic Front=
ier Foundation activist Cory Doctorow, writer/video director David Pescovit=
z and media writer/conference manager Xeni Jardin) presents a combination o=
f individual talent and a shared vision. There=E2=80=99s nothing *wrong* wi=
th personal weblogs, but, like reality TV, they get awfully thin over time.=
 Even when the current search technologies adapt to spider the extra text t=
hat blogging has created, the problem of anemic content isn=E2=80=99t going=
 to go away unless we start doing more collective writing online. The probl=
em is partly a need for education; most writers are still in the process of=
 learning how to use the web to best advantage.

<I>BKS:</I> I'm not sure that it's necessary for a blog to be multi-authore=
d; what it really needs is a mandate, and it's possible that, were the mand=
ate simply to produce rich, incantatory prose -- imagine the Marcel Proust =
blog -- a highly disciplined approach could work. Steve Perry's Bushwarsblo=
g, for example, succeeds quite well on this level (not the Proustian but th=
e muckraker), as does Tom Mantrullo's Swiftian Commonplaces. Both of them h=
ave "political" agendas, but they are also well-written and thoughtful for =
what are in effect news publications without an editor. It helps that these=
 two are journalists and conceptualize their blogs as a distinct form of ne=
ws writing alternative to the mainstream -- the individual voice is sharpen=
ed by an informed sense of the social arena in which it will resonate (in w=
hich the message will ultimately become dulled). Just today, Tom posted a l=
ink to the Times story on corporate blogging=E2=80=94yecch -- and has coine=
d this aphorism, a detournement from Foucault though sounding somewhat Capt=
ain Kirkish to me, to describe his project: "To blog is to undertake to blo=
g something different from what one blogged before." A version of "make it =
new" but with the formal precedent being the blog itself -- a vow not to le=
t individual "multi-authoring" become equal to corporate mono-glut. Perhaps=
 the model blog is that which responds to the formal issues of other blogs =
as if they were social issues (i.e. beyond one's "community"), hence transf=
orming the techne of the writer into a handling of hypertextual craft.

<I>DWL:</I> It=E2=80=99s all to easy too imagine the Marcel Proust blog=E2=
=80=94Christ, what a nightmare (shades of Monty Python: =E2=80=9CProust in =
his first post wrote about, wrote about =E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D). Endless stream=
s of novelistic prose, no matter how incantatory, are *not* what I want to =
read online. William Gibson, for one, thinks there=E2=80=99s something inim=
ical about blogging to the process of novel-writing. I think that the parag=
raph-as-=E2=80=9Cpost=E2=80=9D is the optimal unit of online composition, a=
nd that an optimal online style would be some sort of hybrid of prose poetr=
y and healthy geek cynicism (imagine a Slashdot <slashdot.org> full of Jeff=
 Derksens). But I think I see your point, that it=E2=80=99s possible for on=
e writer to produce the kind of dialogic multiplicity that could sustain a =
blog. There is, however, a large difference between =E2=80=9Cpossible=E2=80=
=9D and =E2=80=9Clikely.=E2=80=9D IMO, as less stratospheric talents than t=
he geniuses of high modernism, we stand a better chance of generating stron=
g content collectively. Another model that I find promising is the Haddock =
Directory <www.haddock.org> -- a site I=E2=80=99ve been reading daily for a=
t least 4 years. Haddock has recently moved to a two-column format: standar=
d blog description-plus-link on the left (maintained by the site=E2=80=99s =
owner and editor-in-chief, if you will) and entries from the Haddock commun=
ity blogs, identified by author, on the right. It=E2=80=99s a very neat exa=
mple of the effective aggregation of data within a particular interest grou=
p. And it seems to follow Stein=E2=80=99s dicta =E2=80=9CI write for myself=
 and for strangers.=E2=80=9D

<I>BKS:</I> I=E2=80=99m still curious about the line =E2=80=9Cgenerating st=
rong content=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94what do you mean by =E2=80=9Ccontent=E2=80=9D=
? My guess is not =E2=80=9Cwriting=E2=80=9D as we know it, but some admixtu=
re of links, intro paragraphs, pictures, HTML formatting, that creates a dy=
namic, engaging, and timely space on the screen. =E2=80=9CContent=E2=80=9D =
moves from =E2=80=9Cwriting=E2=80=9D to the shape one creates by selectivel=
y linking to other sites, serving, but also provoking, a =E2=80=9Cparticula=
r interest group.=E2=80=9D (I wrote earlier today in a dispute over blogs: =
=E2=80=9CCirculars was a short-term effort (or as short-term as the war) th=
at was a response to what I sensed was, or would be (or hoped to be) a mome=
nt of crisis in terms of American self-identification.=E2=80=9D Who would h=
ave thought, ten years ago, that a group of weblinks and writing could cont=
ribute to a crisis in national identity?) Most writers would probably feel =
demeaned to be referred to as =E2=80=9Ccontent managers,=E2=80=9D as if all=
 writing were a versioning of some other writing (put it back in your pants=
, Harold), but, frankly, we=E2=80=99re admitting for a whole lot of plagiar=
ism in this concept of =E2=80=9Ccontent.=E2=80=9D I think the blog-ring mod=
el on haddock.org is strong, since it lets writers tend their gardens, deri=
ving whatever classic satisfactions one gets from writing, and yet contribu=
te unwittingly to a larger collective. I agree: some =E2=80=9Ctypes=E2=80=
=9D of writing just <i>work</i> better online=E2=80=94claustrophobic syntax=
, also non-sequiturs, drives readers back to hunt for hearty prose (though =
writers like Hitchens seem to be as uncompromisingly belle-lettristic on sc=
reen as on paper).

<I>DWL:</I> I like to think of myself as a <i>mal</i>content provider. As s=
omeone who works regularly with found text, copping to the =E2=80=9Cplagiar=
ism=E2=80=9D that=E2=80=99s at the heart of all =E2=80=9Coriginal=E2=80=9D =
writing doesn=E2=80=99t worry me at all; in fact, I=E2=80=99m beginning to =
think it=E2=80=99s a necessary strategic position for artists at this parti=
cular moment in history. As thinkers like Siva Vaidyanathan and Lawrence Le=
ssig have been arguing strenuously for the last few years, the concept of i=
ntellectual property is a relatively recent, regressive invention that has =
nothing to do with the reasons that copyright was established two hundred y=
ears ago, and that it actually reverses copyright=E2=80=99s original functi=
on =E2=80=93 to provide a <i>short-term</i> monopoly solely to drive innova=
tive thought, not to create perpetual profit. Artists in many disciplines a=
re increasingly moving toward creative processes based on appropriation, sa=
mpling, bricolage, citation and hyperlinking, but the multinationals and th=
e entertainment industries are driving legislation in the exact opposite di=
rection by arguing that ideas can and should be owned. Artists and writers =
who have a large investment in their own =E2=80=9Coriginality=E2=80=9D do u=
s all a serious disservice by refusing to recognize and protect the public =
domain =E2=80=A6 the very thing that makes ongoing artistic activity possib=
le. So by all means, yes, don=E2=80=99t just =E2=80=9Cwrite=E2=80=9D (a ver=
b which in many cases bears the superciliousness of the Romantic), build (m=
al)content. Bring on the hyperlinks, intro paragraphs, pictures, PHP script=
s and HTML formatting, especially if they help to demonstrate the mutual in=
debtedness that all creativity entails. Use Your Allusion.

<I>BKS:</I> Copyright laws may never expire fast enough for internet plagia=
rizers who want appropriation <i>now</i>, but I haven=E2=80=99t heard anyth=
ing recently about the Edison company suing Napster, nor did the estate of =
George Meredith go after David Bowie for stealing =E2=80=9CModern Love.=E2=
=80=9D Unfortunately, for poets it hardly matters=E2=80=94if there were a P=
2P system for trading poems, we=E2=80=99d love it, and so poetry may be not=
 a rich ground for recruitment in this battle. No one cared about the Vanei=
gem series until the Times cease-and-desist letter came in (Vaneigem <i>sti=
ll</i> doesn=E2=80=99t care); it=E2=80=99s the reverse of that Benny Hill r=
outine in which a pervert=E2=80=99s trying to look up a lady=E2=80=99s skir=
t=E2=80=94once she takes it off and stands there in a bikini, he loses inte=
rest. Poets are already in the public domain=E2=80=94we=E2=80=99re flounder=
ing there, certainly not unwittingly, but nobody asks permission to steal t=
heir turns-of-phrase, their new sentences and rhetorical ticks, or any ling=
uistic innovation. As for creative products geared toward highlighting how =
indebted creativity is to reworkings of other cultural products=E2=80=94I l=
ike them, of course, but didn=E2=80=99t this trend already pass, along with=
 Verfremdung effects in theater=E2=80=94 placards, talking to the audience,=
 sweating on them? Kenny=E2=80=99s Day is an exception, but it took him 836=
 pages to be one. I welcome the challenge of working with language apart fr=
om appropriation, I suppose because, on the web, I=E2=80=99m all about appr=
opriation=E2=80=94The Truth Interview, Circulars, etc.=E2=80=94and non-appr=
opriative stuff=E2=80=94programming Flash, =E2=80=9Cwriting=E2=80=9D poems=
=E2=80=94seems fresh again. Ah, the dialectic!

<I>DWL:</I> If we treat creative products geared toward highlighting how in=
debted creativity is to reworkings of other cultural products as a trend th=
at=E2=80=99s had its time, we=E2=80=99ll get precisely the culture we deser=
ve =E2=80=93 i.e. one with no public domain (with the Supreme Court=E2=80=
=99s rejection of the Eldred appeal of the Sonny Bobno Copyright Extension =
Act and Mexico considering extending copyright to life-plus 100 years <i>an=
d</i> allowing the government to collect royalties on works in the public d=
omain, we=E2=80=99re that much closer to a continent-wide lockdown). And wh=
ile I agree in spirit with the notion that poetry=E2=80=99s value is arbitr=
ary (which, for the most part, means it=E2=80=99s valueless), as someone wh=
o ran a press for five years, I know all too well that (a) poets are as cap=
able of getting all pissy about contracts as any other kind of writer and (=
b) that no business is too small to receive a cease-and-desist letter from =
a multinational hell-bent on maxing out the value of its intellectual prope=
rty holdings. Besides, with Circulars, I thought that the project wasn=E2=
=80=99t poetry <i>qua</i> poetry as much as it was expanding an innovative =
poetic sensibility outward into policy and politics =E2=80=A6 which means, =
in my mind at least, championing the values of an open relationship to cont=
ent. As writers, we need to have the freedom not only to repost and reconte=
xtualize the news of the moment, but also to deconstruct, d=C3=A9tourne and=
 all of those other French verbs that start with D, without a constant fear=
 of litigation.

<I>BKS:</I> Circulars was indeed intent, on the most abstract level, on =E2=
=80=9Cexpanding an innovative poetic sensibility outward into policy and po=
litics,=E2=80=9D but <i>not</i> to argue <i>for</i> that sensibility. I agr=
ee that a liberated public domain is necessary to maintain the type of free=
-wheeling, free-<i>borrowing</i> public discourse necessary in a heteroglot=
 =E2=80=9Cdemocracy=E2=80=9D but, alas, the point of the site was to upset =
a government and exploit any means necessary in creating the sort of fervor=
 one might associate with a =E2=80=9Crevolutionary=E2=80=9D culture. Approp=
riation was one suprisingly popular means. Tom Raworth=E2=80=99s poem =E2=
=80=9CListen Up,=E2=80=9D written in the voice of a bigoted warmonger in ti=
ght couplets and submitted as a joke to the =E2=80=9CPoets For the War=E2=
=80=9D website, was another (and stronger for being <i>sui generis</i>). I =
<i>do</i> think the torrent of =E2=80=9Cremixes=E2=80=9D and detournements =
that ensued leading up to the war put centerstage a seething but as yet und=
erground counterculture that shares many of your (and my) views on =E2=80=
=9Cproperty=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 that could go somewhere. This is a generatio=
n of people who are on the other side of the paradigm shift regarding cultu=
ral property =E2=80=93 that and other values could be the seed of a new, bu=
t as yet themeless, sensibility. My hope with Circulars was to illustrate t=
he potential power of such sites in times of crisis as provocative, popular=
 cultural tools, and to put our =E2=80=9Cavant-garde=E2=80=9D poetics to th=
e service of a specific cultural effort, <i>not</i> to refresh arguments fo=
r classic avant-garde gestures themselves. But, of course, intentions are n=
either here nor there.

<I>DWL:</I> Okay, time to boat this bass. I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99=
s possible to separate advancing an argument from at least the implicit sup=
port for the underlying sensibility =E2=80=93 otherwise, you have no credib=
ility. If the arguments you make succeed to some extent in supporting the c=
ultural effort in question, then there is still some point in proceeding to=
 operate from that underlying sensibility, because you=E2=80=99ve demonstra=
ted its efficacity. Circulars was a beautiful thing because, within the man=
date it established for itself, it worked =E2=80=A6 but part of the reason =
that it worked is that there=E2=80=99s something useful in the fusion of in=
novative poetics, geek culture and a transnational left/oppositional politi=
cs. That=E2=80=99s a more quiet stance than revolution, but I=E2=80=99m not=
 a revolutionary, just a frustrated idealist with a talent for synthesis. A=
s we continue to glue new fins and antennas to our weird little poetic cybe=
rspaceship, I can=E2=80=99t help but feel that the underlying sense of the =
mission continues to evolve. I mean, I=E2=80=99ll use some of the technique=
s that the historic avant garde has to offer, but am not interested in many=
 of its values (opacity, for instance) and am skeptical of the potential fo=
r revolution. That doesn=E2=80=99t mean that I won=E2=80=99t try to cruft t=
ogether a more amenable space (for and with anyone who=E2=80=99s interested=
 in being involved) in the interstices of late capitalism with whatever too=
ls and materials are available. Right now, that means, among other things, =
websites, weblogs, mailing lists and whatever else we find along the way.

French pianist ends career with a splash

Agence France-Presse - 28 July 2003

A French concert pianist ended his career Friday by hiring a helicopter
to drop a worn-out piano into a lake in the south of the country.=20

Fran=E7ois-Ren=E9 Duchable played Beethoven's Third piano concerto and
Saint-Sa=EBns' Second to an audience of 2,000 before the instrument was
consigned to the depths of the lake of la Colmiane near Nice in
southeast France.=20

He said he was retiring at the age of 51 to "change his life", far from
tours with a perpetual eye on the time. The gesture, he said, was to
show that everything was over, to get rid of the weight of a career.=20

"It was a purification by water," he said.=20

Purification by fire follows on August 31 at the Proven=E7al village of
Mazauges. Duchable will play at a festival whose organizers have been
"friends since 1984" and will end the evening by burning the clothes he
performed in.=20

"I leave with a real exaltation, a great freedom for what will follow,"
he declared as he prepared to bury the stage-life once and for all.=20

Duchable sees himself as a "man of nature" and never liked his life as a
concert pianist, or the world of music, let alone the public that came
to hear him.=20

"How could I like one percent of the public since we know that 99
percent of people have no access to classical music? I cannot feel love
for a public that despises others. People think being a musician
reflects a passion. It doesn't. My profession has never brought me
happiness," he said.=20

"My love of music has never been in question. I reject money, the
tinsel, this rigid, dusty world, a whole system in which I have never
been at home."=20

Duchable said from now on he wants to "live a more personal, tranquil
existence, rediscover calm and solitude," to divide his time between his
beloved sport of cycling, pottery, about which he knows little or
nothing, and perhaps learning other musical instruments.=20

"I want to do much more interesting things than keep on doing for 30
years what I have been doing for the last 30."=20

"I have held on for 35 years," he said, recalling his first concert
given when he was 16.=20

If he does return to the keyboard, it will be in circumstances of his
own choosing and at his own rhythm, in hospitals, schools, prisons and
asylums.=20

The pianist said he might also cooperate with actors and sound and light
artists to offer another approach to classical music and plans to
conduct master classes in Switzerland and Paris.=20

I find this discussion/dialogue fascinating, both from having been a
Circular's contributor and a reader.
Without a real financial foundation, the process of hosting and maintaining
the site clearly created a mounting editorial  "exhaustion integer." One
that may be compared to the "mimeograph revolution" of the mid-sixties - re
the Detroit based Writers Workshop mag "Work", and new jazz review,
"Change", or David Sandberg's "Or" magazine that emerged from the early day=
s
of the Haight. All of which were composed within and on top of initial majo=
r
historical vortexes and conflagrations - Viet Nam, Civil Rights, Drugs, new
musics, New York, Beat and Black Mountain rushes in the culture.

What concerns me here is what seems a premature and laying to critical rest
of Circulars - particularly it's spirt and what it brought to its virtual
community. Personally I think we have just gone through a little "limbo
exhaust" moment which is rapidly moving back into another gear/level. If th=
e
first level was Opposition against the War, it seems the next level will be
Purgatory, as in "political purgation."   Current Progress is that now all
the Democratic candidates have picked up on the anti-war energy and
obviously smell impending blood. Even poor Lieberman is now saying that eve=
n
though he still thinks it's a "Just War", that it's time for GW to hang
somebody out to dry for the WMD lies!

However, my sense is things are back to picking up on a deep public level -
a putting together of deficits, economic malaise,etc. - that any tax cut,
for example, is just a shifting of money  to help your employer pay for
impossibly expensive healthcare - if you even have it.  In short people are
beginning to call the lie and hypocrisy on "faith based" jingo economics,
war mongering, etc. etc.   All of which is to say, if not Circulars, that I
hope another site will emerge, or a synergy of blogs in which poets and
artists can continue to ignite each other in argument, vision and support
for efforts to take the knife (read TOW Missile) out of the Coup Junta.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I wonder if cultural forms can or should remain pure as they leap from culture
to culture.  Why should they remain pure?  Is purity really possible?  Even in
the game of children when you pass a phrase around a circle from ear to ear the
phrase changes.  This is part of what's fascinating to me.  A form that doesn't
change is somehow dead.  Everybody ought to be able to add something that
strikes them as necessary to the form, or to the content.  And we all must read
through our own lenses, no?  It's very interesting to hear about the way the
ghazal is practiced in its origins, though.  I enjoyed it immensely, and yet at
the same time am all for postmodern mongrelism of any and every kind, as I find
it fun.  Now that everybody is in evrybody's fac euntil the end of time (no more
separate cultures) we are going to get all kinds of bizarre mixes.  I think the
only way to stop it is to say that nobody can touch the ghazal form at all
except orthodox practitioners from certain countries and that would be to kill
the form rather than introduce it to the west, as all the attitudes and byways
of these other cultures are not ours, and we can never really get inside those
other cultures any more than we can attain perfect French accents when we come
from places like Clear Lake, Iowa (my birthplace).

It really has to be a conversation in which no one has the upper hand, but
everyone has an opinion, but everyone's opinions have to be susceptible to
change, on every side.  Otherwise, it wouldn't be a conversation, and no
friendliness could come of it.

WTO UPDATE from Montreal - Arbitrary Mass Arrests / 17 Maritimers arrested
Criminalization of Dissent --> Right to Protest Removed

Monday, July 28, 2003

MONTREAL - At least 17 people who travelled from the Maritimes have been
(or are presently being) arrested (as of noon EST) at protests against the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Mini-ministerial in Montreal.

About 100-200 people have been surrounded by police and are being
photographed and put onto busses. Reports indicate that people were
peacefully assembled, with permission, on private property at the time of
their surrounding.

According to CBC radio, arrestees are being charged with participating in
an illegal demonstration. Another report said "participation in a riot". It
is likely that the actual charge is "unlawful assembly."

This morning two Maritime "Street Medics" were targeted by police "snatch
squads."
"Street Medics" role at the protest is to give basic first aid to injured
protesters and bystanders (usually as a result of police violence and/or
chemical weapons). Unfortunately, police sometimes target "Street Medics",
despite the fact that their role is strictly legal. Some suggest that
police target Street Medics because police chemical weapons and police
violence become more effective when there are less street medics.

Organizer Jaggi Singh was also arrested (surprise, surprise). The police
love him. That's what you get for being an organizer and taking
'disruptive' actions such as talking into a megaphone. Funny, he never gets
convicted of anything.

Island resident and organizer Aaron Koleszar says "People don't need to
have done anything wrong or illegal to be arrested by police. Mass arrests
are frequently used (especially in Montreal) as a means to get people off
the street, with additional effects of documenting their names, photos,
etc, intimidating protesters, and others who might join protests, arbitrary
punishment of protesters through the arrest, jail, court, legal costs,
costs of returning to court, time and effort of returning to court, and so
on. Some call it a tax on activism." Koleszar knows of these costs first
hand. He stayed at home due to court conditions that removed his
constitutional rights to travel and attend public demonstrations

Some of the busses with arrestees were reportedly rocking back and forth.
Even after being arrested, people are still expressing resistance to the
unlawful and arbitrary arrests, and to the immoral and arbitrary actions of
the WTO.

As far as we know, there are no notable injuries and people are more or
less safe (considering the circumstances).

Arrestees names are not being made public unless / until they give their
permission.
If you are seeking information on a particular individual, contact Aaron
Koleszar <aaronk@isn.net>
902-659-2575.

** EMERGENCY APPEAL for Financial Support (for arrested Maritimers)
Organizers are appealing to the public for financial support for arrestees.
The arrested Maritimers will likely need money for bail and possibly for
travel home, depending on when they are released, and when the bus returns.
Those wishing to help should contact Aaron Koleszar <aaronk@isn.net>
902-659-2575

Many thanks to all those arrested, for risking and sacrificing their
freedom to expose and oppose the real criminals - the people behind the
immoral and unjust policies of the WTO, and their minions.

I haven't seen the post this one is responding to, but
had to jump in.

There are zillions of great English haiku but the only
one I can think of offhand because it's only one word
is Cor Van den Heuvel's "tundra"--in the middle of an
otherwise blank page.  Two images, tundra and blank
page, working off each other.  Even a season word.
Great because unexpected (when composed)--and,
needless to say, succinct.  And dealing with large
things: silence, emptiness, nothingness . . .

Here are two by Robert Spiess, picked almost at random
for THE HAIKU ANTHOLOGY:

A light river wind;
on the crannied cliff
hang harebell and fern

Muttering thunder . . .
the bottom of the river
scattered with clams

Both, to start with, are pretty pictures, which I
consider a big plus for any poem.  The first seems
superior to me for comparing in a subtle way the
effect of the light wind on the delicate harebell and
fern with the long-term crannying effect of the river;
two kinds of rivers. . . .  And the wind on top of the
river as the harebell and fern are on the surface of
the cliff.  And the near permanence of the cliff
versus the transience of the wind, and river versus
plants.  Something of the precariousness of not only
life (the harebell and fern just hanging) but of
existence (the cliff crannying away).  The different
weights of the two movements of wind and river.

In the second we also get two contrasted/harmonized
images.  The main magic for me inheres in the serenity
of the clams.  But I also like their being muffled, so
to speak, in water, as the thunder is in the distance.
 Note, too, the spring to full-dimensionality of the
poem from river-bottom to distant sky, and the sizes
of the activities going on in both.  And the
transcience of the one versus to durability of the
second (life, this time, not seeming precarious, but
unstoppable).

I have GOT to get out my "Scots Haiku" book (I disremember the author's name) --
as, for some incredibly bizarre linguistic reason, 5-7-5 haiku turn out to work
fabulously well in Scots. Film at 11. (The Robert Burns stuff, I mean, not
Scottish Gaelic.)

Kazim Ali:
I have been a fan of the ghazal off and on over the years. At the moment I'm
a little off--and it may be for some of the reasons you have spelled out on
the list serve recently.
My understanding of the ghazal changed drastically after encountering Shahid
Ali's RAVISHING DISUNITIES. In some ways it also made me less excited about
the form however. Why? Well, how are these poems "disunities"? Couplets in
ghazals written recently are often not distinct from one another. They can
not stand on their own. In fact these ghazals are often oppressively
unified. Where is the surprise? Shahid himself calls for a surprise--in
every couplet actually: "One must have a sense that line 2 is amplifying
line 1, turning things around, surprising us."
Also, the "feeling" or associations seem forced. What I loved about the
ghazal form initially was this sense of trying to force vast, complex
emotions into these tiny couplets. A little like trying to get the tent back
in the packaging... The ability to spring from thought to thought: how far
can you stretch the notion of "spring" "weather" "wood" and still remain
unified? This is exciting.
The biggest difference between what I understood the ghazal to be prior to
Shahid (whose own ghazals illustrate the best of what he is striving for by
the way) is this repeating end word. The repitition makes the whole
enterprise much more challenging, and often for me, the results are much
less satisfying. Okay, I'll admit it, I often find them damn well
irritating.

Best,
Sina

FYI:
Spring games, my own attempt at a Shahid inspired ghazal appears in Todd
Swift's Times New Roman. http://www.nthposition.com/TNR_screen.pdf

My first collection of poetry, SLIP
http://www.ecwpress.com/books/slip.htm
has its share of failed ghazals.

I happen to be working on a book of haiku with Jungian psychiatrist David H.
Rosen, the working title for which is "The Healing Spirit of Haiku." It will
be illustrated by Arthur Okamura.
 However, what I'd like to recommend are haiku by Jack Kerouac. There's a
collection out, and some of his haiku are splendid.

6.

F.W. Murnau pulled himself up, rubbing the plague in
sleepy granules from his eyes. As he did this,
boulders rolled by, as if suspended in a current;
somewhere at some point in his peripheral vision they
dipped beyond the mess of his perception . The
pavement was carpeted with blunt teeth of glass. He
smiled; he knew he was smiling emptily.

Jean Cocteau, he thought; was it inappropriate to
think of Jean after last night? He'd stood in a field,
after reading too many emails about poetry and parks;
on one side, some sort of company dispatched its
trucks for the night; on one side, the irrevocable
back lot of a shopping center unrolled beneath a pink
sky that murmured about distance , murmured and
followed The Death of Love, already distraught-thin
and stumbling vacantly, across the sick punches his
shoes shot into the newly-rained-on grass. On one
side, sleep fell like windows of a house across the
nihil fragrance of tobacco interlaced with his shirt.
And he didn't--or, more appropriately, couldn't--care:
the blitzed starvation in that broken smile The Death
of Love wore had already leached him of everything
he'd known as human.

So F.W. Murnau tried to think of the inhuman. Almost
by reflex he thought first of the computer; the
inarticulate stutter of pages and pictures building
up, loading. The safety of binary, of hexadecimal, of
instruction code and logic and mathematics and
everything a man had to translate to touch. Every act
presupposed another; in the computer, mediation upon
mediation built up a skin that, because of its
density, was highly polished. And yet, lying face up
in that field, a dawn in gauze staining the overcast,
it seemed to F. W. Murnau to be a half-hearted effort.
To understand the computer, to occupy the space of the
computer, was nothing more to him than a man trapped
in a trick house of mirrors; the unfamiliarity of the
house turned out to be only himself, distorted by his
own hand.

Masturbation! It sickened him to stare into a mirror
all day. Jean was like that; Jean never seemed to
leave himself, no matter how many long walks in the
park they took together. The Death of Love, on the
other hand, was the exact opposite: F.W. Murnau
wondered sometimes if The Death of Love was ever
herself; she stared out the windows of the apartment
all morning long, blinking slowly, untouchable, with
all the exclusiveness of a pariah. If Jean Cocteau,
every time F.W. Murnau touched him, froze, heat
spitting around him, splitting the pores of the air,
The Death of Love, when similarly stimulated, would
only sigh.

He shrugged. He didn't see the point in much of
anything anymore. Most of the trucks had left for the
night. A tired-looking young man opened the back door
of the Save-a-lot; he tossed a greasy white trash bag
into the dumpster.

Th dawn birds had stopped singing.

Kirby,
Poetry, as I learned it, is a way of life. I mean, that in order to fulfill
the promise of being a poet it meant I had to be involved with social
issues, active politically, learn the languages of natural history, art,
sciences, you know, be able to look outside and see that cycad and know it
comes from Madagascar, and that the butterfly migrates, things like that,
how a bromeliad absorbs nutrients through its leaves, not a parasite but an
epiphyte, language sets vocabularies of different disciplines, music, verse,
chorus, bridge. I should try and learn wide and deep, projective verse and
geology, to investigate, not take information simply from pop culture, or
for that matter live all the time in a book, there's a life we live across
purposes and involvements, social responsibility, andall that jazz, it is
the way I understood the role of the poet exemplified by my heroes as I was
coming up as a kid during the 60's. It wasn't enough to get high or listen
to the radio. There was nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't enough. So
when it finally came to working in a nursery, that made absolute sense, that
was being a poet, knowing the world, building a greenhouse was building
poetry, and working in city government or with grassroots organizations,
that was all about knowing a place, a location, being a poet, adding that
perspective, the cultural perspective, a renaissance view, I guess, to the
mix of people gathered around a cause.  I believe this made a difference in
the way the CAUSE manifested itself in the mind of the community (SANGHA).
It was surpising for some people to see a POET able to sit down with a
developer and discuss development plans and fiscal concerns, or a POET meet
with the Chamber of Commerce and understand what business concerns are,
speak their  business language from the position of a businessman. But being
of many worlds, they got into the idea that I understood their worries, I
knew first hand where they were coming from, cause I owned my own business,
a tropical plant nursery.

So "galvanized". When I consider the environment, I don't see my work as
poetry as separate or different, in fact, it has always reminded me what I
am supposed to do. But it's not a prescription for everyone, how they should
be a poet. Hanging upside down from the mast of a tuna boat or dressing up
like the planet earth and standing on a street corner yelling rape, while
various people dressed like oil company executives prod you with drills, is
a perfectly valid public demonstration-- art, way to communicate, theater,
agit-prop, whatever it takes to continue to communicate THE ISSUE, bumper
stickers, it's all needed. Some do things better than others and none of it
is easy. But working with the government, knowing the way government runs,
developing the ability to work through the system, and sparking motivation
in oneself to run for office, this isn't something to leave up to someone
else all the time. It's essential people/poets do that too. And that poets
know how to speak to politicians, how the machine works on a daily basis.
How the law works. It's all got to be done. Poets are great at LANGUAGE, and
more than half the battle is mastering the vocabulary, language of the
government, institution, opposition, or science that is in question. It's
poetry as far as I understand it.

Hi Michael Rothenberg,

Ok, well this is quite different from how I thought of art growing up.  For
Lutherans, art is a matter of adiaphora, according to Luther.  That is, while
Calvinists think that bad art can cost you your soul, or with Catholics that it
is a good work, with Lutherans it's just something that doesn't really matter.
Luther didn't ban images in the church, as Calvin did, or as Muslims have done
(and I think Jews, too, if they follow the letter of the Old Testament
restrictions).  Luther said it was  a matter of the Christian's freedom.  He
never banned porn (he apparently liked it), and so you get this kind of
iconographic freedom in the northern Scandinavian Lutheran countries like Sweden
and Denmark as part of a long legacy.

The other side of this is that Lutherans don't take art very seriously.  It
doesn't have the high seriousness that you get in a lot of other traditions.

This idea that art takes in everything and is a kind of activism -- would this
be a Marxist approach to art?  I wouldn't call Gary Snyder a Marxist -- he's a
Buddhist.  Do Buddhists have a serious approach to icons?  What room is there
for free play?  You mentioned that art ought to be about issues, or that however
it approaches an issue, is ok.  Can art be lazy, blind, ridiculous, ambivalent,
and still be art in your book?

I guess you think it can, because you said that your own viewpoint doesn't
preclude others.  Can you give me an example of a poem that you think was
effective in a public policy debate regarding parks, and how you think it
influenced public policy?

Interesting posts from Kirby, and from Michael Rothenberg, too, who frames
"poet" as much more than a mere wordsmith and whose "work" includes the
non"literary."

Kirby writes this about Greenpeace below and I feel compelled to "share"
personal anecdote
"I have a friend who was like a Greenpeace 007 -- he'd climb up on
battleships in Portland (they would come up the Columbia) and he'd climb up
on them with webbed feet and drape a big banner across them in the middle of
the night saying Nuke Free, or something, but I feel that this sort of thing
irritates (as fun as it must have been) but doesn't really accomplish
anything concrete."
Well, I have certainly adored Greenpeace most of my adult, conscious life.
And participated in anti-nuke among other movements in the early eighties --
organized one of Sonomore Atomics "action groups" for civil disobedience
preparation and other activities with lover then, Eve Mezey, daughter of
"straight" poet Robert Mezey, who was not so "straight," really, obviously;
blockaded Livermore Labs; and went to jail (two weeks) same fellow blockader
Daniel Ellsberg in mass action that got a couple thousand or so of us
arrested, then "jailed"/housed in huge outdoor tent facility because the
county didn't have room.
Today (over 20 years later), have several thousand invested in a nuke energy
plant in the UK.  Still love Greenpeace but believe they may be wrong about
nuke energy (though surely not wrong about nuke weapons), which burns clean
and now, after all our carbon combustion polluting, may be necessary for
reducing carbon emissions and preserving "the Ozone."
Am I sure about my "investment" in the nuke plant?  No, of course not.  Oh,
France and Japan have been using nuke energy for decades, and there is some
news of late that a new development will enable getting rid of the spent
fuel and rendering it harmless, so maybe it's not "so bad," after all, but
YES, this is a difficult "contradiction" or "ambiguity" to "tolerate," and
of course I loathe the idea of "rationalizing it."  Do I know for sure my
"financial" investment is not a danger to others in this case?  No.  Yeah.
Yes, and No.  I don't know.  I kinda know.  I kinda know enough, certainly,
to understand my personal choice.
This note, then, because what I'd really like to be is a Peace 007 and
sabotage the militarists, yet I may have to call the Greenpeacers on issues
they may not "get" (while all along it may be me that doesn't get it), and
none of this is easy.  Am reading/re-reading Kierkegarrd, who sets the bar
even higher, though he was the son of a well-to-do father and got
opportunities to study under Hegel (alongside Engels, in fact), and how does
one trust forever these innumerable geniuses who come from priviledge, even
if they reject it.
Blah blah blah,
Joe Sickness Until Bush is Was   :)

Dear Kirby,

 I find your response pleasantly funny.

Of course , I insist that my viewpoint does not preclude others. How would
our friends and enemies know the difference between us if we were all
wearing the same cloth? the same poetic suit? and stuff...

I don't know about Jews and the strict letter of the law. I know that
there's an awful lot of imagery in kabbalah. And regards the depiction of
the deity, that might be The Psalms, but I don't think you were talking
about those poems.

I also know that Jews never agree on anything, so the story goes, either
that or they are all looking for a partner. If I'm coming out of that
tradition, lots of images, psalms, diversity of opinion, and a desperate
search for union, that sounds okay to me. Just as long as we TRY to get
along, as we stumble along.

"Can art be lazy, blind, ridiculous, ambivalent, and still be art in your
book?". You answered that question for me, and just as I would answer it.
Funny, my first take was that you were describing Philip Whalen, one of my
heroes. But that's only one way of looking at him. He was an incredibly hard
worker but some people thought he was lazy, he was blind, not entirely, but
nobody seemed to understand he had trouble seeing, ambivalent? well, there
was this problem he had about not wanting to be bothered and at the same
time not wanting to be left alone, and art, he was all art, a work of art.
He was criticized by many for not having been socially active, agit-prop or
propagandist enough. He wrote a poem, ON WHICH I RENOUNCE THE NOTION OF
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY:

                    "If nothing else we must submit ourselves
                    To the charitable impulses of our friends
                    Give them a crack at being bodhisattvas
                            (although their benevolence is a heavy weight on
my head
                            their good intentions an act of agression)'

I think Philip was just having a bad day. He was an idealist in many ways,
and if you go through his poetry you find tons of places where he attacks
the government, social, economic, and political systems, opposes war,
killing and the cruel and senseless destruction of nature. And the way I see
it, while he and his work may not have been a marching demonstation, he was
certainly very much actively alive, actively dying, and a convincing
demonstration of language as a great big moving heart and mind towards
concern in many worlds and universes at once.
.
The boddhisatva does try to help others on the way out of the wheel. And
there's what is called "engaged buddhism", which is not necessarily Marxist.
Naropa Institute offers an MA in Engaged Buddhism!

Poems that are "effective in a public policy debate regarding parks", well,
that's probably more difficult to get a hold of, to find.  In my own
experience there was a poem I mentioned already, TAKE. I read it at a
council meeting in Pacifica, while we were debating the fate of  Mori Point.
It appears in ecopoetics issue no. 2 and is on the net,
http://www.terrain.org/poetry/7/rothenberg.htm, I think it was "effective",
it didn't necessarily shape policy, but it made people a little bit more
aware and maybe motivated, like a gospel song, to reach a little further "in
the storehouse of love, eternal love" for what they believe in.

Michael

Hi Michael and Steve -- great ambivalent responses!  Just wanted to clear up the
Jewish injunction against the image.  It's in the first commandment given to
Moses:

"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing
that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the
water under the earth."  Exodus 29

For a long time I wondered if Language poetry wasn't a poetry that was in
response to this, as at least some of the practitioners are Jewish, even if
lapsed.  Charles Bernstein is Jewish (this is why he says he hates Pound
somewhere) and Susan Gervitz is Jewish (I went to Evergreen State College with
her), but I doubt if the group is exclusively Jewish.  And perhaps not against
images per se?

Luther rewrote the ten commandments after Christ and says that this one cited
above was bogus and didn't matter any longer (one of his closest friend was
Albrecht Durer, the painter).  Most people think it is just graven images that
are outlawed.  But if you look at the second, third, and fourth clauses, it
actually outlaws competing with God's creation through the making of ANY
likeness whatsoever.  Luther said it no longer mattered.  He was also against
the iconoclasts, who went around smashing religious images during the
Reformation.  He told his crowd to cut it out.

Calvin outlawed RELIGIOUS IMAGES, following this first commandment ot the
letter, and the Baptists do too.  Almost every denomination takes a different
stand on it. Baptists won't allow any images in their churches.  Presbyterians
have lightened up a bit or we wouldn't have Marianne Moore's poetry, but I'm not
sure which Presbyterian theologian(s) rewrote that commandment or how.  I just
love doctrine regarding images.

I don't think Marx anywhere said for instance that images had to correspond to a
political code.  This was codified under Stalin by his goofy general Zhdanov.
Interestingly, this set policy in the Soviet Union for about sixty years.  It's
a short and brilliant article which mostly seems to outlaw humor.  Social
Realism is somewhere int he title of the essay.  It's brilliant because it's so
clear.  Even people like Lukacs had to work with it, or go to jail.  But the
funny part is that I think that Marx meant art to be adiaphora -- I don't think
he wanted to strait-jacket it, but just to monitor it.  I don't think he thought
it would help the revolution at all.  He loved Shakespeare and knew many of the
plays by heart.

But somehow the Eastern Orthodox (Stalin was originally studying for the
ministry) got hold of Marxism, and well, the rest is history.  The Eastern
Orthodox are really serious about the control of images, but I have never had
time to dig up the history of their theology on iconomachy.

I have to stand with Jesse on this. Although I admire what Joel is
attempting I am not so fond of poetry as the panacea of problems, especially
English haiku. Tonka seems to be the best Japanese structure for the English
language rhythms of speech. Even though I like Kerouac's haiku, and others I
have come across -- I still haven't found anyone to write them with the same
passion as Basho. There is a wound philosophy that goes beyond the mere
counting of syllables -- as does Shakespeare with his iams.

Here is a neat website of international haiku

Of course I did not mean to imply that writers
shouldn't attempt forms within other cultural
traditions, only that there is a certain amount of
violence inherent in the act of lifting a form out of
its context or language.

Heightened I guess when it is a Western writer lifting
a form from a colony.

The various literary forms (including, I guess, prose
forms) developed and were shaped by historical and
political forces as much as linguistic forces.
Certainly the haiku form (to my knowledge) developed
after and partially as a reaction to the tanka
form--in its turn haiku spawned other hybrid forms
(haiga, haibun, etc--others know more: this is really
not my area of expertise);

As postmodern practitioners we *do* have this gift of
being able to dip into all the pots. It may or may not
behoove the poet to immerse himself in sensibility
before attempting the poem. Kerouac's haiku *are*
haiku aren't they? And not just little clipped poems?

It may be part of the probably to approach this stuff
"formally" and not from context of "content" (I might
be doubling back here): you would think of the
"characteristics" that inform haiku poetry: austerity,
concision, etc etc (I remember reading these: there
are seven of them...does anyone know?) as a better
starting point to teach the form rather than 5-7-5
that I learned in grade school.

That exercise has its purposes too I believe. Is
anyone on this list a teaching writer who uses haiku
as part of lessons with schoolkids? I would be
interested in hearing about that.

I don't know if there is "purity" or "authenticity"
anymore or just "alterity" but certainly that makes
our work as cross-cultural workers more--not
less--problematic and problematized.

We should add and change existing poetic forms and
develop our own, but this work is profoundly
profoundly political. Mongrelism or Mongrelisme? What
does it mean honestly to write the ghazal in English?

Shahid Ali's work is an excellent example: how he
(especially in "Country Without a Post Office" and
"Nostalgist") was able to capture the real *Urdu*
poetic spirit in the English language: it's really
breathtaking. But this is from a lifetime of living in
both languages.

We are in a different kind of world after all, as
Kirby says "No more separate cultures"

That's ominous to me. Not because of what it
represents but how and why it came to be.

The HSBC billboard at Broadway and Houston showing the
woman sitting in a yoga position blissed out because
she now has free checking.

When we work we work through that too.

I certainly do not mean to say that we ought not look
to other cultures for inspiration, guidance, and help.
Imagine the loss to our poetry had the haiku form
never been introduced to writers of English! The
introduction of the ghazal and (my fervent hope!)
Arabic prose and mixed-genre forms will do as much
good for it. But it's *why* we look over there for
inspiration, and *how* that is so important.

Great poets are few in any culture and any form. Do you actually think that
something inherent in a brief associative form engendered Basho? I'd like
to see the mechanism.

That said, I don't personally have a lot of use for prescriptive forms of
any origin.

By the time of Basho, haiku was already an old form, but one that was not
taken as "serious art." His genius was that he made it so.

I see the haiku as the practice of gathering in instead of spreading out the
prose I've come to love. It's just another way or working, one that happens
to feel right for certain engagements.

I've seen little really good haiku in English. It's a much more demanding
art than greets the eye. A good haiku makes the most of its few words with
layers of cultural and etymological allusions.

For those of you who are interested, Haruo Shirane's, "Traces of Dreams:
Landscape, Cultural Memory, and the Poetry of Basho" (Stanford University
Press, 1998) as a place to begin understanding this particular journey.

Heah, good to see the reassertion de Circulars - thought the exchange - on
which I commented - was a piece of 'obituary worship' - well, there's a
concept much practiced (e.g. Hope, Bob).
Thanks for putting up the Pentagon Futures Sale Strategy. That one  does -
or almost out does any of the Gothix. But maybe this is the phase we are
moving into - open faced Gov Gothix. One that started with cosmetic rehab -
scare the shit out of anyone - facials on the Hussein boys dead. I can't
even begin to imagine the next. It was nice to Sen Biden do a little S&M
with Wolfolitz in Committee today. Wasn't it Biden who had to disappear fro=
m
public ambition because of a plagiarism charge behind one of his speeches
back in the seventies or eighties? Now he gets to ring Wolf for lying to th=
e
American people.  Dark comedies invade from the wings. Who set the fires in
the FrenchsensualRiviera - the "Infidels" or the "Evangelicals"?

of similarity which transcends those superimposed and often super =

Hmm.. It's not really clear from this article how the brain will learn
anything about its environment by scribbling on paper 19,000 k/m's away.
It sounds more like an elaborate telephone call.

The assumption that "living brains in people and animals"  learn by
"adapting and expressing [themselves] through art" is quite a big one,
and shows that these scientists are abiding by a linear logic that is
hopefully in the process of being discredited. Aside from the fact that
they localize "learning' in a brain minus body (though there is the body
of the brain that doesn't seem to figure), don't we learn from art and
in art and (insert prepositions) art? "Through" is an awful
simplification.

Tom, any thoughts on this?

 Hello again,

 David Meltzer is my rabbi. In response to Exodus 29, David says:

                In the weird radical move of the Hebrews, the Divine becomes
                 unimaginable unknowable -- ineffable, i.e., beyond words or
images --

                 In a sense it has to do w/ the mystery of language, what
can
                 be known through language, what can not -- familiar turf
                 poetry/poetics & religious discourse confronts & explores
constantly --

                 Wieners says poets are "busy taking the breath away from
God" --

 So the discourse continues.

 Michael

<That exercise has its purposes too I believe. Is
anyone on this list a teaching writer who uses haiku
as part of lessons with schoolkids? I would be
interested in hearing about that.>

Not my own schoolkids, no, I'm not a school teacher. But when I visit my
wife's family in Kyushu, writing English Haiku with the nephews and
nieces has become a fun way of teaching them English and for them to
teach me Japanese (or about Japanese). They enjoy it because they can be
irreverent (their Japanese teachers teach 'lofty' poetry as gravely as
mine did) and play with a foreign language in an almost familiar form.
Of course, they think English haiku are too easy. I showed them some
Jack Kerouac haiku pulled at random from the internet; they were quite
surprised it could be so simple and that such simple language could be
used in a poem.

Kirby,

Some questions: What do you mean by purity in terms of "cultural forms" as
you put it?

How, then, can a pure form be dead if, say, its soul, shadow or ghost
lingers on in the body of a new or other form? Say, English poesy written to
reflect Latin verse structure?

I think Ali was trying to get at something about purity because if there is
purity then you have mongrelism (Ali used this word), right?
Certain Bedouin families attained "purity" by inbreeding, and you know what
that results in.

(Kenner writes on this subject in his The Counterfeiters (his example of
Creeley counterfeiting Coleridge's verse structure, and WCW counterfeiting
the effortlessness of writing a poem without the poet involved))

I agree with Ali, what you say about "no more separate cultures" is ominous,
very much so.

I hate to bring in politics to irk you Kirby (hey 'irk' is in your name,
Kirby), but take the ransacking of the museums in Iraq. I think that is
indicative of what you mean by not being able to really get inside another
culture, right? the impossibility of it?

Arabic culture is particularly impenetrable since an infidel can't fuck
their women. (Unless, of course, you are someone like T.E. Lawrence.)

(An expat bit of folklore I heard in the UAE when I first arrived was that
you don't touch their women unless you wanted your balls to be sent home in
a ziplock bag.)

Matt

Yes, I've seen tundra around and really don't see anything other than it
being one of many "one word" poems.  Sure the white of the page &c. &c., but
Aram Saroyan's play on the word oxygen strikes me as being far more clever.
And did you mention there being a season word?  Where would that be?  (I'm
working from digest here, so your text is not in front of me.) Spiess'
language has never excited me. One of the haiku you quote with its crannied
wall echoes Tennyson a little two much for my taste, and though the shells
in the last line of the second poem add to that nice picture, the thunder is
a tad tired.

Of course English language haiku writers will tell you that originality is
not so important, and will point to their books of translations to show you
the countless variations on radish poems, etc.--but what most of them don't
know is how brilliant Japanese language haiku can be and how it has to do
with the language itself--particularly the use of Kanji with its many
resonances--and the melding of sounds.  One does not have to be a Basho to
do this.  A native speaker's fluency and years of practice is enough to
attain it as evidenced by the thousands of good haiku published in Japan
every year.

If you can read Japanese then you'll see that most English language haiku is
like trying to stuff a bear's paw into a lady's silk glove.  Even the "good"
work is like that.

Lorine Niedecker is the only writer who comes close, I believe, to the
melding of which I speak with a few of her haiku-like poems.

Hear
where her snow-grave is
the You
                ah you
of mourning doves.

Interestingly enough, you won't find LN rmentioned in any of the official
histories of English Language haiku.

Of course, none of this will stop people from calling tiny poems in English
haiku, or prose-poems haibun, etc. etc.  In a rush (as always) Jess

To a Zen Buddhist, an image is an illusion, so let it be.

It seems to me that there's much more fuss than needed, everyone asserting
their ego into the fray. I'm not referring to this enjoyable discussion, but
theology. Isn't that what it's about? Or else, one would just get on with
their own spiritual life, instead of dictating to others. The
military/industrial/theological complex has been has been with us for
thousands of years. It's latest lap dog sits in the White House, munching on
pretzels and pretending to understand.

Yes.

Also, it was Basho's life that was exemplinary. A few students actually
follow his route north. Of course, the landscape has changed, and that
language evolves, makes the practice of haiku a continuous challange.

to a Zen Buddhist, a zen buddhist
is an illusion, I guess that includes the White House

theology, ideology, one's poetic aesthetic
(is that how you say that?) precluding someone elses'
sounds the same repression to me
but of course we still have our politics, religion and taste...

I kind of like it quietly
between the sheets, lights dimmed, and nobody
eavesdropping...

but then there's that damn leafblower
outside screwing up the palm fronds

THERE OUGHTA BE A LAW!

[Im sure Ive written many of what might be logged as "park" poems over
the year, but this lifelong project seems much more relevant.  mIEKAL]


The Driftless Grotto of West Lima

In the tiny unincorporated town of West Lima, Wisconsin, Xexoxial
Endarchy, Ltd. owns, among other propertieswhich serve as facilities
for "Dreamtime Village" & other projects, a one-acre lot in the center
of town which was historically the "town square." As a public art
project we have begun to design for this site The Driftless Grotto of
West Lima, a village park environment that will be part fantasmagorical
roadside attraction, picnic area, permaculture demonstration, sculpture
garden, & shrine to the Driftless Region. Special features of the
finished Grotto will include

1) A stone-pillared concrete & blue-glass bottle archway entrance;

2) Mosaiced fence around the perimeter of the square;

3) A vernacular futuristic tower housing a Jules Verne-style "time
machine" which will be operated by the movements of live birds inside a

I deleted too quickly but remember some things you
said about "tundra."  Yes, just one word, but done
before "mere" pwoermds were being much done, and still
one of the best ever done.  I would consider "tundra"
a season word.  The blank page is also, surely, a
season graphic.

I think you're just very immersed in Japanese haiku
(and culture) and so a tad biased--as I am about the
kind of minimalist English language poetry I've been
immersed for decades.

The same kind of case is made by the neoformalists for
their kind of stuff.  But all I know of Japanese haiku
are translations, and they were enough to get me into
haiku, but I think the haiku I quoted are in their
league.  And I didn't go into their sounds, including
that of "tundra."  (What Japanese haiku captures
silence better?  And not just silence but the absence
of words, at an edge of the world where words finally
are overtly useless. . . .)

I find that hard to believe since I can't imagine more
delicate works than many of the good English language
haiku I've seen are.  I would add that I would rather
produce a bear's paw than a lady's silk glove--but
understand that to be a case of to each his own.

But to me, this is just one more standard flowers are
alive on Ma's grave haiku, although pretty good for
its genre.

A Big Problem in American literary history is the
ghettoization of the haiku community--and its
ignorance of poets known for non-haiku who also
composed haiku.

I'll only note that I didn't mention the various
pluraesthetic poets who are combining graphics and
other expressive modes with words to make haiku that I
can't believe any Japanese have outdone.

Of course, this is a huge subject.  I don't feel I can
adequately defend English-language haiku in less than
a book, and I don't have time to write one for this
thread.

Stephen,

I thought the Futures Sales gimmick was a Gothic News Service release at
first.  As with variations on modest proposals, the world has gone far
beyond satire.

Nonetheless, the Futures market on terror and assassinations fits well
within the logic of the extremists who hold power now: the market is the
fount of all knowledge, so let's use the market for "intelligence" purposes.

Take care,

Hilton

Bush says he supports law that defines marriage as union between man
and woman

        Wednesday, July 30, 2003

national1127EDT0541.DTL

(07-30) 08:27 PDT WASHINGTON (AP) --

President Bush said Wednesday he has government lawyers working on a
law that would define marriage as a union between a woman and a man,
casting aside calls to legalize gay marriages.

"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman and I believe we ought
to codify that one way or the other and we have lawyers looking at the
best way to do that," the president said a wide-ranging news conference
at the White House Rose Garden.

Bush also urged, however, that America remain a "welcoming country" --
not polarized on the issue of homosexuality.

"I am mindful that we're all sinners and I caution those who may try to
take a speck out of the neighbor's eye when they got a log in their
own," the president said. "I think it is important for our society to
respect each individual, to welcome those with good hearts."

"On the other hand, that does not mean that someone like me needs to
compromise on the issue of marriage," he added.

Bush has long opposed gay marriage but as recently as earlier this
month had said that a constitutional ban on gay marriage proposed in
the House might not be needed despite a Supreme Court decision that
some conservatives think opens the door to legalizing same-sex
marriages.

The Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that made homosexual sex a
crime, overturning an earlier ruling that said states could punish
homosexuals for having sex.

Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia fired off a blistering dissent of
the ruling.

The "opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has
permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual
unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned," Scalia
wrote. The ruling specifically said that the court was not addressing
that issue, but Scalia warned, "Do not believe it."

Rep. Marilyn Musgrave, R-Colo., is the main sponsor of the proposal
offered May 21 to amend the Constitution. It was referred on June 25 to
the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution.

To be added to the Constitution, the proposal must be approved by
two-thirds of the House and the Senate and ratified by three-fourths of
the states.

Bush Casts Aside Calls to Legalize Gay Marriage

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  11:50 AM ET

President Bush said today he has government lawyers
working on a law that would define marriage as a
union between a woman and a banana.


Hal         "I judge a woman and a horse by the same
               criteria: legs, head, and rear end."

This sounds like fun - and labor intensive - mIEKAL. I hope I can some day
roll across the continent to the middle and visit. I must say when my
monitor abused eyes caught #7
 7) A bog garden of endemic carniverous pitcher plants
I read "blog" instead of "bog."  Which got me to thinking of what a virtual
"blog" garden would look like, or more, possibly, appropriate, a "blog
cemetary" - and whether or not there is a material counterpart that could
fit into a real garden.  Secretly I suspect most dead blogs are being shot
out into outer-space to live another life among inner-planetary folks who
are making research decisions about whether or not they really want to come
and colonize Earth and our various environs.
If so, I am sure your Grotto - blog or no blog - will be a prime attraction.
Don't forget to build a landing pad of, maybe, non-carniverous soft ferns.

Jesse: I think you're describing poetry in general. The problem if there is
one with haiku in English is that most people write them as a sort of
exercise. But the vast majority of Japanese haiku that I've seen (granted,
in translation) succeed in being no better than adequate, and I doubt that
there are thousands of good ones published every year--hell, there aren't
thousands of good poems published every year in the world at large. Unless
you're using the word "good" in a special way.

Or are you saying that "a native speaker's fluency and years of practice is
enough" all by itself to generate good short poems, but only if that
fluency is in Japanese? That would be a pretty extraordinary claim.

Oh, I just found the Reznikoff poem -- he says it better --

You have seen a bush beside the road
Whose leaves the passing beasts pluck at
And whose twigs are sometimes broken
By a wheel, and yet it flourishes
Because the roots are sound --
Such a heavy wheel is Rome;
These Romans,
All the legions of the East
From Egypt and Syria,
The islands of the sea and the rivers of Parthia,
Gathered here to trample down Jerusalem,
When they have become a legend
And Rome a fable,
That old men will tell of in the city's gate,
The tellers will be Jews and the speech Hebrew.
                 (by the Waters of Manhattan 34)

Matt, what I'm trying to say in the initial post is that culture is separate
from and more powerful than politics.  Politics has to do with outward forms of
power.  Art is something that moves the heart and spirit.

I have no idea what I meant by purity.  I think I was using the word mongrelism,
but then, you see, everything is all mixed up, and who cares finally, no?  We'll
all forget this conversation in a week.

But the principles will remain -- that which is most beautiful will survive.
Everything is going to go into the garbage.  My post will vanish, but
Reznikoff's poem will survive.

Gah, what follows are some poems I'd lo0ve (typo I
decieded to leave--and the extra letter is a zero, not
an O) to spend the next few months commenting on as
possible haiku or what I call naiku (nigh-ku), and
then a few months.

I can't.  Don't got the minutes.  But I do want to say
a little.  First o0ff, I think in serious discussions
of this sort, one needs (forgive the cliche) to define
one's terms.  No one, including the Japanese, will
agree on exactly what a haiku is.  So the serious
commentator must say what he thinks one is, and go
from there.  Those responding to him should then see
if what he's saying make sense according to his
definition AND (if wanting to) provide an opposing
definition, which can then be discussed.  I have a
brief definition in the recent issue of Modern Haiku
that I'm not going to quote for fear of having to
defend it and/or elaborate on it, etc.  The definition
is in an article on the taxonomy of contemporary haiku
that I now consider much too compressed and therefore
difficult to follow.  But it contains poems I consider
to be haiku and world-class, with reasons why I prize
them.  Now for a few comments on the following poems.

Most people would not take this as very haikuic
because it editorializes.  I believe, with most haiku
fans, that haiku should be pretty much pure imagery.
But I also believe that Williams's "Red Wheelbarrow"
is a terrific haiku--BECAUSE of its "so much depends
upon."

I like this whatever it's called, and I WOULD accept
it as a haiku.  The fastidious would not like its
having a title (and I do believe the title makes it
too long, and too explained).  The fastidious would
also not like its having a metaphor, but I believe all
the best haiku are mataphoric, and should be.

Two haiku there, but the first is too long for a
haiku, though just right for the equal non-haiku I
take it as (with lots of haiku-resonance).

The fastidious would call this too cerebral.  It works
fine as a haiku, for me.

This one is too straightforward for my kind of haiku.

I believe that to cock a snook is to thumb your nose; that is, to make that
gesture that allows someone else to see up your nose like a pig.  Usually an
expression of contempt.  I would have no idea where it comes from
lexicon-wise.

Though I applaud the technology, I find the implications troubling.  Why is
the result of this experiment in the production of "semi-living artists'"
"art" outside of a certain cheekiness on the part of the scientist that
created it?   Doesn't  any poet, musician, painter, see the veiled insult
here?  Why don't the computer scientists create a "semi-living computer
scientist" instead?

I would much rather see those robot arms fashioning a tiny computer chip out
of silica, or attempting to create an itsy-bitsy machine that would
replicate Dr. Steve Potter's hubris from 19,000 kilometres away.

Reminds me again of a passage by Carl Sagan in "Broca's Brain" in which he
talks about the c.c. paucity of Einstein's brain compared to Byron's oodles
in the old noodle.  "But then again," Sagan sniffed, "Byron was no
Einstein!"

I believe that to cock a snook is to thumb your nose; that is, to make that
gesture that allows someone else to see up your nose like a pig.  Usually an
expression of contempt.  I would have no idea where it comes from
lexicon-wise.

'Cocking a snoot' is not the same as 'cocking a snook', which I'm not
familiar with. But, 'cocking a snoot' is related to 'getting a snootfull',
which is related to what my Great Aunt Jess, the millinist (milliner?),
would call 'getting tanked up', isn't it?

strange events

yesterday on the bus to pennsylvania we stopped in a small town and a
woman on the bus said that a man had been threatening her and he
masturbated in front of her. we were immediately surrounded by four police
cars and asked to leave the bus. the man hid in the toilet but was
apprehended and removed. then the woman gave a deposition and we waited.
then we left and he was taken into custody and the police said he had just
'got out of court.'

about thirty miles down the road i was looking out the window and the road
dropped precipitously to a creek. there were five or six formally dressed
people standing in a row by the near side of the creek facing the highway.
they were looking up. i saw a man leap from a highway sign about seventy
feet above the creek. the sign was over dry ground. the man was fully
dressed and there was no safety net or bungee cord. as the bus was moving,
i did not see him hit the ground.

this morning in the small town my father lives in, there were four rare
hawks in the backyard. this was the first time hawks had ever come here. i
cannot identify them since they seem like broad-winged hawks but are much
larger with white feathers over the feet. four of them together was a rare
sight.

earlier we watched a group of wasps carry a group of paralyzed
caterpillars to their nests. later, there were fireflies all blinking in
unison, and i knew that the philadelphia species had come north.

around the same time, i photographed on the south mountain where the
anthracite mine fire has burned for one hundred and one years beneath the
surface. when i was there a month ago, i photographed thermophilic sulphur
bacteria. i was not sure whether they were bacteria or mineral deposits at
the time because they were colonizing around the hottest and apparently
deepest sulphur vents. but this time there were only slight mineral
deposits and the weather had been dry. this indicated that the
efflorescence was in fact bacteria, and most likely hyperthermophilic
archaea.

What Basho wrote me about the dust of Gautama


Dear Patrick,


Empty your mind and your hat will follow.  So please begin by transcribing
the following seventeen hats, and do hold onto your own hat for the
duration.  Only the hat will remain.  I'll explain later.


The Ten Hats of Buddhism

A Zen Buddhist is not a Zen Buddhist
but a person faking paradox
and a person faking paradox
is a fake Zen Buddhist paradox and
"A Zen Buddhist is not a Zen Buddhist"
is an attempt by a fake Zen Buddhist
to fake a fake Zen Buddhist paradox
and the fake attempt of a fake person
who is of course a person and yet empty,
not a person or even a Zen Buddhist at all.


The Four Noble Hats of Buddhism

Which is to say Zen Buddhism is fake
so to be a real Zen Buddhist (Listen up!  Kneel, slave!  Thwack!)
you must be fake at faking the forsaking of Zen Buddhism
and be a fake paradox or even a fake fake fake.


The Two Hats of Buddhism

Perhaps paradoxically, three fakes
do not negate each other when they do.


Buddha, The Enlightened Hat

They merely give nothing a cover.


Love,
Basho


PS  My final and perhaps only coherent recommendation is that you always
wear a hat.  It will help one of you to appear as if you are flying above
the dust in the wind, above the hatless masses.  I'm giving up on the cold
austerity shtick altogether and am heading to someplace warmer.  Look for me
there, where it's warm.  I'm the one in the hat.

Bush called 'President Shrub' in government memo

By GRAEME SMITH
From Thursday's Globe and Mail

Saskatchewan's government has tried everything to get the U.S.
border opened to its beef: pleading, cajoling and even threatening a ban
on foreign beef.

Now a researcher for the ruling New Democratic Party has resorted to
name-calling, in a memo that described U.S. President George W. Bush as
"Shrub."

Titled, "Re: petition to President Shrub," the bulletin on NDP caucus
letterhead was distributed this week to members of the legislature,
candidates for Saskatchewan's coming election and MPs in Ottawa. Media
outlets received the memo by mistake.

"We were just appalled," said Elwin Hermanson, leader of the opposition
Saskatchewan Party, who received the bulletin yesterday. "On the stupid
meter, this seems to go off the scale."

The memo encourages recipients to distribute copies of a petition that
Premier Lorne Calvert launched on Tuesday as a protest against the U.S.
beef ban. It explains the shrubbery reference as a "dismissive nickname
for President Bush."

The government distanced itself from the memo, promising a review of how
it got drafted and whether there should be disciplinary action against the
caucus staffer who wrote it.

"This does not reflect the views of the government of Saskatchewan," said
Eldon Lautermilch, minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and the
government's House leader. "The memo shows poor judgment, bad taste and is
totally unacceptable."

The government will continue gathering signatures for the petition, which
describes the "devastating impact" of the U.S. ban on Canadian beef since
the discovery May 20 of a cow in Alberta that carried bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad-cow disease. The petition reads, in part,
"President Bush, as your oldest ally, closest friend and largest trading
partner, we ask for simple fairness; we ask for an open border for
Canadian beef."

Mr. Lautermilch rejected the idea that insulting the U.S. President could
diminish the impact of the province's lobbying. He emphasized that the
person who wrote the letter, Ted Bowen, is a "junior staffer."

"It's not helpful. I mean, it's taking the focus off of what we need to
do, and what we need to do is make sure we get access to the American
market for Canadian beef. . . . But this would be much different if it was
an elected official or someone at a senior level. I think our American
friends will understand."

But John Wright, a senior vice-president at the Ipsos-Reid polling firm,
suggested that Americans might not have a great sense of humour after a
recent series of insults from prominent Canadians.

Françoise Ducros, a former aide to the Prime Minister, made international
headlines by calling Mr. Bush a "moron." Natural Resources Minister Herb
Dhaliwal called Mr. Bush a failed statesman. MP Carolyn Parrish was quoted
as saying: "Damn Americans, I hate those bastards."

The latest addition to that list comes with some irony, Mr. Wright said,
because the provinces recently suggested they should circumvent the
federal government and appeal to the White House directly because of
Ottawa's perceived anti-Americanism.

"If you're going to play with the big boys, you should try to prevent this
kind of thing," Mr. Wright said. "You can't appeal to the President on a
certain issue and then call the President names."

On the other hand, major league baseball fans might feel relieved that the
president is no longer part-owner of the Texas Rangers. If he was, the
American League might be referred to as "Bush League."

Thursday

I began to despair. One would need to be both blind
and deaf to misunderstand me. That girl who was raped,
some said she had no one but herself to blame.
The ferry was late, and, if it hadn't been late, we

would have missed it. Do you want to cross the street here,
or should we go on to the crosswalk at the corner?
How many ways are there to spell "Shostakovich"?
At low tide we can get out to the island on foot.

I shave every day, whether it's raining or not. No cars
allowed beyond this point. He often asked questions just to
strike up an acquaintance with strangers, even if he
already knew their answers. Please accept my apologies.

It took a hundred million years to make this island,
and now look what's become of it.

Hi Bob--No, the Japanese know exactly what they mean by haiku.  There's no
confusion on that issue.  Everyone from truck drivers to bank presidents
will count out 5/7/5 on their fingers for you if you ask.  The school system
requires that they memorize haiku.  It doesn't matter where they are or who
they are or at what level they are.  Haiku--like sumo--is a part of Japanese
high and low cultures.  For instance, there's a new television show here for
children on NHK--a kind of sesame street--that celebrates haiku, Japanese
tongue twisters, etc. There's also a haiku forum on television, where famous
haijin correct haiku live on air.  There are hundreds of Japanese haiku
circles on all the islands, and local and national contests by the score.

Mark--my extraordinary claim about good to excellent haiku is not so
extraordinary, but in order to understand it you've got to learn to read
Japanese and live in Japan.  Then you'd be able to walk into a railroad
station book stall and see the proliferation of haiku magazines, or spend an
afternoon at Maruzen and see the racks of new haiku books.  That business
about good Japanese haiku doing what it does differently than their poor
bastard cousins in the west inheres in the language.  You'd see that I am
not talking about all poetry if you begin right away and give over--say--
the next six years of your life to study.  Stay away from the translations
and learn Japanese.

I'm trading countries--the land of Basho and sashimi for the land of
Shakespeare and roast beef--for the for the next month, so it's back to the
shadows for me.  Thanks for all the great responses.

Jess

Bob and others--Well, "haiku" in English may not be as good as Japanese
haiku, but they often seem pretty good compared to a lot of other poems in
English.  I think there's a quality of discipline and attention that even
the weak, Englished version of the form can inspire, and I particularly
like the way the genre encourages radical (and enlightening) shifts or
juxtapositions of perspective.  Anyway, I think all the poems quoted below
are excellent (whatever we want to call them) and I also admired the
earlier examples from Spiess (as well as your perceptive commentaries).

But why work without ego? What is this about? I think this is a
misdirection or misrecognition. The most interesting artists I know, from
jazz musicians to painters, have ego, have that obsessiveness and even
competitiveness. And you find this even in Dogen for that matter, not to
mention Hokusai, Hiroshige, Seikaku, etc. etc. Ego can be a furnace.

     I'm a bit baffled by the hostile tone in some of these poests re haiku
("brief associative form",
"mere counting of syllables")--
     Why so dismissive--?   And why allude only to Basho?   I assume this
means one has taken haiku simply from a few examples and investigated no
further--?
     It is interesting that so many "problematic" questions occur when forms
from other cultures are used in English--
     When English and other Western forms and styles have so influenced
other cultures, and not just through colonialism and imperialism . . . it is
an exchange back and forth and all around--a listening and learning--with
the possibilities always open for change--a difference which is perhaps not
of the measure of the originary--yet . . . may well send one back to the
originary with a questioning and open mind--and bring into an other language
new findings and soundings within itself through the use of a different
method of composition . . .
     I understand what dear friend Jesse is saying in regards to an English
language haiku not being able to have the resonances and connotations, the
allusiveness and tonalities of the Japanese.  Hearing a Japanese friend read
some haiku aloud in Japanese conveyed this vividly to me, though I don't
speak Japanese--just listened very attentively.
     Of course, part of this is due to the long centuries of hailku in
history and to its immense popularity and practice to this day in Japan.
There is an immense body of work to draw upon, an immense accumulation of
images, sounds to work with, and ways to work into these contemporary
language in all its ever developing varieties.  Haiku in a myriad of
journals continue an ongoing exchange of  work, a conversation that is part
of a living culture.
     I think it should be noted that begining in the last decade of the 19th
century, with Shiki, there is the
beginnings of the liberation within the haiku form, first from the use of
the seasonal notings (kigo), then
eventually from the use of the 5-7-5 syllabic form (the shinkeiko or
"new-development" movement).  A major figure in this movement is Seisensui
Ogiwara who established the journal SOUN in 1911.
      The most important (and now very popular) poet to emerge from this
movement and journal (he was for a while its editor) is Santoka Taneda.  He
is also regarded as a great Zen master--despite alcoholism which continued
throughout his life.  He was a wandering monk--estimated to have walked 28,
000 miles in Japan through the 1920s and '30s.  Even on his begging
wanderings he kept in touch with other poets and composed continually both
haiku and journals.
     The mighty example and work of Santoka is available in English:
MOUNTAIN TASTING  Zen Haiku of Santoka Taneda translated by and with very
good introduction by John Stevens (New York:  Weatherhill, 1980; it has
recently been reprinted).
      Another alcoholic and suicidal depressive converted to Buddhism and
haiku writing, in an even freer form than Santoka, is Hosai Ozaki
(1885-1926).  His work is presented in English with translations by Hiroaki
Sato, introduction by Kyoko Selden and preface by Cor van der Heuval in
RIGHT UNDER THE BIG SKY, I DON'T WEAR A HAT The Haiku and Prose of Hosai
Ozaki (Berkeley:  Stone Bridge Press, 1993).
      Hosai's lines are not presented in the standard translation method of
three seperated lines, but in one single line:

      I open the desk drawer with nothing in it just to see

     Hosai and Santoka are two of my favorite poets in any language--their
work is an encounter with liberation within/outwo/ards from a form as well
as a liberation of the mind, the life--
     Recently have been reading a good deal of "modern" Japanese poetry
(i.e. post 1900)--
     A number of people in this discussion have questioned the use of forms
from other languages, traditions--
     It should be noted that this works both ways--for example a good deal
of the Japanese poets have been reading made use of Western forms, images,
free form verse, allusions, expressionisms and subjectivisms etc.
     Again, two personal favorites are Shinkichi Takahashi and Hagiwara
Sakutaro, both of whom were very influenced by Dadaism in their early works.
  Shinkichi, later to become known as the greatest modern Zen poet and
author of a myriad Zen books as well as poetry, called himself Japan's first
and greatest Dadaist.  (A friend is translating his Dada works into English
for a forthcoming issue of Traverse).
     Bob Grumman made a very good indication --that there is a very large
American haiku writing community, with journals which contain not only haiku
but also reviews, essays and discussions.  I think it should be noted that
while American haiku may not have the range of tonalities, allusions, plays
on words perhaps that the Japanese does, it is creating in American language
its own sounds and allusions  It can be recalled (and found on CD etc) that
Kerouac recorded many of his haiku with jazz accompaniement.  .
     I have read a good deal of haiku in English--some of it much better
than others--but found that sometimes it is very limited, due to a set of
more or less limited precepts and preconceptions.  I don't think this is
because the haiku are written in English--I think it may be that they lack
the sense of intensity that the great Japanese writers in the form have.
These were concerned not just with the form, but with its use in expressing
both the findings and the searchings along the Path--mainly Zen.  The form
and the Zen work together towards a liberation.
     This does not mean that a haiku writer need be a Zen person--to me it
means that the haiku brings in its concision and attentiveness to the daily,
the simple, the concrete, the sense of the world as we see it as passing--I
think that in this discipline there is the focus of awareness on the minimal
as a way of opening outwo/ards within immediacy.
     Through a series of haphazard events I out of the blue began to write
haiku a year and a half ago and to read a great deal of it.
     For me haiku dovetailed with the work i do in visual poetry and sound
poetry and in writing--that is, the use of materials found in the streets,
using them for rubbings, reverse printings and so forth--
this is a way of working directly and with immediacy by using spray
paintings especially or by making rubbings with lumber crayon, then xeroxing
or adding transfers--
      I write haiku in tiny notebooks carried everywhere.  Began with the 17
syllable 5-7-5 structure and found that this greatly intensified my learning
of the weight, sound, tone of each syllable.  As well, it lead to ever
sparer imagery, getting rid of superflous words, any form of extraneous
exigesis.  Practised daily, it led to a kind of meditation, in which all
thoughts began to form in that structure, bringing a rhythm as one walked,
looked and listened.  It began to change ways of thinking, of action.  It is
a method of working and being, of seeing and hearing.  Reading the great
Japanese haiku writers, I may not hear them in their language.  But I can
use what I do learn from them in the way of ever moving onwo/ards in
finding . . .
     Anywhere--materials with which to work, basic elements, stepping
stones--
     A very strict form and discipline can bring freedoms not before found--
     Don Cherry the great jazz trumpeter used to say "Only a very
disciplined musician can play Free Jazz".
     For myself, working with haiku is a continual learning.
     I have also used it in conjunction with visual poems--THE DEAD SEE
SCRAWLS--
     Haiku encourages a leap--
     a change--
     Cezanne wrote of being able to sit on a river bank, a favorite motif,
and by just moving the head an inch, see a completely new world presented to
view.
      I should note I don't think the short poems being quoted are haiku.
      I love those poems very much but they are not haiku.
      They are written with quite another form in mind.
      It should also be noted that of course many haiku are quite mundane!
      Even among quanta only so many make the leap!
      The main thing is one has a tool with which to work, and others to
learn from of this, over many centuries and among so many people on two
sides of the world.
     As Basho writes in his magnificent "Learn from the Pine":

     "The basis of art is change in the universe."

     I'm a bit baffled by the hostile tone in some of these poests re haiku
("brief associative form",
"mere counting of syllables")--
     Why so dismissive--?   And why allude only to Basho?   I assume this
means one has taken haiku simply from a few examples and investigated no
further--?
     It is interesting that so many "problematic" questions occur when forms
from other cultures are used in English--
     When English and other Western forms and styles have so influenced
other cultures, and not just through colonialism and imperialism . . . it is
an exchange back and forth and all around--a listening and learning--with
the possibilities always open for change--a difference which is perhaps not
of the measure of the originary--yet . . . may well send one back to the
originary with a questioning and open mind--
     I understand what dear friend Jesse is saying in regards to an English
language haiku not being able to have the resonances and connotations, the
allusiveness and tonalities of the Japanese.  Hearing a Japanese friend read
some haiku aloud in Japanese conveyed this vividly to me, though I don't
speak Japanese--just listened very attentively.
     Of course, part of this is due to the long centuries of hailku in
history and to its immense popularity and practice to this day in Japan.
There is an immense body of work to draw upon, an immense accumulation of
images, sounds to work with, and ways to work into these contemporary
language in all its ever developing varieties.  Haiku in a myriad of
journals continue an ongoing exchange of  work, a conversation that is part
of a living culture.
     I think it should be noted that begining in the last decade of the 19th
century, with Shiki, there is the
beginnings of the liberation within the haiku form, first from the use of
the seasonal notings (kigo), then
eventually from the use of the 5-7-5 syllabic form (the shinkeiko or
"new-development" movement).  A major figure in this movement is Seisensui
Ogiwara who established the journal SOUN in 1911.
      The most important (and now very popular) poet to emerge from this
movement and journal (he was for a while its editor) is Santoka Taneda.  He
is also regarded as a great Zen master--despite alcoholism which continued
throughout his life.  He was a wandering monk--estimated to have walked 28,
000 miles in Japan through the 1920s and '30s.  Even on his begging
wanderings he kept in touch with other poets and composed continually both
haiku and journals.
     The mighty example and work of Santoka is available in English:
MOUNTAIN TASTING  Zen Haiku of Santoka Taneda translated by and with very
good introduction by John Stevens (New York:  Weatherhill, 1980; it has
recently been reprinted).
      Another alcoholic and suicidal depressive converted to Buddhism and
haiku writing, in an even freer form than Santoka, is Hosai Ozaki
(1885-1926).  His work is presented in English with translations by Hiroaki
Sato, introduction by Kyoko Selden and preface by Cor van der Heuval in
RIGHT UNDER THE BIG SKY, I DON'T WEAR A HAT The Haiku and Prose of Hosai
Ozaki (Berkeley:  Stone Bridge Press, 1993).
      Hosai's lines are not presented in the standard translation method of
three seperated lines, but in one single line:

      I open the desk drawer with nothing in it just to see

     Hosai and Santoka are two of my favorite poets in any language--their
work is an encounter with liberation within/outwo/ards from a form as well
as a liberation of the mind, the life--
     Recently have been reading a good deal of "modern" Japanese poetry
(i.e. post 1900)--
     A number of people in this discussion have questioned the use of forms
from other languages, traditions--
     It should be noted that this works both ways--for example a good deal
of the Japanese poets have been reading made use of Western forms, images,
free form verse, allusions, expressionisms and subjectivisms etc.
     Again, two personal favorites are Shinkichi Takahashi and Hagiwara
Sakutaro, both of whom were very influenced by Dadaism in their early works.
  Shinkichi, later to become known as the greatest modern Zen poet and
author of a myriad Zen books as well as poetry, called himself Japan's first
and greatest Dadaist.  (A friend is translating his Dada works into English
for a forthcoming issue of Traverse).
     I have read a good deal of haiku in English--some of it much better
than others--but found that often it is very limited, due to a set of more
or less limited precepts and preconceptions.  I don't think this is because
the haiku are written in English--I think it may be that they lack the sense
of intensity that the great Japanese writers in the form have.  These were
concerned not just with the form, but with its use in expressing both the
findings and the searchings along the Path--mainly Zen.  The form and the
Zen work together towards a liberation.
     This does not mean that a haiku writer need be a Zen person--to me it
means that the haiku brings in its concision and attentiveness to the daily,
the simple, the concrete, the sense of the world as we see it as passing--I
think that in this discipline there is the focus of awareness on the minimal
as a way of opening outwo/ards within immediacy.
     I should note that my approach to/with haiku and emphasizing its form
as a way tow/ards an ongoing work of liberation is not based on any clearly
defined personal spiritual belief as such,  but on a personal experience of
haiku in a given context.
     I had not read any haiku nor thought of them in about a quarter century
until a year and half or so ago

Dear David (and all!), not to worry. Things are much better. But yes,
it's been far too long between dalliances. Where is Our Laureateship, do
you suppose, sleeping off his annual butt of sack? Somebody once asked
Bob Hope why he left England and he said "because I found out I could
never be king." Is that why you left? Drink some hot coffee. I love you
too.

> 'Cocking a snoot' is not the same as 'cocking a snook'

Apparently. More snooks are cocked than snoots, if Google is any guide
(909 links to "cocking a snook" and only 87 to "cocking a snoot"). The
OED doesn't give a nod to snoot-cocking at all:

snook, n.
[Of obscure origin.]
A derisive gesture, = sight n.1 7c. Chiefly in phr. to cock a snook
(at).
   1791 E. Wynne Diary 7 Dec. (1935) I. 90 They cock snooks at one on
every occasion.  1879 A. J. C. Hare Story Life (1900) V. 218 If I put my
hands so+(cutting a snooks), they might reproach me very much indeed.
1904 Times 24 Sept. 8/3 The young monkey puts his tongue in his cheek
and cocks a snook at you.  1906 Drury Men at Arms 36 Her Majesty's
ship+cocked her jibboom snooks-fashion at her late enemy the sea.  1929
H. S. Walpole Hans Frost i. vii. 78 He was like a dirty street boy
cocking a snook at Sappho.  1938 E. Ambler Cause for Alarm viii. 128 The
Rome-Berlin axis+cocked the biggest snook yet at the League of Nations
idea.  1959 M. Cumberland Murmurs in Rue Morgue v. 38 With his right
hand he made the somewhat coarse gesture known as 'cocking a snook'. The
thumb and extended fingers, spread in front of the face, made a baffling
disguise.  1961 B. Fergusson Watery Maze ii. 48 It would be idle to
pretend that it was of much importance; it was really only cocking a
vulgar snook.  1965 Listener 9 Sept. 374/2, I walked past the Thatched
House+where I and other young journalists used to cock snooks at our
superiors.  1980 Times 29 Feb. 10 East German craft last spring embarked
upon a new ploy+to net a Danish torpedo,+cooking a snook at Nato's
Baltic muscle.

David: I think you mistake me. As the author of hundreds of brief
associative poems I was describing, not dismissing. I would also be creful
about assuming that I only know the work of one master. Let me say it
again: I'm glad that a lot of Japanese people like to write haiku. It's
good to remember that the sonnet had a long vogue in the west. There are
nonetheless nothing near thousands of good sonnets unless one's standards
are impossibly low. Good poetry of any kind is at any time and in any
language a relatively scarce commodity.

And again: clearly "an English language haiku [can't] have the resonances
and connotations, the allusiveness and tonalities of the Japanese," but it
can have others. Or is the haiku somethingh like a macrobiotic diet, in
which one is only allowed to eat foods currently in season in Japan?

With more emphasis on Bitch Animal beatnik slam that up dose her Cowboy
nutritionist with stolen incoherent species, where males give the
females nuptial.  To innovate cruelty of poetry a variety of live
freshwater Mockingbird anthologies and Performance Volunteers are
needed to feed the cats and tell a horseplayer a huge variety of things
about memorizing because it's not just the resilient toughness and the
unlikely hero, a man who loved short prose decorated the circus. All
new jugglers for the lucky Concrete Cat Bitch even managed to end
ferocious sequences For the Unlost. The Human was an ornery likeness
criticizing the city, bonding between sheer visual Express, only heard
his almost ago as the crowd shouted "Tiger, Tiger, Tiger." She paces
like depiction of the eerie atmosphere. The animals have nothing to say
and I am three gardens and a plant in classical love crystallised
landscape, or well-chilled to avoid the book of wine.  Kite making
behind-the-scenes or the chance encounter once the world has been
saved. You give what you remember of this animal ....

A belief in the unity of God is not favourable to the maintenance of an
hierarchy. (Osama has no Langley)
So says Del Mar of the Moslems.

In the Roman empire the right to coin gold [mint and stamp it] always
remained with the sovereign-pontiff [the Basileus (Augustus) Bush]
... the coinage [the minting and stamping of, not the use] of gold [...]
with the Arabs as with the Persians and Romans, was a sacerdotal prerogative

The early emirs struck no gold, not even with Roman devices, and when
Abd-el-Melik struck gold, the sovereign-pontiff of Rome
[Bush],[...]immediately declared war upon him

Under Abd-el-Melik [...]coins became wholly Arabian and had the valuation of
silver to gold of 6 1/2 for 1, a characteristic that carried westward, and
continued to influence the coinages of Europe until after the discovery of
America

In A.H. 67 (A.D. 686), Abd-el-Melik, being [...]involved in civil war with
the Mardaites, bought peace of Justinian II [...]by the payment of a tribute
of 1,000 gold solidi or dinars per annum for ten years. Down to this time
these coins were struck by Abd-el-Melik, with Roman emblems and legends upon
them. Six years later [Abd-el-Melik] having disposed of the Mardaite
trouble, determined to assert his independence of Rome, and by a token
understood of all the world:

He struck gold with his own effigy

Justinian [Bush] refused to receive these coins because, says, Zonaras
Greenspan, "It is not permitted to stamp gold coins with any other
['effin']effigy but that of the emperor of Rome."

Whereupon a war was declared by Bush (whose Congress abrogated its power to
declare war for some time past)

Why, pray tell, 6 and 1/2 of 1 and half a dozen of another?

Again Del Mar:

The Athenian, Persian, Egyptian, and Roman governments had successfully
absorbed a large portion of the profits derived from the Indian trade, by
lowering the value of silver (in which their tributes were chiefly received)
in the Occident to half its value in the Orient. By making the bullion trade
a strictly governmental monopoly, as Cicero informs us was the case with
Rome, that hierarchy obtained twice as much gold for silver in India as it
paid for it in Europe...

The Arabian government was more considerate of its merchants: it threw open
the oriental trade to all true believers; it imposed no restrictions; it was
averse [...]to the imposition of covert exactions [with usura hath no man a
house of good stone] (and to this day the towns of Arabia have a plethora of
little shops where the little man can make a dirham)

During the seventh century of our era the ratio in India was about 6 1/2 for
1, and this high valuation of silver in India continued substantially
unchanged until the fifteenth century. It was at the Indian ratio that the
moslem struck their coins of gold and silver.

Whatever the true reason of this policy, it was certainly more profitable
for the moslem conquerors than had they adopted the contemporaneous Roman
ratio of 12 for 1. A brief computation will serve to measure this profit.

... [this] system of purely Arabian coinages [...] continued until the
centre of their empire was virtually removed to India, and they had lost
control of both the mines and the commerce of Europe.

You see it is the critical patterning and repatterning of the vectors.

Within catastrophe linguistics there is always the grasp.

One might also have the shun.

The hawks have disappeared. The wasps are thread-waisted.

A large train may appear in the future.
