ERIC GREINKE: A Poet and publisher who promotes mental expansion.

Interview with Doug Holder

Eric Greinke, a native of Michigan, makes no apologies about his ambition=
s
for his work. Greinke, 61, has always been about mental expansion, a way =
to
advance not only the awareness of individuals but society as a whole. I w=
as
introduced to Greinke by Hugh Fox, the noted small press poet, writer, an=
d
critic. In 2005 Fox told me that Greinke was starting up a small press
(Presa Press), and was soliciting select small press poets for an
avant-garde anthology =93Inside the Outside=85=94 Fox had recommended me =
for the
anthology and I was thrilled to be in a collection with the likes of A.
D.Winans, Lyn Lifshin, Hugh Fox, Harry Smith, Stanley Nelson, Richard
Kostelantz and so many other noted poets.

Greinke founded his first literary magazine =93Metamorphosis=94 with Ronn=
ie Lane
in 1968. His first poetry chapbook =93Earth Songs=94 was published in 197=
0,
followed by =93Canary Wine, Milk run & and Other Poems,=94 and =93San=
d & Other
Poems,=94 (A full length, hardcover book.) In the early 70=92s Greinke st=
arted
Pilot Press Books with Ronnie Lane and established a national literary
magazine while at Grand Valley State University in Michigan. He published=
 a
wide selection of poets early in their careers like: Diane Wakoski,
Etheridge Knight, Donald Hall, Kirby Congdon and many others. Greinke was=

also a book reviewer for the Grand Rapids Press for many years, and broug=
ht
writers like Robert Creeley, Charles Bukowski, Clayton Eshleman to the
attention of a mass audience. After a long hiatus from the publishing gam=
e
Greinke, along with his wife Roseanne, birthed the Presa Press, and in a
short time Presa has been making a name for itself on the national litera=
ry
scene. Greinke generously consented to an interview, but wanted to
concentrate on his life as a writer, rather than on his publishing that h=
as
been well-covered in previous interviews.


Doug Holder: A lot of poets talk about how journalism helped them learn t=
he
discipline needed to write. Did the Coast Guard contribute to your
maturation as a writer, as well as your journalistic background?

Eric Greinke: I went into the Coast Guard in 1966, at the height of the
Vietnam War, mainly to avoid the draft. Saving lives seemed preferable to=

taking them or losing my own. Also, we were poor & I had no money for=

college, so I wanted the G.I. Bill, which had generous educational benefi=
ts
back then. I did apply for a job as a journalist in the Coast Guard, but
there were only two slots for journalism because the Coast Guard was smal=
ler
than the New York Police Department, about 28,000 at that time. Being the=

literary editor of a high school newspaper didn't qualify me. So, I went =
on
a Search & Rescue team on the Great Lakes, which was home, so I was q=
uite
pleased with that instead of death abroad. I did write my first attempt a=
t a
novel during my night watches, however, & of course, later wrote Sea =
Dog as
a quasi-autobiographical-90%-true experiment in creative non-fiction. But=
,
Sea Dog probably owes more to Mark Twain than it does to the Coast Guard.=
 I
was inspired by Huckleberry Finn to write it in the first person naive vo=
ice
that allows for many funny double entendres. But, I guess I did learn the=

value of writing every day, because those night watches were four hours o=
f
nothing much to do but listen to the emergency ship to shore channel &amp=
;
hourly security checks around the station. The dog that was the inspirati=
on
for Yogi (the dog character in Sea Dog) kept me company on those watches.=



DH: I noticed the first magazine you put out was "Metamorphosis." Were yo=
u a
Kafka freak, or just into the over-all idea of transformation?


EG: My work has always been about mental expansion. Metamorphosis Magazin=
e
started as a newsletter subtitled "a Transcendental Newsletter" & it =
evolved
into a local literary magazine supported by book & record store ads,
primarily. But, yes, the idea that poetry should be seen as part of the
human potential movement, a way to advance the awareness not only of
individuals, but also of society as a whole, was central to my philosophy=

from the beginning.


DH: Were you part of what Hugh Fox coined as the "Invisible Generation" o=
f
writers?

EG: Not exactly. I think Hugh meant that immediate generation of post-Bea=
t
poets & writers that were less primitive than the Beats but who found=
 it
difficult to follow such a popular act. I knew all those guys, but they w=
ere
all older than I was. Hugh Fox & Harry Smith were already icons in th=
e early
seventies. Hugh was the most avant-garde poet/publisher in Michigan then,=

with his Ghost Dance. Harry was the most active small press publisher in =
New
York City. I was recognized early by the established avant-garde. In my
early twenties, I had already published in magazines alongside Robert Bly=
,
Donald Hall, William Stafford, Robert Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, Phil Whale=
n,
Diane Wakoski, Ted Berrigan & other well-recognized poets. Because ou=
r last
names both started with =91G,' I found myself published a page or two awa=
y
from Allen Ginsberg regularly.
I was also published alongside Lyn Lifshin quite a bit in the early days.=

Joel Oppenheimer, Jackson MacLow, Paul Blackburn - I was acquainted with =
all
those guys. But, most poets born in the forties tend toward deconstructio=
n.
We have been influenced by not only the Beats, but the New York School, t=
he
Black Mountain poets & the neo-imagists like Robert Bly. As a generat=
ion,
the boomers are more diverse & literate than the more primitive Beats=
,
therefore not as accessible or popular as a result. We were certainly mor=
e
visible back then with only four or five hundred poetry books being produ=
ced
a year instead of the four or five thousand produced today. It was easier=
 to
get attention back then. Also, poetry became quite popular in the seventi=
es
on college campuses.


DH: You were a book reviewer for the Grand Rapid Press in Michigan. What =
for
you constitutes a good book review?


EG: That experience was amazing in hindsight. The Grand Rapids Press has =
a
high circulation - a half a million readers. I didn't realize how unusual=
 it
was for a large city newspaper to print big reviews, some up to a half pa=
ge,
of poetry books. I reviewed Charles Bukowski early in his career, Robert
Creeley, Tom Clark, Dan Gerber, Diane Wakoski, Clayton Eshleman, Jerome
Rothenberg, Joe Brainard, Nikki Giovanni, & numerous other poets duri=
ng the
seventies. John Martin of Black Sparrow Press regularly sent me everythin=
g
he published, among others such as Jim Harrison's Sumac Press, Caterpilla=
r
Press, etc. The overall effect was that poetry actually sold in the Grand=

Rapids area. The reviews were part of the whole scene.
When a review is well-written, it reveals the essence of the book being
reviewed. It answers the question of whether the writer accomplished what=
 he
set out to do. It identifies the primary message of the book & how we=
ll the
message is delivered.
I also like it when the reviewer confesses to any biases regarding the
material. I guess the most important thing is to write honestly about you=
r
response to the book, qualifying your opinions when fair & necessary.=

Sometimes this means going against popular opinion. I panned The
Autobiography of Andy Warhol for its facetiousness. He'd sent all the
reviewers signed copies. But, the book was campy & lacked the substan=
ce it
could potentially have had. Decades later, the critics mostly agree with =
me
on Warhol's work. But, at the time, I was out on the proverbial limb.


DH: Transcendentalism has a big influence in your writing. Your work seem=
s
to be steeped in nature, nature imagery, like Thoreau. Can you talk a bit=

about this? I am more into character study, does this appeal to you at al=
l?


EG: Thoreau & his transcendentalism had enormous influence on my worl=
d-view.
Let me go on record saying that Thoreau was the greatest American
writer/philosopher of all. He was a kind of American Zen master. He was
right about everything, & he had the personal courage to live his
convictions. The true test of genius is that their works continue to be
relevant over time. Thoreau surpasses even that test. His philosophy is
actually more relevant today than in his own time.
I believe deeply in human potential & in poetry as a tool of social
consciousness & personal awareness. Poetry is like humor, in that it
attempts to break through to a higher level of awareness, a new recogniti=
on
or a relationship that you didn't see before. Thoreau believed in immersi=
ng
oneself into whatever natural environment one was born into. Every man is=
 a
microcosm of the larger macrocosm. Pure spirituality outside of religious=

dogma is a human potential. Nature is my cathedral. It renews me & en=
ergizes
me. The best way for me to overcome writer's block is to go outside. For =
me,
that usually means hiking or kayaking, maybe fishing. I love to spend tim=
e
with friends on these activities, & do so regularly.
I live by a large lake in an area of numerous lakes & rivers. (Michig=
an has
almost 12,000 lakes.) I have two ski resorts, a large park with hiking
trails & a big nature preserve that includes a good-sized lake, all w=
ithin
about a five mile radius of my cottage. I purposely chose the place for i=
ts
outdoor recreational value.
As a poet, you write about your environment & experiences. I do inclu=
de the
human world though. It's an essential ingredient in my so-called nature
poems, because I want to evoke the contrast between the human world &=
 the
natural world. We need to recognize that nature is alive too, & becom=
e
respectful of that, for our soul's sake, & for the survival of our sp=
ecies.
Character study does interest me, but not in poetry. My novel-in-progress=
,
Elephant's Graveyard, is a character driven book. I see poetry, at least =
for
me, my impulse, as dealing with big mysteries, paradox & perceptual a=
wareness.


DH: Allen Ginsberg wrote, and I paraphrase: "I saw the best minds of my
generation lost to madness." How about you? Is this poet as a madman a lo=
t
of hype, a misguided romantic notion?


EG: I think the stereotype of the mad poet is mostly hyperbole, with a fe=
w
notable exceptions. Writing poetry is high functioning. Perhaps it was on=
ly
when they were writing that the so called mad poets were sane, or
super-sane. Like a joke, a poem needs a punch-line that delivers that "Ah=
a!"
that lift to a new recognition. That's why laughter is transcendental. It=
's
that moment of mental integration, when recognition rushes in. Good poems=
 do
the same thing. They take the top of your head off, to paraphrase Emily
Dickinson.


DH: You said in an interview that you are concerned with perception vs.
reality. Isn't perception reality... for the person that is? Is there a
collective reality...really?

EG: The human condition contains a wide range of experiences & states=
 of
mind, but taken as a whole, there are parameters. Poetry, like humor, plu=
gs
into that common shared experience. Morality is an expression of shared
values. Again, there is diversity, but there are also universal or near
universal taboos on the negative side & positive values such as altru=
ism too.
There is a big reality, but we are limited by our sensory perception &amp=
; our
mental capacity in perceiving it. In the context of the rather large
expanding universe, human reality is limited indeed. Dogs hear & smel=
l far
more than we do. Eagles have telescopic vision. Whales have a bigger brai=
n
to body ration than humans.

DH: You say you want to "break through the surface of things" Have you? A=
nd
what have you found?


EG: Philosophically: personal growth requires divergent thinking. If one =
is
convergent in thought, forming dogmatic attitudes, progress is halted.
Degrees of abstraction are like rungs on a ladder. Climbing requires
flexibility. An internal locus of control increases responsibility & =
leads
to better choices. Being in love is the highest level of human experience=
.
It takes you out of yourself. Nature abhors a vacuum. When you're hurting=
,
give until it feels good. Worry about the past or future causes anxiety.
Time is precious & limited. Death is inevitable & unpredictable. =
Make each
day Thanksgiving & Valentine's Day.
In poetic terms, I've learned that ambiguity & mystery are desirable,=
 & that
the poet's intention is not necessarily the real message of a poem. Poems=

symbolize deeper thoughts & feelings, the way dreams do. I've learned=
 to
trust my intuition as my greatest strength as a poet.


DH: Why did you work as a social worker as opposed to English teacher,
editor, etc...?


EG: I felt a strong need to get physically involved in the effort to trea=
t
child abuse & neglect. Although I had some sudden fame as a poet, I f=
elt
that it would be vain to prioritize it over working directly toward socia=
l
change. I needed to see myself as a man of action. I had the energy &=
 I
wanted to tussle with evil. Later, when my conscience was clear, I began
publishing my writing again.


DH: Hugh Fox wrote in a critical essay about you that it seems that you
advocate dropping out of the work-a-day world, tune out the rat race, and=

tune into the natural world. Should I, for an example, quit the day job, =
and
retire to the wilds, living off the land. In other words how can a man or=

woman combine the demands of everyday, with the need to connect to our
natural selves?


EG: Obviously we can't all retire to the wilds. But we can, as Emerson
advised "simplify, simplify." (Why the hell did he have to say it twice?)=
 We
can pare down our material possessions; make time decisions based on the
potential quality of an experience instead of material gain or superficia=
l
social compulsion. I think people should choose an occupation based on
meaning. My youngest son told me he wants to major in philosophy. "That w=
ill
have no occupational value." I said. "That's what I like about it." he
replied. He's right.


DH: Can you talk about the genesis of the Presa Press?


EG: The word presa is a musical term that refers to the entry-point into =
a
canon. We felt that the non-academic post-Beat poets were poorly represen=
ted
in relation to each other. The need was there to document the underground=

canon. The whole thing developed through conversations with Kirby Congdon=
,
Harry Smith & Hugh Fox. Librarians & others interested in documen=
ting the
independent press poets expressed the need to me originally. I had the
experience of running the successful seventies press Pilot Press Books. S=
ome
of those Pilot Press Books are selling for over $600 a copy on the
international market. We've tried to publish the edgiest, most consistent=
ly
good poets, like any other press.
The strength of a small press is its backlist. We are committed to keepin=
g
everything we publish in print. Sales of well-received poetry books are
cumulative over time. Of course, a lot depends on the poet. The poet is t=
he
best salesman of his own books.


DH: I consider you one of the exalted gray beards of the small press alon=
g
with Hugh Fox, Len Fulton, Lyn Lifshin, Alan Catlin, Ed Galing, A.D. Wina=
ns
and the list goes on. What would the world be like without the small or
alternative presses?


EG: Lyn Lifshin has no beard at all, but she is, & should be exalted!=
 The
world would be less hopeful without the small press, for one thing. For
another, literature would stagnate. Historically, the greatest writers ha=
ve
never been academics. They were either Bohemians, or they worked in anoth=
er
non-academic profession. Frost was a farmer. Eliot & Stevens were
businessmen. Williams was a physician. The academy didn't like the Beats
until City Lights sold a million copies of Howl. Even though Olson & =
Creeley
were academics, they were relegated to the small press because they were
avant-garde. Today, college teachers like Gerald Locklin or Hugh Fox, if
they work in the Whitmanic, colloquial manner, choose the small press. I'=
ve
learned that every poet who writes represents a group of people who feel =
the
same way. Some of us, like Billy Collins, have wider audiences, & som=
e of us
are closer to the minority on the cutting edge. You'll find that edge in =
the
independent presses. Folkways are ultimately much more powerful than the
current fashion of a socio-economically privileged few. All will be
reconciled through the test of time.

GARMENT

Light emanates from my coat
My coat that contains
A shining stream
My coat of fool=92s gold
Wiser than the stars
Singing in its pockets
Imprisoned by the fragrance
Of the rosy clouds
Like the dark heart
Hidden in a bright cave
Hidden in infinity
So far out in the open
That little fish
Swim through its fabric.

Wordslingers is live radio for poetry and the conversations and culture it ignites, with a particular emphasis on Chicago. Twice each month, poets and writers convene in WLUW's studios to read their work aloud, and explore how poetry interacts with Chicago's broader literary culture.

This Sunday, May 3rd join guest host Kurt Heintz (e-poets network) with young writers Nat Iosabaker and Victor Ortiz, as they talk about their experiences at Louder Than a Bomb and other venues where emerging youth writers are creating new culture. Then hear Jennifer Karmin (Red Rover Series co-curator) in her own reading, and in conversation about teaching poetry in its many diverse forms.

Wordslingers is presented by Shelly Nation and produced by Michael Watson. Listen to Wordslingers on WLUW, Loyola University radio on 88.7 FM in Chicago, or click to the live stream at http://www.wluw.org. Broadcasts are at 8:00 PM, on the first and third Sunday of each month.

I=E2=80=99ve tried working with the system and system wanted to work with m=
e. In fact the system tried to swallow me whole. Not in one gulp, but in ti=
ny, tiny, minuscule bites. My middle finger went first right when I was get=
ting ready to give the bird to the system. CHOMP! It was gone. But I still =
had my fists thrust in the air. Then CHOMP, CHOMP they were gone too. The s=
ystem was hungry. But that was all right for as long as I had my ears. I co=
uld listen and hear. Then the system ate my ears. And right before it ate m=
y ears it whispered softly to me and convinced me to close my eyes. Now, I =
cannot see. But the system has not ate everything yet. It is afraid to come=
 for my mouth. Because, it knows that I also am hungry and ready to take a =
bite of my own, and chew, and spit words that know no system.=20

--
Behind the storm of daily conflict and crisis, the dramatic confrontations,
the tumult of political struggle, the poet, the artist, the musician,
continues the quiet work of centuries, building bridges of experience
between peoples, reminding man of the universality of his feelings and
desires and despairs, and reminding him that the forces that unite are
deeper than those that divide. -John F. Kennedy

Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.
-Martin Luther King, Jr.

hey folks;
i'm making a limited edition magazine/ephemeral object entitled =
"speechless" dedicated to the dissemination and discussion of concrete / =
visual poetry.

"speechless" will feature new visual poetry and possible historical / =
rare examples ... the 1st issue (out now) includes 3 new concrete poets =
here in calgary: eva gonzalez, rachelle pinnow and helen hajnoczky (and =
an essay on mary ellen solt).

i seek previously unpublished (or if published, then infrequently =
seen...) colour or B&W concrete / visual poems. email or snail mail =
submissions are fine.

issues are not themed, but an issue on typewriter-based work is planned.

each issue of "speechless" will be between 20 and 28 pages per issue and =
will feature 3-4 poets -- the submission deadline is open (issues will =
be published when enough accepted submissions accumulate), and i plan to =
include both poetry and criticism.

if you have any work for consideration, please send to:

your comments.

Best regards,

Rodrigo Rojas y Felipe Cussen

Greetings, everyone,

I'm looking for someone to live in my apartment (Park Slope,
Brooklyn) and care for my cat, Tyger, from June 11 - 17 while my
husband and I are in Romania.  The cat sitter I already have lined up
may need to leave town on short notice around that time, but I'll be
able to let you know for sure around the first week of June (maybe
even earlier).  Tyger needs no meds, has no health issues, is fairly
low-maintenance, but requires a friendly, mindful presence.  Please b/
c me -- shardav@verizon.net -- to discuss.

With good thoughts,
Sharon Mesmer

Magdelena Zurawski was born in Newark NJ and grew up in Edison NJ, but
Providence RI feels like home because that's where she started writing and
meeting writers and thinking of herself as a writer. Currently, she lives in
Durham, NC, where she is studying 19th-century American literature at Duke.
The Bruise, out now from Fiction Collective Two, is the winner of the 2006
Ronald Sukenick prize for innovative fiction. It is her first book.

Tolkien breaks silence over JRR's 'fierce, passionate' poem
JRR Tolkien's son Christopher admits the poetic form of his father's latest
book, Sigurd and Gudr=FAn, may 'put off' many Lord of the Rings fans

The reclusive son of JRR Tolkien has broken his silence to admit fears that
fans of his father's work may be "put off" by the verse form of his latest
posthumous publication. Responding via fax to a series of questions about
The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr=FAn, published for the first time today,
Christopher Tolkien expressed the hope that it would show a different side
to the author of the much-loved classic The Lord of the Rings.

The 500-stanza poem is closely modelled on the Elder Edda, a collection of
Norse myths preserved in a 13th-century manuscript, a pedigree Christopher
Tolkien described as "unknown territory" for most people.

"I dare say that a good many will be instantly put off by the very idea of
'long narrative poems in verse' and pursue it no further," he said. It was
equally possible that their form will lend them an "unexpected impact," he
continued.

"My hope is that some of those who appreciate and admire the works of my
father will find it illuminating in respect of Old Norse poetry in general,
in his own treatment of the fierce, passionate and mysterious legend, and i=
n
this further and little known aspect of him as both philologist and poet.
Above all I hope they will take pleasure in this poetry."

Christopher Tolkien, who as a child was paid two pence by his father for
every mistake he could find in The Hobbit, and as an RAF pilot during the
war contributed suggestions to the progress of The Lord of the Rings, worke=
d
from a manuscript which he believes his father wrote in the early 1930s. JR=
R
Tolkien taught Old Norse alongside Anglo-Saxon at Oxford university, giving
lectures and classes on Norse language and literature for at least 13 years=
.

Telling in verse the story of Sigurd the V=F6lsung and the fall of the
Niflungs =AD also adapted by Wagner into the Ring cycle =AD The Legend of Sigur=
d
and Gudr=FAn sees the hero Sigurd kill the dragon Fafnir (a slaying which may
have influenced Tolkien's writing of Bilbo's encounter with Smaug in The
Hobbit), take his gold and rescue the Valkyrie Brynhild from her
imprisonment on a rock surrounded by fire. Love, magic, jealousy, and,
eventually, tragedy in the murder of Sigurd and the suicide of Brynhild
ensue.

"My father left one manuscript, and that was complete; there were no more
than a few pages of earlier writings, and all other drafting has
disappeared. The manuscript is in good clear handwriting, written out
without corrections, and obviously intended to be a final fair copy. A few
minor changes were made to it much later," said Tolkien, who was appointed
as his father's literary executor and has over the past 36 years devoted
himself to editing and publishing his father's unpublished works, including
The Silmarillion and a 12-volume History of Middle-Earth. "My 'editing'
consists very largely of explanation and clarification."

Tolkien, 84, has lived in France since 1975, where wild rumours have
suggested that he guards his property from obsessive fans of his father's
work with a wild boar =AD a canard he dismissed as nonsense. "In the full for=
m
of the story I keep not one, but a whole troop of wild boars, expressly in
order to chase off Tolkien fans who are imagined to lurk in the woods that
surround my house," he said. "There are indeed many wild boars in these
parts, but I don't think they would be at all suitable as guardians even if
I wanted them."

Two years ago Tolkien completed and published his father's unfinished tale
of Middle-Earth The Children of H=FArin, which went on to sell more than 1m
copies in English.

Speculating about what his father, who died in 1973 aged 81, would have mad=
e
of his immense popularity today =AD over 150m copies of The Hobbit and The
Lord of the Rings have sold worldwide =AD Tolkien said he "might have been in
turns delighted, charmed, amused, puzzled, disquieted, baffled, indignant,
but, finally, comprehensively astounded".

AC [ Institute Direct Chapel ] Presents on the 3rd Anniversary of the Work's
Premiere:
Thursday, May 7th between 6-8pm


Openings
Richard Kostelanetz (2006)



With Featured Performers:



Laura Barger
Holly Crawford
Margaret Lancaster

Paige Taggart

Trio: Robert Dick, Joshue Ott and Morgan Packard





The AC [ Institute Direct Chapel ] continues in its performance series
offering a program of a sole work-though presented in a fashion that is
decidedly not solitary. With Richard Kostelanetz's score Openings as our
starting point, we traverse discipline and media offering a glimpse into the
infinitely mutable possibilities of his work. What depth Kostelanetz's work
offers, in turn also reveals much about the reader, the interpreter, the
performer. As such we are pleased to present 5 multi-faceted "versions" of
this work highlighting the following performers in their unique renderings
and also inherent collaboration with the score: Laura Barger; Holly
Crawford; Margaret Lancaster; Paige Taggart; and Trio: Robert Dick, Joshue
Ott and Morgan Packard. Curated by Sonya Hofer, AC Fellow.



This event is FREE and open to the public.





AC's mission is to advance the understanding of art through investigation,
research and education. It is a lab and forum for experimentation and
critical discussion. We support and develop projects that explore a
performative exchange across visual, verbal and experiential disciplines. We
encourage critical writing that challenges conventional expectations of
meaning and objectivity as well as the boundaries between the rational and
subjective.

Obododimma:

You are absolutely correct.  My laurels as poet laureate should be
based on material text production.  I have started to consider all the
options of what a poem of West Lima will encompass.  So far I'm
thinking horse & buggies, rednecks & budweiser,  lawn mowers, church
bells, more church bells, visible night sky, snow, more snow, drunk
teenagers driving recklessly, absence of books, burning trash barrels,
excessively fertile soil, 100 year old buildings in disrepair, & cars
parked with keys still in the ignition.

ALONE IN THE BACK CAF=C9, a new chapbook by Paul Murphy, has been
published by Survivors' Poetry in London, England.  The chapbook was
funded and sponsored by the Esm=E9e Fairbairn Foundation.

Paul Murphy was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1965.  He studied
at the University of Warwick, gaining a B.A. in Film and Literature.
From there he went to Queen=92s University in Belfast to study for an
M.A. on T.S.Eliot and the French philosopher Jacques Lacan.  Murphy
has been writer-in-residence at the Albert-Ludwig Universitat,
Freiburg im Breisgau, in Baden-Wurtemburg, in Germany.  He also writes
philosophy and enjoys working on the interface between poetry and
philosophy.

Paul Murphy's previous book, IN THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS, was published
by the University of Salzburg Press, in Salzburg, Austria.  Also,
Murphy's book T.S. ELIOT'S POSTMODERNIST COMPLAINT was published by
Postpressed in Australia (www.postpressed.com.au).  Paul Murphy has
read from his work in Paris, Cambridge, Galway and Belfast.  He is at
the moment writing an oral history of the Black Forest.

The cost of Paul Murphy's ALONE IN THE BACK CAF=C9 is =A34.00 (or $8.00)
and may be ordered from Survivors' Poetry at

http://survivorspoetry.com/SP_Shop/index.php?productID=3D141

... or directly by postal mail to

Survivors=92 Poetry,
Studio 11, Bickerton House,
25-27 Bickerton Road,
Archway,
London, England,
N19 5JT

Survivors=92 Poetry, a British non-profit established in 1991, promotes
the writing of survivors of traumatic distress.  Survivors' Poetry is
in a unique position to act on its vision of a society in which
survivors can work towards emotional and mental stability through the
discipline and truth to self that is a prerequisite for the
imaginative expression in language of traumatic experiences.
Survivors=92 Poetry actively supports and promotes the sheer linguistic
talent that many survivors bring to their insight into their own
condition and that of others.

The First 100 Days of Obama
http://stephenvincent.net/blog/
On my blog, I have just put up some photo documentation and a brief account=
 of the Gallery show and simultaneous book publication - 200 pages which in=
clude the entire haptic drawings and texts. The event was also a "performan=
ce piece" in that I was in the Gallery from 11 until 8 in the evening while=
 I made drawings and texts for the 100th day for the initial limited editio=
n of 25 copies. (Another 75 copies will be soon printed to include the form=
al text and drawing for the 100th day). The Gallery will take orders for ei=
ther edition. There are 10 copies remaining of the limited.=A0 Yes, 'the dr=
awing arm' began to swell like a baseball pitcher!=A0 And it was a great, f=
un day.=20

If interested, the blog permits going backwards in time to visit previous h=
aptics and texts.=20

As
 always, appreciate your responses.

Please join us for an intimate evening on Wednesday, May 6th from 6:30pm to

relating to being a migrant writer. The San Francisco Chronicle finds that
"Though the issues are weighty, Jin's prose is straightforward and
welcoming. . . . In this poignant and provocative book, Jin takes us on thi=
s
journey [to our envisioned homelands], revealing paths laid by migrant
writers before him and perhaps by those who will follow."

*Ha Jin* is the critically renowned author of five novels, including, *
Waiting* and *War Trash*,* *as well as three collections of short stories
and three books of poetry. His short story collection *The Bridegroom** *wo=
n

Beverly Dahlen was born in Portland in November, 1934, attended public
schools there, and after the end of World War II, moved with her family
to Eureka, California. In 1956, she resettled in San Francisco. Her
first collection of poetry, Out of the Third, was published by Momo=92s
Press in 1974. Two chapbooks, A Letter at Easter (Effie=92s Press) and The
Egyptian Poems (Hipparchia Press) were followed in 1985 by the
publication of A Reading 1-7 (Momo=92s Press). Since then, three more
volumes of A Reading have appeared, as well as the chapbook A-reading
Spicer & Eighteen Sonnets (Chax Press). Her essay =93Beauty: Another
Reading=94 recently appeared in Crayon 5. Ms. Dahlen was a co-founder,
with Kathleen Fraser and Frances Jaffer, of the feminist poetics
newsletter (HOW)ever; in December of 2008 her work was honored by Small
Press Traffic with their Lifetime Achievement Award.

David Abel was born in Salt Lake City in November, 1956, and schooled
there and in South Florida, Eastern California, the Mid-Hudson Valley,
and the Rio Grande Valley. After tenures in New York City and
Albuquerque (where he established the Bridge Bookshop, and Passages
Bookshop & Gallery, respectively), he relocated to Portland in 1997. He
is the author of numerous artists's books and objects -- including Rose,
Selected Durations, and Threnos (with Katherine Kuehn), and Let Us
Repair and While You Were In (with Anna & Leo Daedalus) -- and several
chapbooks, including Black Valentine (Chax) and Twenty- (Crane's Bill).
His most recent chapbook, Commonly, will premiere at this reading, along
with two new issues (one for each reader) of the broadside journal
Envelope, which he edits.

Does anyone know of a place to stay in Philadelphia for a few nights in the
third week of June? I'm traveling down there for research at the Rosenbach
Museum and am hoping to find a couch/cheap place to stay. Any suggestions
warmly welcomed!

Certainly the way to go. Seen and unseens. Some sweeping. Some excavation:
an archeology of things felt only. So, remove the halters from the necks of
th rearing questions.

Greetings, the May issue is up and fantastic at www.foggedclarity.com.
So we have now been doing this for one third of one year.  Thousands upon
thousands of people have viewed your work, and thanks to poet Michael Tyrell
*Fogged Clarity* just got its first mention in the *New York Times*. That
being said, it is game time this month; a true opportunity to proliferate
beauty and establish the clarity as one of the finest comprehensive arts
reviews in the country.  You are all wonderfully talented individuals with
extensive networks throughout the artistic community.I urge you to keep help
us spreading the word in any way you can: link us on your sites and social
media, tell your students, your friends and lovers.  Last month we had
11,000 unique visitors, this month I would like to make it an even 20.
Let's keep making things happen, lets keep celebrating our brief stints of
stimulus with ventilation.

Cheers my friends

Also, my apologies if you recieve a couple more emails from me on the email
blasts.

I don't as a rule call attention to writings about my own works, though =
the temptation is always there.  But there's a very detailed, very =
accurate piece just posted on the Poetry Foundation web site - a =
discussion of my experiments from some years ago with "total =
translation" and in particular a series of compositions that began as =
translations from Navajo ritual poetry.  The piece is by David Noriega =
and titled "The Original Performance Poetry: Jerome Rothenberg's 'total =
translations' of Navajo Horse Songs" - accompanied by clips of some =
early multi-track studio recordings.  The URL, for any who want to track =
it down, is =
http://www.poetryfoundation.org/journal/article.html?id=3D236556.
The work of course goes back to the early 1970s, so it's my pleasure too =
to see it still in circulation.

THE RED LINE

By Elizabeth Kirschner

Early morn and my eyes are like gun slits, swollen almost shut from the n=
on-
stop torrential weeping I did last night. Too much brain pain. Brain pain=
 that=20
knocks me off my feet, sometimes escalating at the speed of light until I=
=92m hit=20
with a bout of psychosis. Called =93episodes=94 as if they were a popular=
 TV=20
series, I go far away from the world and into one where wolves are devour=
ing=20
my brains or demons are throttling me, choking me halfway to death.

These states of psychic intensity are what have landed me for the past fi=
ve=20
years in the psych ward behind the red line that=92s six feet in front of=
 the=20
locked door that only visitors can cross, not patients. Red line like a g=
oal one=20
must get into in order to win the game. Red line from which I watched my=20=

then husband cross and go through the locked door, his shirt a small sail=
, his=20
posture like that of a wounded God.

My first grand entrance into the psych ward coincided with my first psych=
ic=20
break. I went from being in a state of what I call classical despair, as =
though=20
it were an art form, into the hellish belief that I was a dust baby, blow=
n hither=20
and yon, then switched in a moment long enough for my demons to snap thei=
r=20
fingers, into the violent schema wherein I was wrestling with God in piss=
 and=20
shit in a sewer hole with the lid shut tight.

That first incident, over five years ago, happened on my son=92s eleventh=
=20
birthday. In delirium, I argued with my husband, told him I needed to mak=
e the=20
birthday dinner and bake the cake before I would go anywhere. The kitchen=
=20
knife held a strange allure, something to cut and be cut with, but off I =
went=20
to the ER, a crazed Madam, a loony-tunes mother and wife.

I had been in just about every emergency room in Boston prior to that=20
December day where the light was so severely cold it felt shrill. Seizure=
s=20
brought me there, seizures which I experienced countless times for four l=
ong=20
years before they stopped and the madness erupted. And now, for over five=
=20
years, the psychotic breaks have occurred, volcanic in nature, way too ma=
ny=20
times, some of which landed me back in the ER or the psych ward.

The lock-up, the nuthouse. So just what is life like behind the red line?=
 Surely=20
it merits being called an inferno. Surely it=92s like living in a void sl=
it in the side of=20
time. It is a kind of incarceration where all the patients are players in=
 a=20
tragedy of Shakespearean proportion. It=92s a haunted tunnel in which one=
 hears=20
anonymous screams or a wax museum, each of us rigid with pain. The =93us=94=
=20
being a community of dying souls=97the demented, tormented thrust into he=
ll=20
holes that are gaping wounds, the only comfort being that there is an =93=
us.=94=20
None of us are alone=97one patient walks the hallways hours on end, anoth=
er=20
caves into the lair of despair, still another talks out loud to no one, m=
aking=20
elaborate plans=97when to get one=92s hair done or buy tickets to go to=20=

symphony=97this =93us=94 is a =93we=94 and thus we share a huge common=20=

denominator; we are all touched in the head, a little kooky, or most poli=
tely, a=20
bit too eccentric to exist anywhere else except behind the red line.

It=92s just one more way of being devastated. That my first hospitalizati=
on=20
occurred on my beloved son=92s birthday is a heartbreak I will carry unti=
l I die. O=20
how I longed to be back in the maternity ward laboring to give birth inst=
ead of=20
wanting to create my own demise. How many times have I crowned on the=20
cusp of death wherein the only word I can muster and master is die? I wan=
t to=20
orchestrate my own death, I have written or said far too often, my only=20=

motto: annihilate the violated because my brand of madness is the result =
of=20
severe childhood abuse committed by both of my parents. Abuse I buried in=
 a=20
cavern so deep I lived in a coma of unconsciousness that exploded into=20=

concussions of consciousness that came not prior to, but after my initial=
=20
hospitalization. This much I know: abuse is taboo and I have been thoroug=
hly=20
schooled in the drama of trauma and know, as well, what it=92s like to be=
 was=20
partially dead in the head for almost five decades.=20

That day in December I was, of course, in the ER for hours moving in and =
out=20
of psychosis. Monkeys walked out of walls, a den of lions was ensnared=20=

beneath my bed which I told my biologist husband to tell them to go away.=
 He=20
did so, calmly, firmly, but imagine his terror at seeing his Elizabeth go=
ne=20
completely out of her mind.

Late that night I was finally admitted after being given a neurological t=
est,=20
one that I knew by rote from the seizure years. Then came the body check,=
=20
the patting up and done like a cop searching for weapons. Off came my=20
wedding ring, my good earrings. My hastily packed bag was thoroughly=20
checked for sharps, cords, anything that could do me in even though I was=
=20
already done in.

I had to wait for hours for my bedtime meds, was put on a new one called=20=

Risperadol which was meant to be =93psychic glue.=94 I was just another H=
umpty=20
Dumpty fallen from the wall and all the king=92s horses and all the king=92=
s men=20
couldn=92t put me back together again, but the new med did. Eons later, I=
=92m now=20
on three times as much of Risperadol and take three tabs of it whenever I=
=20
have a psychic break and must wait while literally screaming my bloody he=
ad=20
off until the drug kicks in. Once I was in a state so severe and prolonge=
d, I=20
downed a dozen tabs, landed in the psych ward again because I had taken a=
n=20
accidental overdose.

The first time I was admitted, voluntarily, I was given a private room, m=
uch to=20
my relief. I cried myself to sleep in the wee hours while clutching my so=
n=92s=20
favorite teddy bear. This bear has come with me every time I=92ve been=20=

hospitalized as a kind of surrogate son. That son, as well as my doctor a=
nd=20
dog keep me on, however precariously, on terra firma, that is until the n=
ext=20
quake of madness hits me putting me once again on the verge of psychic=20=

extinction.

In the unit, the keepers and the kept are separated by a tidal abyss. The=
=20
keepers check the kept every ten minutes round the clock, hand out the me=
ds=20
and make sure they=92re taken, take one=92s pulse and temperature every m=
orning,=20
have the keys that might let one free, but are used to lock the locked up=
 ones=20
in the shower where razors are verboten. They guard the halls and every=20=

morning, precisely at 4:00 a.m., I would awaken, pace the small stretch o=
f=20
hallway between my room and the guards until the community room opened at=
=20
6:00. Then I could go make tea, quietly pad back to bed in the flannel=20=

nightgown I wore morning, noon and night, and read the mythic Aneid in=20=

mythic madness.

The first morning I was there, I paced around the bed, then ended standin=
g=20
up on it, terrified, because I was sure the floor was swarming with poiso=
n=20
insects whose bites could kill me. My Dantesque hell realm of insanity ha=
s put=20
me in a minefield because I never know when I might land on a one and be=20=

blown away in pain so acute my only wish is a death wish.

Life among the deranged has had an equalizing effect. I often saw my agon=
y=20
reflected in someone else=92s eyes such that I wanted to give that fellow=
=20
sufferer a hug, but no touching was allowed in the unit. There are rules =
to be=20
followed, a very strict list. If a rule was broken, one was sent, like a =
naughty=20
child, to his or her room for very long time-outs. One man, a tailor, was=
 never=20
allowed to leave his room. He stood in the doorway during all his waking =
hours=20
like a broken scarecrow and once I was scolded for talking with him. Upon=
 my=20
release, I gave him the rest of my paper and a pencil that I had scribble=
d=20
fragments of poems on so he could draw suits and dresses. His look of=20
gratitude was so profound I only wanted to sob.

In the lock-up the kept are kept busy by their keepers. One is not allowe=
d=20
was not allowed to stay in bed all day. In the morning we were counted=20=

before we could eat breakfast, then we went to groups all day and finally=
=20
gather in the community room come evening to go round the circle and repo=
rt=20
one positive thing that had happened that day.

I remember crying a lot. I remember hiding quarters in a sock so I could =
make=20
calls out on one of the two phones on the ward. I remember staring out th=
e=20
suicide-proof window in my room longing to fall to the pavement below. I =
was=20
haunted by all the other half-mad, self-destructive poets=97Lowell, Sexto=
n,=20
Berryman, Plath=97and felt a sort of camaraderie with their ghosts. I fel=
t that=20
same camaraderie with the other patients. We were in it together, all tak=
en=20
out of the world because we were suicidal, crazed, debilitated=97in short=
, not=20
fit for society.

We had our own society. We were colleagues passing each other in the=20
hallway, working together in groups, telling each other the specifics of=20=

whatever form of mental illness that kept us behind the red line. Mine wa=
s, is=20
Borderline Personality Disorder, a diagnosis I didn=92t know until after =
my release,=20
one that came out of a survey test hundreds of questions long that I took=
=20
soon after my arrival. It is a mood disorder, biologically-based that=92s=
=20
exacerbated by childhood trauma. One, two years after my first=20
hospitalization, I remembered the primitive, primary truma, that is, of m=
y=20
mother whacking the back of my head with a baseball bat when I was three =
or=20
four years old. I remember hitting the floor which had black and white ti=
les like=20
a chessboard, me the pawn, she the ruthless queen holding me in checkmate=
.=20
Years after that, while in an episode of great intensity, I recalled how =
my=20
father decapitated my life-size doll in my playhouse, then told me that=92=
s what=20
would happen to me if I didn=92t comply with him. These memories and othe=
r=20
assorted, horrific ones, buried deeper than deep, are what made my childh=
ood=20
blocked out with blackouts and are what lead me to life behind the red li=
ne.

Being suicidal is what kept me in the lock-up. It is a holding tank, a ha=
lfway=20
house between life and death, a hang out for lost souls, broken people, a=
=20
cuckoo limbo. If I know what it=92s like to be kept, then Somerville-base=
d poet,=20
Doug Holder, who has worked at a psychiatric hospital in the Boston area =
for=20
years, knows what it=92s like to be a keeper, or more kindly, a caregiver=
. Hence=20
we share a particular knowledge, the flipped sides of a single coin and p=
lan to=20
give readings together, thus creating a dialogue, a crucial one about wha=
t it=92s=20
like to be at either end of the spectrum of life in the unit.

That I survived my childhood is a miracle. That God has put a pen in my h=
and=20
is another one. I have written in line after line about the hellish dimen=
sions of=20
my illness and of life in the unit. I should have used red ink, blood-red=
, to ink=20
the lines that have resulted in two collections of poetry. The first, My =
Life as=20
a Doll, brought out by Autumn House Press in May =9208, is my survivor=92=
s tale, a=20
memoir in verse about my mother=92s violence. The second book, not yet ou=
t=20
but someday, one day will be, also by Autumn House is titled The Fire Bon=
es=20
and it chronicles my father=92s sexual abuse. It is meant to be the compa=
nion=20
book to My Life as a Doll.

Red lines then as scaffolding for my particular horror story. Yesterday, =
in the=20
strangest of places=97a car dealership=97there was a huge poster that=20
read, =93Thou Shalt Seek the Red Line.=94 Eerie to find it there, to pond=

meaning, yet a vision soon came to me while walking by the sea of a red l=
ine=20
encircling the earth with the whole human race, hand-in-hand, toeing it. =
Every=20
one of us is susceptible to life behind that red line, many have crossed =
it=20
either as the kept, the keepers or their loved ones and have felt just ho=

universal suffering is. Let=92s stand together then on the red line, link=

Dear Friends,
=20
Creating time and space for poets to present their work to an open audience
is at the heart of the Project=B9s existence. Next week we have 3 great
consecutive readings that serve as our Spring fundraiser. Attending one or
ALL of these events is a perfect way to show how exuberantly you support
poetry and The Poetry Project!

We love a full house but if you can=B9t make it please consider making a $25
donation (about the price of 3 admissions) here
<http://poetryproject.org/get-involved/donate-now> .

And check out our blog <http://poetryproject.org/project-blog> for a new
post from guest blogger Edwin Torres, Star Black=B9s photos from Kenward
Elmslie=B9s 80th Birthday Reading and a video clip of
Ruxandra Cesereanu & Andrei Codrescu reading from FORGIVEN SUBMARINE.

Love,=20

Simon Cutts & Nancy Kuhl

Simon Cutts is a poet, artist and editor who began Coracle in the early
1970s, having worked with small publications from the 1960s. He began makin=
g
work through concrete poetry, a form of visual presentation of the poem on
the page. Now he sees book-form as the physical metaphor for the poem
itself. The Coracle Press Archives are held in the Getty Research Institute
in Los Angeles. A recent book of essays, Some Forms of Availability, was
published last year by Granary Books, New York. Nancy Kuhl=B9s first
full-length collection of poems, The Wife of the Left Hand, was published i=
n
2007 by Shearsman Books. She is the author of The Nocturnal Factory, a
chapbook published in 2008 by Ugly Duckling Presse. Another chapbook, Means
of Securing Houses &c. from Mischief by Thunder and Lightning, is
forthcoming from Propolis Press. She is co-editor of Phylum Press, a small
poetry publisher and Curator of Poetry of the Yale Collection of American
Literature at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.

John Giorno

John Giorno was born in New York and graduated from Columbia University in
1958. Four years later, he met Andy Warhol, who became an important

He was the =B3star=B2 of Warhol=B9s film Sleep. He has collaborated with William
Burroughs, John Ashbery, Ted Berrigan, Patti Smith, Laurie Anderson, Philip
Glass, Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Mapplethorpe. In the decade of the
2000s he has collaborated with Rirkirt Tirvanija, Pierre Huyge, Elizabeth
Peyton and Ugo Rondinone, who is his partner. He is the author of ten books=
,
including You Got to Burn to Shine, Cancer in my Left Ball, Grasping at
Emptiness, Suicide Sutra, and has produced 59 LPs, CDs, tapes cassettes,
videopaks and DVDs for Giorno Poetry Systems. He founded the AIDS Treatment
Project and is an important force in the development of Tibetan Buddhism in
the West.

Another one of the greats has passed into the (mostly) invisible world.
But he'll be under our bootsoles and in the aether into which and from
which we draw poetry, which is he, Robin, Robin Blaser, puckish and
ever-burning.

I'm wondering whether  anyone else encountered this problem  and how they
remedied it. I attempted to send quite a large file through  Outlook. I,
unfortunately, have the VISTA operating system. The file  seems to have
gotten stuck in Outlook and keeps attempting to send it. I've gone into the
outbox to delete it without success. Help me if you can I'm feeling down.

Does anyone know of a place to stay in Philadelphia for a few nights in the

doors 7pm, reading 7:30pm

The Carleton Tavern (upstairs),
223 Armstrong (at Parkdale)

Monday, May 25, 2009

with readings by:

	Clint Burnham (Vancouver)
	Christine Stewart (Edmonton)
	Ken Belford (Prince George)
	Peter Midgley (Edmonton)
	& Michelle Smith (Edinburgh)

author bios:

Clint Burnham is a Vancouver writer and teacher. His most recent books
include The Benjamin Sonnets (Bookthug, 2009), Rental Van (Anvil, 2007),
and Smoke Show (Arsenal Pulp, 2005).

Christine Stewart writes, teaches and researches experimental poetry and
poetics in the English and Film Department, University of Alberta.
Selected Publications: This Then Would Be the Conversation." Antiphonies:
Essays on Womens Experimental Poetries in Canada. The Gig. 2008.
Propositions from Under Mill Creek Bridge. Virgin Press. 2007. The Trees
of Periphery: above/ground press, 2007. Pessoa's July: or the months of
astonishments. Nomados Press. 2006. "We Lunch Nevertheless among
Reinvention." Chicago Review. 2006. from Taxonomy. West House Press, 2003.

Ken Belford is the author of six books of poetry including lan(d)guage
(Caitlin Press 2008), and when snakes awaken (Nomados 2007). A proponent
of what he has termed lan(d)guage, Belford assembles his intellectually
independent sequences out of the shifting language of the BC interior,
writing out a type of poetic pidgin by mixing language markers of the
modern west coast with an older contact lingo of the lands beyond the edge
of the farmers and ranchers field. Self educated, Belford has lived in the
roadless mountains of the headwaters of Northern BC's Nass River for half
his life. He adapts language and ideas, making a writing with a governance
and order of his own. Lan(d)guage is his sixth book. He will be reading
from lan(d)guage and a new manuscript, decompositions, to be published by
Talon.

Peter Midgley is a storyteller and a writer of childrens books that have
won international awards and have been translated into 20 languages. He is
also the author of two plays, Archetypes and Namlish, a political farce
about Namibian independence. Peter writes in both English and Afrikaans
and his poetry has appeared in the South African journals, Literator and
New Coin. Some poems also appear in The Story that Brought Me Here: To
Edmonton from Everywhere. He is currently working on a bilingual volume of
poems, perhaps i should / miskien moet ek and book-length creative
non-fiction project, A Truce Stranger than Fiction: Reflections on
Namibian Independence.

Michelle Denise Smith is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of
Edinburgh. She was awarded a doctorate in English literature by the
University of Alberta in 2008. Her poetry has appeared most recently in
Arc, Grain, CV2, and The New Quarterly. She is fascinated by travel
or,more to the point, Paris, and she is accordingly at work on a
collection of travel essays and a novel titled Hitting the Ground. She is
also close to completing her first collection of poems, mnemosyne above
dark waters.

Dear All,

My third book, These Hands Are Not Ours, published by Earl of Seacliff Art =
Workshop, is now available for pre-order. It will be released in early June=
 2009.



Jill Chan's These Hands Are Not Ours, her third book of poetry, explores th=
e deep and sometimes uncanny relationships between our human experiences an=
d our wider, more tenuous though, at times, no less ambiguous experiences o=
f the divine.  These poems are written in an almost subliminal language fil=
led with beautiful tension and silent immensity.


Perhaps we are never created
until we are brave enough
to be made.

Until these hands
are not ours
but the sky=E2=80=99s,

we claim too much
of the night,
the love,
its making.


                  (excerpt from 'Claim')


Jill Chan grew up in Manila, Philippines. She has a Bachelor of Science in =
Chemistry. In 1994, she migrated to New Zealand.  Her poems have appeared i=
n Poetry New Zealand, JAAM, Trout, Takahe, Asia and Pacific Writers Network=
, MiPOesias, Tears in the Fence, foam:e, and New Zealand Poetry Sound Archi=
ve.  Her two previous collections, The Smell of Oranges, and Becoming Someo=
ne Who Isn't, were published by Earl of Seacliff Art Workshop.  She is the =
editor of Poetry Sz: demystifying mental illness, and Numinous: Spiritual P=
oetry.


Please mention that you learned about These Hands Are Not Ours through the =
author when you order your copy via the link below:

Thank you very much.

Cheers

Jill

In *Quaternity*, Scott Glassman and Sheila E. Murphy ask, "...and what
divination will rhetorize the oppositorum / attract the needed nightshade /
counter pull assume high produce / to be revered osteo"?  Do you understand
the question?  Whether you reply Yes or No, the point is that the excerpt
can be understood to be a question.  How? Through the push and pull of its
music.  *Quaternity* asks the reader to trust in words =97 the word itself =
and
not what it supposedly signifies.  For the word itself can be a musical not=
e
and it can suffice (more than suffice!) that certain combinations sing.  Th=
e
dictionary bows to Glassman and Murphy's seductive diction: "No curve to
infinity can mimic bells." =97*Eileen Tabios*



These collaborative pages elaborate vocal colors and chord-changing
arrangements of sensory elision: musics of meaning. *Quaternity* is
"lubrication-lit," aglow with the sensual pleasure of its making.  Glassman
and Murphy court rapture "where frogleaps suture kismet vines." =97*Tom
Beckett*



In *Quaternity*, Glassman and Murphy cease to make the usual "third thing"
of collaboration =96 art and meaning immanent in shared composition =96 the
end.  Let the third be words and process, this material book, or tent
camping, and start the box step waltz of four:  author, author, writing,
lunge. =97*Catherine Daly*

Kitsilano poet remembered for sense of humour
Robin Blaser continued to teach rising poets after taking early retirement from faculty at Simon Fraser University
By Kelly Sinoski, Vancouver SunMay 11, 2009


Kitsilano poet Robin Blaser has died.
Robin Blaser, a renowned Kitsilano poet whose work was devoted to the avant-garde, has died after a battle with cancer.
His death, at the St. James Cottage Hospice in Vancouver last week, was just shy of his 84th birthday.
"He
took the world with him when he went," friend and fellow poet George
Bowering said Sunday. "That's how I feel ... he really loved the world
a lot."
Blaser, who was raised in a small Idaho town, became one
of California's triumvirate poets, along with Robert Duncan and Jack
Spicer. The trio participated in what is known as the Berkeley
Renaissance, contributing to postmodern poetry.
In 1966, Blaser
moved to Canada after accepting a position at Simon Fraser University.
Nearly a decade later, in 1974, he became a Canadian citizen and met
his life partner, David Farwell.
Bowering, who travelled to San
Francisco in the early '60s to meet Blaser, said he had much respect
for the erudite poet with a great sense of humour.
Blaser not
only received the Order of Canada in 2005 for his contribution to the
arts, but was winner of the Griffin Poetry Prize for lifetime
achievement in 2006 and the Griffin Prize for Poetry in 2008. He was
awarded an honorary doctorate by SFU in March 2009.
Bowering said
one of Blaser's major strengths was as a teacher. Despite taking early
retirement from SFU in the 1980s, he continued to teach rising poets in
his Kitsilano home.
"Students kept going to Robin's place instead
of to Simon Fraser," Bowering said. "He was a great teacher for those
who kept going to see him and for those who read his books."
Bowering
noted that even though Blaser was one of Canada's best poets, "you
would have to go a long way to find an English professor in Ottawa
who's read him."
He described Blaser's work as challenging and
hard work yet delightful, noting he never wrote straightforward
sentences and it was as if he "kicked the hell out of the English
language."
"You've got to have a lot of nerve to dig into [Blaser's] book and all those essays," Bowering said.
But
when you do, he said, lessons can be learned. And in his short essays,
Blaser's "great sense of humour" shines through, especially in his work
over the past 20 years.
"He was a guy who could tell you everything and then tell you a joke," Bowering said.
Blaser is survived by Farwell as well as by his sister Hope Samac and brother Augustus Blaser.

Creeley dedicated a poem in For Love?

TONIGHT
MONDAY MAY 11, 2009
POETRY PROJECT
8:00 pm

Tonight I will have the pleasure of introducing Simon Cutts and Nancy Kuhl
at the Poetry Project. This will be my last night as curator of the Monday
Night Reading Series. Thanks to the staff, volunteers, readers, and everyon=
e
who has attended. It's been a blast. Hope to see you tonight!

Simon Cutts is a poet, artist and editor who began Coracle in the early
1970s, having worked with small publications from the 1960s. He began makin=
g
work through concrete poetry, a form of visual presentation of the poem on
the page. Now he sees book-form as the physical metaphor for the poem
itself. The Coracle Press Archives are held in the Getty Research Institute
in Los Angeles. A recent book of essays, Some Forms of Availability, was
published last year by Granary Books, New York.

Nancy Kuhl=B9s first full-length collection of poems, The Wife of the Left
Hand, was published in 2007 by Shearsman Books. She is the author of The
Nocturnal Factory, a chapbook published in 2008 by Ugly Duckling Presse.
Another chapbook, Means of Securing Houses &c. from Mischief by Thunder and
Lightning, is forthcoming from Propolis Press. She is co-editor of Phylum
Press, a small poetry publisher and Curator of Poetry of the Yale Collectio=
n
of American Literature at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

a little Glen Gould trivia from wiki... Gould, like Wittengstein's older? brother, was "possessed with genius." Wittengstein thought of himself as rather dull by comparison.
***************************************************
***Having entertained a lifelong fascination with the hereafter, with theories of reincarnation and mystic numerology akin to those of Arnold Schoenberg, Gould believed that he would be reincarnated two years after his death in the person of Sam Caldwell, a media theorist and contrapuntal poet. This belief was strengthened by Gould's regrets (expressed particularly in his 1980 interviews with Bruno Monsaigneon) that he had not brought his contrapuntal radio work to a satisfactory stage of completion. With plans to explore to its logical conclusion the application of Wagnerian leitmotifs and J.S. Bach's contrapuntal textures in the medium of the spoken word, and particularly in poetry, Gould conceived of this fictional "second go-around" toward the end of his already immensely productive lifetime.

The Dusie Kollektiv is made up of 50 poets who each produce a chapbook for =
distribution among the kollektiv members. In past years, participants have =
published their own chapbooks, but for this year, the third of the kollekti=
v, members published one another's chapbooks from author-editor combination=
s which were created randomly. Many editors published their chapbook under =
the name of a small press with which they were already affiliated, and some=
 created small presses just for the kollektiv. The point with the various n=
ames of press was to reify ownership and flood the market with 50 new press=
es.=20

Each year is different for the kollektiv, as every year there are different=
 participants. With that said, there are many loyal kollektiv members who h=
ave been with the project since the first year. Change is inevitable, and e=
nergy and enthusiasm are necessary, but ultimately it is the group ethos wh=
ich has kept them together and moving forward. The project focuses more on =
process and risk, and writers have no inhibition regarding publishing as it=
 is a completely open platform and all works get published. Also, the group=
 exchange gives an extra push in way of timeline and production, which also=
 motivates creation.

Cara Benson edits the online journal Sous Rature. Her first full length col=
lection (made) is forthcoming from BookThug. Her chapbook Quantum Chaos and=
 Poems: A Manifest(o)ation (BookThug) co-won the 2008 bpNichol Prize. Other=
 chaps include He Writes (No Press), UP (Dusie Kollectiv), and, with Kai Fi=
erle-Hedrick and Kathrin Schaeppi, Spell/ing ( ) Bound (ellectrique press).=
 Benson edited the interdisciplinary book Prediction (forthcoming from Chai=
n). She lives and writes in the analog world of upstate New York.

review in the upcoming issue of Jacket. She is also co-curator of the Bard =
Roving Reading Series.

in conjunction with Homebase IV


about Homebase:
{HomeBase is an artist-run international art project, which aims to
nurture a rich contextual exploration around the archetype of home. In
pursuing this exploration annually, HomeBase seeks to integrate
contemporary art into the everyday urban experience and to challenge
the role of art as an educational tool for cross-cultural dialog and
community cultivation.

The HomeBase model consists of marking a temporary base, a raw urban
architectural site in a neighborhood undergoing change, and inviting
international artists to engage in a three-week workshop that includes
study, dialogue and communal dinners. As artists explore the personal
and critical aspects of home and city dwelling, they create
site-responsive installations in rooms in the base location.

The workshop is followed by a 3 week happening. The HomeBase site
opens its doors to the public free of charge and features lectures,
art talks
, performances, and interactive events which transform the
site into an exciting temporary urban platform. By merging community,
architecture, and art, HomeBase becomes a home to an intercultural and
inter-disciplinary experience.

Selected by New York Magazine's Jerry Saltz as Critic's Pick in 2008
and featured on NY1 and many other notable media channels, HomeBase
has welcomed thousands of visitors through its doors and is expecting
many more in during its future projectst in New York, Berlin, and
London.}

DUBLIN (AP) -- When Dublin university student Shane Fitzgerald posted a
poetic but phony quote on Wikipedia=2C he was testing how our globalized=2C
increasingly Internet-dependent media was upholding accuracy and
accountability in an age of instant news.

                       =20
His report card: Wikipedia passed. Journalism flunked.
The
sociology major's obituary-friendly quote -- which he added to the
Wikipedia page of Maurice Jarre hours after the French composer's death
March 28 -- flew straight on to dozens of U.S. blogs and newspaper Web
sites in Britain=2C Australia and India. They used the fabricated
material=2C Fitzgerald said=2C even though administrators at the free
online encyclopedia twice caught the quote's lack of attribution and
removed it.
A full month went by and nobody noticed the editorial
fraud. So Fitzgerald told several media outlets they'd swallowed his
baloney whole.
"I was really shocked at the results from the
experiment=2C" Fitzgerald=2C 22=2C said Monday in an interview a week after
one newspaper at fault=2C The Guardian of Britain=2C became the first to
admit its obituarist lifted material straight from Wikipedia.
"I
am 100 percent convinced that if I hadn't come forward=2C that quote
would have gone down in history as something Maurice Jarre said=2C
instead of something I made up=2C" he said. "It would have become another
example where=2C once anything is printed enough times in the media
without challenge=2C it becomes fact."
So far=2C The Guardian is the
only publication to make a public mea culpa=2C while others have
eliminated or amended their online obituaries without any reference to
the original version -- or in a few cases=2C still are citing
Fitzgerald's florid prose weeks after he pointed out its true origin.
"One
could say my life itself has been one long soundtrack=2C" Fitzgerald's
fake Jarre quote read. "Music was my life=2C music brought me to life=2C
and music is how I will be remembered long after I leave this life.
When I die there will be a final waltz playing in my head that only I
can hear."
Fitzgerald said one of his University College Dublin
classes was exploring how quickly information was transmitted around
the globe. His private concern was that=2C under pressure to produce news
instantly=2C media outlets were increasingly relying on Internet sources
-- none more ubiquitous than the publicly edited Wikipedia.
When
he saw British 24-hour news channels reporting the death of the triple
Oscar-winning composer=2C Fitzgerald sensed what he called "a golden
opportunity" for an experiment on media use of Wikipedia.
He said
it took him less than 15 minutes to fabricate and place a quote
calculated to appeal to obituary writers without distorting Jarre's
actual life experiences. He noted that the Wikipedia listing on Jarre
did not have any other strong quotes.
If anything=2C Fitzgerald
said=2C he expected newspapers to avoid his quote because it had no link
to a source -- and even might trigger alarms as "too good to be true."
But many blogs and several newspapers used the quotes at the start or
finish of their obituaries.
He said the Guardian was the only
publication to respond to him in detail and with remorse at its own
editorial failing. Others=2C he said=2C treated him as a vandal who was
solely to blame for their cut-and-paste content.
"The moral of
this story is not that journalists should avoid Wikipedia=2C but that
they shouldn't use information they find there if it can't be traced
back to a reliable primary source=2C" said the readers' editor at the
Guardian=2C Siobhain Butterworth=2C in the May 4 column that revealed
Fitzgerald as the quote author.
"It's worrying that the
misinformation only came to light because the perpetrator of the
deception emailed publishers to let them know what he'd done=2C and it's
regrettable that he took nearly a month to do so=2C" she wrote.
Fitzgerald
said he had waited in part to test whether news organizations or the
public would smoke out the quote's lack of provenance. He said he was
troubled that none did.
And he warned that a truly malicious
hoaxer could have evaded Wikipedia's own informal policing by getting a
newspaper to pick up a false piece of information -- as happened when
his quote made its first of three appearances -- and then use those
newspaper reports as a credible footnote for the bogus quote.
"I
didn't want to be devious=2C" he said. "I just wanted to show how the
24-hour=2C minute-by-minute media were now taking material straight from
Wikipedia because of the deadline pressure they're under."

"NONE OF THE ABOVE : Assembling, Collaborating and Publishing in the
Eternal Network"

A CALL FOR PARTICIPATION, to poets and artists ...

In an ambitious assembling-style project, Minnesota Center for Book
Arts invites any and all to send 125 copies of anything that will fit
into a 9" x 12" envelope.

This project is in conjunction with MCBA=92s upcoming exhibition "None
of the Above : Assembling, Collaborating and Publishing in the Eternal
Network."

An assembling project represents the ultimate in democratic art.
Everything submitted will be included in the publication (or series of
publications, depending on how many people participate).  In return
for your efforts, you receive a selection of 89 different works
created by others who participate.

What to send?  Any means of expression is fine (paper, CDs, stickers,
popsicle sticks) but it can be no larger than 8.5" x 11" (21.6 cm x
27.9 cm) and 1/8" thick (.3 cm).  It can be folded, stitched, crushed,
flattened, etc.  Shrunk-via-shrink-ray submissions are okay.  If you
need a theme, submissions will be compiled in publications titled
"None of the Above."  How=92s that for clear direction?

How many to send?  Submit 125 copies.  89 of these will go to other
participants.  Additional copies will be archived, distributed to
donors/volunteers, and a small number will be sold as a fundraiser for
MCBA.

What else to send?  So that we can send you your copy of the
publication, include a sheet of paper with your name and postal
address.  Also include $5 in U.S. funds =96 checks payable to Minnesota
Center for Book Arts =96 to cover the cost of envelopes and postage.

Where to send ...

"None of the Above,"
c/o Minnesota Center for Book Arts,
1011 Washington Avenue South, Suite 100,
Minneapolis, Minnesota,
55415

Deadlines:  If we receive submissions by August 21, 2009, they will be
displayed as part of the associated exhibition.  To be included in the
publication, submissions must be received no later than October 24,
2009.

A special collating event will occur at MCBA on Saturday, October 24,
2009.  For those who would like to participate, you may bring your 125
copies that evening rather than mailing.  Then there is no fee.

Please e-mail Jeff Rathermel, MCBA=92s Artistic Director, at

jrathermel@mnbookarts.org

by October 16, 2009 if you will be participating.  Arrive at 7:00

Yours for the poetry of assembling,

We are so thrilled to announce these upcoming summer workshops with Small
Press Traffic.
Please pass the word along to your friends and students.


*SITE-BASED PRACTICES  with David Buuck & Jessica Tully
*Marin Headlands Bunkers
Sunday June 21, 11am-2pm
$40 ($30 for students and members)

Please join writer & critic David Buuck & artist & activist Jessica Tully
for a site-specific workshop at the former military bunkers in the Marin
Headlands. We will explore a wide range of methods and practices related to
site-based writing & art practices, including several on-site exercises &
experiments. This workshop is designed for ALL levels of interested writers
& artists, to explore how we engage place, site, environment & the politica=
l
histories therein as writers, artists, and citizens. We will provide
optional pre-workshop reading that covers both the site's history as well a=
s
essays on site-writing & site-specific art practices. We will discuss &
explore writing & research techniques as well as much more performative &
embodied strategies of site-work, so be prepared to try new ways of
thinking, moving, and working!

Note: We will arrange for car-pooling to the site, as well as lunch. Bring
notebook, camera, sunscreen, outdoor shoes, layers for wind, etc. The Marin
Headlands is home to several former military installations, including the
bunkers, the Nike Missile Site, and the current home of the Headlands Cente=
r
for the Arts.

*Conceptualism and Craft with K. Silem Mohammad
*CCA San Francisco Campus
Monday through Thursday July 6-10th
Time: 6pm-9pm
$125 / $100 students and members

This four-day workshop will begin by examining and rehearsing various
techniques central to Conceptualist poetics, broadly considered so as to
encompass appropriation, transcription, and other versions of what Kenneth
Goldsmith has called =93uncreative writing,=94 as well as the deliberately
awkward and expressively debased gestures associated with Flarf. We will
then look at these techniques in relation to older and more traditional
notions of craft: can there be coherent criteria for craft-based evaluation
of texts written using blankly conceptual or intentionally =93bad=94 method=
s? Do
any of the familiar aesthetic categories still apply, and if so, how?


*Oakland A's /White Sox Game  with Bill Luoma*
Oakland Coliseum
Saturday August 18th
11am workshop/ 1:05pm game
$40 includes admission to the game and a baseball to take home/ $30 student=
s
and members

In the spirit of the Basketball Aritcle by Meyer and Waldman and Yo-Yo's
with Money by Berrigan and Schiff, we will spend some time working on the
body of baseball & poetry. Or just poetry since that encompasses baseball.


*Note* Scholarship admission is available for those who need it. Please
contact Samantha for more information.

There's a bio in German at
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Gerhardthttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Gerhardt.
He and his wife ran a press and a revue, he translated, edited, wrote
poems and essays that are still read in Germany. Committed suicide in
1954--he was 27. Olson addressed two poems to him, "To Gerhardt,
there among Europe's things of which he has written us in his 'Brief
an Creeley und Olson,'" and "The Death of Europe."

To practice distributivity is to acknowledge the inevitability of
pataphor, the paralinguisticality of perception, the boundedness of
action, the passion of ideas, the beauty of era, the chains of
bureaucracy, the possibilities of intuition and the uncanny delight of
chance. In contrast to the syllogistic rationality of bureaudocile
logistics, distributivity is situational, shifts with the winds, courts
contradiction, feeds on inconsistency. I embrace a distributivity of
bewilderment. I don't know where I am going and never have, just try to
grapple as best I can with where I am. The dissemination that most
engages me is not theoretically perspicacious. Indeed, it has a
distributivity and an aesthetics, but not a predetermining theory. It is
multiform and chaotic, always reformulating and regrouping. Competence is
less important to me than responsiveness; mobility, ingenuity and
invention more important than solutions to predefined problems.

In the current issue of Art In America, Leo Rubenfein has written a very go=
od piece on Robert Frank's, The Americans -=A0 this in association with the=
 Frank show that started from the National Gallery of Art In Washington.=A0=
 The show is just opening at San Francisco's MOMA.

Rubenfein makes connections between Frank and the techniques of poets (part=
icularly around the employment of images) who were active in Switzerland in=
 the early 40's before Frank came to the States. And how these practices in=
formed his picture taking, including the sequencing of the work in the book=
.=A0=20

Some of which may explain the impulsive enthrall by poets with the book whe=

Gerhardt was a German poet who befriended Creeley by correspondence, and
then in person when he and Ann were living in France in 1951. He also
corresponded with Charles Olson, and translated Olson, Creeley, Pound,
Williams and others. He published the magazine *Fragmente*, which included a
story by Creeley in the second (and last) issue*. *He died in 1954, amid
mounting debt and despair.

A German-language tribute to Gerhardt can be found

**Dusie Press
http://www.dusie.org/

The Dusie Kollektiv is made up of 50 poets who each produce a chapbook =20=

for distribution among the kollektiv members. In past years, =20
participants have published their own chapbooks, but for this year, =20
the third of the kollektiv, members published one another's chapbooks =20=

from author-editor combinations which were created randomly. Many =20
editors published their chapbook under the name of a small press with =20=

which they were already affiliated, and some created small presses =20
just for the kollektiv. The point with the various names of press was =20=

to reify ownership and flood the market with 50 new presses.

Each year is different for the kollektiv, as every year there are =20
different participants. With that said, there are many loyal kollektiv =20=

members who have been with the project since the first year. Change is =20=

inevitable, and energy and enthusiasm are necessary, but ultimately it =20=

is the group ethos which has kept them together and moving forward. =20
The project focuses more on process and risk, and writers have no =20
inhibition regarding publishing as it is a completely open platform =20
and all works get published. Also, the group exchange gives an extra =20
push in way of timeline and production, which also motivates creation.

bpNichol Prize. Other chaps include He Writes (No Press), UP (Dusie =20
Kollectiv), and, with Kai Fierle-Hedrick and Kathrin Schaeppi, Spell/=20
ing ( ) Bound (ellectrique press). Benson edited the interdisciplinary =20=

book Prediction (forthcoming from Chain). She lives and writes in the =20=

analog world of upstate New York.


**Elizabeth Bryant

experiment Defeffable, and CR79 Books. Her first full-length serial-=20

BREAKTHROUGH IN BERLIN
Saturday the 27th of June 2009

CALL FOR PROJECTS ...


** Description

"Breakthrough" proposes an experimental, interdisciplinary event
constructing a new field of research & play.  "Breakthrough" signals
the skewed extension & plain rupture with a series of earlier actions
[in London, Bergen, Berlin] exploring the material basis of technology
& expanding on the practice of life coding.

The term "breakthrough" describes a sudden shift in understanding or
technologies, & finally a clearing (Lichtung), an entry into unknown &
unmapped territories.  An enclosure is breached allowing access to
another, totally unforeseen state or space.  Communication is thus
implied, a new form of exchange, perhaps between two otherwise
unconnected domains, between the living & the dead, between many
worlds.  What does the sheer possibility of a "breakthrough" imply for
communication between the past & the future?

"Breakthrough," as event, signals a change in direction, a pointing
towards new ways of actively describing & creating the world.  Within
a complex mise en scene of workshops, lectures & performances, diverse
artists & poets, theorists, researchers, & hackers collaborate in the
creation of a "breakthrough" which can rupture the enclosure of
scientific rationalism & enlightenment without recourse to named
magic.

projects-berlin

http://www.1010.co.uk/


** Call for projects/actions:

"Breakthrough" calls for projects which perform, describe & construct
(in process) a rupture or breaking through of the projects of
rationalism & endeavour of past or future intention.  Projection &
play with time space co-ordinate points is encouraged.

Potential actions or investigations could very well extend into ...

practical endophysics, sound & radio wave transitions, diagrammatic
formation, clustering & islanding, simulations coding & exploration,
biologic interface, crashing, brain writing, construction,
environmental steganography, data forensics, escape hatch literature,
novel geometry description, life coding, poetry coding, interrupt
theatre, sexual coding, amateur radio astronomy, etc.

"Breakthrough" will be prepared within a three day workshop in Berlin,
towards the construction of a one day event distributed across the
city of Berlin, & maintained with a strict scheduling & interrupt
system backbone (micro-FM and Internet).

Please submit short messages of intent to

m@1010.co.uk

by the 29th of May 2009.

"Breakthrough" is supported by Hauptstadtkulturfonds, Berlin 2009

** Postscript:

Byrne:  "I do not want to get a long half-hour involvement about
Faraday cages, diodes, or transistors & so on.  Ken, in very simple
language & very shortly, have you been able to break this thing
technically?"

Attwood: "Technically, no."

THE HAIKU FOUNDATION

http://www.thehaikufoundation.org

Dear Friends:

The Haiku Foundation, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to
archive the accomplishments of the first century of haiku in English
and to create greater opportunities for its second, was chartered in
the state of Virginia, USA, on 6 January 2009.  It is a volunteer
organization primarily designed to create and implement projects
centered around haiku.  Most haiku organizations have privileged the
poet and her needs:  education, publication, socialization.  The Haiku
Foundation instead seeks to foster the growth of haiku itself.  This
is where poets come when they want to give back.

We are pleased to announce the public unveiling of our website.  We
hope you will visit it often and with pleasure.  Please tell us how it
serves you, and how it might serve you in the future.  And most of
all, we welcome your participation.  Please join us to help us realize
our goals.

Jim Kacian
The Haiku Foundation

http://www.thehaikufoundation.org

...

The Foundation appears to invite participation by a wide diversity of
poets.  And, it's web-site includes various examples by Marijan
Cekolj, David Cobb, James W. Hackett, Jack Kerouac, Ezra Pound, and
Richard Wright among other unexpected authors of haiku.

Lori,

I haven't read Gerhardt's poetry, but I know that he was a German poet who
published a couple issues of a magazine called Fragmente that included a
number of American poets and had an interest in Creeley's poetry.

There's a chapter on the poem and on Creeley's relationship with Gerhardt in
Ekbert Faas' book Robert Creeley: a Biography. The chapter starts on page
107 and is available through Google Books:
http://books.google.com/books?id=ztPfosyWpeAC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=%22rainer+gerhardt%22&source=bl&ots=2xqP0KST5j&sig=ls-sqt6gzbaUnI1GtLWk7RvQL78&hl=en&ei=EPcKStucAo6-NOrvuM8L&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#

Creeley also writes a short note about Gerhardt in his Collected Essays,
available here:
http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft4t1nb2hc&chunk.id=d0e10773&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e7777&brand=ucpress;query=rainer%20gerhardt#1

Hope that helps,

Andy

You cannot politically defy the institutions when all you really wanted was to be
clasped to their bosoms and hope in time to be cherished under the very framework of
oppressive values you are thinking of overcoming. That would be co-optation,
revolution only in the sense of a circulation of elites rather than the extirpation
of the very impulses of elitism.

Lori,
He was a post-WWII German poet who published Fragmente. See Creeley's
"Rainer Gerhardt: A Note" in Creeley's Collected Essays. Might also
want to look at Olson's poem " To Gerhardt There, Among Europe's
Things of Which He Has Written Us in His 'Brief an Creeley und
Olson." Also, you can track Creeley and Olson discussing him in their
correspondence.

Lori, =C2=A0i'm sure others on the list know real substantive things about =
RG, ... but who knows. maybe i'm wrong? =C2=A0the little i know, is:


1. Olson dedicated to him his poems, "To Gerhardt, There Among Europe's Thi=

=C2=A0 and then "The Death of Europe (a funeral poem for Rainer M. Gerhardt=
)" ...=C2=A0


2. as you might guess from all this, he was a poet very intensely concerned=
 with and responsive to US poets...


3. =C2=A0what else i've learned (and forgotten) =C2=A0i learned from the To=
m Clark Olson bio, ... i don't have it with me, but one of the first places=
 i'd start would be the index to that.... (not a real popular book on this =

Hi Lori,

From what I can find, Gerhardt was a German poet and friend of Creeley's in
the early 50s. He published the small magazine, *Fragmente*, and translated
two of Creeley's stories from *Gold Diggers* for its second issue in '52.
Late in '51, C went to Freiburg to visit him, and the Fass, Trombacco,
Mackinnon biography<http://books.google.com/books?id=ztPfosyWpeAC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=rainer+gerhardt&source=bl&ots=2xqP0KVS2j&sig=P2up8_66zlSPPRERWrstBMcHa-M&hl=en&ei=RgILSsGGFZWNtgf9zZjFAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPA107,M1>has
a short chapter (12) on the visit--which included a lot of late night
"conversation" and near fights--and the poem you mention in *For Love*,
which Olson really liked.

Mary Novik's *Robert Creeley: An Inventory* has several other references to
Gerhardt--looks like C published a note on him in the *Pound Newsletter*,
number 4 (October 1954).

Hope this helps out,

The reading at the White House I want to hear about will happen when all
the poets who have been dis-invited or turned down invitations are asked
to come and read...people like Sharon Olds and Sam Hamill come to mind.

There are many more.

Yours in Peace & Poetry,

This novel isn't suitable for you. The story is romantic and terrifying. Too
gloomy. You should read something delightful.

Dublin Writers Festival

Dear Administrators,

Once again the Dublin Writers Festival has excluded Irish-language
writers from any meaningful participation in the Festival events and
activities.  This behaviour by the organizers is shameful, offensive,
and imperious.  Indeed, I call for a boycott of the Dublin Writers
Festival.  It is my intention to urge writers, artists, and other
citizens (in Ireland, Britain, the U.S. and other countries) to
withdraw any and all support from the Festival and its activities.  I
urge an earthquake of a protest campaign until there is a constructive
remedy to this imperiousness!

For creative diversity in Ireland,

Greetings!

I had hoped that the days of literary and linguistic apartheid were
well over.  Seemingly not.  It would appear that your festival has
boycotted Irish-language writers.  How sad.  Pathetic, really, given
the fact that an anthology of contemporary Irish-language poetry and
prose, AMANAIRIS, has appeared in Slovenian and was recently launched
in the National Library, Dublin, and reported below in the Slovenian
press.

UbuWeb is now blogging about new resources on the site, focusing on lost gems and shedding light on some of the things you may have missed or might not have been aware exist in the vastness of the archive. Think of it as a textual analogy to the UbuWeb Podcasts or our monthly guest-curated Featured Resources but it happens a whole lot more frequently.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Palm Press is pleased to announce the publication of David Buuck's =
full-length collection of poetry: The Shunt

The Shunt provocatively explores one of our most ordinary experiences of =
social discomfort-embarrassment for the flailing comedian and his all =
too visible affective labor-in a strikingly intelligent and utterly =
heartbreaking way. For all its acerbic tonality, The Shunt's affective =
agenda is thus the exact opposite of ironic cynicism, which is one of =
this brilliantly discomforting book's most delightful surprises.-Sianne =
Ngai

With its stutters, fractures, puns, sarcasms, and ironies, The Shunt is =
part of a cluster of books recently written by US poets attempting to =
understand what it means to live in a country that is constantly bombing =
other countries. But with its relentless attention to the group =
psychosis that this state of siege induces in US citizens, The Shunt is =
also something sui generis. This is your brain on war. --Juliana Spahr

In a blow-up doll of "meaty-ations," David Buuck's "pre-enactments" push =
us over a speed hump--a "World Wide Wedge" whose word-wilding labors to =
de-desertify globalization as it runs on "war dash time." Split betwixt =
Ginsberg and Prince, paranomasia and stutter, every page of this =
"writing degree Xanax" will remind you to take your meds from a (n =
undisclosed) place in the bunk-bed of history.--Judith Goldman

Please join Mission17 Gallery & BARGE as we host another event in conjuncti=
on with the current =E2=80=9C17 Reasons Why=E2=80=9D exhibit, an ongoing re=
sidency exploring the cultural politics of the Mission district, hosted by =
David Buuck & BARGE. Writers, artists, & activists Erick Lyle, Kari Orvik, =
and Nick Pagoulatos will present recent work related to the Mission Distric=
t and anti-gentrification struggles in San Francisco. There will be food, d=
rinks, and conversation as well, so please come by!

Erick Lyle is a writer, musician, activist, and zine editor. He is the auth=
or of *On the Lower Frequencies: A Secret History of the City* (Soft Skull)=
, and since 1991 has edited the influential zine *Scam.* He has published w=
ork in a wide variety of cultural and political publications, performed in =
numerous bands, and worked with the Coalition on Homelessness in San Franci=
sco. He spent much of the 90=E2=80=99s hopping freight trains around the co=
untry and living without electricity in abandoned buildings. For most of 15=
 years, now, though, he has resided mostly in San Francisco.

Kari Orvik is a San Francisco photographer whose work in low-income housing=
 led her to start creating public portraiture projects. Like a portable JC =
Penney, she has set up on-site photo studios in SRO=E2=80=99s, on rooftops =
and on the street, where community members can get formal portraits for the=
ir own use. Displaying these portraits in public spaces has been a way to r=
ecognize as members of the community everyone who lives, works, hangs out i=
n or passes through our public spaces. In 2007 she received a San Francisco=
 Arts Commission Grant for her photo and video project Mission Portrait Stu=
dio.

Nick Pagoulatos is the Community Planning & Development Director at Dolores=
 Street Community Services, and the Coordinator for MAC, the Mission Anti-D=
isplacement Coalition, whose goal is to stop the displacement of working cl=
ass people in the Mission District and San Francisco. He has also worked as=
 the Project Director for St. Peter=E2=80=99s Housing Committee and at the =
Mission Economic Development Agency on community planning, economic develop=
ment, and land use issues. With a background in housing law and tenant advo=
cacy, he holds a J.D. from the New College of California.

This is an excellent issue, our largest ever! I was busy picking and
choosing for this issue while recovering. It was particularly irksome to no=
t
be able to fully edit as my heart wanted to do, but I was able to dedicate =
a
bit more time to the selection process. So hurray! We have work from writer=
s
at every stage in their career, from first publications to mid career to th=
e
well established! There is a delightful interplay between all of these
pieces that move around the vastness of contemporary poetry.

Our goal is to present poetry that does not suck. This is the only criteria
for our journal, well that and an interpretive freedom on the part of the
contemporary poet, prose poet or fiction writer, with exponents of a wide
range of viewpoints brought together to explore. And in that exploration we
do not mean one specific interpretive approach. However, the freedom for a
poet to come at the poem from a view that might well be extremely unusual
but is actually bound up firmly with the content of the poem =8B an approach
that is centered on communicating that content with as much impact and
individuality as possible. And with that, I think you will be extremely
pleased with this issue!

Hey there-
I'll be giving a 'performance lecture' of some sort next Sat, featuring rec=
ent BARGE projects, with the amazing Liz Glynn, as part of the General Proj=
ects series at Outpost for Contemporary Art. Hope you can come out---

David Buuck & Liz Glynn
Saturday, May 23 from 4-7pm
at Outpost for Contemporary Art
6375 N. Figueroa Street
Los Angeles, CA 90042
(323) 982-9461
http://www.outpost-art.org/

Liz Glynn is an LA-based artist who explores the ambition of empire and the=
 pleasure of ruin. Her practice seeks to embody dynamic cycles of growth an=
d decay, and to propose direct action through sculptural material. Recent w=
orks include the 24 Hour Roman Reconstruction Project at the New Museum, an=
d the In the Beginning is the End, a Processional for Los Angeles in Chinat=
own. Her work has also been presented at venues including Acuna-Hansen Gall=
ery (LA), John Connolly Presents (NYC), and Beta Level (Los Angeles), and w=
ill be included in an upcoming project at the Los Angeles County Museum of =
Art. She received her MFA from California Institute of the Arts, and her BA=
 from Harvard College. http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/liz-glynn/=20

BARGE (the Bay Area Group in Enviro-aesthetics) was started by David Buuck =
in 2003. BARGE has organized several (de)tours around the Bay Area, investi=
gating regional sites & spaces that are underrepresented & overlooked in mo=
re conventional touristic, commercial, & socio-political notions of place &=
 public space. BARGE investigates how vernacular landscapes =E2=80=94 from =
highways & billboards to waterfronts & public utilities, from industrial lo=
ts & server farms to military bases & surveillance zones =E2=80=94 are cons=
tructed & inhabited, while also exploring the ways in which engaged psychog=
eography can provide new modes of counter-tourism & activism. Recent invest=
igations include "Buried Treasure Island" (Yerba Buena Center for the Arts,=
 2008), "17 Reasons Why" (Mission17 Gallery, 2009), & "Matta-Clark Parks" (=
Root Division Gallery, 2009). *The Shunt* is just out from Palm Press (palm=
press.org), and recent writing has appeared in SITE/CITE/CITY (2008), Artwe=
ek, Bombay Gin, With+Stand, Try, & elsewhere. buuckbarge.wordpress.com / da=

Bone Bouquet is a biannual online journal of women's poetry. We seek
to publish the best new writing by female poets, from artists both
established and emerging. We are especially interested in work that is
unpredictable, poems that have both sass and authority.

We are currently seeking submissions for our first issue, which will
appear as a downloadable .pdf at bonebouquet.wordpress.com in January
2010.

Please send up to five pages of your best work to
bonebouquet@gmail.com. Your work should appear as an .rtf attachment
or in the body of the email. Also include a short (50 word)
biographical note. Simultaneous submissions are fine, as long as we
are notified when work is accepted elsewhere. The reading period will
remain open through October 15, 2009.

Some female poets we admire include Catherine Bowman, Mary Ruefle,
Eula Biss, and Denise Duhamel.

All best,

Krystal Languell

Editor, Bone Bouquet

SIMON CUTTS & ERICA VAN HORN

THE METAPHOR BOOKS 1967-2009

4:15 PM, TUESDAY 19th MAY, MUSKIE ARCHIVES at BATES COLLEGE

If you are in New England, you can catch =B3The Metaphor Books 1967-2009=B2 (a
talk given at Threads last week in New York City) this Tuesday in Lewiston,
Maine.=20

Simon Cutts is a poet, artist and editor who began Coracle Press in the
early 1970s, having worked with small publications from the 1960s. He began
making work through concrete poetry, a form of visual presentation of the
poem on the page. Now he sees book-form as the physical metaphor for the
poem itself. The Coracle Press Archives are held in the Getty Research
Institute in Los Angeles. A recent book of essays, Some Forms of
Availability, was published last year by Granary Books, New York.

Writer and artist Erica Van Horn's work was exhibited in Book Arts in the
USA, an exhibition of work by 51 artists (1990); and in New Work, the annua=
l
Artist Members Exhibition of the Center for Book Arts (1986).  With Simon
Cutts, Van Horn directs Coracle Press.

http://www.coracle.ie/

The metaphorical development of certain poem sequences and series in the
work of Simon Cutts may be completed by the physical form of the book in
which it is present. As such, it is intrinsic to the particular poem, well
beyond the mere convenience of appended pages or the alignment of the poem
as an accompaniment to illustration.

Hello ALL! Wow - what a wonderful series of helpful replies to my
query! Thanks ever much to all - it's been fascinating finding out
about this person that I hadn't paid any attention to before. I got
curious because a student of mine has a relative (now deceased) in
Germany by the same name and we were wondering if it could have been
the same person. His relative was an architect, though I suppose
there's still a chance that they are related in some way.

Anyways, thanks every much to all - this is exactly what's still so
valuable about the poetics listserv.

yours, Lori

The editors of Packingtown Review, a journal of the University of
Illinois at Chicago, published by the University of Illinois Press,
invite submissions for its second issue to be released in 2010. The
journal publishes creative work including:
=A7        drama
=A7        poetry
=A7        fiction
=A7        creative nonfiction
=A7        literary translation

We seek submission of scholarly papers including:
=A7        interdisciplinary scholarship
=A7        literary criticism
=A7        comparative literature
=A7        critical theory
=A7        rhetorical studies
=A7        cultural studies
=A7        political theory

We also accept for consideration:
=A7        interviews
=A7        critical reviews of books, films and the arts in general
=A7        genre-bending work that explores or challenges form
=A7        graphic art and photographs

Whether scholarly or literary, we welcome edgy, fresh writing that may
be experimental or that explores boundary crossings of/between
genre(s) and form(s). What does it mean when poetry and prose are
indistinguishable? What is lost =96 or found =96 in translation? When
literary form is fluid, what happens to the relationship between art
and criticism? Between the creative and the scholarly?

acceptable) of prose (or genre-bending pieces), 40 pages of drama, or

Writing Experiments Workshop
Dodie Bellamy

My summer workshop will meet 10 consecutive Wednesday evenings, from
7 to 10 p.m.  The dates:  July 1 through September 2.  Cost:  $350
with a $100 deposit by June 17.  Balance of payment will be due the
first class.

In the past, the workshop has filled up quickly, so if you're
interested, do contact me promptly.

Most weeks students will be assigned a short take-home writing
experiment which they will share with the class the following week.
Assignments will range from cut ups to exploring bodily sensations.
Assignments are geared towards the class dynamic, so they may
eventually drop away or they may continue for the duration of the
class.

Each week we will also critique longer pieces by two to five
students.  Students may bring in anything they want (up to 20 pages)
for the longer critiques.  Depending on the length, these longer
pieces will be read aloud in class or handed out a week ahead of
time.  Though this class will have a prose focus, it is cross-genre,
and poets are welcome.  The class is limited to 10 students.  Lots
and lots of personal attention.  It takes place in San Francisco, in
my South of Market apartment, which comes complete with snacks and
cats.

This is a good class for poets wanting to play around with narrative
or prose writers wanting to open up their prose.

About me:  Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and
memoiresque essays, was published in 2004 by San Francisco's Suspect
Thoughts Press.  My vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was
reprinted by University of Wisconsin Press, also in 2004. Academonia,
a book of essays was published by Krupskaya in 2006.  My latest
chapbook, Barf Manifesto, came out from Ugly Duckling in 2008.  I'm
the author of 3 other books and I teach creative writing at SF State,
CCA and Antioch Los Angeles.  I've also taught at CalArts, Naropa
summer session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute.
I've received the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the
Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc.  Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them.  If you're interested do contact me promptly.
Preference given to those not currently enrolled in a grad writing
program.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Preliminaries: If you've never visited the visual poetry website Other
Cl/utter before you can go to www.otherclutter.com to see what it's on
about. If you've not yet stumbled on the Scream Literary Festival, skim and
peck your way over to www.thescream.ca

The Call: This year the Scream Literary Festival has chosen 'The Book is
Dead' as its theme. Yes, dead. Up and croaked. Each year we have an on-theme
gallery showing in the basement of Type Books located in Toronto's Queen
West district where the Scream also holds workshops and other events. The
gallery stays up for the duration of the festival (this year July 2-13) and
is generally curated by someone from the writing community with an interest
in the subject-matter (this year Jenny Sampirisi, facilitator of Other
Cl/utter and Bill Kennedy, co-compiler of the Apostrophe Engine are heading
up the gallery showing). Given this year's theme we're looking to have book
works, treated text, and book objects and/or their destruction. The artwork
will be placed inside the gallery and will also be displayed on Other
Cl/utter as a digital extension of the event.

Works can speak to the growing worry of the obsolete book object in favour
of a digital information system; they can examine the role of something like
an archive, a dictionary, a non-searchable database; they might present new
challenges to the authoritative functions of the book or question the
relevance of published textual knowledge and the limitations of the book as
a finite, bound object currently faced with potential dematerialization.

Sculpture, audio, paper works, digital imagery and documentation of
conceptual art projects are all welcome

Please send submissions and queries to otherclutter@gmail.com. And feel free
to pass this on to interested third parties.

They want edgy, fresh writing but apparently only
take snail mail submissions. Duh.

A Note on the Poem
James Harvey

The
poem more or less wrote itself. Marguerite White sent me cardboard
cuttings out in the shapes of sea birds she had used for one of her
installations=2C I had been watching David Attenborough=92s The Blue Planet
and the idea for the poem came shortly after. At the back of my mind
was also Bob Cobbing=92s poem =91alphabet of californian fishes=92=2C (in b=
ob jubile=2C selected texts of bob cobbing=2C
1990)=2C though I did not realise this until it was shown to me
afterwards by a friend to whom I had previously shown the Bob Cobbing
poem as one of my favourite poems. Its influence seemed clear to me.

*

James
Harvey studied Biology at UCL. After leaving university=2C he took up
poetry full time=2C with Ecology (and not Deep Ecology) inspiring much of
his poetry. He has had poems in magazines and In the Company of Poets
anthology. Poetry now on the web is at Great Works and Openned - in the Ope=
nned Magazine and Openned Anthology. Mackerelling is his first book.

The Poetry Project at St. Mark=B9s Church

May 19, 2009

Dear Friend of The Poetry Project,

We are still in high spirits from the three monumental readings we held her=
e
last week for our Spring Fundraiser. If you attended the John Giorno
reading, the John Ashbery reading, or the panel and/or reading for the
Collected Poetry of Jack Spicer, thank you. We raised $3,500! And if you
attended, you have already heard that the Poetry Project's fundraising
campaign has just begun.

For those of you who are hearing this for the first time, The Project has
some serious financial challenges to meet in 2010 including a substantial
rent increase to stay in our home at St. Mark's Church. Our goal is to rais=
e
at least $15,000 by the end of this year.

We're asking you, our dear supporters, to help by not only becoming a Membe=
r
of The Project (a $50 Individual Membership will get you a subscription to
our quarterly Newsletter), but giving an extra tax-deductible contribution
of $25 or anything that you feel you can offer - even small amounts are ver=
y
welcome.

You can simply click here
http://poetryproject.org/get-involved/become-a-member to become a Member or
renew your Membership.

Or here http://poetryproject.org/get-involved/donate-now to donate.

You may also opt to send a check made out to The Poetry Project at 131 E.
10th St. New York, NY 10003.

We are a poet-founded and have always been a poet-run organization whose
programming has developed out of a complete devotion to the risk, challenge
and heart of contemporary poetry. And we know we've developed a community
who is just as intensely devoted. Thank you!

Sincerely,

Stacy Szymaszek
Artistic Director

Subject:      Wordplay celebrates Robin Blaser
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

As most here will know, on May 7th Robin Blaser, one of the last major
figures among those who came to public notice via Don Allen's New
American Poetry, passed away in Vancouver, just shy of 84.

I never successfully recorded Robin myself; both times I tried, my
usually trusty Uher balked. Thankfully, the great Penn Sound audio
archive has hours of readings and lectures in his voice, so I put
together this week's Wordplay from three of its recordings. The first
finds him reading in Vancouver in 1965; the second, discussing his
work, and that of his fellows, in a BBC interview with Iain Sinclair
in 1994; the third, reading at the Woodland Pattern Bookstore in
Milwaukee in 2004.

In Vancouver he read "The Moth Poem", an early exploration of serial
form; it's a great poem, but the recording, given that it was made on
analogue tape over forty years ago (probably by Fred Wah, though he's
not credited), had some hiss that I removed for better audibility. In
Milwaukee, Blaser began his reading with the introductory section of
his extended poem on Dante, then switched to shorter poems, and then
returned to the "Great Companions" piece on Dante, saying he hadn't
"prepared anything else". I brought the two pieces together for the
show. It's a powerful reading.

The program note has more information, and a link to the audio, here:

Enjoy,

Jeff

VERSAL 7 IS NOW AVAILABLE

--Launch of Versal 7--
The seventh edition of Versal, the annual English-language literary journal
published out of Amsterdam, was launched on 15 May. As in previous editions=
,
the writing and art in Versal 7 is resolutely international, and above all
distinctive for its lack of defined borders. Contributors include Agustina
Bazterrica, Emily Carr, Jennifer K. Dick, Joel Fishbane, Elizabeth Gross,
Desmond Kon Zhicheng-Mingd=E9, Trey Moody, Sawako Nakayasu, Mary Miller, Pete=
r
Shippy and Nicole Walker.

Copies and subscriptions are available at:
http://versal.wordsinhere.com

--Versal Journal--
The launch of Versal 7 also coincided with the launch of our new blog,
http://versaljournal.blogspot.com, through which we hope to join the lively
online literary dialogues, as well as discuss aspects of our submission
review process and the wide(ning) aesthetic that Versal seeks out.
=20
--The HERE project--
The blog will also be a space to post the results of the HERE project, an
initiative we have started this year. Copies of Versals old and new will be
passed into the hands of a number of potential readers around the world. Th=
e
project is simple: read & pass on. These copies are labeled and numbered,
and readers are encouraged to contact us with their responses, whether text=
,
image, video, sound, which we will then post on the blog.

Hello

I'd like to thank those who asked about me for their concern.

I've been incommunicado for much of the past year because my wife and
I moved
one town north, a move that became more complicated and protracted
than any
we've made before, including moving from Connecticut to Florida.

In addition to moving, I've spent much of the past year wrestling with
computer problems.
My email address book has vanished several times, so I've lost most of
my contact information.

I'm doing well and have finally resumed a regular writing schedule.

If you'd like to become part of my rebuilt address book, please
backchannel your contact information to me.

Best,

Vernon

Hello,

I'm teaching a senior undergraduate course entitled "Poetry since 1950"
in the fall, and I'm making up my own anthology as a course package so
as to include a fair amount of experimental material. However, I need
some ideas for a short critical overview of contemporary poetry that
takes a world or at least trans-Atlantic perspective and addresses
historical contexts, movements, issues in poetics, etc. Is there such a
book available?

Thanks for ideas.

Hilary Clark

A very important press to support....



As many of you will know, Jen and I have been struggling to keep Salt
moving since June last year when the economic downturn began to affect
our press. Our three year funding ends this year: we've =A34,000 due
from Arts Council England in a final payment, but cannot apply through
Grants for the Arts for further funding for Salt's operations. Spring
sales were down nearly 80% on the previous year, and despite April's
much improved trading, the past twelve months has left us with a
budget deficit of over =A355,000. It's proving to be a very big hole and
we're having to take some drastic measures to save our business.

Here's how you can help us to save Salt and all our work with hundreds
of authors around the world.

JUST ONE BOOK

1. Please buy just one book, right now. We don't mind from where, you
can buy it from us or from Amazon, your local shop or megastore,
online or offline. If you buy just one book now, you'll help to save
Salt. Timing is absolutely everything here. We need cash now to stay
afloat. If you love literature, help keep it alive. All it takes is
just one book sale. Go to our online store and help us keep going.

2. Share this note on your profile. Tell your friends. If we can
spread the word about our cash crisis, we can hopefully find more
sales and save our literary publishing. Remember it's just one book,
that's all it takes to save us. Please do it now.

With my best wishes to everyone
Chris
Director

kino21's last show for a spell:

Sunday, May 24th, 8pm
VAUDEVILLE FOLLIES
Artists Television Access
992 Valencia
San Francisco, CA

From Brooklyn, New York, poets Nada Gordon and Gary
Sullivan lead an evening of multiple media San
Francisco premieres: poly-vocal poetics, neo-benshi
film narration, and mangled imagery.

Visiting the Bay Area live for one night only, the
latter-day vaudeville team of Gordon and Sullivan will
present their most recent poetry, performance and
video work showcased last month (fresh!) at The
Whitney Museum and Dixon Place in New York. Gordon and
Sullivan are founding members of the notorious and
irreverent Flarf Collective. They have been committed.
To hilarious and unsettling entertainment. Throughout
this millenium.  They will premiere two live film
narration pieces, and read from their recent work.

Oakland poet-provocateur Erika Staiti will perform her
live film renarration of a short scene from "Woman
Under the Influence," which premiered last month in
the Los Angeles underground venue, Machine Project.

From Queens, New York visual artist, montagist and
poet Brandon Downing will sends us several
disturbingly funny new video collages.  Using a
hilarious form of homophonic translation of song
lyrics as subtitles from Bollywood movies, Downing
dispaces the musical numbers into new registers of
meaning with both bawdy and poignant overtones.

Check out Poems for the Millennium vol 2, ed. Rothenberg and Joris

Subject:      Urgent Poetics Query
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I wanted to call this post, "Feminism:=C2=A0 Not Just for Women Anymore" bu=
t figured such a title might cause more than a few to 86 this straight to t=
he trash bin.=0A=0A=0AAfter posting my miscellany note earlier today, one g=
uy actually followed up and gave me even more grief for being annoyed that =
he assumed I was shocked by the Briton study ("fine fine geez).  I answered=
 the other two guys by posting my response frontchannel.  Only one person s=
tarted a respectful conversation with me backchannel about the study.=0A=0A=
=0ASo my question to the first chap who asked why would I post a study that=
 includes info "we [Poetics list members] already know" (i.e. that people a=
re afraid of poetry) was:   If we were on a politics listserv and I posted =
a recent study that found many thought marriage equality was about civil ri=
ghts or was overdue, would he then also question why I was shocked?  And is=
 it an accident that two other men asked me backchannel why I was surprised=
 by the study?=0A=0A=0AThis type of exchange raises all sorts of questions =
for me about this list.  That study was posted on another listserv by a man=
 (James).  I don't think he was queried about his motivation, nor was it as=
sumed he was shocked/surprised by the study.  Correct me if I'm wrong, Jame=
s. And yes, I think this is a gender issue. =0A=0A=0AI'm not alone as of la=
te in wondering about the dynamics of listserve etiquette, the different mo=
dels of "feminine" and "masculine" exchange, and just why this particular l=
istserv, with nearly 2,000 members now, has grown so utterly quiet in discu=
ssion.  I know I'm opening a can of worms now with this line of inquiry (pi=
n the bulls eye on my forehead gently, please), but while it seems the old =
model of open, unchecked exchange led to more discussion in years past, a t=
on of flaming and ad hom attacks inevitably and typically spiraled into int=
imidation and attack mode, overwhelming and silencing most of the female me=
mbers as well as many men who simply didn't have the time or interest to en=
gage in such battles.  =0AWhat was the past attraction?  Does aggressive ba=
iting stimulate?  False accusations or intentional misreadings?  I wonder i=
f it's a coincidence that debate has significantly tapered now that those t=
ypes of exchanges are prohibited.  Even more telling, when I post a note of=
 miscellany as a woman, I am "checked" backchannel by several men who proje=
cted a response onto me that I simply did not have nor indicate anywhere in=
 my posting, forcing me into defense mode to waste more time that would be =
better served in discussion/debate.  These types of exchanges are old schoo=
l and so very tired. =0A=0A=0AThe women of Delirous Hem [http://www.delirio=
ushem.blogspot.com/] have recently been discussing the dynamics of such exc=
hange as well as how men and women are actually advancing a feminist poetic=
s.  This line of inquiry has even led a few to wonder aloud (via their blog=
s) just what a feminist poetics is and how to promote it.  Even a few men a=
ren't afraid of the notion that we need new models of exchange, which is a =
poetics too.  Feminist modes of thinking and operating may not, after all, =
be for women only.  I don't have the answers, but feminist imaginings may a=
ctually provide models by which we can jump start a listserv that seems to =
have grown quiet in exchange, even by initially asking, Just what can femin=
ist thinking make us aware of and what models for discussion might we use? =
What is a feminist poetics, exactly?  What are the aims of feminist-minded =
poets? ... Some excerpts from the Delirous Hem responses:=0A=0A=0A"while id=
eas live differently in different cultures, equality is not necessarily a c=
ultural idea/value; its thorough application would involve a change in cult=
ure, and as an idea, it might arise or live differently in different cultur=
es, sure" =0A-- Catherine Daly (http://cadaly.blogspot.com/2009/05/what-doe=
s-feminist-poet-look-like-or.html)=0A=0A~~~=0A=0AGina Myers, a teacher, a p=
oet, and an all around amazing human being, has a piece up over at Deliriou=
s Hem, a blog for women poets. Myers' piece, entitled "This is what a [post=
] feminist [poet] looks like," explores her relationship with feminism in a=
 so-called "post feminist" society. ...=0A=0A=0AMyers' poetry is an inspira=
tion to all who read it, and in he piece, she reflects on her work co-direc=
ting the Vagina Monologues at a small town community college in the middle =
of a corn field and overflowing with sexist, homophobic ideologies that onl=
y a select few seem to want to fight against.=0A=0A=0AI did not see one cau=
se as being more important than others, nor did I necessarily see them as b=
eing separate causes. The larger issue is social justice, and I have contin=
ued to live my life committed to this one cause.=0A=0A--Feministing [cont'd=
 http://community.feministing.com/2009/05/this-is-what-a-post-feminist-p.ht=
ml]=0A=0A~~~=0A=0AA lot of the poems in Becoming the Villainess were writte=
n after these experiences left me frustrated - "Okay, Ophelia" is one of th=
em. I started noticing that the culture does a great job of portraying wome=
n as eye candy, as victims and villainesses, but not a great job of portray=
ing them as anything else. I started thinking about the mythology and fairy=
 tale stories I grew up with, and how women today could or couldn't model t=
hemselves after those characters.=0A=0A=0A...The poems grew out of my incre=
asing awareness of how women are treated now, in myth, and in our culture. =
 I grew up around guys - I have three brothers, I dated a lot of great guys=
 and had mostly guy friends - and I'm happy to say I have a terrific, suppo=
rtive, dare-I-say feminist husband. But I look around me and wish for more =
positive role models, for some support for women who need to be protected, =
for a place where girls don't have to worry about what they wear for fear t=
hey will be attacked.=0A=0A--Jeannine Hall Gailley  [con't -- http://www.we=

=0AI know there are more forums planned (I plan to co-organize one, too), b=
ut I hope this topic gets a second run, because I imagine there are plenty =
of women [poets] who thought they weren't feminist poets until they read th=
is -- just as there were contributors who thought they weren't feminist poe=
ts until they entered grad school, until they were employed by a bureaucrac=
y, until they sat down to write their pieces.=0A=0A=0AA note on blog commen=
t boxes: It's a thrill to see these filled with women's opinions. I can fee=
l, but can't yet quite articulate, how the rhetoric shifts when women enter=
 into comment-box conversations. It seems to me that comment boxes are some=
times like city streets at night: women know they shouldn't go alone, know =
they risk danger -- leering eyes, men who do not know how to listen in earn=
est but would rather hear themselves talk.=0A=0A--Becca Klaver [con't -- ht=
tp://beccaklaver.blogspot.com/2009/05/on-delirious-hem-this-is-what-feminis=
t.html]=0A=0A~~~~=0A=0ASo what to add? How about a confession I'm not suppo=
sed to make. When I was pregnant, I desperately wanted a boy and when I fou=
nd out I was having a boy, I cried with joy...=0A=0A=0ABut I did have a pre=
ference. There are some personal, complicated reasons, but also there is a =
philosophical one. I want to try to contribute to society a man who is thou=
ghtful, introspective and considerate. Somebody who doesn't view himself as=
 the center, the norm, the standard. A man who can both respect and not tak=
e advantage of the women of his generation. As feminists and mothers in gen=
eral, I believe we spend a lot of time making up for what current society l=
acks and preparing our daughters to handle that. I think this is incredibly=
 important and must continue. But I think some of us overlook how we need t=
o prepare our sons. It's easy to do, society offers so many more advantages=
 to our sons. But society fails them on many other levels.=0A=0A=0A...For i=
nstance, many of the poet-dads brag about "changing a lot of diapers" or st=
aying home a day or two a week to watch their children. Yes, that's great. =
Yes, it undoubtedly is helpful to the mother. Yes, that's likely a big step=
 forward from what their fathers did. But these guys see themselves as hero=
s almost, like what their doing is above and beyond the expectation. It doe=
sn't occur to them that 30% of diaper changing and 20% of childcare is clos=
er to being described as supplemental.=0A=0A=0AI wouldn't even mind this im=
balance if there was at least an better awareness of it. A poet-dad admitti=
ng that his wife does the bulk of the child rearing which allows him to wri=
te more and travel, well that's a totally different situation. That's aware=
ness and honesty. He's not inflating himself or diminishing her.=0A=0A=0ACa=
n you imagine a poet-mom bragging that she changes a lot of diapers? Your r=
esponse would be, um, yeah, that's part of raising a baby. If I bragged abo=
ut staying home to watch my child, you'd stare and scratch your head. Yes, =
you're a mother, you don't leave your young child alone to fend for himself=
. How many times have I heard a poet-dad say he's "babysitting" his own chi=
ldren? How can one babysit his own child? Aren't poets supposedly be consci=
ous of their word choices? How many poet-dads of young children go away to =
writing colonies for a month at a time without a second thought? It's kind =
of amazing. I go away for three nights and am constantly reminded, often by=
 complete strangers, how lucky (and of course, selfish I am) to leave my so=
n with his own father.=0A=0A--Reb Livingston [con't -- http://reblivingston=

eliot weinberger edited Poetry after 1950 which is out of print but maybe
you can contact him directly as it has commentary--he is involved with the
rothenberg too.

A response to Amy King's post about recent web developments in feminist
poetics:

I attempted to comment at Mark Wallace's website a few days ago, and the
comment -- never transmitted -- went up in a puff of peace smoke.  I had
tried to explain -- something I have written about at my weblog -- that in  the
early 80s -- "feminist" where I lived in Madison (beloved city) meant
"radical, lesbian separatist feminist."  I explain further at my weblog  that
there was a difference between academic feminist scholarship (phenomenal)  and
lesbian street feminist (raw).  The womyn's commune where I lived  filled
seats to hear women's poetry and promoted street  feminism.  I moved next to
upstate New York, where few people (Mark Wallace  an exception) talked about
feminism in creative writing.  There were  international feminist scholars
in training.  One American woman feminist  Ph.D. candidate was driven crazy
with sticks.  Her audibly dry mouth  during seminar was almost the first I'd
known of anti-depressants.   Street feminism upstate was pro-choice
activism, and as many men as women  participated (the redneck men with shotguns).
In Texas, I wrote a  short story about it, and the editor (an  influential
"writer-who-happens-to-be-a-(white)-woman") read mysterious  hinterlands
anti-semitism into the pro-choice male vigilantes.  That  short story (called
"Hymen") became boilerplate in workshop, running  through three guest workshop
"leaders" before it died on the  schoolroom floor.

Texas in the early 90s was a trip.  Texas is in favor of sexuality
generally, and the politics of sexuality were a little hard to stab w/ a pickle
fork.  The strippers were the feminists and anti-war activists.  Two  of the
strippers were the only two mothers among the graduate students.   The
strippers were the textual feminist critics in creative writing  prose, too.  I
called it "finger-touch" feminism.  It was witty,  erudite, delicate, and
literate.  We did it quietly at the workshop table  surrounded by male and
female writers whose work was more likely to see  mainstream publication.

New feminism -- stirrings of which are wafting like violets in our hair --
is new femininity.  You don't get to punch the sky in new femininity, but
you do get to knit.  Knitting is big, so is embroidery, needlework of all
kinds.  Bored by textual feminism, it over, the women started on  needle
crafts and waited, first for Obama, when it was Bush, now for  Michelle Obama's
next gorgeous cover.  My mother (who had wanted a career  in public office)
once knitted a tailored three-color v-neck-turtleneck for my  Barbie.  My
sister, who is a textual designer, and I still can't believe  she knit it.

A v-striped-turtleneck?  My sister, though she also writes, is  a textile
designer.

Amy,

I am surprised that you are the one asking the question about the moribund
state of the Poetics List today since, if I remember correctly, you were
instrumental in its creation. Under the overly broad rubric of "flaming,"
including within it unsavory ideas, and also banning the posting of any
individual works new rules drain the Poetics List of all its energy and
turned it essential a trade list where people list their publications and
poetry readings.

Polemics is the bread and butter of thought. Heated polemics is the bread
and butter of passionate, committed thought -a quality, as you have noted
this list has been devoid of for quite a long time. Words don't break bones=
.
I never quite understood what is to me the extreme squeamishness about
flaming. That's me I suppose with all my male, aggressive hormones going al=
l
the time.

As for your comments about the recent London research results. I am one of
those responded to you, thinking I was posting to the list. For some reason=
,
my response was back channeled to you. Anyone who has taught a class of hig=
h
school or early college students know very well how students -male and
female- approach poetry with anxiety, with a sense that poetry requires
rules or attitudes they are not familiar with or are alien to them. This wa=
s
a casual cultural comment -a bit of kvetching by a poet- which it seems, to
my amazement, you fantasized into a sexual verbal attack.

Ciao,

Murat

Geckos with Bristles, May 21, 2009
By Kevin Killian
=20
Looks like mighty little Meritage Press has plucked forth another winner,
this one with a nursery edge that will have your infants gripping the bars
of their cribs and swatting those cut-out animals that dangle, like indents=
,
above their faces on showy Kid Calder mobiles. Buffalo-based Geoffrey Gatza
has long been a man of the animals, and now he has put together a complete
collection of animal poems that invites comparison to similar efforts by
Marianne Moore and Hilaire Belloc. The poems are illustrated with period
woodcuts from a variety of childrens's literature texts of bygone eras, so
the glamour of the antique falls gently here and there over what might
otherwise be rather a sharp menu to feed baby with.
=20
In fact I have a feeling that kids aren't the primary audience for Housecat
Kung Fu, though there is nothing that would scare or offend any redblooded
kid. Well, there is a Bambi like transition from two giraffes necking, to
one of them being taken away and hanged by the neck. But children seem to
adore violence and they might well laugh at the surreal practice of hanging
anyhow: with a giraffe in the noose Gatza provides an indelible image of th=
e
wrong. Elsewhere the poems depict "befuiddled" heroes trying to obey strang=
e
customs that keep them caged, but, as we learn, "one cat's incarceration is
another cat's contented cradle." Gatza's poetic invention never flags, and
half the fun is seeing how he takes you from one line down to the next--no
two poems are alike, except that here an accent on the quirky and mutable
can always be heard, an onomatopoetic replicating the mind of the poet
meeting the greater minds of the animal kingdom.
=20
An attractive and illuminating book of wisdom.

HOUSECAT KUNG FU by GEOFFREY GATZA
RUTH LEPSON Reviews
=20
Housecat Kung Fu by Geoffrey Gatza
(Meritage Press, St. Helena & San Francisco, 2009)
=20
Geoffrey Gatza has moments of Leslie Scalapinoism:
=20
    Consumed, I began cleaning; as a portrait of moments flicking out a
drifting life, a lake, an edited reality
=20
=20
of sweet humor:
=20
    a hazelnut is a miserable/ nut to quarrel with...a man=B9s heart devises
his dance/and earth charms away his days
=20
=20
of visual poetry:
=20
    There are two sides to every tablecloth
    is a line that gets paler as we see the other side of the tablecloth
=20
=20
of personification that moves compelling sounds through emotion:
=20
    look at me alive
                  =20
    frozen paths cut
                  =20
    lonely blankets of snow
=20
                  =20
    moments live for days
=20
=20
crazy flights of imagination:
=20
    so I took off my nose and unzipped
    my skin and folded it neatly by the reflecting
    pond so no one would think those awful things
    people think about people who go leaving
    their skin any which way
=20
=20
his own set of myths, for instance, how the jellyfish was beaten into a
quivering lump
=20
and endless sweetness and sympathy:
=20
    maddened moments of trees in terrible pain, Cars rusting on their
underbelly
=20
=20
so read his book HOUSECAT KUNG FU, whether you are an adult or a child,
because once you start you will want to continue.

Murat, Amy,

I do not know what kind of answer Murat forwarded but if it is within the
limits Murat sets, it wasn't certainly the one that triggered Amy's
response.
I do not agree with Murat that Amy wanted the list to die down, and I am
with Amy in being able to speak rather than insult. I have had my part of
insults from one list and that is why I rarely contribute to some.

About the link Amy forwarded, I remember thinking, "ah the Britons". I went
to England for several stays, and I read many posts/books by Britons. That
is how I justify my comprehension of the undoubtedly true statistic. As I
know the people of the north and the people of the south, as Mme de Stael
would put it more broadly.

I cannot understand why such an article aroused any anti-feminist remarks,
this really goes beyond my comprehension.

With my best wishes,

Anny

Yes, Murat -- it's all *my fault* because, according to you, people simply =
don't want to join discussions that don't include flaming, name-calling, an=
d the posting of their poems.  =0A=0AAnd no, I'm not "shocked" you reached =
this conclusion either (based on the historical nature of this list, you're=
 right in line, hence the "bull's eye" notation) -- unfortunately, I think =
there is some truth to the idea that some are drawn to discussions for the =
mere drama of it all, and drama requires flaming, loud name calling, aggres=
sive intimidating rhetoric, etc... =0A=0AAdditionally, discussions are ofte=
n about one upping the next guy:  the old hierarchical positioning that cer=
tainly takes place in conversations can also be seen in many other realms, =
including the popular sports realm -- if I disrespect you, then I'm on top.=
  How many "in your face" moves do we see after someone successfully dunks =
a ball or reaches the goal line?  I think this list has proven time and tim=
e again that the inclination is to devolve into such positioning, most espe=
cially among a specific few who cause others to retreat into silence while =
said handful dominate with their preening and bashing, degenerating the lis=
t's tone with name calling, flaming, ad hom. etc.  =0A=0AAnd if *that* is t=
he requirement to keep discussions going, then it's a sad one that conclude=
s the list is certainly best left for announcements only rather than gettin=
g mired into "listening" in on who comes out top dog via such unconstructiv=
e debate.  =0A=0AI do, however, think that there are other factors to consi=
der and am wondering aloud (again, be gentle when you take aim, please).  P=
erhaps the list is simply too large and a sense of community is no longer f=
ostered.  Can we actually have international and national discussions?  Wha=
t forum permits that?  The women's poetry listserv, while it has its moment=
s, maintains a specific focus that most members remain set on: discussing w=
omen's poetry and promoting it.  The Lucipo listerv is situated within a ge=
ographical community.  New Poetry is smaller and has a stable base of parti=
cipants who contribute regular poetry/poetics info and respectful debate fo=
cused on analyzing poems, among other interesting foci.  Of course, all thr=
ee of those lists are considerably smaller than Poetics and certainly don't=
 have the historical base of attack and flaming that Poetics has cultivated=
 for itself, which is exactly why I was asked to moderate:  to put an end t=
o the
 cultivation of that tone.  One need only do a search for Buffalo Poetics l=
ist to learn of that history.  But before all of that, Poetics did foster g=
reat discussions on poetry and poetics ...=0A=0AAlso to consider, and I'm n=
ot the first to note this:  many discussions now take place on blogs.  The =
proliferation of blogs and their comment streams have opened up smaller, mo=
re focused discussions that you can join or ignore.  On Poetics, every memb=
er receives every post.  The same holds true for online forums.  Each discu=
ssion is labeled, and while there may be nearly two thousand members, they =
only read what they want and join topics they deem worthwhile.  They are no=
t forced to read such discussions as earlier noted (hierarchical positionin=
g via flaming).  =0A=0AI got to thinking about all of this yesterday mornin=
g when someone asked my why the list has had a lull.  And then I posted my =
miscellany and rec'd some presumptuous queries backchannel.  I posted a not=
e, below, that I thought might generate some discussion about what has happ=
ened to this list and fully expected to be blamed.  Don't think, Murat, you=
're alone.  I've rec'd a few backchannels in the past with the same sentime=
nt - actually from two men specifically.  They want free reign to terrorize=
 as they see fit and they believe bullying me will somehow get that kind of=
 "power" reinstated.  It's too bad that such blindered thinking gets airpla=
y and that these men have the stamina to keep working at it.  Sadly many ha=
ve sent me backchannel support and bow out.  I've had many more emails of t=
hat variety.   The idea is that these latter people want to see a better li=
st, one that offers more respectful discussion among members, one in which =
they feel safe
 from name calling if they join in debate, etc.  Their numbers have been mu=
ch greater than those who would bash me backchannel.  But truly, no one wan=
ts to waste time defending themselves against willful misreadings and attac=
ks on their character.  Not even me. =0A=0A=0A =0ACALL FOR CONTRIBUTORS=0A=
=0A=0ABeyond this particular discussion and overall, Poetics has been and r=
emains a valuable resource.  Our numerous members are hard-working poets, r=
eviewers, educators, and culture makers.  Perhaps it's time to figure out, =
communally, how we might revamp the list and generate material for discussi=
ons.  Many on this list are active bloggers while others have lots to say a=
bout the topics debated on those blogs and elsewhere.  We might  take a cue=
 from New Poetry and enlist contributors to post --on a schedule even-- abo=
ut specific happenings, new and neglected books, schools of thought, and, t=
aking a cue from Wompo, a once a week or once a month celebration of an adm=
ired poet (on Wompo, it's a "Foremother" celebration), etc.  =0A=0AWe could=
 even have a guest editor for a week or month who could solicit posts and s=
teer discussion... =0A=0AI'd be very happy to hear folks' suggestions, and =
if you'd like to be a contributor or nominate someone to guest edit, please=
 contact me.  This list offers an instant audience of nearly 2,000 active p=
oets and poet appreciators with more joining everyday -- why not try to fig=
ure out new possibilities?  =0A=0AThanks,=0A=0AAmy=0A=0A=0A=0A_______=0A=0A=

=0AThanks for this, Ann.  I wonder if the reasons you give below are why mo=
re intellectual men are no longer afraid of referring to themselves as femi=

g?  Men can be nurturers now but fiscal equality isn't such a consideration=
 anymore?  How does this play out when men encounter feminist poetics?  I f=
ind more men receptive to the likes of Alice Notley, despite her shirking o=
f the notions that women should please - on The Poetics of Disobedience:=0A=
=0A"It's very feminist but men seem to enjoy it a lot, it possibly contains=
 a rather virile approach to things riding roughshod and shooting at every =
little duck that seems to pop up. As I implied earlier, Disobedience didn't=
 exactly set out to be disobedient; it set out actually to try to do the ki=
nds of things I'd previously done in different poems all in the same poem, =
that is tell a story, interact with the so-called visible or phenomenal the=
 despised daily, and explore the unconscious. But it got more and more piss=

Hi - I'm probably more at fault than most, although I'm kept in check re:
continuous posting. I do want to note that a list like Cybermind keeps on
going without flaming at all, the discussion good at times, but then it's
only about 180 members who have known each other, for the most part, for
years.

I don't remember flames on Poetics, but that's my own lack of memory; I do
remember open policies, and would like to see what would happen if modera-
tion was ceased for, say, a set times - perhaps ten days? I promise I
won't inundate. I'd like to see what other people are writing, for one
thing, and figure that praxis involves the work itself just as much as
discussion or critique - for one thing, a lot of us can't afford to buy
poetry books/mags/etc. and this is a potentially amazing way to read.

Yes, of course, blogs are somewhat of a replacement - but they're also
dominated by their creator - I always have the feeling I'm reading under
the aegis, charity, and connoisseurship of someone else.

- Alan

Hi all - well, er, just to second Anny's note: as an ex-moderator of the
list, I think it pretty much goes without saying that the list has a loooon=
g
history of being a venue of anything BUT "heated debate". In fact, I wasn't
even going to bother posting this note because I didn't want to deal with
the responses that would ensue. But, for the sake of historical accuracy, a=
t
least from my eyes, the days of the unmoderated list were dominated by
dominators and one moderator after another had to continually deal not just
with the flaming of friends and colleagues, but threatening personal emails=
.
Why should that be an accepted part of the job?!

That all said, if anyone at all would be willing to step out from the
shadows of the list and considering any of Amy's suggestions that sure woul=
d
be wonderful. We've all thought about how great it would be if we could
focus the list, somehow take advantage of the list's sprawling 2000
membership via a particular leader for a limited period of time, on a
particular issue; and we imagined that leader soliciting considered
responses from certain people etc. Many a year ago Chris Alexander did this
on the list very successfully as I remember. But there are many other
possibilities too I'm sure -

Over and out,
Lori

Hi all,

As many of you know through individual letters and emails, Chax is in
a big push to bring in needed funds, not only to make it "through"
this current sometimes troubling period, but beyond, with ambitious
plans to do more than we've ever done before, and to do it better. I
don't want to make the pitch right here on poetics, but I hope you
will all visit an event site created for this purpose on facebook, at

	http://www.facebook.com/reqs.php#/event.php?eid=99709892577&ref=ts

or read the message on my blog, at

	http://chax.org/blog.htm

and consider what is there (follow links if needed to get to the
heart of the message).

And if none of that, go to our main site at http://chax.org and buy 1
book (or 2 or more).

Thank you!

Charles

Amy,

Does it occur to you that phrases such as "right in line," "aggressive,"
"intimidating" might be experienced by the person on the receiving side as
name calling or flaming? My phrase "I am surprised that you are surprised"
on the subject of the lack of interest in poetry among the general
population was obviously experienced by you as some kind of aggressive,
dominating, male (as though women are not permitted or do not use such an
phrase) act. I do not mean that you should not have brought this discussion
to the list (I am glad that you did) or should have leveled the tone of your
language. I only mean that flaming or agressive "male" behavior is often in
the eye of the beholder, whether one agrees with the expressed point of view
or not. Because of that, I think, we should be more accomodating of
tonalities and uses of language. Such tolerance will not kill us. Anyhow,
you never struck be as someone shrinking back in front of somebody else's
words.

As for your other comments, I think what was special about the Buffalo List
was the broadness of the issues it covered. As a result, people's minds
moved freely, though I agree with you sometimes it resulted in insane
behavior; but even those often often had the kernel of a significant
contention behind it. Now both are gone. Do you think this is a better
result?

I have never been an enthusiast of blogs and expressed it under different
occasions. It splinters the poetic community, making one search for who or
what is like one, narrowing the horizons of discourse. The great promise of
the web has been its potential openness to "the other." A vibrant list is an
expression of that ideal which, I am afraid, gave up too easily, without a
fight so to speak.

Ciao,

Murat

it might be neat if there were some sort of sampler, i.e., rather than a
bunch of posts about "what I put on my blog this week" -- I don't watch or
feed many -- there were a synopsis with links:  should be fairly easy for
someone with a good list of POETICS bloggers to rip off
because of the posting limit, a lot of discussions get taken off list to
blogs, and some posts here have been "hey look at this discussion on my
blog"

the nature of the list has changed a bit, too, and necessarily, because the
internet and small press publishing has changed

one of the things I've been thinking idly about is something that was picked
up on the Black Ocean blog, which was about the distrust many established
poets, particularly those a generation before me, have for younger poets who
are publishing quite a bit and in general very active, and setting up
coherent coteries, rather than the typical "a book every seven years from
Knopf"

- because one such older poet is apparently Tony Hoagland, a lot of this is
anxiety over quantity and quality, couched in a disdain for "easy domestic
surrealism" and procedural poems and projects

- there seems to be a failure to realize that publication has gotten easier,
and it is easier/less expensive/time consuming to found a press

- there seems to be a failure to accept that most aspects of writing well
CAN and ARE being taught

- ditto for "po biz", seeing works to publication, etc.

I would be very interested in what people think about this; are we all
getting more prolific?  Editing less?  Is this good?

in the flame days, the list was a time suck for me because posting something
that wouldn't get ripped to shreds took forever; NOW it is because if you're
in a discussion you've got to post something long and detailed (unless
you're George Bowering), anticipating rebuttals, knowing you only have one

What's interesting about many young poets (and I don't know if this
represents a sea change or is only because they're young) is that they seem
to avoid the flaming and jockeying that so characterizes most "communities."
Say what you will about Tao Lin, but the guy never talks shit about anything
other than his own writing.

i think lists have had their day as high quality discussion forums. some
options have emerged since then, such as blogs and social networks. well
lists are social networks, aren't they. but they weren't called that when
they were in their prime. now the term 'social networks' encompasses lists,
things like facebook, myspace, rss of blogs, and so on. there's more options
and more theory of social networks. unfortunately, for all that, i haven't
seen anything that rivals the early days of the list in terms of strong
discussion. i think it would take quite a strong platform/app to do that.
something that was strong enough to merit the trust that the list no longer
enjoys. if that's possible.

Also seconding Mark Weiss' suggestion. Poems for the Millennium Vol. 2 is
excellent; Donald Allen's The New American Poetry, 1945 - 1960 might make a
good companion text.

2009 is the centenary of the publication of The Plan of Chicago. The
Synesthetic Plan of Chicago is an art installation project which corresponds
with the celebration of this historic event. SPC's participating artists and
organizations have designed installation pieces which bring together sounds,
sights, tastes, smells, and tactile things that relate to Chicago's
neighborhoods; create an interactive environment so participants can
interact with the sensory "artifacts" of Chicago in creative and imaginative
ways; and encourage people to think about synesthetic connections with
things that relate to Chicago.



The Synesthetic Plan of Chicago is commissioned by the City of Chicago. SPC,
which is co-curated by Annie Heckman and Daniel Godston, includes the

Jim,

That is exactly my point. Was the sacrifice worth it or was the cure many
times worse than the disease? Of course, that maybe just a man speaking.

Ciao,

The phrase which initiated this  discussion was "fear of poetry," which has
been so little discussed since,  that one wonders if this is not a "given,"
rather than perhaps having a good deal of potential for investigation and
questioning--
sometimes the very "unquestioning" acceptance of phrases may provoke in
itself a questioning--

in this age of continual Fear mongering and inciting, imposing--it is not
possible that what one is being presented with in this poll is the other wa=
y
round?
that is:
that it is POETRY which is IN fear--
and also that it is quite possible there may exist a Poetry of Fear
and, in turn a Poetry FOR Fear--

the "fear of poetry" then may not be an indication of a "given" but the
symptom of FEAR which is continually made more frightening by the
controlling forces within that society--

Poems from Guant=E1namo
The Detainees Speak
David Baptite Chirot <http://www.kaurab.com/english/books/guantanamo.html>

"Fear of poetry"--
i ran out of time before having a chance to briefly b/c Amy re this
poll--and these questions-
will essay to do so here--

the first thought that occurred to me regarding fear, as this poll is in th=
e
UK--
is how incredibly saturated by surveillance the British people are', the
most so in the world, and that they experienced bombings in their midst mor=
e
recently and quite differently from the 9//11 in the usa--
and that some of the bombers are persons living with in the UK, not as
"illegal aliens always, but often as second and third generation immigrants
who are British citizens themselves--

Americans are or should be familiar with this kind of bomber--Timothy
McVeigh, Eric Rudolph, the little recalled fact that in the US in1970 there
were 5,000 incidents of bombing, and historically there was the heyday of
bombings first by primarily Galleanisti--the first car Bomb is attributed t=
o
Mario Buda aka Mike Boda--who on 16 September blasted Wall Street t the tun=
e
of 37 dead and hundreds of injured--while in 1917 in Milwaukee he is though=
t
to be behind the bombing which unintentionally became the killer of 7
policemen and a number of civilians
(the bomb was found outside a Church, and carried by the police to the
station, where it then suddenly exploded)
 soon to follow were the use of explosives i Chicago and environs caused by
rivals gangs vying for control of the bootlegging racket--today replaced y
the primarily Crack racket--asChigao being one of the central points" from
which the drug is distributed--

However, these parts and aspects of history are for the most part suppresse=
d
and or/omitted --as the role fn the US Government in the incendiary
exterminating  conflagration of Waco generally  is--
(at Waco n the weeks preceding the fire-- and during the stand off in Panam=
a
preceding the arrest an extraditing of Noriega, many of the torture
techniques using light and sound were "tried out" and later adapted for use
through out the US secret prisons and those "open" ones such Guantanamo,
Abu-Ghraib and Bagram and also in Gaza and many others--

In the UK the fear of bombings on British soil and done by Britons and
"foreigners" alike is a very vivid one and real one, and not as expunged as
in the US, where anything pre9/11 except the World Trade Center bombing is
ignored--to emphasize s much as possible the focus on these events for
reasons of "security" used to steadily eat away at Civil and Human Rights
within and outside the US that are carried out by the US--

(in 1979 when the one cab we rode in in London began to take a suspiciously
round about way--the driver said it was due to the call in of a bomb--one
could see various streets on that night cordoned off--and unruffled Bobbies
talking with passersby--)


the history of bombings in England is very long--Guy Fawkes Day for example
point to one form of it--and novels like Henry James' The Princess
Cassamassima and Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent emerged from the massive
bombing campaign in London esp. but in many areas of England in the 1880's
and later on--a literary /bombing "connection/tradition" "carried on"
literally by Brendan Behan, arrested and shipped to Borstal for attempting
to enter the UK with an "Infernal Machine" as a teenager--

with the 24/7 surveillance and it seems every few months another series of
Draconian Laws being imposed in the UK on al citizens, is it any wonder tha=
t
anyone might not have fear not of poetry but simply of being asked what may
be a "trick question" --seemingly about something as innocuous as poetry,
while actually to-do with something far more insidious--

after all,  a person polled  might say that she or he loved the poetry of
Rumi and had been known on many n occasion to fairly explode from the
spontaneous combustion of this poetry which began to suddenly flow
ecstatically forth from one's mouth while reading or reciting its line;  th=
e
poetry uplifting being itself, so that that the Deleuzian =93flight=94  of =
being
is rising to new heights, like a Dove of Freedom flying above the Walls of
Guantanamo, Bagram, Gaza, Baghdad----

You see?  Red alert!! Red Alert!! and the lover of the works of Rumihis
hauled off and after preliminary questioning renditioned to the US for
assignment to one or another of the secret  prisons polluting this earth at
a rate faster than  the vanishing that of potable water for these last many
years--

(the exaggerations of mine  are to remind the reader that these are
possibilities, not, one hopes, facts; and so should be treated as, that is
to say they are the imaginings which the facts may produce--not only as
fiction--but also as a cause for alarm on the part of the individual, the
person polled, because in the climate of today in the UK and US--and
Canada--to like and recite Rumi may be a method for transmitting "terrorist=
"
messages and "for security reasons" necessitate a "better Safe than sorry"
policy of immediate "detention."  A factual example prompting the imaginary
as yet one is that the Poems from Guantanamo to this day are feared by some
in the Military establishment to have contained hidden messages, despite al
efforts to the contrary in controlling their translations and which were
chosen.For almost everything noted here, there is actual factual proof; the
times i include fiction is to indicate that an essay on poetry in a poetic
mode may be created using both fact andimagaination--NOT separating Dr
Williams ""only the imagaination is real"
 in Spring and All from "no ideas but in things, Mr" written roughly 20
years later and appearing in Paterson.)

"Fear of poetry"  is not because of "poetry" perhaps n the cases of those
polled, but the fear of being asked MORE questions, interrogated--frightene=
d
of what one might say in the "being forced to speak" of torture--

"Fear of poetry " then is this fear not od Poetry, but of the persons who,
and the ways in which,  Poetry may be manipulated with "Other Ends in Mind.=
"

One's own poetry for example might be used against one, as an example of no=
t
producing the "correct" form of poetry or Poetics, which in turn leads to
the questioning of the correctness of one's thoughts, commitments, beliefs,
until such a point is reached that indeed even the person polled begins to
know that they are guilty of "poem crimes" and "thought crimes,"  making
their treatment at "Correctional Facilities" being completely necessary to
save both themselves and  the Security of Society, AKA the Society of
Security,   from the Evil that they bear and which is trying to destroy the
Homeland, the Poetry of the State and State Institutions and so forth--.

It may not be Poetry  at all which is "feared," in this poll, but perhaps
very much the Fear of Not Conforming, of Not Saying the Right Thing,  the
Fear of being different, an outsider, and so one is unsafe AS oneself,
unsafe even TO oneself--

in many other cultures around the world, this does not exist, this "fear of
poetry"--
instead, often, poetry may be striking fear into the government, into
traditional forms of conformity, or cause fear simply by being "outspoken"
regarding things one is not supposed to say or think, or, knowing most
people think these forbidden, "subversive" things, one is not allowed to
express them, for the  fear on the "leaders'" parts that once the door is
opened a crack, the rush of those pouring forth with a long bottled up
energy wil be enough to blast the leaders and government and al the
institutions enforcing dutifully their edicts, from the military to the
universities, as well as not a few complicit poets and artists--to blast
these al away as they collapse under  a "popular uprising " from "Below"--

To be sure, (as often is the case) poetry need not be even overtly
protesting "things as they are" but doing so simply by remaining a living
call through time of the yearnings of people for "something more than
this"--
be it spiritual or erotic, complete liberty or the reiteration of the beaut=
y
of the world, of life, that is often lost sight of--

Lost sight of, really, in order to crush down any desire for anything
"more"--to be cynically or intellectually etc opposed to the concept that
persons may want much more than they are given--and that what persons may
want is what you don't want them to have, in which case the "leaders" and
their poets , KNOW, have DECIDED, what is "good for you"--and that is that-=
-
So, to ask for more is NOT ALLOWED--ie. no more imagination! no more
questions! no more laughter! no more doubts!  no more thinking that things
shsented & represented  to one as  the way they are is a lie! yes, for the
benefit of the big shts and their accompanying bards --
(for al Kings, Empresses, have had their Bards, and today it is even claime=
d
that a Bard is President--what a savings eh!  two for the  price of
one!--what genious on the part of somebody or other--)

in which case, to join with "Poetry in Fear, " there may welexist also THE
POETRY OF FEAR" and its sidekick "THE POETRY FOR FEAR""--

Poetry in Fear are those polled who fear to give any asnawers regarding
Poetry which are outside the realm of Conformity--
It is not Poerty that is feared, but what might be behind the asking of wha=
t
may be a "trick question, "leading to one's detnetion for non-confomrist
thoughts and waysof life of being itself, one's being, being "out side the
box" so much that the onlybox fit for one is the one they stick you in to b=
e
lowered into the ground--if you are lucky, eh--

The Potry of Fear is tha poetry which the President speaks when announcing
notonly the continuance of a gret many of the worst and most Fearful
programsof the previousadministration, but a Poetry of Fear which demands
that the society join him in going evn further than any President has gone
before.

And where might this be, this new direction ever futher --itis into the
realm of deatiningone indefintiely wihtout being charged, meaning no
recourse to a defense orlawyersof any kind--and al becuase the president
candecide anytime he or she feelslike to say that so and so is  going to
COMMIT A HEINOUS CRIMEIN THE FUTURE, and to prevent this,nneeds to be
detained and renditioned immediately.

Itisone thing to detain personfor crimes that HAVE BEEN COMMITTED--becuase
then there is evivencde and both a prosecution and efense may present their
arguments pro and con before a Judge. In other words, what American Law is
supposed to be.

However, no  on one in history has ever demanded the Right TO  DETAIN
PERSONS FOR CRIMES THEY HAVE NOT YET COMMITTED..

one SEES NOW,QUITE CLEARLY , THAT CONFOMRITY IN THINKING AND ACTING IS GOIN=
G
TO BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY,. TO AVOID ANY NON-FORMING ALERTING THOUGHT OR
WORDS OR POETRY WHICH WILL LEAD ONE TO SWIFT DETENTION--T BE "DISAPPEARED"
AND--ALSO--PERHAPS--"DELETED" FROM EXISTENCE

To make matters worse, the President is also demanding that the Supreme
Court overturn its ruling that a person arrested can not be questioned unti=
l
provided with a lawyer, either their own or one court appointed.

Tihsm eans that the police, on their own, and in their own ways, may be
questioning the person well before any defense or advice is provided, and
thus given the FULL FEAR FACTOR that will elicit a confession in no time,
and al the "valuable information" needed to avert yet more"CRIMES NOT YET
COMMITTED.

This is the Poetry of Fear--on its way to being "the Law of the Land,"as
decided by a President whom many Poets have seen as indeed being "One of
Them."

"The Law of the Land"--the President is about to name a new Supreme Court
justice--

Once upon a time this Poet president sat and talked with Edward Said.  Dr
Said knew a thing or two about bombings, arsons anonymous and
publcithreatson hislife--after al his office at Coumbia was incierated--and
he lived the rest of his life with an emergency button wired into his desk.

Dr Said of course was a deluded being, way outside the box, yes?--
(The Poetics list even at one point was carrying  truly vicious violent
virulent and graphically obscene hate speech directed at the then just
deceased scholar among a great many things including Poetry. There were
members who protested at the time, also, this kinds of attacks being allowe=
d
to be on thelist, not just Re Edward Said,, but any and eveyone)

That is why a very UnAmerican Law was instituted to protect Americans from
such beings ever again having a chance to be so "influential:

'Another group, chaired by Lynne Cheney, wife of Vice president Richard
Cheney, and Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman , has decried liberal and
leftist academics as the 'weak link' in the war on terror . These public
relations campaigns are designed not simply to arouse public awareness, but
also to influence government action. And they have. After taking hours of
testimony from conservative intellectuals decrying the pernicious influence
of the late Columbia University scholar Edward Said on Middle Eastern
Studies, the House of Representatives UNANIMOUSLY (my emphasis) adopted in
the Fall of 2003 a bill requiring academic programs receiving federal
funding to tailor their their scholar ship and curriculum  to 'better
reflect the national needs related to homeland security.' Under that rubric=
,
according to a report in Salon, the government could use the carrot and
stick of federl money to make sure that ' international studies departments
. . . show more support for American foreign policy."

(Corey Robin:  Fear:  The History of a Political Idea; Oxford UP, 2004; 188=
)


Here, as with the Military and Governement "chain of command"  for
translators working in a rigrously legal, controlled and constrained manner
and environment on the very few non censored "Poems from Guantanamo is what
one may call the "Fear of Poetry, "

Corey Robin  in Fear : the History of a Political Idea just cited also
notes  another tactic
directed against,a whole laundry list of  threats internal and external
published
as full page NY Times ad taken out by AVOT (Americans for Victory Over
Terrorism: amongt them Wiiliam J bennet, James Woolsey & Frank Gaffeny of
the Regan, Bush and Clinton administrations), which calls for "ho.ding
'scholarly research' about Islam to "a serious and rigorous standard.'" (op
cit; 188)

Since a lotof the study of Islam involves the poetry of the Qu'aran both
within and without its text in the poetries inspired by it, one may again
note a "Fear of Poetry"  ("a threat internal and external")  on the part of
the American authorities.

On the one hand the  "Fear of Poetry" and  the "Poetry of  and for Fear."
and on the other, that evinced  by the poll of British persons, as well as
by the inaction's of, as has been the so often remakred on"internally and
externally" the "fear within American poetry & arts" of being "out of line,=
"
not toeing the Company line, remaining complicityly silent re the actions
internal and external of the current and previous Administrations, over a
long period of time.

The American persons then who may well have a Fear  of Poetry, may be those
poets who do not conform to the "rigourous standards" of Institutions from
the Office of President on down to the barcnhes of learning as well as the
monitoring of emails, telephone calls, letters received or books taken out
of the library.

That is the Fear within Poetry--to conform or else--be publicly and
privately attacked. not only by the usual suspects from the Federales or
State or University Administration and media Representatives, but from
fellow poets also.



Re "the end of lists" --
a double edged sword of social networks and their theories is the
possibility of always being among those who agree with one--"like-minded
individuals"--in which case their is no criticism, feedback, discussion,
that may or not be of help to the individual presenter, yet may contribute
some new information or suggest other possibilities to other members of the
network
and where  "the skies are not cloudy all day"

on the one hand, every poet, artist needs encouragement and support,
attention and care; ontheother hand this may devolve into a nonstop parade
of flatterers and sycophants--

one of the dangers of any list, blog, facebook, my space etc etc is that
there is always a strong pressure to conform--

this pressure often need not be "voiced" or written, expressed in any overt
way, yet exist as an undercurrent which flows among the members--

fear is the political arm used to enforce and control the directions of
conformity--

ratchet up the fear and persons not previously fearful suddenly are-the fea=
r
no longer need come from without solely, it is also being generated within,
through the adoption of rebranded language, which quietly omits any
conflicts between directives and actualities--

in other words there is eventually a a good possibility for the  parroting
of propaganda only being allowed--

lists are not at all over, as Jim claims; it just dependents on what lists
one is participating in--there are many that are very alive and well and
also more inclusive than the old poetics list was--these lists and other
social networks one may form without mingling always among the like minded,
are international, and so not governed by the tendency to conformity which
observers of the American scene since de Tocqueville have seen and remarked
on--

the "fear of poetry" then may not be an indication of a "given" but the
symptom of FEAR which is continually made more frightening by the
controlling forces within that society--

& public intellectuals are a dying breed. Or, there is neither the space or a public interested in intellectual debate. Bohemia is dead/dead/dead.
The listserv is a rare and much needed exception... from "The Last Intellectuals/American Culture In The Age of Academe", by Russell Jacoby:

...it was not alwyas difficult to name the "young" intellectuals. Once writers and critics regularly, often obsessively, monitered the new generation; tehy differed not so much over the manes but over their merits. Today even the briefest list would include many blanks: leading younger critics? sociologists? historians? philosophers? Psycholgists? Who are they? Where are they?

Appreciate reading your post, Ann. I am wondering,however, does knitting ha=
ve to be gender identified, or gender claimed? That seems retro to me and n=
o over-all benefit to 'the larger whole'. I have seen a lot of men knitting=
 great stuff. Just this weekend up in Monte Rio on the Russian River, we en=
counter two men at a roadside table. They had yarns to extraordinary colors=
 - translucent blues, carrot reds, jades, deep rose reds, etc. One of them =
was spinning a wooden wheel. There were a variety of woven caps in differen=
t styles for sales.
I joked with the spinner as to whether or not he 'could also tell a good ya=
rn.'=A0 Ironically he had never heard the term 'yarn' for a story.=A0 Then =
I told him that in Greek that the word 'text' means to 'weave' - as in, for=
 example, 'to weave a good story.' And that a good story usually also had a=
 good feel, 'a good texture'. Yes, he remembered a story of a woman who wen=
t to court with her loom and put the words and account=A0 of the proceeding=
s into an on the spot weaving.
This is not to deny that different genders will do the same things quite di=
fferently - no doubt informed by other causes as well (regional, age, etc.)=
=20
Knitting is probably a form of 'marching in place' - as the legs go, and th=
e fingers and hands keep going. Personally, I am walking not so far, and dr=
awing much more!

Paul Naylor, JAMMED TRANSMISSION

Jammed Transmission is a unique text. It is poetry, but not poetry,
philosophy but not philosophy, religion but not religion. It probably
refers, wittingly or unwittingly, to ancient writing practices that were
considered to be spiritual exercises, shorthand verse-form takes on
scripture, composition as devotional exploration. Such forms of writing
were commonplace all over the world at a time when religion – conceived
as the process of ultimate encounter with the limits of human thought
and being – was not, as it is now, divorced from the literary arts. In
fact, in ancient times, long before religion learned how to become
effectively repressive and oppressive, there was no distinction
whatsoever between these two fields of endeavor. All religion required
forms of writing, all writing was sacred writing, and all writers were
of necessity religious people, because it was only within monasteries
and religious enclaves that the esoteric arts of reading, writing and
calligraphy were practiced. (Norman Fischer)

Mark,

Exactly.  Which is why I brought the larger question back to "What can a feminist poetics offer?"

Going back, I do think the immediate reaction to my Briton post was gendered.  I doubt very much if James, who originally posted the note with no other miscellany on another list received queries presuming he was "shocked" and "surprised."  There was no indication in my note that I was either, and yet.  Does David Chirot, who often posts studies here from the NYT, receive such backchannel queries?  But that was just one event on this list that represents a model that is often gendered.  There have been many other examples here that have devolved into bullying, aggression, and intimidation.  And this model, like it or not, is classically dubbed a masculine one, no matter who executes it.  BUT.  That is not to say, and I think we all know this, that women cannot adopt that model.

From childhood, we are each gendered and taught to behave accordingly.  It's why gender ambiguity is so frowned upon from the start.  We want things to be clear so that we can fit the packaged expectations.  It's very important to parents that they know "what they are having" beyond just a healthy baby.  Clear gender is vital.  Many more intersex children are born than we realize (or care to admit - http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency), but parents are urged to "correct" their childrent at birth.  Then we've got studies that illustrate how people, once they know the gender of a baby, handle boys more roughly than girls.  Next, everyone is telling boys not to cry and to be a "big boy" when they exhibit "feminine" expressions like crying or dancing or appreciating frilly or colorful things.  If he likes to paint, he better not like nail polish.  Girls are emphatically schooled to share, care, nurture their dollies, dress like princesses (learn to be
 beautiful), etc.

Literature, including children's verse, begins by upholding that tradition of socializing gender.  Where the Wild Things Are emphasizes the "boy code" which is one that encourages boys to be adventurous, disobedient (to a limit - they eventually do come home to eat), independent, and above all, powerful.  You need only Google "the boy code" to learn all that this term entails.  When the boy in the book finally dominates the monsters, he learns that he has this potential to overcome other forms of power through his own strength, and should, and he will be able to continue to do so throughout his life.  On the flip side, girls are taught in their books to be social via tea parties, to help each other learn how to ice skate and other non-competitive activities, and to just generally be cooperative and interdependent.  I'm not saying grown-up women don't get bitter that these are the roles we've been instructed in anymore than men don't feel confined by
 their roles to always exhibit strength.

Additionally, both models have much to offer.  We develop skills in competition; we complement each other as a species and help others to grow through cooperation.  Of course, all of this is a quick, very generalized overview. *Moreover*, once we've learned these gendered behaviors, it's very difficult to take a step back and ask, "What isn't natural about the way I interact with others?  What behaviors and ways of seeing have I learned?  How do I communicate and what presumptions do I make based on how I learned to be a male or female?"  There is immediate, massive resistance to such examining because to do so A) acknowledges that some of what we think of ourselves as being "naturally" we were in fact conditioned to and, gulp, such learning was beyond our control (does that inherently imply that we were duped?)  and B) it's easy not to consider such gendering because it is so very base and instinctive for adults.  Childhood conditioning becomes "second
 nature."  "It's just the way I am."  Studying any ideology, particularly one's own that is referred to as "reality" is simply upsetting.  Especially when the very question implies the possibility of change.

And so we get to the original question -- what can a feminist poetics offer?  Feminism, more specifically, a feminist poetics is the school of language work that strives to lay bare just how language is gendered *and* seeks to confound/upset/dismantle the expectations and mechanisms of those uses.  It works away at the very ways we communicate.  And yes, as noted, anyone can adopt those masculine and feminine models.  It's why a select few women can behave as aggressively on another list (turf) as the select few men on this list can:  because we are socialized to believe these behaviors are natural, but they are in fact learned and can be adopted at will.  We fall back into our effortless roles of communicating as we were taught growing up -- it's why Reb, in the material I posted, was excited to raise a boy; she wants to break that tradition and raise a man who does not learn the "boy code" and all that it offers (and restricts). A feminist poetics also
 strives to confound the segregation of those models and see what happens when we mix up "feminine" and "masculine" ways of using language.  I posted a few snippets indicating as much too.  Perhaps they were lost in proving that the lull in list discussion was all my fault...

No matter.  The former listserv model only worked for a select few and silenced many.  As noted, these were men and women who were silenced.  If current moderation simply means those select few don't get to name call and ad hom everyone into spent exhaustion and silence in the days of yore, then this will remain a list of announcements.  But if some are interested in figuring out how we can communicate without resorting to such tactics, then the list just might resuscitate a bit.  A list is only as good as its discussions and participants.  I do think, as earlier noted, the lull goes beyond examining the gendered nature of those former discussions; there are other factors, as others have now noted, that detract from list discussion such as blogs.  How many have left this forum to retreat to their own sites and others' comments streams?  Do the smaller number of participants create a sense of community that nearly 2000 cannot?  And perhaps people
 appreciate having a low volume listserv that solely provides announcements?  Perhaps I am nostalgic for a period of discussion on this list from so very long ago, one that didn't resort to bashing other moderators and the creator of the list for discussion fodder.

Yikes -- more to say on mixing up the feminine and masculine modes / models but I'm late for an appointment!

i don't think i've ever seen a list that has taken a dive really come back
to life.

it might continue to have lots of announcements and perhaps poems and
creative writings and so forth. but once they are scuttled as discussion
forums, they don't seem to recover as discussion forums.

and they're relatively easy to scuttle as discussion forums. any idiot can
and does post to them. if the list has interesting artists/critics/thinkers
on it, all the better to bray on.

the open, unmoderated list can't be a good discussion forum for very long.
it's too bad. a cryin shame, really.

we need an alternative where it is much easier to tune out braying. i know
how to create a filter where mail from person x goes in the sin bin, but not
a filter where the mail is from a list and the poster is x. facebook has
this figured out, but i haven't run across any good discussion on facebook.

but the above presupposes a web interface. or a cross-platform email client
architecture where it's easy to develop plugins for a wide variety of email
clients. that'd be nice. then we could develop 'list apps' in email clients.
you'd think the major makers of email clients would get together on such an
effort. sort of like the w3c of emaildom.

An interesting perspective, Amy, and one well stated. And you've made an
attempt in your discussion to be inclusive and not point fingers when you
refer to "bullying, aggression, and intimidation" saying that this is a
learned response. There is one problem created by your prose, however, and
that is labelling it a 'feminist poetics'. This label, in and of itself,
refutes your inclusivity. And please, don't take this as if I'm  faulting
your  analysis. It's just that, when you state "Feminism, more specifically,
a feminist poetics is the school of language work that strives to lay bare
just how language is gendered *and* seeks to confound/upset/dismantle the
expectations and mechanisms of those uses.  It works away at the very ways
we communicate.", you have neglected to examine and analyze this most basic
of terms. Calling something a 'feminist poetics' is almost guaranteed to
raise the hairs on the backs of nearly half your audience as a 'feminist
poetics' must be in opposition to a 'masculine poetics', whatever the hell
that is. Applying a binary Saussurean analysis to this, 'feminist poetics'
is being privileged to the denigration of anything the male might
contribute. Which is unfortunate as it is not what you intended. And I'm not
saying that at one time (hopefully, no longer today) this rallying cry was
required and necessary in order to get beyond the benign neglect occasioned
by the at one time dominant male population. Somehow, we have to get beyond
these gendered terms to a position of personhood.

Mark,

Exactly.  Which is why I brought the larger question back to "What can a
feminist poetics offer?"

Going back, I do think the immediate reaction to my Briton post was
gendered.  I doubt very much if James, who originally posted the note with
no other miscellany on another list received queries presuming he was
"shocked" and "surprised."  There was no indication in my note that I was
either, and yet.  Does David Chirot, who often posts studies here from the
NYT, receive such backchannel queries?  But that was just one event on this
list that represents a model that is often gendered.  There have been many
other examples here that have devolved into bullying, aggression, and
intimidation.  And this model, like it or not, is classically dubbed a
masculine one, no matter who executes it.  BUT.  That is not to say, and I
think we all know this, that women cannot adopt that model.

From childhood, we are each gendered and taught to behave accordingly.  It's
why gender ambiguity is so frowned upon from the start.  We want things to
be clear so that we can fit the packaged expectations.  It's very important
to parents that they know "what they are having" beyond just a healthy baby.
Clear gender is vital.  Many more intersex children are born than we realize
(or care to admit - http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency), but parents are
urged to "correct" their childrent at birth.  Then we've got studies that
illustrate how people, once they know the gender of a baby, handle boys more
roughly than girls.  Next, everyone is telling boys not to cry and to be a
"big boy" when they exhibit "feminine" expressions like crying or dancing or
appreciating frilly or colorful things.  If he likes to paint, he better not
like nail polish.  Girls are emphatically schooled to share, care, nurture
their dollies, dress like princesses (learn to be
 beautiful), etc.

Literature, including children's verse, begins by upholding that tradition
of socializing gender.  Where the Wild Things Are emphasizes the "boy code"
which is one that encourages boys to be adventurous, disobedient (to a limit
- they eventually do come home to eat), independent, and above all,
powerful.  You need only Google "the boy code" to learn all that this term
entails.  When the boy in the book finally dominates the monsters, he learns
that he has this potential to overcome other forms of power through his own
strength, and should, and he will be able to continue to do so throughout
his life.  On the flip side, girls are taught in their books to be social
via tea parties, to help each other learn how to ice skate and other
non-competitive activities, and to just generally be cooperative and
interdependent.  I'm not saying grown-up women don't get bitter that these
are the roles we've been instructed in anymore than men don't feel confined
by
 their roles to always exhibit strength.

Additionally, both models have much to offer.  We develop skills in
competition; we complement each other as a species and help others to grow
through cooperation.  Of course, all of this is a quick, very generalized
overview. *Moreover*, once we've learned these gendered behaviors, it's very
difficult to take a step back and ask, "What isn't natural about the way I
interact with others?  What behaviors and ways of seeing have I learned?
How do I communicate and what presumptions do I make based on how I learned
to be a male or female?"  There is immediate, massive resistance to such
examining because to do so A) acknowledges that some of what we think of
ourselves as being "naturally" we were in fact conditioned to and, gulp,
such learning was beyond our control (does that inherently imply that we
were duped?)  and B) it's easy not to consider such gendering because it is
so very base and instinctive for adults.  Childhood conditioning becomes
"second
 nature."  "It's just the way I am."  Studying any ideology, particularly
one's own that is referred to as "reality" is simply upsetting.  Especially
when the very question implies the possibility of change.

And so we get to the original question -- what can a feminist poetics offer?
And yes, as noted, anyone can adopt those masculine and feminine models.
It's why a select few women can behave as aggressively on another list
(turf) as the select few men on this list can:  because we are socialized to
believe these behaviors are natural, but they are in fact learned and can be
adopted at will.  We fall back into our effortless roles of communicating as
we were taught growing up -- it's why Reb, in the material I posted, was
excited to raise a boy; she wants to break that tradition and raise a man
who does not learn the "boy code" and all that it offers (and restricts). A
feminist poetics also
 strives to confound the segregation of those models and see what happens
when we mix up "feminine" and "masculine" ways of using language.  I posted
a few snippets indicating as much too.  Perhaps they were lost in proving
that the lull in list discussion was all my fault...

No matter.  The former listserv model only worked for a select few and
silenced many.  As noted, these were men and women who were silenced.  If
current moderation simply means those select few don't get to name call and
ad hom everyone into spent exhaustion and silence in the days of yore, then
this will remain a list of announcements.  But if some are interested in
figuring out how we can communicate without resorting to such tactics, then
the list just might resuscitate a bit.  A list is only as good as its
discussions and participants.  I do think, as earlier noted, the lull goes
beyond examining the gendered nature of those former discussions; there are
other factors, as others have now noted, that detract from list discussion
such as blogs.  How many have left this forum to retreat to their own sites
and others' comments streams?  Do the smaller number of participants create
a sense of community that nearly 2000 cannot?  And perhaps people
 appreciate having a low volume listserv that solely provides announcements?
Perhaps I am nostalgic for a period of discussion on this list from so very
long ago, one that didn't resort to bashing other moderators and the creator
of the list for discussion fodder.

Yikes -- more to say on mixing up the feminine and masculine modes / models
but I'm late for an appointment!

Be well,

The alternative which you seek is called usenet.  A usenet newsgroup may be
moderated or not, preferably moderated, considering the trolls that lurk
there.  One may then create a killfile for your newsreader in which to dump
undesired posters.  Usenet is thriving with well over 100,000 groups, some
of them quite active.  Connected newsgroups could be set up as well,
including binary groups where graphics and sound and short videos could be
posted.  You could have something like alt.poeticslist.discussion.moderated
along with alt.poeticslist.poems and alt.poeticslist.binaries and this could
possibly lead to a more robust use of the notion.

Thanks for the familiar explanation. It would be helpful if we had a state =
of nature for comparison, but we don't. There's of course no denying the di=
fferences in role models in our society and their enforcement by difference=
s in child rearing. But the underlying assumptions about the nature of the =
species and genders are less than compelling. One of those assumptions,agai=
nst a great deal of evidence, seems to be that we come into this world as t=
abulae rasa, hence infinitely mutable. Another seems to be that in a state =
of nature little girls, and boys, would be made of sugar and spice and ever=
ything nice, and that in the society we have aggression by men and women is=
 a distortion of nature and to be lamented. I'm not that optimistic. It's e=
ntirely possible that, raised with no social expectations whatever, more li=
ttle girls would grow up to be as aggressive as some men, and that aggressi=
ve women in our society have against the odds succeeded in being themselves=
, or that there are more aggressive women because there is less childhood c=
onditioning against aggressiveness. Regardless, we can make a fair guess th=
at in whatever just society there would be wide variation, with an unhealth=
y percentage of women as well as men exhibiting uncomfortable levels of agg=
ression. One sign of this might be the numbers of women who, thanks to fert=
ility control, find themselves free to join the military. Are they being ma=
sculine, or are they subject to the same economic motivations that drive so=
me young men to enlist, and also the ungendered psychological motivations t=
hat drive some of those young men to enjoy inflicting pain? In a just socie=
ty would more female sociopaths feel free to express themselves as men do?

Back to list behavior. I don't see any solution. I've been on this and othe=
r lists for a long time, and I don't remember "a period of discussion on th=
is list from so very long ago, one that didn't resort to bashing other mode=
rators and the creator of the list for discussion fodder." All lists seem t=
o go through periods of warfare, though this more than most. I suspect that=
 it's the demographics--a lot of academics, and a lot of the young. In any =
event, we're talking about the behavior of very few--active participation o=
n any list I know of seems to be restricted to a very few members, you and =
I among them.

Mark,

Exactly.  Which is why I brought the larger question back to "What can a fe=
minist poetics offer?" =20

Going back, I do think the immediate reaction to my Briton post was gendere=
d.  I doubt very much if James, who originally posted the note with no othe=
r miscellany on another list received queries presuming he was "shocked" an=
d "surprised."  There was no indication in my note that I was either, and y=
et.  Does David Chirot, who often posts studies here from the NYT, receive =
such backchannel queries?  But that was just one event on this list that re=
presents a model that is often gendered.  There have been many other exampl=
es here that have devolved into bullying, aggression, and intimidation.  An=
d this model, like it or not, is classically dubbed a masculine one, no mat=
ter who executes it.  BUT.  That is not to say, and I think we all know thi=
s, that women cannot adopt that model. =20

From childhood, we are each gendered and taught to behave accordingly.  It'=
s why gender ambiguity is so frowned upon from the start.  We want things t=
o be clear so that we can fit the packaged expectations.  It's very importa=
nt to parents that they know "what they are having" beyond just a healthy b=
aby.  Clear gender is vital.  Many more intersex children are born than we =
realize (or care to admit - http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency), but parents=
 are urged to "correct" their childrent at birth.  Then we've got studies t=
hat illustrate how people, once they know the gender of a baby, handle boys=
 more roughly than girls.  Next, everyone is telling boys not to cry and to=
 be a "big boy" when they exhibit "feminine" expressions like crying or dan=
cing or appreciating frilly or colorful things.  If he likes to paint, he b=
etter not like nail polish.  Girls are emphatically schooled to share, care=
, nurture their dollies, dress like princesses (learn to be
 beautiful), etc. =20

Literature, including children's verse, begins by upholding that tradition =
of socializing gender.  Where the Wild Things Are emphasizes the "boy code"=
 which is one that encourages boys to be adventurous, disobedient (to a lim=
it - they eventually do come home to eat), independent, and above all, powe=
rful.  You need only Google "the boy code" to learn all that this term enta=
ils.  When the boy in the book finally dominates the monsters, he learns th=
at he has this potential to overcome other forms of power through his own s=
trength, and should, and he will be able to continue to do so throughout hi=
s life.  On the flip side, girls are taught in their books to be social via=
 tea parties, to help each other learn how to ice skate and other non-compe=
titive activities, and to just generally be cooperative and interdependent.=
  I'm not saying grown-up women don't get bitter that these are the roles w=
e've been instructed in anymore than men don't feel confined by
 their roles to always exhibit strength. =20

Additionally, both models have much to offer.  We develop skills in competi=
tion; we complement each other as a species and help others to grow through=
 cooperation.  Of course, all of this is a quick, very generalized overview=
. *Moreover*, once we've learned these gendered behaviors, it's very diffic=
ult to take a step back and ask, "What isn't natural about the way I intera=
ct with others?  What behaviors and ways of seeing have I learned?  How do =
I communicate and what presumptions do I make based on how I learned to be =
a male or female?"  There is immediate, massive resistance to such examinin=
g because to do so A) acknowledges that some of what we think of ourselves =
as being "naturally" we were in fact conditioned to and, gulp, such learnin=
g was beyond our control (does that inherently imply that we were duped?)  =
and B) it's easy not to consider such gendering because it is so very base =
and instinctive for adults.  Childhood conditioning becomes "second
 nature."  "It's just the way I am."  Studying any ideology, particularly o=
ne's own that is referred to as "reality" is simply upsetting.  Especially =
when the very question implies the possibility of change.

And so we get to the original question -- what can a feminist poetics offer=
?  Feminism, more specifically, a feminist poetics is the school of languag=
e work that strives to lay bare just how language is gendered *and* seeks t=
o confound/upset/dismantle the expectations and mechanisms of those uses.  =
It works away at the very ways we communicate.  And yes, as noted, anyone c=
an adopt those masculine and feminine models.  It's why a select few women =
can behave as aggressively on another list (turf) as the select few men on =
this list can:  because we are socialized to believe these behaviors are na=
tural, but they are in fact learned and can be adopted at will.  We fall ba=
ck into our effortless roles of communicating as we were taught growing up =
-- it's why Reb, in the material I posted, was excited to raise a boy; she =
wants to break that tradition and raise a man who does not learn the "boy c=
ode" and all that it offers (and restricts). A feminist poetics also
 strives to confound the segregation of those models and see what happens w=
hen we mix up "feminine" and "masculine" ways of using language.  I posted =
a few snippets indicating as much too.  Perhaps they were lost in proving t=
hat the lull in list discussion was all my fault...=20

No matter.  The former listserv model only worked for a select few and sile=
nced many.  As noted, these were men and women who were silenced.  If curre=
nt moderation simply means those select few don't get to name call and ad h=
om everyone into spent exhaustion and silence in the days of yore, then thi=
s will remain a list of announcements.  But if some are interested in figur=
ing out how we can communicate without resorting to such tactics, then the =
list just might resuscitate a bit.  A list is only as good as its discussio=
ns and participants.  I do think, as earlier noted, the lull goes beyond ex=
amining the gendered nature of those former discussions; there are other fa=
ctors, as others have now noted, that detract from list discussion such as =
blogs.  How many have left this forum to retreat to their own sites and oth=
ers' comments streams?  Do the smaller number of participants create a sens=
e of community that nearly 2000 cannot?  And perhaps people
 appreciate having a low volume listserv that solely provides announcements=
?  Perhaps I am nostalgic for a period of discussion on this list from so v=
ery long ago, one that didn't resort to bashing other moderators and the cr=
eator of the list for discussion fodder. =20

Yikes -- more to say on mixing up the feminine and masculine modes / models=
 but I'm late for an appointment!

Be well,

Thank you, John.  However, I disagree with the notion that a "feminist poet=
ics" implies a divisiveness based on there being one versus the other.  Tha=
t would be a "feminine poetics" versus a "masculine poetics."  A feminist p=
oetics is not exclusive to one gender.  It's true that feminism, historical=
ly, has sought to make practical strides for women such as achieving equal =
pay and fairness in the law.  But men have since become feminists (some cal=
l themselves as much too) as they have benefited from the more complex effo=
rts to change gender roles and expand the very notion of gender, behaviors,=
 etc.  There are now many men who embrace feminism for what that school of =
thought has opened up for everyone, because of and despite gender divisions=
.  And beyond them.  For those reasons, again, practically speaking, there =
are men today who are living very different lives than their fathers and gr=
andfathers.  Riskily generalizing again, men are nurturing more now
 than ever (& not just in the home but in relation to others at work, with =
friends, etc), view relationships with their wives / parnters in much more =
egalitarian ways than even as recently as the feminine mystique (despite it=
s remaining vestiges - http://www.nysun.com/arts/reconsiderations-betty-fri=
edans-the-feminine/86003/), stand up to bullying even when its the popular =
thing to join in on, and a lot more changes than I can note here.  Overall,=
 both genders are engaging in ways of communicating previously unimagined a=
nd are appreciating and respecting more than ever before.  =0A=0AI don't th=
ink a feminist poetics is exclusive to women -- at all -- which is why we a=
re now seeing more men and women (and those beyond the strict labels of "me=
n" and "women") inquiring into and exploring what a feminist poetics is att=
empting and might offer.  Of course, my rudimentary explanation was meant o=
nly to illustrate the foundations from which a feminist poetics was born; i=
t is not -- by a long or short shot -- an explanation of what a feminist po=
etics is.  I think there is a "fourth wave" (or whatever period we're enter=
ing) that will surprisingly include more men than ever.  I earlier posted e=
xcerpts from just a few of the male poets who are inquiring to illustrate t=
hat a feminist poetics is open to all and is a much more complex field than=
 even I am aware.  Some of those notes I posted reveal that many are just n=
ow beginning to ask, "Who is practicing a feminist poetics and what are the=
y doing?" -- in that line of inquiry is the idea that
 there are surely a variety of foci, aims, and achievements to date.  By st=
arting with how have we worked through inequities and how are we addressing=
 them, as well as conceptual ones, we can trace some practices as well as n=
ote new innovations as they come to light.  =0A=0AAll in all, a feminist po=
etics queries just what a "masculine poetics" does as well as a "feminine p=
oetics" because both sides of the (false but still taught) dualism have the=
ir positives and negatives that we are trying to sort through -- as you are=
 well aware, I'm sure, the very fact that the two are separated and then co=
nditioned as behaviors based on biological gender is a sad condition that n=
eed not be.  Who gets told to be aggressive?  Who gets applauded for speaki=
ng with intimidation?  Who is encouraged to avoid disagreement in favor of =
affirming others?  Who sacrifices expressing what one knows because modesty=
 is preferred over "vanity"?  What is expected of me on those bases? etc.  =
A feminist poetics wants to confound those binaries, from what I've seen, a=
nd blur the lines of who gets to practice a masculine poetics vs. a feminin=
e one.  A feminist poetics, in part, wants to conflate the very notions, re=
duce some aspects, emphasize others, etc.=20
 And of course, all of this remains much more complex than my explanation, =
which is why I posed the question to the list, "What can a feminist poetics=
 offer in relation to the way we communicate, operate within a listserv com=
munity, and beyond?"  Personhood, yes!  Perhaps we could create a personhoo=
d poetics, but until then, its foundation is in a feminist poetics from wha=

That sounds defeatist but fair, Mark.  All in all, it seems the very notion that this list is moderated against flaming and name calling was enough to quell the few.  Honestly, I've omitted very few posts during my tenure here and only those that truly were flames/name calling. Even posts that don't seem to contribute to discussion are released.  I'm all for passionate arguing, but based how few offer up debate anymore, I'm inclined to think that some versions of "passionate argument" necessitate name calling "warfare", and those few posters ("combatants"?) devoted to the practice gave up.  Kind of like Rambo when he came home -- he had no purpose except the one he was rigorously trained for, to fight, so he made war in a small quiet town with the cops to give himself something to do.  I guess once they realized such message bombs weren't going to get through, those few figured if they can't include such base tactics, why bother trying anything else.

Back to list behavior. I don't see any solution. I've been on this and other lists for a long time, and I don't remember "a period of discussion on this list from so very long ago, one that didn't resort to bashing other moderators and the creator of the list for discussion fodder." All lists seem to go through periods of warfare, though this more than most. I suspect that it's the demographics--a lot of academics, and a lot of the young. In any event, we're talking about the behavior of very few--active participation on any list I know of seems to be restricted to a very few members, you and I among them.

Thank you, John.  However, I disagree with the notion that a "feminist =
poetics" implies a divisiveness based on there being one versus the =
other.  That would be a "feminine poetics" versus a "masculine poetics." =
 A feminist poetics is not exclusive to one gender.  It's true that =
feminism, historically, has sought to make practical strides for women =
such as achieving equal pay and fairness in the law.  But men have since =
become feminists (some call themselves as much too) as they have =
benefited from the more complex efforts to change gender roles and =
expand the very notion of gender, behaviors, etc.  There are now many =
men who embrace feminism for what that school of thought has opened up =
for everyone, because of and despite gender divisions.  And beyond them. =
 For those reasons, again, practically speaking, there are men today who =
are living very different lives than their fathers and grandfathers.  =
Riskily generalizing again, men are nurturing more now
 than ever (& not just in the home but in relation to others at work, =
with friends, etc), view relationships with their wives / parnters in =
much more egalitarian ways than even as recently as the feminine =
mystique (despite its remaining vestiges - =
http://www.nysun.com/arts/reconsiderations-betty-friedans-the-feminine/86=
003/), stand up to bullying even when its the popular thing to join in =
on, and a lot more changes than I can note here.  Overall, both genders =
are engaging in ways of communicating previously unimagined and are =
appreciating and respecting more than ever before. =20

I don't think a feminist poetics is exclusive to women -- at all -- =
which is why we are now seeing more men and women (and those beyond the =
strict labels of "men" and "women") inquiring into and exploring what a =
feminist poetics is attempting and might offer.  Of course, my =
rudimentary explanation was meant only to illustrate the foundations =
from which a feminist poetics was born; it is not -- by a long or short =
shot -- an explanation of what a feminist poetics is.  I think there is =
a "fourth wave" (or whatever period we're entering) that will =
surprisingly include more men than ever.  I earlier posted excerpts from =
just a few of the male poets who are inquiring to illustrate that a =
feminist poetics is open to all and is a much more complex field than =
even I am aware.  Some of those notes I posted reveal that many are just =
now beginning to ask, "Who is practicing a feminist poetics and what are =
they doing?" -- in that line of inquiry is the idea that
 there are surely a variety of foci, aims, and achievements to date.  By =
starting with how have we worked through inequities and how are we =
addressing them, as well as conceptual ones, we can trace some practices =
as well as note new innovations as they come to light. =20

All in all, a feminist poetics queries just what a "masculine poetics" =
does as well as a "feminine poetics" because both sides of the (false =
but still taught) dualism have their positives and negatives that we are =
trying to sort through -- as you are well aware, I'm sure, the very fact =
that the two are separated and then conditioned as behaviors based on =
biological gender is a sad condition that need not be.  Who gets told to =
be aggressive?  Who gets applauded for speaking with intimidation?  Who =
is encouraged to avoid disagreement in favor of affirming others?  Who =
sacrifices expressing what one knows because modesty is preferred over =
"vanity"?  What is expected of me on those bases? etc.  A feminist =
poetics wants to confound those binaries, from what I've seen, and blur =
the lines of who gets to practice a masculine poetics vs. a feminine =
one.  A feminist poetics, in part, wants to conflate the very notions, =
reduce some aspects, emphasize others, etc.=20
 And of course, all of this remains much more complex than my =
explanation, which is why I posed the question to the list, "What can a =
feminist poetics offer in relation to the way we communicate, operate =
within a listserv community, and beyond?"  Personhood, yes!  Perhaps we =
could create a personhood poetics, but until then, its foundation is in =
a feminist poetics from what I can tell ...

Best,

Amy

You may be right. Although I haven't seen these folks on the barely- or un-moderated poetry listserves that I belong to.

I've always been more concerned that so few contribute to the discussions on any list I know of. I kinow a fair number of those on the lists from other contexts, and I know how interesting they are. But this seems to have always been the case, even before blogs etc siphoned some of the discussion away.

It never occurred to me, by the way, that you were overcontrolling messages.

Best,

Mark

I've been on this and other lists for a long time, and I don't remember "a period of discussion on this list from so very long ago, one that didn't resort to bashing other moderators and the creator of the list for discussion fodder." All lists seem to go through periods of warfare, though this more than most. I suspect that it's the demographics--a lot of academics, and a lot of the young. In any event, we're talking about the behavior of very few--active participation on any list I know of seems to be restricted to a very few members, you and I among them.

I have no interest in wading into this thread, but my feeling is that
the 2 post rule did much more to quell interesting, active &
spontaneous discussion, than any form of moderation.

The poetic on this list that I find the most troubling is that every time an energetic discussion gets started, it quickly devolves into a binary argument -- because one person (often the person who started the discussion in the first place) hits REPLY to EVERY SINGLE MESSAGE that appears in the thread.  This creates, at its very best, a two-way argument: PRO- vs. ANTI-, or the polemicist against the world, or the center against the margins, or the one against the many, or etc., and turns the remainder of the 2000 people on the list into mere cheerleaders who can only pick sides in the argument and not contribute any of their own thinking to the discussion.

I imagine that most of the thousands here are casual users like myself, who don't care very much about the brand name of The List, and are here because they like to think about poetics ("I don't 'like' the poetics list, but I read it anyway," is a sentiment I've often heard). We don't read it every day, and certainly not the several times per hour that would allow us to argue here with anyone intent on shouting us down.  If you few frequent posters really want us many to contribute, I'd recommend you restrain yourselves from posting overmuch in the same thread, and post your posts in a more open form which invites participation and discussion rather than argument.  I think Amy is right to call such a form "feminist", but I wonder whether quasi-academic expository-prose essays are ever a vital embodiment of a feminist poetics.

I, for one, would love to see more posts like Alan's more "poetic" essays, preferably a constellation of such posts and posters that they actually respond to and discuss with one another, however obliquely. I understand that you may not want to open the floodgates to a zillion nostalgic-for-profession amateurs, posting our doggerel and asking "SO WHADDYA GUYS THINK OF MY POOEMS?", but I think that framing a discussion of poetics with the rules of something like "literary influence" rather than those of "undergraduate seminar" or "presidential debate" would be very helpful.

i'm familiar with usenet. it's been around since 1980. some email clients
such as outlook express can process usenet.

it's a little off the beaten track, isn't it. and it seems to have a spam
problem. i suppose those are the unmoderated lists.

why isn't it more popular for poetics-like types of forums?

probably because it requires a very slightly higher tech level. and usenet
is not supported by all email clients.

also, i'm thinking of something that would require almost no moderation.

is there something like a w3c for email clients? so that cross-platform apps
for email clients can be developed. why not, if no? email is one of the
'killer apps' yet email clients still aren't all that great.

Subject:      answering question from mark weiss &what i wrote abt the way amy
              posted the original link and "fear of Poetry" that intersted me
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

trying to scan through the one incredibly long post which has been added on
to by many persons--
i noticed that mark Weiss had a question or remark  wondering what i might
hear back channel  from posting  just an article name here and the link

once in a while i may post a couple comments
but on the whole i like it better
(as you will see below) when the link is there and one may read it without
another's voice thrumping in the head
and so be bale to have a conversation rather than a reaction with the
persons interested in the link, new story

likewise i like it when people do  as Amy did--do the same thing and just
post the note as you will see below
that way without having each other blasting boomboxes in other's the mind,
one reads more attentively and is able to have a better conversation-

(a big problem on line is misreading--people read way too fast i think and
just leap like panthers onto a few key words like in a speed reading
class-and so get the actual letter/post al mixed up and are made as hell and
not going to take it anymore about something that is not there in the
original, but which has been projected into those empty spaces between the
keywords in which one assumes it is saying what one is sure as certain is
that THEY KNOW just what so and so will say--what i say included of course-i
think often persons project their image or idea of a person on to the
persons and so dont pay much attention to what they actually say
-)



i can't recall having any negative feedback regarding these from anyone
once in while on the list itself someone wil be angry but often it is due to
misreading
i actually get a very great deal of mailbackchannel from women in a wide
variety of countries and societies, cultures--
actually when think of it i get quite abit more mail from women than
men--and often it is about al ink without the message--so one can think for
oneself-or artworks seen and so forth-and write lot back and forth-even
though sometimes neither one of us may know the other's language al that
well-sometimes just use a third language we both do know or--if you  want to
converse you will for sure

since a child i haven't been intersted in arguments but very much ore in
conversations--usually arguing is done to show off smart one is and flex the
mind-muscles and show off and try to beat the other person down into the
ditches of humiliation

often if you listen to an argument it is not based on anything more than oft
times mutual dislike and not a real argumentative point-
and also al otof the time neither one listens to the others

and on top of it
very often it is absurd as al too often neither one knows as much about the
subject as each one thinks they do
so that's why i don't put things out there with any of my nonsense attached
or as litle as possible
stiiaight?
straight up!

below you can see whati wrote re the events here --and links etc--


http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2009/05/fear-of-poetrypoetry-of-fear.html

below some opening images, this is exactly how my post appears re Fear of
Poetry/Poetry of  Fear and Poetry for Fear
the piece there is slightly revised and typo corrected from what appeared on
this list and is accompanied by a great many illustrations from a wide
variety of sources inc some of my Visual Poetry --

there wil be   Part Two re reviewing of poetry (and why al the reviews seem
to be puff pieces)-- as the issue was raised and discussed by Kent Johnson
and a distinguished gathering of poets-in mAYDAY.
http://maydaymagazine.com/




(note: this is a response to a message on the buffalo poetics list from Amy
King re a poll taken in the UK
I thank Amy for sending this as i found it thought provoking in many ways.
The original message is as here--

Britons are baffled by poetry, with many saying they live in fear of being
asked to recite a poem in public, research has found.

Seven in 10 (73%) are "scared" by the genre, according to a
poll of 1,500 adults, while two thirds (67%) admit reading and reciting
poetry leave them tongue-tied.
more...
http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5inb086GokHGwHM5CYXZ0-XLJpYxw

there were no comments, simply this note.
Personally I like finding such things as some provocative facts placed out
their in the winds to see what may be some responses re what I took to be
the issue of "fear of poetry/poetry of fear."


For reasons beyond me the note apparently provoked many attacks, from what i
can glean of the matter, y it's being sent by a woman. Fortunately the
attacks led to a very good discussion of Feminism, Feminist Writing, and
Feminist Writing blogs.
Here is a link to an excellent blog and its description and address as
posted by Amy King where many of the responses re the Feminist and Feminist
writing issues appeared

he women of Delirous Hem [http://www.delirioushem.blogspot.com/] have
recently been discussing the dynamics of such exchange as well as how men
and women are actually advancing a feminist poetics. This line of inquiry
has even led a few to wonder aloud (via their blogs) just what a feminist
poetics is and how to promote it. Even a few men aren't afraid of the notion
that we need new models of exchange, which is a poetics too. Feminist modes
of thinking and operating may not, after all, be for women only. I don't
have the answers, but feminist imaginings may actually provide models by
which we can jump start a listserv that seems to have grown quiet in
exchange, even by initially asking, Just what can feminist thinking make us
aware of and what models for discussion might we use? What is a feminist
poetics, exactly? What are the aims of feminist-minded poets? ... Some
excerpts from the Delirous Hem responses

      [image: Because Freedom Can't Protect
Itself]<http://action.aclu.org/site/R?i=3DlnB0hSoeNfxobRGbX9MOxw..>
   Dear ACLU Supporter,

Today, personal freedom took a big hit in California. In a 6-to-1 decision,
the California Supreme Court ruled against us in our case to overturn
Proposition 8.

Marriages of same-sex couples will continue to be banned in California.

This is deeply disappointing, especially in light of the recent Iowa Suprem=
e
Court ruling saying that it is unconstitutional to keep gay couples from
marrying -- and the passage of laws opening marriage to everyone by the
Vermont and Maine legislatures. Public support for marriage for same-sex
couples is gaining ground, but California is being left behind.

Matt Coles, the director of the ACLU's LGBT project, recorded a personal
message about California's decision, what it means for people=92s lives and
its impact on the freedoms of all Americans.

*Please take a minute to watch this video and share it with your friends an=
d
family: <http://action.aclu.org/site/R?i=3DfHykD_oIcQgmx3tphHCMzw..>*
  [image: Watch Now]<http://action.aclu.org/site/R?i=3D-6oMyjb_CUlo9L7kMWKj=
pA..>

This decision legitimizes discrimination and allows the government to
intrude on our most intimate commitments. You can be sure the ACLU will
continue to work for fairness for gay couples and families.

But this case goes beyond the LGBT community. It is also about the
government imposing one group=92s idea of morality on everyone else. And wh=
en
that happens, you can be sure the ACLU will be there.

Listen to what Matt has to say about the Prop 8 decision and the important
work the ACLU is doing to protect the personal freedoms of all Americans.

Those opposed to same-sex marriage are on the wrong end of history. And,
with your help, the ACLU will wage and win this battle for equality no
matter how long it takes.

Sincerely,

Friends,

I'm very happy to announce the publication of my first full-length book. SECRET DONUT was written between 2004-2006, the same time frame as most of my other chapbooks. The book contains four longish sequences, including some "translations" of 20th century French poets) and a handful of loose poems.

I'm also very pleased that Pressed Wafer is issuing the book. I have long admired their work (they also published my second chapbook, DAYS AND DAYS) and this one is absolutely gorgeous.

I hope you'll check the book out. At the URL below you'll find ordering information, an image of the cover, and a sample poem.

http://pressed-wafer.blogspot.com

Thanks very much.

Be well,
Aaron

STUNNING COLLECTION OF CONTEMPORARY LOVE POETRY BY SOME OF TODAY=E2=80=99S =
MOST CUTTING-EDGE ARTISTS

From the earliest records in the Western tradition of poetry, throughout th=
e classical period and during the Middle Ages, spanning the Renaissance, th=
e Enlightenment and beyond, romantic love has been the obsessive object of =
poetic attentions. However, modern and postmodern poets tend to avoid writi=
ng about love, focusing instead on political, social and theoretical terrai=
ns.

When Dawn-Michelle Baude took on the job of guest-editing the sixth edition=
 of the internationally acclaimed poetry anthology Van Gogh's Ear, she deli=
berately chose love as her theme in order to challenge this modern poetic s=
ystem in which the vocabularies for alienation and violence have outstrippe=
d those of attachment and affection.

More than seventy cutting edge poets, writers and visual artists from aroun=
d the globe have answered Dawn-Michelle Baude's call for poems and prose pi=
eces about love. Complementing the poetry and prose are the stunning images=
 selected by Arts Editor Anne-Shelton Aaron whose twenty-five years of expe=
rience as a contemporary art connoisseur have leant incredible visual depth=
 to this edition of Van Gogh=E2=80=99s Ear.

Van Goghs Ear 6: The Love Edition takes the throbbing pulse of love now, in=
 2009, in countries around the world. Sexual, romantic, altruistic, fetishi=
stic, Platonic, political, happenstance and all the rest - the poems and pr=
ose in this edition are vital, and, in abrupt contrast to the foundational =
irony of postmodernism, even sincere. The writers=E2=80=99 engagement with =
the topics ranges from the subtle to the overt, the off-hand to the engaged=
, just like in life.

> Which is why I brought the larger question back to "What can a

I have been reading through this thread and wishing I had the time to
contribute more than the quick response that this message is going to
be. The question of a feminist poetics, what it is/might be, how men
do/can/should/shouldn't/can't relate to it, adopt it, adapt to it,
find ourselves in it, etc. and so on has been central to my writing
for as long as I have considered myself a poet, and it goes back to
the fact that it was feminism, specifically my reading of Adrienne
Rich's essays when I was in my early 20s, that gave me a vocabulary--
and therefore a voice--to talk about, to speak my truth of, my
experience of having been sexually abused as a boy. There is a great
deal to unpack in that statement, I know, part of it autobiographical
and part of it not, but, as I said, I don't really have the time to do
so right now. What I will say here is that one of the things I found
in feminism--and the connection to my being a survivor of sexual abuse
will be obvious--is a poetics of the body that has been indispensable
to me as a man trying to figure out who I am in this world and as a
poet (and those two are obviously not unrelated). More than in any
other framing of the world/way of reading/agenda for change (to the
degree that feminism as some sort of abstract notion can be said to be
or have one agenda; there are, after all, many feminisms), I find in
feminism a willingness, an eagerness, to embrace the notion of the
body, the material body, the skin in which we all walk around, and the
integrity of the body, as fundamental to ideas of justice (and this is
quite different from the patriarchal ideology of biology as destiny).

And so--I am sort of leaping here--one of the questions that has
occurred to me as I have been reading through this thread is what,
precisely, do we--or, more precisely, does our language, since
language is all we have on a list--embody when we post here; and that
makes me think of an essay that I read a long time ago in, I think,
The Georgia Review by a woman whose name I cannot remember, but whose
point (and I am paraphrasing a memory here) was that the kind of
writing that gets taught in academia--argumentative, persuasive,
scholarly--takes as its underlying metaphor the notion of battle, the
idea that the point of engaging in scholarly discussion is to have
your argument come out on top; and that makes me think of a book
called Metaphors We Live By, by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, in
which they show that it's not just academic discourse that we think of
metaphorically as war, but that, in US culture anyway, we conceive of
argument in general as a kind of battle. Just think of the expressions
we use: arguments are lost or won; they are destroyed, honed,
advanced, withdrawn; we strategize our arguments, look for weaknesses,
loopholes in the arguments of our opponents; we concede some points to
gain others and, hopefully, by losing the battle, enable ourselves to
win the war; and the list could go on.

Certainly what I have just written describes my experience of
discussion, and it's not that I shy away from strong debate or
intellectual confrontation; or that I think everyone is "right" in
some easy relativistic sort of way...well, way of illustrating how
deeply embedded this metaphor is in the way we see the world, Lakoff
and Johnson suggest a thought experiment: try to imagine argument not
as a contest with a winner and a loser, but as a dance, where the
object is for the end result to be beautiful, where the point is to
build that beautiful thing. We all know that there is tension in
making art, that some ideas work better than others, that some parts
need to be discarded in the interest of the whole, that one of the
beauties of a work of art is that it can hold opposing points of view
in some kind of resolution, even though that resolution may not
necessarily be in the work itself, but in the experience of the artist
and/or audience.

In this metaphor for argument, there is no opponent to defeat--and I
apologize for writing quickly and perhaps carelessly or too
telegraphically--and so it seems to me that one way of thinking about
what a feminist poetics has to offer, one way of beginning to perform
a feminist poetics, is to engage in this kind of what I will call
"deep" reimagining; if we don't like the way arguments/discussions
have been conducted on this list, and if the way they are conducted
has to do with the results the participants expect (in this case,
winning and losing); and if the results the participants expect have
to do with metaphor(s) through which we imagine and experience
argument/discussion; then maybe if we start to talk concretely about
what other kinds of results we might want--and I don't know if "a
dance of ideas," for example, is the way to go, but it's a beginning--
we might start to get the kind of change that Amy has been saying we
need to be looking for.

And now it's back to my regularly scheduled writing tasks.

Richard

The biggest problem with usenet is that it (almost always) has to be
locally cached by your ISP. Fewer and fewer ISPs are willing to
devote the bandwidth and storage space to caching the huge, huge,
HUGE volume of usenet, especially if their users clamor for the
inclusion of binaries groups.

Sadly, usenet is a doddering old dinosaur about to expire, as
wonderful as it was back in the days of Gopher and the like. There
are alternatives like Deja News, but Google, who owns it, could pull
the plug at any moment, and there goes your party. And most new use
of usenet has been from spammers.

The better option might be a system like Slashdot's karma and mod-
points system. That community is extremely contentious, yet their
system allows posts to be hidden and/or promoted based on a user-
based moderation system in which users with good karma are
periodically given moderation points which they can spend to mod a
post up or down, into greater or lesser visibility, depending on how
an individual reader's preferences are set. Readers can effectively
set their own level of tolerance, while a small, frequently-changing
subset of users marked as responsible set the standards. Digg uses a
similar but less complicated and less effective (more easily gamed)
system of moderation.

Anyway, that's my geeky two cents, as a former moderator of in an old
unix-based BBS discussion system. JP

Richard:

All this is very nice (way too nice), but it elides the difference between discussion, which is a dance of sorts, and argument. Here's a thought experiment: try to imagine the dance of a schoolboard divided between secularists and fundamentalists deciding whether to have creationism or evolution taught in its schools.

Not all argument is about the ego of the arguers. Often it's a matter of unbridgeable disagreement about passionately-held positions that do matter.

Maybe another way of thinking about this is sports, which also depends upon metaphors of combat. From the perspective of a god a baseball game is dynamic geometry arrived at through the cooperation of eighteen people, a beautiful, complex thing. On the field it's akin to warfare, with a winner and a loser.

Dancing and sports can each be pleasurable--we wouldn't engage in them otherwise--and the one doesn't need to supercede the other. Both become tiresome if all that's at stake is the ego of the participants. That's I think the kind of argument being objected to here.

Back to metaphor. Context is all. We routinely hope that "our" team slaughters the opposition. Nobody anywhere takes that literally (well, maybe the Maya did), football riots notwithstanding. So where's the problem? It seems to me that there's a kind of puritanism at work that says certain metaphors are to be eliminated, certain codes of language are simply beyond the pale. How little good that does is apparent in the CIA's constant invention of nonviolent metaphors for torture. Changing the language doesn't aleviate the victim's suffering.

Best,

Mark

Richard's post, as well as my finding a first edition Naked Poetry anthology
at the library book sale, made me think of a definition of what we mean by
"open poetry" "open poetics" and -- "open discussion".

                                                 & public intellectuals are a dying breed. Or, there is neither the space or a public interested in intellectual debate. Bohemia is dead/dead/dead.
The listserv is a rare and much needed exception... from "The Last Intellectuals/American Culture In The Age of Academe", by Russell Jacoby:

...it was not always difficult to name the "young" intellectuals. Once writers and critics regularly, often obsessively, monitered the new generation; they differed not so much over the names but over their merits. Today even the briefest list would include many blanks: leading younger critics? sociologists? historians? philosophers? Psycholgists? Who are they? Where are they?

Ah, FABULOUS!  As a fag I tend to NOT say this word very often for
obvious reasons!

But again, FABULOUS!  There are things I would LOVE to say right now,
but I know they would WITHOUT A DOUBT be censored, as many of my posts
to this List have been censored!

Murat I'm with you all the way!

Fear of language should NOT be in the recipe for poets, at least not

cris cheek
part: short life housing

This book collects seven texts written between 1981 and 1999, by UK-=20
born, US-based poet/multimedia artist cris cheek. cheek was one of =20
the key figures in the London poetry scene of the 1980s =E2=80=94 the =
so-=20
called =E2=80=9Clinguistically-innovative poetry=E2=80=9D grouping later =
=20
anthologized in Robert Sheppard and Adrian Clarke=E2=80=99s Floating =20
Capital: New Poets from London. Likewise, he became central to =20
developments in Performance Writing emerging out of variant =20
distributed networks during the following decade. He has remained a =20
prolific, genre-slipping figure: poet, performance artist and =20
musician, whose activities range from the ambitious conceptual =20
project Things Not Worth Keeping to recordings with the ensembles =20
Slant and Garam Masala. Yet to date his publications have been =20
relatively scarce and elusive, a situation which part: short life =20
housing goes far to rectify.

At the heart of this book are two long sequences, previously =20
unpublished aside from short extracts: =E2=80=9Ccanning town =
chronicles,=E2=80=9D =20
a scathing set of verbal accretions that emerged from the wreckage of =20=

the Thatcher era; and =E2=80=9Cf o g s,=E2=80=9D a series of typestracts =
quarried =20
from verbal improvisations recorded during outdoor walks in densely =20
foggy weather. Also included are several shorter pieces, including a =20
selection of early 1980s work and =E2=80=9Cplain speaking yet,=E2=80=9D =
cheek=E2=80=99s =20
memorial to the novelist Kathy Acker. The poems have, in keeping with =20=

the author=E2=80=99s concern for the specificity of occasion and =20
publication, been revised and visually reimagined with this volume in =20=

mind.

*

For all its thickness, unanticipated moves, visual beauty, and =20
playful language acrobatics, the poetry of part: short life housing =20
consistently retains the edge of serious critique. There are few =20
poets as attuned to the sounds and ambient fogs of everyday life as =20
cris cheek, yet his record is tuned and sharply turned toward the =20
reimagining of social knowledge. This volume is a generous move =20
towards the full representation of cheek=E2=80=99s crucial project.
=E2=80=94 Carla Harryman

Finally a good and rich span of writings from cris cheek. Here=E2=80=99s =
an =20
artist and writer whose work has always taken up active tenancy of =20
the languages and the streets of urban living, recording them and =20
composing them back into the dense abstract neighbourhoods of his =20
pieces. With this careful selection, cris cheek reminds us that he is =20=

a Londoner and as such is as inhabited by Dickens=E2=80=99 dark maze of =20=

industrial streets as by mind-altering years of activist art =20
lodgings, smoggy thoughtful wanderings or the eerie shock of the =20
thatcheritic city. That=E2=80=99s at least two hundred years of grime, =
greed =20
and energy you=E2=80=99ll find distilled in the cellular lines and ink =20=

splashes of this great volume.

Space. =20
After a century of developments in poetic form best understood as a =20
series of metaphors for transcribed speech, cheek=E2=80=99s poetry often =
=20
actually is transcribed speech, throwing shapes on the page that pay =20
homage to (and lay the ghosts of) all the dead metaphors. As in Alvin =20=

Lucier=E2=80=99s I Am Sitting in a Room, the speech in cheek=E2=80=99s =
work =20
functions as something like echolocation: its reflections (on him and =20=

Charles Freeland employs narrative sequence as a mode of aspiring to
innocence. Each of these deceptively direct prose pieces, "embracing that
infinity," is replete with power to endure what finally endows the consciou=
s
mind with revelations disguised as moments. Freeland=92s wry humor, charged
observations, sonorous lines ("Eulalie stands thigh deep in the river"),
remind us of our privilege "just to catch the echo of it, the way children
sometimes catch crayfish on the end of a sharpened stick." One final word
for Freeland: "Encore!" =97 *Sheila E. Murphy*


Freeland's collection takes us on a journey with unexpected directions and
deviations.  Full of satire and the understated, the poetry of *Through the
Funeral Mountains on a Burro* is masterful. =97 *William Allegrezza*

CALL FOR WORK
&Now: a Conference of Innovative Writing and the Literary Arts
New Proposal Deadline: June 15, 2009

The 4th Biennial &Now Conference of Innovative Writing & the Literary
Arts will be held in Buffalo, NY from October 15-17, 2009. The &Now
Festival explores intersections between creative and critical praxes,
examines innovative and experimental acts of writing, and advances a
serious inquiry into theories of language.

Keynote Speakers: Robert Coover, Nathaniel Mackey, Rikki Ducornet

PLEASE SUBMIT….
Critical papers and cross genre work of all kinds: criti-fictional
presentations, readings, performance pieces (digital, sound, and
otherwise), and digital and multimedia projects. Pieces that address
linguistic transgressions, the limits of genre, or works that promote
interdisciplinary explorations are particularly encouraged. Proposals
can be for individual readings, critical panels, creative panels, and/or
roundtable discussions.

Please send proposals by email in the following format:

*Title of Proposed Reading/Performance/Presentation
*Brief Description (no more than 500 words).
*Brief Bio (a few sentences) of all participants
*Tech needs (if any)

Submit all proposals to: andnow4@gmail.com

PROPOSAL DEADLINE: June 15, 2009.

Please note: Each session will be approximately 75 minutes. Individual
presentations/readings should therefore be limited to 15-20 minutes so
that grouped sessions that make thematic sense can be arranged.

i am going to create a new blog dedicated to animated poetry.  i'm
thinking mostly about animated .gifs, but it really could be any type
of animation.  (i'm a simple person.  i just like to see moving
words.)  if you have something to add, send it to me at
holymerda@moriapoetry.com.  the blog will be as unedited as i can let
it be, so i'll take just about anything.   i'm just going to chunk
what is sent onto the blog.**

**i know the e-mail address sounds like a spoof, but the blog will be
real.  i just like imaging a bunch of poets typing holymerda.

**if you are an academic lacky, don't take the "unedited" thing to
mean feel free to send me vita filler.

bill allegrezza

p.s. feel free to give me feedback on the idea.  hopefully it
generates more excitement than the poetry wiki i created
(http://innovativeaudiences.pbworks.com/).  that was lame.

Wunderkammer <http://wunderkammerpoetry.typepad.com/wunderkammer/> is
seeking innovative new work for its curious collection of art, poetry, and
prose.


*ABOUT THE NAME:* A wunderkammer, also known as a cabinet of curiosities or
a wonder room, is a collection of objects meant to represent the world in
miniature. Wunderkammern were popular during the Renaissance, when wealthy
men would amass encyclopedic collections that might include fossils,
paintings, sculptures, bones, feathers, religious relics, and other
oddities. The tradition of the wonder room is believed by some people to be
the precursor to the modern museum.

*SUBMISSIONS:* Email original writing or art to
wunderkammer.poetry@gmail.com and write "Submission" in the subject line of
the email.

*THEME WEEKS*: If you are submitting work that relates to a particular
theme, please indicate the theme in the subject line of your email. In
addition to non-themed submissions, Wunderkammer is now seeking creative
work that falls into these categories:

Collection (deadline--June 14, 2009)

Obama (deadline--June 28, 2009)

Ecopoetics (deadline--July 12, 2009)

*GUEST CURATORS:* If you have an idea for a theme week, please submit a
detailed proposal and write "Curator Proposal" in the subject line of your
email.

ok, so i still think the idea of a poetics wiki that has space for any
type of discussion is a good idea.  here is the one i created a few
years ago: http://innovativeaudiences.pbworks.com/.  it already has
some great discussion under the language traditions link from ernesto
priego.  i encourage you all, especially in light of the recent
discussions here, to jump on the site and add your views.  since i
want to see the discussion myself, i'll sweeten the offer.  i'll buy
anyone who posts a beer (or a martini, coffee, tea, water, etc).**

**deal only valid when the writer visits chicago at a convenient time
for me and visits the local bar/cafe/lake within walking distance from
my place.

Open means allowing the poem to find its own track. Duncan =

Catherine,=0A=0AOpen means allowing the poem to find its own track. Duncan =
and Levertov used this language in the early 60's in their correspondence a=
nd differentiated Organic from Free Verse and certainly from Conventional p=
oetry. You have to be open to let the poem find its way...open to the turns=
 a poem wants to make for itself. A free verse poem like Howl is not entire=
ly organic, because Allen had a sense of what he wanted to say about his fr=
iends and acquantences being fucked over by the Military-Industrial mentali=
ty and the industry-generated culture which maintains this force.=0A=0ARobi=
n Blaser, rest his soul, in the introduction to The Holy Forest suggests:"T=
he whole marvellous thing of open form is a traditional and an American pro=
blem...the sublime poem (tells) the narrative of the spirit...not simply to=
 be led to a conclusion, but be taken by such a magical carmen perpetuum to=
 all the image-nations of this remarkable, revivifying world.=0A=0AIn my me=
etings with him in 2005 & 6 (documented here: http://www.goldenhandcuffsrev=
iew.com/gh9content/16.html) he was fine with calling it Open, Projective an=
d Organic, as if the terms were interchangable. But I think Organic is more=
 evocative of the cosmology of process, relationship and interdependence al=
s Whitehead and the Hua Yen Buddhists. This is why I prefer it.=0A=0APaul=

the speech goes out into the arena
where sometimes it wields clubs

face to face with my own speech

ore from the earth. What it says
I strain to hear. The sewer inside my neck
spits like a dog's mouth but it wipes
off clean, easy, shining.

Also, I think Duncan and Olson thought the poem was not a "closed" =20
system, i.e. it was open to what is "not" the poem, so that a poem =20
didn't need to feel "finished" and set apart, so that one might think =20=

of the field as encompassing more than the single poem, even more =20
than the single poet, a field of relations in which any single poem =20
is partial. I think Blaser touches on this in the quote Paul brings =20

"open" poetry as well. "Organic" as I might understand it would apply =20=

various sorts of natural progressions in the poem, and I don't think =20

              Army try shutting down Opening , Closing Nights

*To Confront the Culture of Power with the Power of Culture--*
Edward Said,  quoted at Palfest09 after it became, thanks tothe Army and
Ploice
literaly and literally true--

I sent earlier this week a piece re Fear of Poetry, Poetry of Fear and
Poetry FOR Fear--and Fear FOR Poetry--
as "fear of poetry " was at the origin of the long discussion that is most
recently re what to do abt about lists/discussions--

I don't know if anyone else has been following it, but from 23 May  to 28
has been the 2nd "Palfest"--Palestinian Festival of Literature.

The festival is actually a touring one, beginning in Jerusalem and traveling
to several different towns and communities before returning to Jerusalem for
the Closing Night Events.

Jerusalem was chosen because this year it is the rotating Arab Capital of
Culture.  Every year the Capital is in a different City and country--

Opening Night was set upon by Police and IOF soldiers; the French consulate
volunteered their cultural spaces--so to  speak- for the night and the
Festival proceeded without a hitch.

The final night--last night--the same  thing occurred--the Army and some
police appeared, a paper was nailed to a door--and the planned Theater site
was made a Forbidden Zone.

This time the British Consulate stepped in and provided the site for the
Events.

I've been posting a steady stream of the videos the Palfest Photo stream,
and also  many International reports on the events. (Ha'arretz has a lot  f
l inks at its site--and very good coverage--most of the reports  i have
found so far are Israeli and from various Arabic networks.  (The only
language i checked in so far is English--now on to more--)
http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com
http://www.palfest.org/

The only mention so far found in the USA media  is a tiny note today from
USA today.

Also haven been posting readings , interviews, articles, reviews of several
contemporary Palestinian and Palestinian-American writers and performers and
as ever music videos also.Esp of one of my favorite bands, Checkpoint
303--one of the most interesting and original electronic/sampling, unplugged
acoustic, uses of recorded documentary sounds in streets and from literally
old documentaries. bands around in their uses of sounds, mixes, ,live
recordings and  techno and "natural" instruments--across three countries and
two continents--


Perhaps the "Fear of Poetry" is too evident in the attempted closing downs
to be considered an "interesting enough" form of fear these days?

On the other hand there is the Fear of reporting about these events  and
also,of discussing them,--in terms of the discussion here--to really
discuss, rather than censoring or attacking-- because this is "not really to
do with poetry."  does that mean that it really cant be discussed at al in
such a relation?

or is that simply "yet another reason to rid oneself and language of the
troubling obstacles to the purity of the language the tribe--"

 Or simply in the case of the "conflict," only one side is really
permissible to think of  and act on in the US.

This fear is the one impressed on one in a culture and society which has
developed a powerful denial of events in favor of words, and in this way
interiorized self censorship regarding many issues, among them quite
prominently the Israeli-Palestinian "conflict."

To be rid of conflict  means that there remain now " no opposing sides"--no
contradictory language
IT IS ONE
it  is won

Of course it is not a fear or closing down only on the account of Poetry,
but oon account and due to  al aspects of a culture and people, because any
acknowledgement of them is taken to be a criticism of the other side, when
it may not be anything other than a simple statement of fact.

Which is the most feared of all, these facts, because they do not agree with
the discourse which has been created for these situations.

In order to keep hidden the US and its Black President supporting an
Apartheid Regime, the word "Apartheid" as much as possible must be attacked
if mentioned, and the person--as Jimmy Carter found out--writing or saying
the word is attacked personally, morally, aesthetically, in every way
possible, so as to give an object lessons in what happens unless the
repellent word is expunged not only form language, but from thought itself.

This is basically the project that Orwell outlines in 1984 and its
appendices on the development of Newspeak.

The reduction of the lexicon that is permissible and remains in use though
every day shrinking a bit, by bit----this reduction of vocabulary creates
also a reduction in thinking, and especially thinking of any "critical"
kind.  Instead, one is trained to dutifully be unquestioning in the
acceptance of whatever one is told, even if yesterday one was expected to
believe the exact opposite.
This "forgetting" via unquestioning belief erases memory also, so another
critical faculty is expunged.

Over the last couple years--and in this discussion, pronounced by Amy, the
term "dumbing down" has become something that is being contended with in re
poetics and poetry.

Apparently the "dumbing down' is considered a natural casualty of adjustment
to quite different times etc, and different technologies, and, ironically,
"difficult poetries."

(Perhaps the "dumbing down" makes the "difficult poems" much more prevalent
and easier to not only create but also  constructing itself as a discourse
that does not even permit the thought that it is making itself ever more
less capable  of understanding the "difficult poem," which in itself is
being turned into ever more gibberish, as no one really notices--and al that
matter is that the "difficult poem" be preserved against the "attack of the
dumbed down readers."

Now why would an intellectual or a poet, as I read Charles Bernstein also
speaking of "dumbing down" being something that the was accused of-and
didn't seem to find so bad--, why wd a poet want to speak so casually of the
fact that one must accept the dumbing down,  as what one "gains from it," is
at least for the nonce, more important.

Perhaps for the simple reason of taking advantage a situation in order to be
advantaged by it and so --making it the only existing "alternative"--

That is, the "dumbing down" of others makes ever more "evident" the
difficulty of the poet's "difficult poems."  Both the dumbed down and the
poets themselves will see very clearly  that the difficulty of difficult
poems is a matter of a simple and natural occurrence,and fate, of some
persons being less dumbed down than other, making them the ones capable of
making and understanding the difficult poems so difficult that the vast run
of humans may wel not arise to the levels of thought required to
"understand" or "process" the difficult poem

The debates over the lack of "critical, satiric or negative reviews of books
of poetry," are in  a sense a barking up the wrong tree.

For if only those capable of reading difficult poetry  are reading writing
and reviewing it, how wds any one out side the circles of of difficult poets
ever even know  care or be interested if what they are reviewing is good bad
or ugly--

The problem is, that after a certain point, the dumbing dow and expunging
and erasing of vocabularies, meanings, references, allusions, creates the
impossibility of the mind to recover  or reverse engineer what it was was
dumbed down from.

Dumbing down, considered as a process of effects and aims on the "mental
state and well being of individuals," iis not unlike the "we had to destroy
the village to save it," deformation of thoughts and words that the Vietnam
War-and every War-produces.

The "fear of poetry" often discussed on this list as in a certain way at
times being seen as a "positive sign of its difficulty"--is taken to be a
fear of "poetic language" rather than perhaps motivated by class
differences, cultural differences, political imperatives or simply that the
elite practitioners need to feel that they are in possession of
something"too difficult" for the great unwashed to grasp.

Indeed, "difficult poetry" is felt to be its own sure sure guarantee of
one's elite status in comparison to those weak and hopeless dullards who are
the bards of al other poetries--

I wrote previously of many different reasons that a person might fear not
poetry, but simply being asked questions that are being "noted down" and
counted observed, polled and --what then--by these nosy and snooping
individuals from perhaps a secret undercover govt agency?--

This age of Security ,wire tapping, email decoding,library card watching and
checking, the time  of the monitoring of the destinations one not only flies
but drives to-walks to--the stores and public restrooms frequented--in an
age like this
what is really needed i is not Security on the part of the State, but of the
interiorization of the behaviours habits, thoughts  and words of the
Security States directives and recommendations of "dumbing down" and also of
the "attack of the difficult poems"--as a reminder to each particular group
of its positioning in the hierarchies of the society vis a vis one another.


The Thought Police, the Brain Police--especially now that the Obama
Administration is essaying to introduce into US Law the concept that one may
"detain indefinitely" a person who MAY IN THE FUTURE THINK OF COMMITTING A
CRIME--OR EVEN  COMMIT IT.

To arrest someone because they have the possibility someday of doing such
and such--is a truly disturbing form of instilling fear, because one will
have to be  ever more carefully monitored by ONESELF--trying to desperately
to control and prevent  one's inward thoughts and their outward
expressions."happening" or "behaving"in any way remotely suggestive of a
future criminality-

The self censuring citizen will need no censor from above or outside
itself,  as everything will be censored before leaving the consciousness of
the citizen involved.To continually fear not what has happened and being
caught, for it, or what is happening and being caught, but to not caught,not
charged, not accused, but simply "detained indefinitely"  for something one
has never done--simply so that one may in fact NEVER DO IT--

basically delivering one over to the authorities via breakdown and the
overwhelming sense of guilt----like Winston Smith's in 1984--guilt not for
something in the past as Freudian psychology and religions would have one be
wary of--but of something which one does not have any idea of  which others
think one is be capable of doing in the future--so capable that it is better
that one is detained indefinitely--

(Why not lock everyone u after being born and nursed long enough to make the
transfer to the life time cell--
in a sense this is what a good part of Earth's billions are bron into--not
to mention the imnese prison of Gaza--where one is  guilty for being
Palestinian--because of course one day you wil be a terrorist--if not
already being one at a few weeks old--

Is this not what "Homeland Security" is really about?

Securing language and minds so that
"seldom is heard a discouraging word
and the skies are not cloudy al day."

Home Homeland on the Range!--

The "fear of Poetry " then is actually cherished by an elite as it
designates them as above such toxic situations, and thinking themselves
immune, they do not notice that in fact they are among the traffic cops
directing the flow of persons thoughts words al into one direction, the one
that knows it is "Home Wa/ord Bound"--bound and gagged--

Instead of Fear of Poetry what one is manufacturing is the Poetry of Fear
and the Poetry For Fear.

A Poetics can be seen as an "attacking entity" like a virus, or parasite as
it seeks to attach itself to the body of the subject, and from there to work
the way INWO/ARDS--and to create as it travels a wake behind it in which
everything previously present "vanishes amid the white froth--"


a present absentee-
-
is now become what it needs to be to fullfll its destiny (as the Israeli
reporters are trained to write and speak of a Palestinian killed by the
IOF--"they met, or walked into,  their destiny"--which came about naturally
, and via Kismet, rather than by any human agency which might be forced to
take respsonsibality some day.


And because one is not supposed to acknowledge that this is happening, ,
these events, this closing of poetry festivals, Apartheid Walls, denial of
700 students in Gaza to attend the schools and universities including in the
us that they have fellowships and grants for--o
because of  the immense and immensely contradictory, surreal and horrifying
gaps between words and things, words and events, words and peoples,--one is
ever more  constrained to interiorize the imperatives of the society and
culture  to "remain silent," or
 to learn, like Winston Smith that Peace is War, 2 +2=5
that is--that loving Big brother one now understands that seeming Opposites
are equal, thus ruling out the possibility of the previous elements of the
equation ever having existed--

one learns the ineffable joys of denying that one knew ever existed an
alternative , or that one ever thought even thought and so, eventually one
cannot recall at all what it was that one forgot--
the complete expunging of those irksome questionings doubts, those impure
words ideas and actions which are the obstacles between one and Big
Brother--

and demonstrating this ineffable joy in the Truth by joining in the
attacking bray as loudly and long as one can ,along with the ever more
numerous and exactly like minded right thinking crowd,
 for the longer and more loudly the Big Lie is repeated, the more solid and
real and unquestionable is its Truith--



Take for example  Frank Geary-designed Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance
in Israel--
which tolerates not a single shred of a thread that would give any evidence
that  the Palestinians ever existed right there for centuries., and continue
to exist right outside the building.

The Museum of Tolerance however is a proof that, as Golda Meier said, "There
never was such aa thing as a Palestinian."

The attempts to close down the Palfest 2009 is perfectly consistent with
these attempts to make --"never existing"--be the state of anything
Palestinian..

In fact, the Palestinians living inside Israel--who are steadily having al
their rights taken away--
are called "present absentees."

This is a remarkable phrase--truly a poetic one--
In that a person who is a present absentee--is a reverse refugee, a reverse
engineered ghost from the future--

To be an absentee who is "present'__wel isn't that the way that soldiers and
prisoners are "hailed" as the man said.'
"present," "absent"--

already the prison routine has set in for these beings  present awaiting
their absentee status to be fulfilled.

of course al humans as transient beings on earth are "present absentees"
from the point of view of Death--

the efficacy of the phrase is to designate specific persons as already
dead--
and being present only by being absentees--
whose time has not yet quite come-
don't you see --
 like the Indians of the Americas-
are very much in the way--

and so their presence needs to be absented as they walk out one day and
"meet their destiny" which comes not due to the rocket that kills them and
14 others, but was simply the action of their personal private Kismet--

If one examines the current situations in the US and Israel, and everywhere
where the things which words --via difficult poetry--no longer refer to or
have any repsonability for--
is it not so that in order to believe in them unquestioningly , one must
treat language itself
not as a present absentee--
but as an  absent present--

a "not there" meaning a never was there--
which however the Govt  State sees as "not yet there" whose  "indefinite
detention" is an effort to ensure--Securely-- that the not yet there  never
wil be so that  the absent present functions even more smoothly than does
the present absentee--
and so even in the future--the past and p[resent never were there-are
there-and this means that it wilnever happen
there never wi be any change from this Steady State of Equilibrium of the
Law of Entropy--the Second law of Thermodynamics--again, donning an sense of
rationality and normality and happening as though completely "naturally"
--so that it never is a there--and no, there never was such a thing--nor wi
thever be--

and so like Klaus Kinski's completely Mad Conquistador Arch Fiend of the
Most Great Treaons-- Don Lope de Aguirre "The Wrath of God"-- in  Werner
Herzog's film, --the present has dropped away like al the dead aboard
Aguirre's disintegrating raft overrun b small monkeys
and in its place is that "difficult poetry " of making absent reality and
--creating not an ambiguity of appearance but instead a complete splitting
between the appearances and language, appearnces and things, persons--

a splitting in which it is "obvious" that one, in order to believe in the
Big Lie now TRUTH which one of Aguirre's men struggles with--a boat in a
tree indicating not there is ahaluciontation but instead that there is the
new meaning of t"that is not a shoip, that is not a tree, --"the seeing of a
doubled world now split asunder and collapsing into that empty space in
which al things rare a smooth opacity, a surface of appearances from which
never is heard
a discouraging word
and the skies are not cloudy all day--
a discouraging word
is seldom heard
and the skies are not cloudy al day--

the search for  that perfect El Dorado--
made possible by Mallarme's "purifying of the language of the tribe"
which may be taken to mean also by some wags as the
purifying of the tribe from language--

hurling any contradictory being thing object word name into that ayss in
which there never was such a thing as a Palestinian, in which 2+ 2=5
and in which the US Black President is a supporter of Apartheid.

In the forced denial of reality --the Museum of Tolerance and its non
present present absentees, who are treated as not even ever having been
present let alone absent--that is, they never existed, such things--

in there, the ridding oneself of the contradictions of language creates
poetry not difficult but one in which difficulty or ease are no longer
questions--

al that is left now is that self same appearing of oneself to oneself as
oneself purified in language and tribe into that ultimate trasncendence of
the fusion of oneself with Big Brother--

the final closing down of the being of being-and the birth of the
empty vessel of the new conceptualsm , which gives i the empty vessel tasks
to perform-- copying to be done-- data to be moved about--filed--
and so--

dreaming that absent present is this hallucinatory Virtuality of detached
things ,  detached  words sheltering in the Difficult Poem and Museums of
Tolerance--
where seldom is heard
a discouraging word
and the skies are not cloudy all day
