sounds like dread to me. that cold, unidentifiable dread that like low frequency noise seems to come at you from every direction and no direction at once. impossible to pinpoint, the best therapy is to push it away from your attentive consciousness so that it just fills the background. but it never goes away of course. it's still there, humming away just below the audible hearing range, a wicked tritone south of whatever other sounds are propagating in the air, paralleling them in a basso profundo counterpoint so simple minded and plodding that it seems almost inhuman and mechanical.

i like to write like that myself.

I wonder, if we reframe the word "enemies" as "dysfunctional friends," to borrow self help
 lingo, if we might see  these things as aspects of practice  and awareness, rather than potential ruin in the writing practice?

 Might I paraphrase Whitman loosely and add that laziness can be a virtue as it  forces us to acknowledge limitations of the self, and to come to terms with  blockage or boredom as transitional states.

Ground Plain

Smaller crystal radio (double-tap single coil) fed directly into the mike
input of my laptop, then filtered with CoolEdit. Nothing but ground hum
and static was picked up; these were modified into a semblance of ontol-
ogy. Clearly there are impedance mismatches at work and ground problems
resulting from the general radiation spewing of the laptop. The result as
usual is interesting soundwork, but the coiling itself, running the power
grid into and out of the earth, conjures an impossible mythos; this 60-
cycle would already be otherwise throughout most of Europe, half of Japan
for example.

It occurs to me that someone or some thing is speaking just around the
corner, or coroner, given the propensity of the dead to inhabit anything
but the clear evidence of the living. So there's plenty of room for a
poetics of ground-space grid-space, provided both of them are at least
somewhat subservient to the corporate powers that provide the thrumming in
the first place.

You know, the whole world is electrified, humming along on whatever funda-
mentals occur from region to region - and their respective additions, sub-
tractions, etc., pretty Lissajous figures all.

So we've joined the fish with their electric organs, not to mention the
effects of insect wings on very low frequency radio reception - such
effects perhaps on each other as well.

Still, given the ground and ground plane and hum's ubiquity, we're mostly
listening to ourselves listening to ourselves. The 'said' rides the
current like obscene outriggers, even though it's the riding we care for
as we face one another over any distance greater than a few meters. And
perhaps even less than that distance as well.

Subject:      Strange political theater and music in the San Francisco Fringe!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hello, all!

The Nonsense Company (of Madison, WI) will bring two works to the San Francisco Fringe Festival in just a handful of days; they(ok, we)'ve been taking these pieces around the country for the last year or so, and are excited about the opportunity to do them six times in the Bay Area. A theatrical music composition and a play, both by Rick Burkhardt, their blurbs say:


â€œGreat Hymn of Thanksgivingâ€ (for three speaking percussionists)
takes place at a dinner table, where the sounds of conversation have been replaced
with news clips from Iraq, scraps from the Army prayer manual, fragmented folk
tales, the poetry of Rae Armantrout, and a recurring state of emergency pointing
everywhere and leading nowhere.  The Company sounds like a newscast one
moment and a church congregation the next, using vocal techniques theyâ€™ve
honed for years to switch tones collectively in mid-syllable.  The noises of the
table itself â€” scooting chairs, singing wineglasses, squeaking forks â€” force this
â€œconversationâ€ into a confrontation with material reality.

In â€œConversation Storm,â€ three friends from three sides of the political spectrum
unpack current US torture policies as they unwillingly talk their way through a
hypothetical "ticking time bomb" scenario, dissecting, revising, and even
brutalizing their own positions in the process â€” but time has either stopped or
entered an ugly loop, and as the friends assign and reassign roles, the scenario
begins to dissolve the boundaries between real and hypothetical, past and future,
day and night.

â€œMoving, funny, and provocative....  theater at its best.â€
Austin 360

â€œStrange and compelling pieces... introspective, recursive, highly charged...
stunningly choreographed into visual theater as well as an aural melange.â€
Shockwave Radio
KFAI Minneapolis

http://princemyshkins.com/nonsensecompany.html

WARNING:  â€œGreat Hymn of Thanksgiving/Conversation Stormâ€ contains
extremely graphic adult language and is not appropriate for children.  Please,
no one under 13.

The performances take place at EXIT Stage Left, 156 Eddy St., San Francisco.
No late seating. The Fringe runs from 9/6 through 9/16. For performance times,
advance tickets, and such, go to

Hope you can make it!

all the best,

welcome & excellent point from whitman.
what gets me writing--reading poetry esp LangPo Creeley Stein listening to
free jazz sometimes classical & emotion--WHY is another question. something
to do w/ freeing myself from usual thoughts. rhythm, deep feeling w/
understanding desire to reach another & things too complex to articulate--
of course someof that is contradictory but never mind, so to speak.

Alan,

Panic and control are not necessarily contradictory. When you say control,
don't you mean more "being conscious of"? To the extent that you let certain
processes establishedby you at one point to take over, you are at one point
letting go while still remaining completely conscious of the process.

In a similar way "souljam" projects chaos, a centrifugal movement, while
simultaneously hinting at a unifying pull holding these fragments in check,
the Sufi ideas of "arc of descent" and "arc of ascent."

I never suggested your work was purely autobiographical and can be explained
away as such.

Ciao,

Murat

Tom Mazzolini, the SF Bay Area Blues impresario, - used his Saturday KPFA
radio show to say he had just learned that Bo Diddley had suffered a heart
attack (apparently this was preceded by a stroke last Spring). Then Tom
played Bo Diddley's "Who Do You Love?" (below) - a song he wrote in 1953.
Tho I probably heard this song a million times 'back in the day', I was
thunderstruck by the language, let alone the audacity of the voice. Critics
must have a name for this brand of surrealism, it's gothic, southern
graveyard mock Satan/devil rattling bravado. This guy is going to control
the whole street! Let alone happy or terrified "Arlene".  It's a wonderful
masterpiece.

May Bo Diddley make it quickly back into play. If not, he leaves more than a
few 'scorchers'.

I walk 47 miles of barbed wire,
I use a cobra-snake for a necktie,
I got a brand new house on the roadside,
Made from rattlesnake hide,
I got a brand new chimney made on top,
Made out of a human skull,
Now come on take a walk with me, arlene,
And tell me, who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Tombstone hand and a graveyard mine,
Just 22 and I dont mind dying.

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

I rode around the town, use a rattlesnake whip,
Take it easy arlene, dont give me no lip,

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Night was dark, but the sky was blue,
Down the alley, the ice-wagon flew,
Heard a bump, and somebody screamed,
You should have heard just what I seen.

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Arlene took me by my hand,
And she said ooowee bo, you know I understand.

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Hi Stephen,

I was listening to this song just yesterday. I'd always that it was
pretty audacious (good word), when I heard it way way back. Out of
another world.

I remember him doing a gig at Sydney Uni, so long ago. He wasn't 22
then but he was still in charge. I mean, they wheeled him on and off
stage but when he was there, he was there, doin the do with that
square guitar thing he played.

Hmm, Arlene's story, that would be interesting. Wonder if she was a
cuz to Nadine (why can't you be true).

Hey Bo Diddley

Best
Jill

Does anyone know any postmodernist poets in Russia that need exposure
or translation? I'm going to be hanging out in St. Petersburg for all
of September translating and gathering interesting art works and
thoughts. Would be glad to meet some new writers if anyone has any
ideas about who  might be interesting in this regard. I'm thinking
that it might be good to meet some academics as well. Any Mikhail
Epstein postmodernists out there?

Please take the time to read _King of Eatable Birds_, the latest entry from a
human
collaboration with the world's most handsome poetry-generating software.

from the preface:

"When writing about these beautiful poems, one should not consider them Anne
H.
Murdeus', or the machine's, but the collaboration between nearly two dozen
human
authors and math.  Gnoetry allows for a nearly objective poetry, built from
neutral
code and human syntactic tendencies."

While not approaching the kind of labyrinthine checkpoint obstacle
course of the translations of the Guantanamo Poetry book, the issues
of dealing with government "redactions" handled through lawyers in
creating both the text and the images of Di Palma's film are in a
similar vein.
It's interesting also that via these pressures the writer/director
notes how various documentary aspects had to be fictionalized.

Isn't that what the government continually does--take the documentary
and fictionalize it?

Faces of Iraqis at the film's end were blacked out--censored--by order
of the power that be.

Not unlike Guantanamo prisoners' letters to families which are so
blacked out all one may read is "Dear Mother:  and "love, X".

"Redaction" as "read action"--
"take some read action" on that writing!

All to maintain a "willing suspension of disbelief" on the part of
"critical" readers.

Another form of "read action":

Patrons of Independent booksellers are being asked to warn their
favorite book stores about possible customers who purchase multi
copies of the new book "The Israeli Lobby and American Foreign
Policy".

Apparently this is a tactic which has been employed with a number of
books critical of Israeli policies or of the Israeli lobby/ AIPAC in
the past.  The tactic is to make sure the books are off the shelves as
quickly as possible.

White the "number of sales" will look impressive, the "number of
readers" is actually the opposite.

It's an inverted version of the poetry book or library book say, in
which one copy of a book has many readers.

Hi Eireene! Why not ask the langpo poets who have been there and made so many contacts...like Lyn Hejinian, Watten, Silliman?and crew from that joint work LEGEND was it? Also, I would imagine translator John High would be a good one to ask for being au courant on this...I do not have any of these emails but I'm sure you could backchannel here...good luck! I'd love to see the final results!

Joel,

when you keep referring to "this city" you might tell us
what city it is. Or is that the point? I mean about being lost.

You don't mean Portland,. do you?

*of /Dolores Dorantes/, by Dolores Dorantes *

978-0-9767364-2-4 $14.95

Dolores Dorantes was born in Veracruz in 1973 and has lived most of her
life in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, where socioeconomic violence and
politically-charged daily brutalities have informed her radically humane
and beautifully incisive work as a poet, journalist, and cultural
worker. Dorantes is a rare phenomenon among Mexican literary
communities, in that she engages a wide-ranging international stance
toward poetry and poetics while refusing to accept state support from a
government she cannot respect. She has published four book-length works
of poetry, and is a founding member of the border arts collective
CompaÃ±Ã­a Frugal (The Frugal Company), which counts among its activities
publication of the monthly poetry broadside series /Hoja Frugal/,
printed in editions of 4000 and distributed free throughout Mexico.
Regarding that publication, Dorantes writes: â€œThe /Hoja Frugal/ is a
project that came into being on September 9, 2001 in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez,
Chihuahua (the so-called â€˜crime frontierâ€™). Our idea was to share the
readings and translations in which we as writers are engaged. But more
than anything, to share them with the community as a whole, not with the
â€˜intellectualâ€™ community. Our intention was to give the community a
breath of respite in the context of the growing phenomenon of violence
we experience daily in this border zone.â€ Engaging this
literary-political project from another perspective, */PUREsexSWIFTsex/
and /September/* are books 2 and 3 of Dorantesâ€™ lifelong project titled
/Dolores Dorantes/.

A copublication of Counterpath Press
<http://www.counterpathpress.org>and Kenning Editions.

And eventually...

*/Ambient Parking Lot/*, by Pamela Lu. PROSE. Part fiction, part earnest
mockumentary, /Ambient Parking Lot/ follows a band of musicians as they
wander the parking structures of urban downtown and greater suburbia in
quest of the ultimate ambient noiseâ€‘-one that promises to embody their
historical moment and deliver them up to the heights of their
self-important artistry. Along the way, they make sporadic forays into
lyric while contending with doubts, delusions, miscalculations,
mutinies, and minor triumphs. This saga peers into the wreckage of a
post-9/11 landscape and embraces the comedy and poignancy of failed
utopia. Pamela Lu is the author of /Pamela: A Novel/. Her work appears
in the anthology /Biting the Error/ and in periodicals such as
/Harperâ€™s/, /Chicago Review/, /call: a review/, /1913/, and /Fascicle/.

Yes, Jill, I suspect Arlene, and Nadine are fallen out cousins of Ondine -
the latter - in terms of Bo - probably not wanting to get that far 'down'.

An excellent person, especially re the post modern, the conceptualists
and many others is Kent Johnson, co-editor of the anthology Third Wave
which is the first anthology in English to have such important figures
as the recently late Dmitiri Prigov. among a great many others.

Mikhail Epstein whom you make note of--wrote an excellent piece as one
of his two appendices to the Doubled Flowering Excerpts from the
Notebooks of Araki Yasusada (who actually may/may not  be Kent
Johnson) in which he posits as hypotheses of the "real author" of
these works either Prigov or Bitov, another of the poets in Third
Wave,

Another person, the most knowledgeable re the history and figures of
Russian avant-garde writing from the beginnings of Russian Futurism
and Zaum to the present is Professor Gerald Janecek, also a great and
in most cases the only translator of a massive amount of Russian
avant-garde poetry and manifestos of the last hundred years
(Janecek for example has witten/translated the incredible book Zaum
The Transrational Poetry of Russian Futurism and in a later work of
his, a collection of essays, has many studies of contemporary Russian
avant-grades as yet very little known outside Russia. Hi book The Look
of Russian Literature remains the best study of Russian visual/sound
poetry of the period 1907-1920 roughly.  At the time of Third Wave
(1992) most of the writers of the avant-garde in there were also
hardly known of at all in the English speaking world.It's a classic
groundbreaking work still.)

(back channel for address)
Janecek knows more than anyone re the kinds of writing up are interest
in and also probably people to meet, and Johnson knows a great deal
also about the poets and where many may be found as well.

No, i didn't. I am temporarily unsubscribed. I could give some names
though. Besides the usual set of names, i personally like Sergei
Stratanovskii (he used to be a librarian in the Public Library, Publichka,
the main one), Larissa Berezovchuk, Aleksandr Gornon, Vladimir
Kucheriavkin, all of them widely known in narrow circles (as the Russian
saying goes). Stratanovski could help contact the others. She can contact
me for more information. Hope this helps. masha

Alan I'm fascinated by the want of writing, something you touch on here.
Depending on the want of writing Craving may become Carving, cutting into
oneself, or one other.

Some of the most wicked people I've ever met are poets.  There's so much
envy and jealousy and it gets so thick in some of their blood it cripples.
And there's a stench too from it.

Maybe I can't tear my eyes away from these car wrecks because they are
incredible, invaluable lessons for my own life.

If there's a cure for any of it it's the nod deep into the concentration of
writing.

Not to disappear, not be the fantasy, but to get it all clearer, the bright
brighter.

There's a spiritual solution to poetry's problems of want and it's the
poetry itself.  And to me that's funny because not everything on the planet
works this way of course.  If the solution to the want of cocaine was taking
the deepest hit imaginable, imagine that.  It's as if poetry has the most
manipulated back no saddle fits, yet any saddle fits if you use the saddle
as a ladder beside it.  If poetry rides you one day what's that about?  I'm
praying for spurs coming down into my thighs.

Slippery works best, grease all the pens,

Blogs--

I recently told my friend, Dan....writing a blog is like writing a letter
and putting it in an envelope that hasn't been addressed... you have to
wonder who's going to read It..,

but being a writer like you folks, I've decided to persist for a while.

Well after casting about for a bit,  I've decided to generally focus my
blog on what I'm reading...If you're interested I'm posting on

www.myspace.com/charlierossiter

recent blogs are about John Fante (bukowski's literary hero), Zora Neale
Hurston, and poets i'd like to sit down and have a conversation with--both
living and dead.

If you eschew Myspace, the same postings are at

www.charlierossiter.blogspot.com

I'd be glad to get any response, encouragement or arguments.  The
assumption is that we're all in it to learn.

All,

Will be traveling to Prague in December and wonder if anyone might be able to provide me with information related to its current community of poets and artists - ie, feedback and places, contacts. Was last there about five years ago when things had begun to quiet and become a bit more orderly, will say, the rush of new ideas preceding this period slowing quite a bit, the old Globe Bookshop moving, some very talented people departing and new interests taking over.

Your time will be much appreciated.

Regards,
Alexander Jorgensen

Hello,

I have subscribed to this list for some time but
haven't posted about my tiny publications before.
Under the imprint of "Teeny Tiny," I make mini zines
and chapbooks and distribute them for free or trade (I
especially like to trade for other small books/zines).
 Please see my website -- http://www.teenytiny.org --
for more info.

I thought some of you would be interested in my latest
tiny book, which is the first "Teeny Tiny Time
Machine" chap.  Edited and with notes by Jesse Glass,
"The Tremendous Adventures and the Mighty Deeds, Rise,
Downfall, Life and Death of A. Jacks" is a tiny story
written (we think) by Henry Faxon in 1853.  This mini
book is made from a single-sided photocopy folded to
make 8 tiny pages and has cardstock covers which
feature an original print.

This mini book is available in a limited, numbered
edition of 50 copies.  If you would like a (free!)
copy, please email me.  If you would like to send me
something as a trade, I would love that, but if you
don't have a trade, that's OK, too.  Just let me know
(backchannel, of course) if you're interested.

All best,
Amanda Laughtland

CALL FOR PAPERS
for "Contemporary Poet's Theater:  L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E and Beyond":
A panel on critical approaches to poet's theater
to be proposed to the 20th Century Literature Conference in Louisville

Please respond with an essay abstract and bio by SEPT. 12.   A print project
may be in in the future on the poet's theater topic, so we are happy to
learn of your interest.

Description of panel proposal with submission instructions:
      In recent contemporary poetics, the term "poet's theater" has become
linked with the "Language" group of writers and often directors of
poetry-plays produced as low-budget staged performances in the late 1970's
and '80's.  Today,  new  productions of classic "Language"-oriented poet's
theater abound, by writers  including Leslie Scalapino, Carla Harryman,
Charles Bernstein, among  others.  Yet there are also many contemporary
playwrights in other settings  doing work that is not only aesthetically
related to  "Language"-oriented theater, but which might be productively
critiqued in terms articulated by Language writers and others writing on
avant-garde performance art.  These "other" are theater writers are those
who are engaging in "poet's theater," by virtue of treating a written text
as an act of performance -- the drama  thus emerging not from some external
"signified," but from within the "signifier," the poetic language, itself.
         This panel is an attempt to ground a definition of the term
"poet's  theater" in a potentially expanding notion of the contemporary
working scene of today's American  theater, both through under-financed
small public venues (cafes or coffee houses or art-spaces) or in venues
like Off-Broadway.  It is also an attempt to take the recent use of the term
by the Language writers into other realms of "language"-oriented theatrical
poetics.  We wish for presenters to look at what the embodied stage and
poetic experiment have to offer one another, in practice and/or in
conceptual theories.  We are proposing this panel to the Louisville
conference directors (conference to take place in February '08), with the
hopes that we can bring new perspectives into a discussion of an often
under-considered form of contemporary poetics: that which is written to be
staged.  We are looking for papers that consider specific poet's-theater
works and their authors, approached from some knowledge of contemporary
poetics theory or performance theory (or both).
         Since our topic concerns CONTEMPORARY poet's theater, please submit
paper proposals only on poets of the theater who have emerged during or
since the early stages of "Language" writing (including John Ashbery,
Bernstein,  Ntozake Shange, Harryman, Scalapino, Amiri Baraka, Cherie
Moraga, Tracie Morris; as well as "non-poet" playwrights like Adrienne
Kennedy, Anna Deavere Smith, or Suzan-Lori Parks -- the latter of whose
works are based in a non-linear use of lyrical language). Historical
influences, however, are also of interest.
         Send a 250-300-word abstract and title describing your paper topic
no later than SEPTEMBER 12, by e-mail, to Laura Hinton (
laurahinton12@gmail.com).  Accompany this abstract with the following
cover-sheet information needed per conference requirements:    * 1)Name  2)
Address (preferably home)  3) Telephone number
4) Academic or other affiliation (if applicable)   5) Personal biographical
note (100-150 words)

Recently, I started a "sidewalk blog."  I paint signs on pieces of wood,
drill holes in them, and hang them on
chain link fences with pieces of wire.  Have a look.  If you click on
the photos, they get bigger and a brief
narrative appears:

unschooling and homeschooling really annoy me and i find the premises on
which the movements are based (that public schools are filled with
incompetents and that group education is inherently bad) insulting to
the many wonderful public school teachers I know and love, including the
ones who educated me.

the foundational myths on which the "movements" are based are luxuries,
moreover, of a class that doesn't require both parents to be
breadwinners, and as such  are a way of shirking the social
responsibility to provide for the education of all children, rather than
simply  abandoning the concept of public education and providing for
ones own.

I'm not saying that someone won't learn in an unschooling environment,
i'm saying that i reject the idea that public schools are mental poison
and i defy anyone to show me any advantages of unschooling that aren't
possible in public schooling when one remains active and involved in a
childs education.

people abandon public schools, and have done so for several generations
now, and they wonder why people voted for george bush or can't find the
united states on a map. rejecting public education means accepting the
idea of living in an ignorant society. i don't accept that and don't
think any one else should either.

Bay Area poets, painters, video and filmmakers, cartoonists,
theorists, novelists, sculptors, and curators and is an evening not to
be missed!  Additionally, you will be helping support and sustain
Small Press Traffic, the West Coast's oldest and most important
independent literary arts non-profit, as we push to make it through
another year in an increasingly anti-arts-funding climate. Any support
you can offer helps!

Thanks for saying this re: some of the stench, jealousy, stupid ambition. It exists everywhere, of course, but is uglier when it exists within poetry because of the danger of language itself to deceive and isolate.?The thing about it for me is that admitting to such would make it all clean. The truth is purifying. What I object to is the creation of a false self-image whether that be imbedded in text or part of personality pretensions--this falseness is what makes us flee culture to begin with--to end up within the same culture of false veneer is what has made me stop over and over--but then there is a limitation of ways to express so writing becomes inevitable.?I do believe there is beauty in honesty for its own sake. I re-wrote your words to prove it to myself once again?that there is no shame in anything/ only in wasting our precious time on earth lying to and opposed to one another:
so to paraphrase and take possession of:
"I am one of the wicked people for I am a poet and there's so much
envy and jealousy in me,?it gets so thick it cripples, my blood, there's a stench to it."?

Alan I'm fascinated by the want of writing, something you touch on here.
Depending on the want of writing Craving may become Carving, cutting into
oneself, or one other.

Some of the most wicked people I've ever met are poets.  There's so much
envy and jealousy and it gets so thick in some of their blood it cripples.
And there's a stench too from it.

Maybe I can't tear my eyes away from these car wrecks because they are
incredible, invaluable lessons for my own life.

If there's a cure for any of it it's the nod deep into the concentration of
writing.

Not to disappear, not be the fantasy, but to get it all clearer, the bright
brighter.

There's a spiritual solution to poetry's problems of want and it's the
poetry itself.  And to me that's funny because not everything on the planet
works this way of course.  If the solution to the want of cocaine was taking
the deepest hit imaginable, imagine that.  It's as if poetry has the most
manipulated back no saddle fits, yet any saddle fits if you use the saddle
as a ladder beside it.  If poetry rides you one day what's that about?  I'm
praying for spurs coming down into my thighs.

Slippery works best, grease all the pens,

hi jason.  i put both my kids through public school.  if i hadn't been
there (and most parents don't have the luxury of doing that either--most
have to work at the time they're kids are in school), it would have been
worse than it was.  i'm a teacher too.  there are wonderful teachers.
there are also incredibly damaging terrible teachers, monstrous
administrations, etc.  the wonderful teachers i've known have often had to
battle hardline administrations in order to be so wonderful.  it was too
often that the teachers my kids had put the kids down harshly, were more
interested in discipline than learning, expected the kids to become
obedient robots, had no imagination.  even in the alternative charter
schools i've been in, taht was too often the case: no lying on the floor,
no freewriting, blablabla.  in my view--and i see what the students who
come to the university are like--often squished and afraid to express
themselves, except for a couple of exceptions.

if unschooling or home schooling is done in a group setting--lots of
families grouping together--it doesn't ahve to be a privileged thing.  can
share.  gabe

Jason, it's not impossible to work to improve public schools while, at the
same time homeschooling one's own children.  And while you are quite right
in identifying the class element to this, I know that if I ever had children
of my own I would do my best to keep them out of the public schools until
such time as dramatic changed had been effected.

I, too, had some remarkable teachers.  I also had horrible ones who didn't
know their subject or who "solved" the problem of a student being harassed
for a being a lesbian by calling a class metting in which she allowed the
harassers to share their "opinions" of lesbians and then asked the lone
harassed girl why she didn't say anything.

There is a problem when people start to say that public education is
inherently bad.  On that, you and I agree.  However, the way it is right
now, I can understand why people would think so.

I hope you can come to see my new play, which I wrote with the video
artist Karla Milosevich.



WEe are putting it on as a benefit for Small Press Traffic Literary
Arts Center and it will be staged one night only, Friday the 7th, at
7:30 p.m. at CCA, California College of the Arts (Timken Hall
auditorium), 1111 Eighth Street.

Basically it's all about apodyopsis.  Do we only know about
apodyopsis in California?  Then read on!

KEVIN KILLIAN AND KARLA MILOSEVICH
CELEBRITY HOSPITAL

Apodyopsis--the act or condition of sexual excitement caused by
exposure to medical procedures.  To protect the privacy of his
clientele at Celebrity Hospital in LA, top surgeon Dr. Tim Baldwin
admits only famous people.  Even the doctors and nurses are (or were)
celebrities of a sort.  It's another typical day at Celebrity
Hospital, as everyone from Courtney Love to Kurt Russell and Diana
Ross is having work done, and ingenue Scarlett Johansson, avoiding
stalker Woody Allen, spends a day in the ward observing and nursing
in preparation for her new role in the new Oliver Stone film about
nurse politics.  Then Dr. Baldwin and his staff are confronted by two
grave ills, the eco-terrorists known as the Cult of the Black
Feather, who demand universal facelifts for the poor and oppressed,
and by a strange apparitions haunting the hallways and linen closets
of Celebrity Hospital, that looks like a werewolf and seems to be
after Hollywood's greatest and most ageless stars, most of whom
suffer from apodyopsis, they never really experience sexual feeling
unless they're having unnecessary medical procedures.  Celebrity
Hospital features a cast of Bay Area poets, painters, video and
filmmakers, cartoonists, theorists, novelists sculptors and curators
including Dodie Bellamy, Matthew Hughes Boyko, David Brazil, Norma
Cole, Gerald Corbin, Kate Fowle, Craig Goodman, Cliff Hengst, Scott
Hewicker, Colter Jacobsen, Kevin Killian, Mac McGinnes, Anne McGuire,
Karla Milosevich, Tanya Milosevich, Chuck Mobley, Rex Ray, Laurie
Reid, Lisa Robertson, Jocelyn Saidenberg, Leslie Shows, Wayne Smith,
and Ryan Thayer.  And from Madison, Wisconsin, a special appearance
by the Primce Myshkins (Rick Burkhardt and Andy Gricevich).  In one
way or another the San Francisco Poet's Theater has been around for
decades.  Killian and Milosevich have collaborated on two previous
plays, Love Can Build a Bridge (2003) and The Red and the Green
(2005).

If any of you can find You Tube then you can view a pair of coming
attractions for our play:

BITTERNESS
                        by  NIELS HAV

Bitterness is the most durable result
of much human activity –
and you can’t use it for anything,
so everyone denies it exists.
Most store it in the back room,
it is poisonous with a nasty colour.

During busy times it plays dead
lying desiccated in its little box
but as soon as there’s an unguarded moment
it demands attention.  It lives off
injuries and thrives perfectly well in winter;
Christmas is a festival for it.

When bitterness is fully grown
it demands to be aired.  Some
take it along to the pub on the weekend,
that works.  Monday they show up at work
and begin again.  Bitterness longs
for 5 p.m.; it speaks loudly to itself
in traffic and may hawk a gob.

Certain species prefer to live in exile.
There bitterness can run free.
It refuses to learn the language
and lives on a diet of fermented insults.
If it is rich, France is perfect.
Well cared for, bitterness can
grow to a good size.

Most important is to avoid mirrors
and emotional affiliations.

There is always the great Arkadii Dragomoshenko.  I believe he is undertranslated.  A prose book of his was recently published by Ugly Duckling Presse.  I have never seen a book of his poetry translated, however.  He gave great readings here ten years ago.  You might contact UDP about newer writers.  I don't have their address on me.  But of course there is always the omniscient Google for that, I assume.  Regards, Tom Savage

THE RADICAL POET GROWS INCREASINGLY FAMOUS AT SUNSET

I shook his hand as a sacrifice to my fingers

=C2=A0

No one stood in the hall with its chipped gray paint

Admitting we posed as historians of the plantation

No one admitted the cotton

=C2=A0

It was crucial to find the knee the ankle

The sweat of the body

It was his hand I took

=C2=A0

For the text is but a fault line for desire

A turning away

=C2=A0

How the head is shaped distant from the nose

His profile an insurrection an incursion

=C2=A0

And no I did not believe his modesty

Hi.  I'm not a language poet or a post-language poet.  Nevertheless, I've had three plays done by the Medicine Show Theater in NYC, one of which was previously performed at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's.  I am interested in your topic but am not sure you're interested in me.  By the way, the performance of my play was applauded by Charles Bernstein in Silliman's blog.  Regards, Tom Savage

laura hinton <laurahinton12@GMAIL.COM> wrote:  CALL FOR PAPERS
for "Contemporary Poet's Theater: L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E and Beyond":
A panel on critical approaches to poet's theater
to be proposed to the 20th Century Literature Conference in Louisville

Please respond with an essay abstract and bio by SEPT. 12. A print project
may be in in the future on the poet's theater topic, so we are happy to
learn of your interest.

Description of panel proposal with submission instructions:
In recent contemporary poetics, the term "poet's theater" has become
linked with the "Language" group of writers and often directors of
poetry-plays produced as low-budget staged performances in the late 1970's
and '80's. Today, new productions of classic "Language"-oriented poet's
theater abound, by writers including Leslie Scalapino, Carla Harryman,
Charles Bernstein, among others. Yet there are also many contemporary
playwrights in other settings doing work that is not only aesthetically
related to "Language"-oriented theater, but which might be productively
critiqued in terms articulated by Language writers and others writing on
avant-garde performance art. These "other" are theater writers are those
who are engaging in "poet's theater," by virtue of treating a written text
as an act of performance -- the drama thus emerging not from some external
"signified," but from within the "signifier," the poetic language, itself.
This panel is an attempt to ground a definition of the term
"poet's theater" in a potentially expanding notion of the contemporary
working scene of today's American theater, both through under-financed
small public venues (cafes or coffee houses or art-spaces) or in venues
like Off-Broadway. It is also an attempt to take the recent use of the term
by the Language writers into other realms of "language"-oriented theatrical
poetics. We wish for presenters to look at what the embodied stage and
poetic experiment have to offer one another, in practice and/or in
conceptual theories. We are proposing this panel to the Louisville
conference directors (conference to take place in February '08), with the
hopes that we can bring new perspectives into a discussion of an often
under-considered form of contemporary poetics: that which is written to be
staged. We are looking for papers that consider specific poet's-theater
works and their authors, approached from some knowledge of contemporary
poetics theory or performance theory (or both).
Since our topic concerns CONTEMPORARY poet's theater, please submit
paper proposals only on poets of the theater who have emerged during or
since the early stages of "Language" writing (including John Ashbery,
Bernstein, Ntozake Shange, Harryman, Scalapino, Amiri Baraka, Cherie
Moraga, Tracie Morris; as well as "non-poet" playwrights like Adrienne
Kennedy, Anna Deavere Smith, or Suzan-Lori Parks -- the latter of whose
works are based in a non-linear use of lyrical language). Historical
influences, however, are also of interest.
Send a 250-300-word abstract and title describing your paper topic
no later than SEPTEMBER 12, by e-mail, to Laura Hinton (
laurahinton12@gmail.com). Accompany this abstract with the following
cover-sheet information needed per conference requirements: * 1)Name 2)
Address (preferably home) 3) Telephone number
4) Academic or other affiliation (if applicable) 5) Personal biographical
note (100-150 words)

One Dragmoshenko poetry book that was translated was Blue Vitriol. I remember reviewing it (favorably) about eight years ago. I forget who did the translations, but fairly sure it was Lyn Hejinian collaborating with a native speaker. Think it was a West Coast press that brought it out, but not sure which one. Could easily be Googled.

There is always the great Arkadii Dragomoshenko.  I believe he is
undertranslated.  A prose book of his was recently published by Ugly Duckling
Presse.  I have never seen a book of his poetry translated, however.  He gave
great readings here ten years ago.  You might contact UDP about newer writers.
I don't have their address on me.  But of course there is always the omniscient

MacArthur Foundation Announces New Digital Media and Learning Competition

Deadline: October 15, 2007

The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
(http://www.macfound.org/) has announced a public competition that will
award a total of $2 million in funding to emerging leaders,
communicators, and innovators shaping the field of digital media and
learning. The competition is part of the foundation's $50 million
Digital Media and Learning initiative
(http://www.digitallearning.macfound.org/), which aims to help determine
how digital technologies are changing the way young people learn, play,
socialize, and participate in civic life.

Awards will be given in two categories: 1) Innovation Awards of $250,000
or $100,000 each will support learning entrepreneurs and builders of new
digital environments for informal learning; and 2) Knowledge Networking
Awards of up to $75,000 will support communicators in connecting,
mobilizing, circulating, or translating new ideas around digital media
and learning.

As part of their prize, awardees will receive special consultation
support on everything from technology development to management
training. Winners will be invited to showcase their work at a conference
that will include venture capitalists, entrepreneurs,  educators, and
policy makers seeking the best ideas about digital learning.

The open competition will be administered by HASTAC, the Humanities,
Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory,
(http://www.hastac.org/), a consortium of humanists, artists,
scientists, social scientists, and engineers committed to new forms of
collaboration for thinking, teaching, and research across communities
and disciplines fostered by creative uses of technology.

Detailed information on the competition is available online at the
program's Web site.

Philip Metres has done acclaimed translations of the works of  Lev
Rubinstein, (book from Ugly Duckling--and more--)  as well as of
Dmitry Prigov and Sergey Gandlevsky, with whom he has also toured.

Philip also is one of the rare poets/literary historian-critics who is
also interested very much in the interrelationships of Poetry and War
and Peace.
His blogspot, taken after the name of an excellent book of his is on
American poetry of war and resistance since 1941-, is:

http://behindthelinespoetry.blogspot.com

(in the current issue of Big Bridge he has an excellent essay on this
subject, a great & inspiring education to read, and a gold mine of
source and reference materials.)

Highly recommended!!

I'm certainly not arguing that the public schools are perfect by any means. And since public schools have a large degree of autonomy, there is a great deal of variance in their quality from school district to school district. Certainly "No child left behind" has done severe damage to the integrity of public schooling in most states in the US. At the same time, though, the reason why the right was able to push through that agenda is because they've been so successful in creating the myth that there's something terribly broken in our public schools. That's not really the case. What's broken is the administration and financing of public schools, which is infected by the trojan horse of an ideological right wing that hates the idea of a free education for everyone being monopolized by the public sector. It's an ideology that has everything to do with a short sighted economic theory and nothing to do with what's the best for education.

At the same time, you're right there are bad teachers and there are lousy administrations. Where I disagree with you is that i think there is a certain amount of value in learning how to deal with that. One of the things that i learned in public schools was how to deal with bureaucracys and how to work a system. I learned that because my parents were involved in my public education and i had a number of hands on lessons. Those skills have served me a lot better as an adult than what I learned in earth science or us history ever did. Which is not to say that they're good things, but they do have value, and one of the biggest advantages that kids in public schools have is that they're in an environment with built in diversity. If a kid gets a bad teacher, then at the very worst they're only going to ahve to deal with that particular bad teacher for a year. by middle school, they're only going
to have to deal with that teacher for part of the day. and at the same time, getting multiple good teachers is as likely as multiple bad teachers, and I honestly believe that one good teacher can undo all the damage done by 100 bad ones.

The problem with working to improve public schools by homeschooling though is that whatever work you do is offset by the fact that you've weakened the overall public school system by taking the energy you put into schooling your child out of the system thereby depriving the kids whose parents don't have the homeschool option of your enthusiasm for a good education. If a parent has the time and the energy to homeschool a child, why not put that energy and time into involvement with your child's local school? It's not like public schools put up a wall outside the school building to prevent parent involvement. And in the meantime you'll be teaching your child a valuable lesson about social responsibility and cooperation by your example, and you'll be more aware if there are any "bad teachers" hampering your child's development and you'll be in a better position to both offset any negative results
there and at the same time keep your eye out for "good teachers" to get your kids with at the next school year. Parental involvement like that is one big reason that schools are better in the suburbs than they are in the inner cities, and it means that everybody, not just the children of financially well off people who have the bandwidth for homeschooling, benefits from those parents who have the resources to be more involved in the education of a communities children. That, to me, is the ideal of both fulfilling the parental and social responsibilities present in child rearing and i'm disappointed in people who choose not to when they have the capability to do it.

I crossed wires and attributed Parshchikov's  Blue Vitriol to
Dragomoschenko...my bad...it's great to be senile..okay, senescent....it's a  long train
ride....

makes me think of that great sonnet by ms. Mayer...

"It would be nice to lose one's mind my mind
I'd like to lose it I wouldn't mind at all
To be in the lunatic asylum at last
All for you and for the taxi drivers

I'll go there and be asked what year what day it is
& who's the president, how come he's a resident
I could teach prosody there but nobody
Knows what it is
So send me away to anybody
Anywhere who might
Not know something I might not
Since I must vice versa live

Whaddya mean perforce?
Army or navy or marines?"


love that one!

Dedication

You whom I could not save
Listen to me.
Try to understand this simple speech as I would be ashamed of another.
I swear, there is in me no wizardry of words.
I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree.

What strengthened me, for you was lethal.
You mixed up farewell to an epoch with the beginning of a new one,
Inspiration of hatred with lyrical beauty,
Blind force with accomplished shape.

Here is the valley of shallow Polish rivers. And an immense bridge
Going into white fog. Here is a broken city,
And the wind throws the screams of gulls on your grave
When I am talking with you.

What is poetry which does not save
Nations or people?
A connivance with official lies,
A song of drunkards whose throats will be cut in a moment,
Readings for sophomore girls.
That I wanted good poetry without knowing it,
That I discovered, late, its salutary aim,
In this and only this I find salvation.

They used to pour millet on graves or poppy seeds
To feed the dead who would come disguised as birds.
I put this book here for you, who once lived
So that you should visit us no more.

--Czeslaw Milosz, Warsaw, 1945

many students try to enter High School after being home-schooled through Mi=

 in each of my five classes per day, my seven hour day becomes a 13.75 hour=
 day (If I spent a more generous five minutes per student then it becomes a=
 21 hour day).  This, combined with a general lack of respect for the profe=

There is a movement of public charter schools throughout country. Provides inclusion and special services for children with disabilities. Regular communication with teachers. Some amazing experiments and dedicated teachers who are very much aware of all issues raised.

I'm certainly not arguing that the public schools are perfect by any means. And since public schools have a large degree of autonomy, there is a great deal of variance in their quality from school district to school district. Certainly "No child left behind" has done severe damage to the integrity of public schooling in most states in the US. At the same time, though, the reason why the right was able to push through that agenda is because they've been so successful in creating the myth that there's something terribly broken in our public schools. That's not really the case. What's broken is the administration and financing of public schools, which is infected by the trojan horse of an ideological right wing that hates the idea of a free education for everyone being monopolized by the public sector. It's an ideology that has everything to do with a short sighted economic theory and nothing to do with what's the best for education.?
?
At the same time, you're right there are bad teachers and there are lousy administrations. Where I disagree with you is that i think there is a certain amount of value in learning how to deal with that. One of the things that i learned in public schools was how to deal with bureaucracys and how to work a system. I learned that because my parents were involved in my public education and i had a number of hands on lessons. Those skills have served me a lot better as an adult than what I learned in earth science or us history ever did. Which is not to say that they're good things, but they do have value, and one of the biggest advantages that kids in public schools have is that they're in an environment with built in diversity. If a kid gets a bad teacher, then at the very worst they're only going to ahve to deal with that particular bad teacher for a year. by middle school, they're only going to have to deal with that teacher for part of the day. and at the same time, getting m
ultiple good teachers is as likely as multiple bad teachers, and I honestly believe that one good teacher can undo all the damage done by 100 bad ones.?
?
The problem with working to improve public schools by homeschooling though is that whatever work you do is offset by the fact that you've weakened the overall public school system by taking the energy you put into schooling your child out of the system thereby depriving the kids whose parents don't have the homeschool option of your enthusiasm for a good education. If a parent has the time and the energy to homeschool a child, why not put that energy and time into involvement with your child's local school? It's not like public schools put up a wall outside the school building to prevent parent involvement. And in the meantime you'll be teaching your child a valuable lesson about social responsibility and cooperation by your example, and you'll be more aware if there are any "bad teachers" hampering your child's development and you'll be in a better position to both offset any negative results there and at the same time keep your eye out for "good teachers" to get your kids w
ith at the next school year. Parental involvement like that is one big reason that schools are better in the suburbs than they are in the inner cities, and it means that everybody, not just the children of financially well off people who have the bandwidth for homeschooling, benefits from those parents who have the resources to be more involved in the education of a communities children. That, to me, is the ideal of both fulfilling the parental and social responsibilities present in child rearing and i'm disappointed in people who choose not to when they have the capability to do it.?

nowhere to land perfectly, precisely, every time. Like
any excellent portraitist, she exposes her subjects'
emotional landscapes, but she also goes beyond the
frame of the individual to evoke an entire time and

color, and Jane Rice re-enacts it here."

Subject:      phenomenology of radio earth
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

phenomenology of radio earth


phenomenology of the earth in relation to vlf and crystal - how fields
recreate an alternative 'mapping' of the planet, encased in a skein or
membrane of radiation (radiations, single or plural).

these mappings are always 'cleansed' - pure no matter what the ostensible
content of the carriers. from a technical viewpoint it's all modulation,
all encoding. extrapolate from this back to visual perception - there's
that neutrality again, as if every visible, every wound, suture, object,
process, were not only of equal value, but of null value, or rather - as
if value had no place in the world.

Buddha might have relegated suffering to the broadcast band.

induction forms intimacies with the earth; crystals are the fundamental
filters, assigning direction and flux to topological space.

earphones etc. are nothing more than mechanisms of evidence; - it's here
that the origin enters into the image - earphones establish the origin: of
the perceiver, but also of the signal content and the implications of the
location of the signal itself, if not the location itself.

loop and magnetism, but also loop and interrupter, the self-containment of
the loop. the loop virtualizes the magnetic flux transmission, inheres it.

the phenomenology of the open ground/antenna system implying segment or
vector; the earth and skies are tied to their fields, extended elsewhere
and continuously.

this tends to become too mystical, too much Heidegger who might has well
been describing early radio; the Fourfold is superhetrodyning.

>> the idea is to listen to the weakest part of the band, amplify until
something, no matter what, is heard - the potential well falls apart here
- i.e. the signal-to-noise ratio of safe information collapses. <<

think of coils and communities, coils as circumambulations surrounding
what is peripheral, perhaps preset. communities of ostensible content,
speech, interferences, adjacencies.

capacitors - inductors - proximities all: metal near metal, curled or
flattened. every capacitor induces, every inductor capacitates.

CB radio as relic community - how does this relate to the net - CB hacking
- how does this relate to codework. CB: local straggling across the earth;
your car or truck extends nine-miles in every direction.

what could constitute mineral or organic inductors, capacitors - was there
physical circuitry before humans. it's important to imagine radio as al-
ways already present, not only as background/interference, but as fore-
ground/content, intentional transmission.

http://www.asondheim.org/radioearth.gif

i don't want to harbor on this, remain in this harbor of spectral audio. i
don't want to remain here, i want to point out the myriad phenomena, their
constituents, their being-thought-through in problem worlds, or rather,
their problems in the worlds of knowing. then it's time to leave the con-
sort, or for random acts of internalization, surgical knowledge, then it's
time to leave those as well.

AUTHOR'S STATEMENT:

This book intends to present both verbal and visual poetries as equal.
Though notions of poetics have shifted and swerved, what has stayed solid
throughout is that the alphabet, the word - however arranged - contains,
within it, dual significance. First, the proto-historic role of the visual
conveyance of represented fact. Second, the overriding desire of human
utterance to substantiate existence. In conjoining these two models this
book hopes to form a third, blurred value. Thought and experience are
factors that accrue, while staring and writing help resolve and conclude.
Text itself is an amalgam of units of meaning. As you stare at text you
notice the visual aspects of letters. As one stares further, meaning loses
its hierarchy and words discorporate and the alphabet itself begins to
surface. Shapes, spatial relations and visual associations emerge as one
delves further. Alphabetic bits or parts or snippets of letters can create
an added visual vocabulary amidst the very text one is reading. One aim, to
this end, is to merge and hinge visual and textual writing into workable
forms. This book collects some of these experiments.

SAMPLE OF WORK FROM "TEXT LOSES TIME":

     FROM "THE SCAFFOLDING"

  The Rhymes of Vellum

 A boy or girl, Vellum, blows a few papers in the wind   It answers noise
Hopping, hopped. Tapping, tapped   Swim sweet twins swing twig   Think of
losing, serendipity or the wings of a sentence   He will get them, but not
tell you where they were   I like to drink through my brother's center   A
finger's rose begins   A shadow grows down the sidewalk   Clapping, clapped
It helps to rip this box open   Sound harbor, sound hole   Blind rose is a
very shape friend   I want a shirt to visit my slacks   Moon noose soon
loose   A good look at the cookbook - lots of o's - ghost epaulets on the
shoulders of a paragraph   Dishes mixes, buses guesses   I sit down to work;
I draw with my right hand   The response sadly is never   Living as wide as
it gets   Think sift   You could fault the long moth, the dog lost in soft
fog, but it's the song's cost, its crust   I got frogs in my throat, a
forehead throat   Boris said, "Your throat's red."   Timothy hums a nail
into the wood   I run uphill swimming   The test isn't over   The floor's
hard   The new girl at school   Can you look at a book without getting
caught on a line?   Like radio, writing is a broadcast   They found people
in the mailbox   A huge gem in a cage   Susan flips back to the glossary
Only a certain type of fastener   The letter "R" in each corner of a page
Unexpectedly the middle is empty   Next, write your best trick   Most banjo
Odd pretty piece asleep   A drum whisking discard into cream   In this way
we raise our pigs on fire & Kenny is always six yards old   The donkey said,
"Enough." The donkey said, "English."   Dark thoughts won't cure light
sickness   The ladder moved slightly throws the world in disarray   The
teacher's a bird and flies out the window   They had found their clown
center   Art will say, "I like to pitch. What is your name?" Art will say,
"Hi, I'm Art. I like to pitch. What's your name?"   Slowly toward a large
bird   Paper hats, cats   A lot of noise comes to visit Long thin water in a
line of people   I called you once today to say geese make a village of gold
& both of my little friends like to sing. Their secret voices are beautiful
Spray Spray Spray

COMMENTS ON TEXT LOSES TIME:

"Part nested Minimalist cubes and part laser light that won't diverge across
distance, Nico Vassilakis' poetry seems to ask whether we are primates at
play on a baseball diamond of memory and desire beside mural-lined public
structures slipping toward infinite regression.

Richly iterative, these pairings and alphabets escape the mirror to thrill
us with variation and sting all forms of complacency. Vassilakis extends
Oulipian strategies:  Perec references, lamellisections, crystalline
build-outs and transpositions, a scat of nonrepresentational vocables,
lettered whirlwinds giving speed for legibility, --  "extracting the gem
through layers of gauze" and, other times, lowering a gem into a fold.

Can an argument between a machine that produces texts and "longhand into
tiny notebooks" wake us up?  In pain, "the throbbing thumb" makes us "attend
to the living."

If Vassilakis revises the rock lyric "meet-the-new-boss,
same-as-the-old-boss" to "meet the solipsistic era.  same as the old
solipsistic era,"  is treatment to be had in a bar, a science lab, or will
it reach us over the radio?  Try a road trip, so "you can't afford to blink,
to be blind for even a second" going through a colander out where dust is
breeding and "glass traps lighting" like no scene you've seen in quite this
way. Through crevices, perforations, punctures, piercings, pinholes, see
neighborhoods as "that place where organized sleeping happens." So, look for
a faceted colony that "sometimes congeals.""
--Deborah Meadows

"Nico Vassilakis' Text Loses Time unhinges the folds of the book and the
word; as the 'folded loose leafed sheets whiz past your ears' you can hear
the echoes of meaning. The words flake off the page like aged paint leaving
a patina of colour and meaning on the surface and a growing heap of
signification at our feet. Here the means of writing rise up and turn
against our expectation, lurching into new spaces. Letters become tactile,
meaning becomes rubbery, and both reading and writing become a new
collaboration."
 --derek beaulieu

there are a number of issues here and what is added below may have
already been said.
one place where the politics of dissent may be experimented with, and
practiced, is in the classroom, be it public or private school, high
school or university.  this is where a student may learn how to have
an  opinion that breaks from the fold, to respectfully disagree with
authority, how to be a member of a group and yet inhabit one's own
path.  what it means to dissent from the collective in real terms, and
how dissent might be sustained over time.  and this is where people
who are drawn to consensus, may also learn what it means to have the
odd one out among you, what it means to hear forceful or supple
disagreement, and what it means to suspect that possibly, the
consensus is mistaken on certain points, or else alternatively, to be
impartial about it for the sake of this point, that we will always
have the cranks among us.  and that loyalty and consensus are not
always the same thing.  and i think this is true in secular and
religious classrooms both.  it is an obvious point, and a small point,
but in the end the intellectual process is shared, and belongs to
everyone, and how the common good is interpreted over time may also
take place in the classroom.  my husband is a SUNY professor.  what an
awesome responsibility the teachers bear.

of course there are other forms and conditions of dissent in our time,
but we are lucky to have our schools also.

peace,

heidi

i wish i could have been home schooled. it was a crime however when i was growing up. now it's just another choice you can make, which i think is great. i always hated forced socialization. even for things like birthday parties or like funerals. i was always impressed with quentin crisp's answer as a child to "what do you want to be when you grow up?" he always answered "an invalid." i'm sure proust would have approved.

just a clarification, by the "odd one out", i was referring to myself,
and by religious classrooms also, i was referring to catholic
education in the u.s.

AUTHOR'S STATEMENT:

This book intends to present both verbal and visual poetries as equal.
Though notions of poetics have shifted and swerved, what has stayed solid
throughout is that the alphabet, the word - however arranged - contains,
within it, dual significance. First, the proto-historic role of the visual
conveyance of represented fact. Second, the overriding desire of human
utterance to substantiate existence. In conjoining these two models this
book hopes to form a third, blurred value. Thought and experience are
factors that accrue, while staring and writing help resolve and conclude.
Text itself is an amalgam of units of meaning. As you stare at text you
notice the visual aspects of letters. As one stares further, meaning loses
its hierarchy and words discorporate and the alphabet itself begins to
surface. Shapes, spatial relations and visual associations emerge as one
delves further. Alphabetic bits or parts or snippets of letters can create
an added visual vocabulary amidst the very text one is reading. One aim, to
this end, is to merge and hinge visual and textual writing into workable
forms. This book collects some of these experiments.

SAMPLE OF WORK FROM "TEXT LOSES TIME":

     FROM "THE SCAFFOLDING"

  The Rhymes of Vellum

 A boy or girl, Vellum, blows a few papers in the wind   It answers noise
Hopping, hopped. Tapping, tapped   Swim sweet twins swing twig   Think of
losing, serendipity or the wings of a sentence   He will get them, but not
tell you where they were   I like to drink through my brother's center   A
finger's rose begins   A shadow grows down the sidewalk   Clapping, clapped
It helps to rip this box open   Sound harbor, sound hole   Blind rose is a
very shape friend   I want a shirt to visit my slacks   Moon noose soon
loose   A good look at the cookbook - lots of o's - ghost epaulets on the
shoulders of a paragraph   Dishes mixes, buses guesses   I sit down to work;
I draw with my right hand   The response sadly is never   Living as wide as
it gets   Think sift   You could fault the long moth, the dog lost in soft
fog, but it's the song's cost, its crust   I got frogs in my throat, a
forehead throat   Boris said, "Your throat's red."   Timothy hums a nail
into the wood   I run uphill swimming   The test isn't over   The floor's
hard   The new girl at school   Can you look at a book without getting
caught on a line?   Like radio, writing is a broadcast   They found people
in the mailbox   A huge gem in a cage   Susan flips back to the glossary
Only a certain type of fastener   The letter "R" in each corner of a page
Unexpectedly the middle is empty   Next, write your best trick   Most banjo
Odd pretty piece asleep   A drum whisking discard into cream   In this way
we raise our pigs on fire & Kenny is always six yards old   The donkey said,
"Enough." The donkey said, "English."   Dark thoughts won't cure light
sickness   The ladder moved slightly throws the world in disarray   The
teacher's a bird and flies out the window   They had found their clown
center   Art will say, "I like to pitch. What is your name?" Art will say,
"Hi, I'm Art. I like to pitch. What's your name?"   Slowly toward a large
bird   Paper hats, cats   A lot of noise comes to visit Long thin water in a
line of people   I called you once today to say geese make a village of gold
& both of my little friends like to sing. Their secret voices are beautiful

COMMENTS ON TEXT LOSES TIME:

"Part nested Minimalist cubes and part laser light that won't diverge across
distance, Nico Vassilakis' poetry seems to ask whether we are primates at
play on a baseball diamond of memory and desire beside mural-lined public
structures slipping toward infinite regression.

Richly iterative, these pairings and alphabets escape the mirror to thrill
us with variation and sting all forms of complacency. Vassilakis extends
Oulipian strategies:  Perec references, lamellisections, crystalline
build-outs and transpositions, a scat of nonrepresentational vocables,
lettered whirlwinds giving speed for legibility, --  "extracting the gem
through layers of gauze" and, other times, lowering a gem into a fold.

Can an argument between a machine that produces texts and "longhand into
tiny notebooks" wake us up?  In pain, "the throbbing thumb" makes us "attend
to the living."

If Vassilakis revises the rock lyric "meet-the-new-boss,
same-as-the-old-boss" to "meet the solipsistic era.  same as the old
solipsistic era,"  is treatment to be had in a bar, a science lab, or will
it reach us over the radio?  Try a road trip, so "you can't afford to blink,
to be blind for even a second" going through a colander out where dust is
breeding and "glass traps lighting" like no scene you've seen in quite this
way. Through crevices, perforations, punctures, piercings, pinholes, see
neighborhoods as "that place where organized sleeping happens." So, look for
a faceted colony that "sometimes congeals.""
--Deborah Meadows

"Nico Vassilakis' Text Loses Time unhinges the folds of the book and the
word; as the 'folded loose leafed sheets whiz past your ears' you can hear
the echoes of meaning. The words flake off the page like aged paint leaving
a patina of colour and meaning on the surface and a growing heap of
signification at our feet. Here the means of writing rise up and turn
against our expectation, lurching into new spaces. Letters become tactile,
meaning becomes rubbery, and both reading and writing become a new
collaboration."
 --derek beaulieu

And are they still treated this way?  A friend and I have been discussing the ways younger female poets (as well as musicians, etc) are still infantilized, despite their talents/success/etc.  She posted about it on her blog today.  It is baffling but appears to be a trend, though Ana only mentions two examples here:

i have grown almost as tired of that wispy fairy girl persona as i have of the soulful all american boy thing that guys like john mayer seem to pump out. it seems like every time there's a new female singer songwriter who's gotten any acclaim has to pull that dreamy stevie nicks on quaaludes little girl otherness and it seems so very affected i wonder if it's a sort of defense mechanism to hide from the attention. Like maybe the reaction that one naturally has to people starting to listen to them is to immediately turn on whatever charms have gotten them laid in the past and then amp it up to a vaudevillean parody of 21st century gender tropes.

A friend and I have been discussing the ways younger female poets (as well as musicians, etc) are still infantilized, despite their talents/success/etc.  She posted about it on her blog today.  It is baffling but appears to be a trend, though Ana only mentions two examples here:

Half of my peers from the age of 10 to the age of 18 were home-schooled.   In terms of socialization, they were far more mature.  In terms of decision making, they've avoided nearly all of the pit falls of adolescence (ie drinking drugs irresponsible sex).  In terms of education, I believe they were at the very least on par with the other half of my peers.  However, I believe that ultimately the quality of a home-schooler's education relies solely on the effort that both parent and student put forth, as well as the level of the parents education.  The difference can vary between that of a poorly funded rural public school to that of a high priced private school.

These generalizations are utterly useless, if you ask me.

Subject: beware of biased, unfounded, opinions about homeschooling



I'm astonished to read the ill-informed post about home schooling

Sorry, but that  take on homeschooled kids is full of shit

Actual date suggests that homeschoolers are, on average, above average.
Think Lake Wobegone

The idea that homeschoolsers are socially deficient is completely without
support.

Homeschoolers are way ahead of their peers in living in the world.  They
have less time with their age peers but they spend more time among normal
adults and as a result do not behave as complete dolts when an adult
attempts to interact with them. Instead they treat the adult as a person
and respnd appropriately

I don't know where you get your information but it's completely off base.
Homeschooling is generally a much better preparation for life (even the
pathetic life that formal school offers).

If you care about such things, data tells us that homeschooled kids score
around 70-80 percentile on standardized tests.  No wonder...consider the
vocabulary one develops spending the day with an adult who has a half-way
decent vocabulary when compared to spending one's days with little kids
with little kids' vocab.

Dorothea Lasky needs no one's permission to act one way or the other.  Those
who actually read her poems understand exactly how and where she stands in
this world.  One of the strongest people and poets I've ever met in my life
is Dorothea Lasky.

Lasky points directly at what you see and you know soon enough how lazy your
eyes have been.

AWE is one of the best books of poetry of 2007, no doubt about it.

In 100 years when the rest of us are forgotten there will be Lasky.

=B3they've avoided nearly all of the pit falls of adolescence (ie drinking
drugs irresponsible sex). =B2 =3D Sex, drugs, alcohol are bad

sounds like moralizing,  which that would be a point of my objection to
home-schooling, and I confess may have prompted me to respond to this post.

The inevitable will always come; children have to be socilaized, and join i=
n
to a society of their peers at some point.
We brought our 8 month daughter, whose name is confusingly crash, to creche
this week, where she takes her cues from the other children; movement,
voice, sound, balance, sharing, not sharing, crying, laughing, the whole
range of emotions.
The other children are teaching her things that we cannot. She is joining
her society here in our city, she is making friends her own age.


My objection to home-schooling, as I understand it, is based on my own bias=
:
it sounds like advocates of home schooling think theres something wrong wit=
h
the common values.=20
Advocates of home-schooling are somehow contrarian.
The most obvious example that comes to mind is creationism. i have no idea
of the numbers but i would imagine a large percentage of home schoolers are
advocates of church AND state partnership.  When I was a child in
california, our neighbors moved to idaho, to join a community with
conservative religious values, and to home school.
Thus, my biases also tell me thats theres more home schooling in the bible
belt, places like idaho and utah
Is this not true?

To my knowledge, the united states is the only occidental country currently
failing to separate church and state.

The exception, as Will mentioned, might be that the quality of schooling is
so bad that the children are not learning vocabulary and geography.
I think the point is that as a society and community we should be able
create educational institutions that work and meet universal needs.

I agree with Charlie; the individual success comes down only to the
household, and that there is no common denominator, and with crystal its no=
t
possible to generalise either way, good or bad.
Is there an "average" home-schooling profile?

bob & susan arnold of longhouse books home-schooled their son carson whom I
am sure knows little of creationism, but plenty about biology, carpentry,
music, poetry & literature. He is an excellent writer. He's a musician and
music critic with an interesting blog;

Poets who imagine that it would be an improvement to be certifiably crazy have never spent time in a mental ward, which I did.  I hospitalized myself ten years ago while recovering from brain surgery and  was on the wrong medication.I got out in two weeks but saw plenty of people who were "truly crazy" who stayed in the lockup for longer periods of time.  Since then, I have been reluctant to call people "crazy" unless they are disturbing and causing problems for other people for a significant period of time.  This is for the business of Bernadette speculating about losing one's mind.  As for senility, I can't say, having not reached that point quite yet.  Is King Lear a  dependable roadmap?  I doubt it.

Hi all,

a brief clarification -- in the case of Joanna Newsom's interview, the
questions posed her can & should be under question, as they were selected by
the interviewer; for Lasky's interview, though, questions from the Proust
Questionnaire were used:

http://perso.orange.fr/chabrieres/proustquestionnaire.html

and only the tone of the conversation is supplied by the
interviewer/interviewee.

If these artists were anything other than brilliant & intriguing, I doubt
their artistic/public personae would be of interest to me or anyone else, or
be the object of my admiring analysis. They're their own best champions. And
how they present does matter.

Thanks, all, for reading...

Ana

I worked as an attendant for 7 years at state=20
mental hospitals in Ohio. Good fellow workers,=20
decent conditions, but most patients were
miserable. I'd not recommend it. My father died
of congestive heart failure and Alzheimer's
disease. Facing the possibility of such a
future and what it would mean to my life
(I teach), I don't overly worry
about it (what the hell are you going=20

glamorize it, even in daydreams.

Dear David,
Given the importance of this oversight action, and the rhetoric spouted by
the Bush administration on Iran -- now is a pivotal time to *TAKE ACTION*.
Join the nationwide effort to flood the offices of our member of Congress
with calls demanding an end to the U.S. war in Iraq and no new war with
Iran.

Call your Representative and both Senators on *Thursday, September 6th,
TODAY*.  The number for the *Congressional switchboard is:  202.224.3121*.

Tell them:   I want you to act now to end the war and occupation of Iraq and
to prevent a war with Iran.
Congress has the Constitutional right and a moral responsibility to use the
power of the purse to *withdraw all U.S. soldiers and contractors from Iraq
on a rapid and binding schedule. *
Congress must act to prevent a catastrophic war with Iran, and speak out
against the Bush Administration's reckless escalation of rhetoric and
provocative actions against Iran.

Not sure who represents you in Congress?  Look
Here.<http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=eWF3JoG7cPYb13l%2B/5EKind2K8HyAgj2>
Background:
Iraq Spending:
In September, Congress will focus on Iraq. They will vote on the President's
request for continued funding of the war. At this writing, the request
stands at $142 billion, but Bush will probably increase it to over $190
billion! Congress is not required to give Bush any of this money, or even to
bring the request to a vote. Congress can also put restrictions, firm
withdrawal time lines and other conditions on any funding in order to force
an end to the U.S. occupation of Iraq.

Iran:
On August 28, President Bush announced that he has authorized US forces in
Iraq to confront Iran militarily. "I have authorized our military commanders
in Iraq to confront Tehran's murderous activities," Bush said in a speech to
US war veterans in Reno. Simultaneously, US forces raided a hotel in Baghdad
and detained ten Iranians who were part of a delegation that had been
invited to Iraq to help with reconstruction.

The harshness and frequency of the rhetoric has steadily increased. Last
week the Bush administration announced its intention to designate the IRGC
as a terrorist entity, an unprecedented move. This week in Reno, the
President reiterated accusations that Iran was smuggling weapons into Iraq
while chastising the Iraqi prime minister for his diplomatic relations with
Iran. Left unchallenged, all these steps point in one, undeniable direction:
War.

The recent moves follow a familiar pattern. In January 2007, the President
accused Iran of supplying IED's to Iraqi insurgents, signaling his intention
to use military force to attack Iran. Simultaneously, US forces detained
five Iranians at an Iranian consulate in the Iraqi city of Irbil. Congress
successfully averted crisis through swift and strong reactions to the
escalated rhetoric. Congress took immediate action by challenging the
President to provide evidence for the claims.

Now, as the White House is once again escalating tensions, Congress must act
to prevent war from occurring.
 In Peace,

I think (and this is speculation) that it was a poem written in the excess of exuberation and comcomitant frustration that turbulent and uncertain love brings...and that in such scenarios one imagines calm safe harbors everywhere if elsewhere...away from the intensity...the fact that she imagined THAT as a safe harbor is what made it work and still work for me...the "no place to lay one's head" biblical thing sorta...

and you know poets...they like...exagerrate and stuff...

This problem is still rampant in music criticism, it's built into the words
some male critics use-- songbird, songstress, and diva, just to name a few--
when discussing female musicians; this in the (probably unconscious) service
of infantalizing female musicians and reducing them to a state of cutesy
kitsch. also the tacit assumption, particularly relating to female pop
stars, that they're basically puppets with some male Svengali doing all the
heavy mental lifting in the wings-- and in some cases this may be true, but
male critics of a certain stripe (hardboiled indie dudes or aging rockists)
seem to make the assumption much more readily about Gwen Stefani than Justin
Timberlake. Music expresses culture, and this sort of condescending
criticism by males simply expresses a mindset still prevalent in the
culture. For what it's worth, I've interviewed Joanna Newsom -- not only is
she a brilliant and classically trained musician, she's one of the most
intelligent and articulate people I've interviewed, which you wouldn't pick
up on from that video.

Speaking of the svengali trip, one of my favorite recent albums is Ballad of the Broken Seas by Isobel Campbell and Mark Lanegan--in part because I love how the tables are turned: the frail-voiced, cello-playing woman becomes the svengali for the gravel-voiced, hard-rocking guy.

you can infantilize gwen all you want...she'll go with it...she's "feeling yummy head to toe"...and she had the best pop lyric this year i think "p...you crazy...where u get this? this sounds like disco Tetris"...talking to pharell...i think the general rule of thumb is if they stick their finger in their mouth at any time flirtatiously?during a performance it's ok to assume the role of a bimbo interviewer interviewing a bimbette...but hopefully you're both making a lot of? money while doing it...was it paula yates who used to conduct all her interviews in bed with rock stars...i think that's a good way to get rid of the tensions and seriosity...i'm not sure if she interviewed, say, leonard bernstein, like that....i think she stayed more on the pop twinkie side of things...poor?paula ?r.i.p....she and hutchence allegedly victims of the canonization of Sir Geldof....

Uh, that may be the premise of the story of the songs on the album or
something, I don't know because I haven't heard it.

But Lanegan's been making records since the grunge scare of the mid to
late 1980s (he was in Screaming Trees) and the band that Campbell was in
earlier, Belle & Sebastian, didn't begin recording til some time in the
mid-1990s.

So who's the Svengali here?

I'm very surprised that there seems to be such an aversion to the use of condoms amongst some of you!

part of the problem with this discussion is people are making
generalizations about a concept which really has always existed in
this world since the beginning of civilization.  the discussion seems
to be focussed on one extremely specific form of home-schooling which
revolves around removing your children from public schools so they
can be indoctrinated into a religion.  believe me, unschooling /
homeschooling  (which really are quite different things) is far more
diverse than that.  in our part of the country more than 25% of the
kids I know are homeschooled at least till high school, at which
point they join one of the alternative high schools.  my son Liaizon
was unschooled until he was 12 or so.  he was a voting member in our
community when he was 7, was able to conduct a meeting, create an
agenda, sponsor & solve problems from a very early age.  at the same
age he could also cook a meal for 25 in order to feed people.
verbally & creative precocious, inventive, playful & quite happy.
because he had very long hair & was into really different things than
local kids, he would have met endless bullying & unwanted attention
in the public schools.  I know because that's what happened to me in
the schools in this part of Wisconsin when I was, even into high
school.  Things haven't changed much in rural public schools.

She didn't "create" him, duh, but if you check out the record, she uses him as the mouthpiece for her concept.

Uh, that may be the premise of the story of the songs on the album or
something, I don't know because I haven't heard it.

But Lanegan's been making records since the grunge scare of the mid to
late 1980s (he was in Screaming Trees) and the band that Campbell was in
earlier, Belle & Sebastian, didn't begin recording til some time in the
mid-1990s.

So who's the Svengali here?

Love,

The Poetry Project



TUESDAY, September 11, 7 - 9PM (FREE)
RECOLLECTIVE:=20
ST. MARK=B9S CHURCH & THE ARTS PROJECTS OBSERVE 9/11

This event is sponsored by St. Mark=B9s Church and will include readings and
performances by the arts project=B9s that call it home: The Poetry Project,
Ontological Hysterical Theater and Danspace. The St. Mark's Choir and
Reverend Billy will also perform.  Join us in the sanctuary as we remember,
reflect and create communally.  Featured poets are Thom Donovan, Nathaniel
Siegel and Christina Strong.



WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT:
=20
BASIC AND BOLD: LOGOS R US =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 9TH
=20
Every writer finds a niche, a gesture, the thing that works in what they do=
.
At some point it may become a style or convention.  Sometimes it becomes a
crutch.  One way to break the mode is to be radical=8Bthat is, return to the
roots.  What brought you to poetry in the first place? This is a workshop
for writers who want to re-look at how the structure and elements of poetry
provide the wherewithal to make poems that are as ambitious, thoughtful and
innovative as you want them to be. There will be in class writing,
assignments, reading, and a revision project called =8BCAN THIS POEM BE
SAVED?=8B in which you bring a poem that simply has not come to closure; seem=
s
to be stuck; or needs to be looked at by fresh eyes in the hope of finding
what could make it work. This workshop is geared toward writers who have
been seriously writing for some time.  Please submit 5-8 pages of poetry an=
d
a brief description of what you=B9d like to accomplish in the workshop by
September 28. African American poet, playwright and cultural commentator,
Patricia Spears Jones is author of two collections, Femme du Monde and The
Weather That Kills.
=20
POETRY LAB: FORMS OF JOYFUL EXPERIMENTATION =AD TODD COLBY
FRIDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 12TH


In this workshop we'll forge new paths to the poem by investigating how far
a poem can depart from being =B3a poem=B2 and yet still be a poem. We'll
experiment with breath, heartbeat, movement, blogs, the alchemy of words,
visions, letters to the editor, spontaneity, psychoanalysis, collaborations=
,
appropriations and self-hypnosis, along with various traditional forms. The
main objective is to create a supportive and inviting atmosphere in our
joyfully experimental "Lab." A partial reading list will include: Hannah
Weiner, Jacques Lacan, Gertrude Stein, Diane Williams, David Markson,
Miranda July, Thomas Bernhard, Bill Knott, Arthur Rimbaud, Alice Notley,
Mina Loy, Charles Olson, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Todd Colby is the author
of Tremble & Shine, Riot in the Charm Factory, Cush, and Ripsnort, all of
which were published by Soft Skull Press.
=20
WORLDLY AND INFINITELY DIMENSIONAL:
A WORKSHOP =AD RACHEL LEVITSKY
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 13
=20
In these times, the possibilities by which we may amplify, record, document=
,
display, shape, formulate, and publish words increases daily. Although
expanded media and its wide reach are in themselves a meaningful fact of ou=
r
times, they don=B9t necessarily enhance a poetry=B9s resonance. How do we, and
by we I mean both ourselves as ones and ourselves as groups, best construct
and perform our poetries so as to be present in these particular times and
yet open to the infinite possibilities of =B3projection,=B2 =B3conception,=B2
=B3performance=B2? Familiarizing ourselves with poets like Abigail Child, Julie
Patton, Cecilia Vicu=F1a, Bob Dylan, Linton Kwesi Johnson (some will be
visiting the workshop), we will consider all means available and any means
necessary to project living works into our world. Individually and
collaboratively we=B9ll construct performances, visual works, sound events,
improvisations, etc. Rachel Levitsky is the author of Under the Sun
(Futurepoem) and is the founder and co-editor of Belladonna Books.
=20
=20
The workshop fee is $350, which includes a one-year individual Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all fall spring and fall classes=
.
Reservations are required due to limited class space, and payment must be
received in advance. Please send payment and reservations to: The Poetry
Project, St. Mark=B9s Church, 131 E. 10th St., NY, NY 10003. For more

Wait, wait wait wait!

When did "diva" become a belittling word?
Does that mean that to call someone "divine" (source of the word "diva")
is to insult her?

This is so interesting. How do you see Joni Mitchell fitting in here, into
what you say? Recently, I have listened to her interviewed as a very young
woman (here:
http://archives.cbc.ca/IDD-1-68-2462/arts_entertainment/joni_mitchell/).

Thus.


Usage Note: Thusly was introduced in the 19th century as an alternative to t=

 educated people straining to sound stylish. The word has subsequently gaine=

Grim(e) Day

This has been a grim day. Whenever I speak with my father, his hatred
manages to hit home. From his viewpoint I'm a failure. He's been paying my
health insurance; otherwise I'd die which might not be that much of a dis-
pleasure to him. Thinking about this there were voices in my head which
managed to expand into a world I prayed was out there, but am certain was
just going on between cortex and ego. Yes, things manage to leap ontolo-
gies just like that, the sign of madness. I listened to crystal, worked on
rearrangement, all those voices spewed into the aether through systems of
coils echoing one another, http://www.asondheim.org/echocoils.mp3 . I
began to recognize the mockery of dissonance, played music and toppled the
line upon itself with echos and delays as I thought what to do next, in
the meantime beginning world-building once again with universal harmony,
http://www.asondheim.org/universalharmony.mp3. By this time I was raging
in tears fighting myself repeatedly, not that my health has been in good
shape, it hasn't. I'm as far from my family as an event horizon filled
with nothing worthwhile. I curled into myself. I curled farther into
myself, I thought myself monad, I thought myself rage, I thought myself
consort, I stopped thinking, I began again with the harmony of monads
purring softly in molecular air, http://www.asondheim.org/harmonady.mp3 ,
open the windows, monads and let the soft flow healing in, the curing of
rage against the selves swells to uncanny beauties that never makes the
pain worthwhile.

Jeez guys, I WISH my brother would consider homeschooling my nephew-- who is
brilliant, thoughtful, original and who thrives in hands on situations.  I
love ripping things apart with him and watching hyim learn how to put it all
back together.  Yesterday he asked me what was the difference between wisdom
and knowledge.  When he discovers and idea he loves, he literally wants to
dance around the room with happiness.

I dread what will happen when he goes to school and has be quiet and sit
still or be labelled "hyperactive".  I think he would do well with
unschooling because he is so naturally curious and interested in the
world.,  He doesn't need to be squeezed into some standardized hole.

BTW, I think responsible sex is totally HOT.  Nothing fires me up as much as
a man who is thoughful and considerate by nature,  and would never want to
hurt me in a million years.  You can keep the selfish creeps who only care
about their own pleasure....

the minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 25 pieces by Andrew Topel.

"The trillionth part has not yet been said; and all that has been
said, but multiplies the avenues to what remains to be said.  It is
not so much paucity, as superabundance of material that seems to
incapacitate modern authors." --Herman Melville

To which I would add: seems to incapacitate *some* modern authors, but
not Andrew Topel, who meets superabundance head.

Come see one small drop in his bucket.

Enjoy,
Dan

first thought after watching the 'tube piece: there's 4+ minutes of my
life I'll never get back -- and I try *so hard* not to think like that
these days...

there is a general shallowness of self-presentation I think is in vogue
now, and I take Ana's original post as an illustration of how creative
women come off as ninnies when they're asked the "20 questions" or
whatever -- I blame the context, not the subjects, in this case...

I will have to give D Lasky a read -- based solely on the YouTube
questionnaire footage, she struck me as just another self-loathing
female poet -- that said, I don't put much stock in anyone's
"performance" when accosted with one-size-fits-all magazine
questionnaires: irk.=20

I've seldom heard "diva" used in music journalism to indicate the divine,
regardless of its origins. It seems more often deployed to insinuate the old
"hysterical woman" stereotype, synonymous in tone with something like "prima
donna". It's not explicitly insulting, it's part of a larger structural
pattern of language from male critics that holds back a measure of artistic
seriousness from female musicians. At any rate, "siren" might have been a
better example, implying as it does (even in its literal sense) that the
singer will lure you into danger with her magical song or some shit like
that.

Best,
Brian

I had an interesting conversation with a colleague of mine in our music
department the other day that I thought I would share with the list.  He
regularly teaches a class on music-voice-text, and one of the issues he
is interested in is poetic texts that resist vocalization/performance.
As he and I discussed, it seems like such resistance could be
categorized in a number of ways: features of the text that make it
difficult to vocalize (such as working in several languages, unusual
syntax or diction, etc.); features of the text that don't necessarily or
obviously translate into vocalization (although punctuation, lineation,
etc. always work at least partly at the acoustic level, they also often
have other, overriding concerns); and, poetic texts that are engaged
with the visual perhaps almost to the exclusion of the verbal.  For this
last, we were talking of course about concrete poetry and other "visual
poetries" -- we spent a lot of time talking about Robert Grenier, for
instance.

I found the conversation interesting partly because there is so much
interest (on my part, at least), in the acoustic/musical/performance
qualities of poetry, and it was useful to poke at the limit-cases of
that concern.

I'm wondering if anyone else has any thoughts....

Thanks!

Writing Experiments Workshop
Dodie Bellamy

My fall workshop will meet 11 consecutive Tuesday evenings, from 7 to
10 p.m.  The dates:  September 25 through December 4.  Cost: $350,
with a $100 deposit due by September 18.

Most weeks students will be assigned a short take-home writing
experiment which they will share with the class the following week.
Assignments will range from cut ups to exploring bodily sensations.
Assignments are geared towards the class dynamic, so they may
eventually drop away or they may continue for the duration of the
class.

Each week we will also critique longer pieces by two to five
students.  Students may bring in anything they want (up to 20 pages)
for the longer critiques.  Depending on the length, these longer
pieces will be read aloud in class or handed out a week ahead of
time.  Though this class will have a prose focus, it is cross-genre,
and poets are welcome.  The class is limited to 10 students.  Lots
and lots of personal attention.  It takes place in San Francisco, in
my South of Market apartment, which comes complete with snacks and
two cats.

This is a good class for poets wanting to play around with narrative
or prose writers wanting to open up their prose.  I won't be doing a
workshop in the spring, but hope to do another one in the summer.

About me:  Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and
memoiresque essays, was published in 2004 by San Francisco's Suspect
Thoughts Press.  My vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was
reprinted by University of Wisconsin Press, also in 2004.
Academonia, a book of essays was published by Krupskaya in 2006.  I'm
the author of 3 other books and I teach creative writing at SF State,
CCA and Antioch Los Angeles.  I've also taught at CalArts, Naropa
summer session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute.
I've received the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the
Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc.  Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them.  If you're interested do contact me promptly.
Preference given to those not currently enrolled in a grad writing
program.

Okay, I believe your experience.

I still hear the word "diva" used without irony in its proper place.

The only laughable usage I have heard lately is its application to
female pop singers.

Subject:      Absent 2:
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=WINDOWS-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Disposition: inline

       Simon De Ceo's blogspot (http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com)
and the first two issues of the journal Absent that he edits
http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/2007/08/absent-magazine-issue-two-now-on=
line.htmare
exciting and very interesting to read, especially as in Absent there's
the  inclusion of a conversation among a much wider range of poetries
and poetics than is too seldom offered.  Issues of growing concern for
quite some time in the ongoing American Empire's Wars (Poverty, Drugs
& Terror) at home and abroad are those of censorship and the control
and manipulation of translation and Intelligence (includingto be sure
"Intelligent Design!"). The more unstable things become, the more
silencing of critical writings and voices there is.  With more
frequency al the time, one reads of talks canceled talks, classes,
contracts and marshaled attacks on "books, professors, authors,
citizens.  The kind of dialogic sphere Absent presents is a great
breath of fresh air to find in such a climate.
           Two essays in particular I found fascinating in relation to
the politicization and policing of language and translation in
attempts to effect/claim the effects  of the controlling of a social
construction of discourses via questionable claims,especially
linguisitic ones, These are De Ceo's own "fuck you,aloha, ecopoeisis,"
and Kent Johnson's  "competence, linguistics, politics & post-avant
matters." In both, the issue of grammar is raised as a counter to what
De Ceo calls "the inhospitable state of language"

De Ceo writes:

Which brings me, of course, to ecopoiesis. Not ecopoetics, the
creepily violent Iron John-derivative masculinity of Gary Snyder, but
ecopoiesis, the creation of life in a hostile environment. The
violation of the inhospitable state of language by the introduction of
the poet-as-extremophile.

extremophile =97 the bacteria that live the extrodinary pressures of the
ocean trenches, in sulfuric acid, in the pores of mineral gems. The
bacteria that one day =97 if the human race outlives its own violence =97
with which we'll bombard the surface of Mars, erasing the pristine
inhospitability to build our shopping malls and hospitals on a foreign
landscape . . .

Language hates us, language resists us, language, as Noam Chomsky
demonstrated to an academic world whose antihumanists such as Judith
Butler (despite her other excellencies) continue to resist, is not
man's cozy creation, it is a work of nature. The same nature that
battered New Orleans batters us daily in our Universal Grammars. What
but the mind, and that deepest creation of the mind, the poet, is able
to survive the inhuman branchings of syntax, the poverty of semantics?

A home must be made on the surfaces of language, inside its syntax and
its semantics, and this is where, with a hindsight berift of the usual
communal demands of politeness that pervade the landscape of the
English-speaking world of poetry, we will recognize what is great and
what serves the ephemeral neuroses of the winning side of a widening
class divide.

          The issue of poetry surviving in the  "inhospitable state(s)
of language" in terms both of poetry and the world in which "the mind"
struggles against the inhumanity and neuroses of both nature/Universal
Grammars and the class divide
ie especially interesting to me as pretty much all my visual works in
particular are involved in the situations of an extremophile among
billions of extremophiles, who are being continually less visible and
listened to by means of Walls, fences, prisons, censorships, gated
communities, "security" and Surveillance systems and the new methods
of "translation" which seamlessly spread disinformation and propaganda
as "news".

        Kent Johnson's essay also takes up the issue of grammar in
relation to poetry and politics.    For Johnson, the ontological
foundations of Language Poetry and its claims to being resistant to
the kinds of "inhospitable state(s)" that De Ceo writes of, are not
based in any actual  linguistic findings, whether Chomksy's or others.
Language Poetry's claim that grammar itself is a product of and "=3D" to
social relations and constructions can be seen from this perspective
as being ironically what it purports to be resisting, or subverting.
That is, a rhetorical claim to a "truth" which has no basis, yet is
used in order to control discourse as though the rhetoric is --rather
weirdly--not in reference to "the situation on the ground" which De
Ceo recognizes and is concerned with, but a situation which exists
only within terms of its rhetoric.
The rhetoric then becomes a kind of self-referential totality
(to my mind) not unlike Karl Rove's famous statement that" We are an
Empire and can create or own reality."  The problems with the
disconnect between the rhetorical reality and the reality on the
ground, have of course been made hellishily all too real for millions
of persons.
         If it is not grammar that creates or equals a language of
class distinctions and oppressions, Johnons asks, among other
questions, in what ways does this claim still have a validity in terms
of practice?
Among Johnson's questions in this regard are:

To what extent -- to reorient Bernstein's remark -- might "grammar,
vocabulary, diction, form, and style" within the post-avant subculture
more directly and relevantly reflect a range of power relations at
work in the literary field itself? And what complicity might "avant"
poets share in maintaining and extending such relations? These
matters, I'd argue, are much more immediately critical to politically
minded poets than any purported homologies between grammatical
conventions and cultural hegemonies.

    Both these essays raise a great many fascinating questions in
relation to the fundamental and, for both writers, very much
overlooked, question raised, as Johnson points out, by Kasey Silem
Mohammad at his blog regarding "competence" and "questions of value."

In a period "inhospitable state(s)" of language and ontological being,
these questions take on an even greater sense of urgency and I'd
highly their thought provoking presenations of them.

Diva, usually applied to opera singers, is a term of respect,
something like grande dame--great lady. Beverley Sills was a diva,
and nobody ever accused her of being a prima donna.

I've never heard diva applied to pop music types, not even
incorrectly. But I'll confess to not being sufficiently interested in
pop music to read the journalism about it.

Dear Robert

=20

I read your post to the Poetics List with interest. From 1988-94 I =
performed
what I sometimes describe as my West Coast Beat-Black Mountain poetry =
with
free jazz accompaniment. At the time, I played bass violin and had a =
band
that performed throughout Connecticut and Massachusetts, and a duo with =
the
late jazz saxophonist Thomas Chapin that  performed in venues such as =
the
Nuyorican Poets Caf=E9 and other Manhattan venues.=20

=20

After I disbanded the group, I found that my poetry became more complex. =
I
found myself writing what I call =93orchestrated text=94 involving =
multiple
voices that would come together and diverge in much the way a free form
ensemble improvises. At some point in the late 1990s, I received an
inundation of Language Poetry books and =20

my style moved comfortably in that direction.=20

=20

On infrequent occasions, between 1999 and 2001 I would recite sections =
of my
longpoem =93IMPROVISATIONS=94 with a band composed of musicians from my =
former
poetry band. The difference in poetry made different demands on the =
music.
When my earlier poems had a clear and pointed meaning, I controlled the
music from the bass chair so that the improvisations, while free, would
reflect the mood and meaning of the poem being performed. With the more
language-centered poems, the musicians could move in whatever direction =
they
chose; the abstract text allowed the music to establish a =
correspondingly
abstract interaction. I didn=92t have to control the music.=20

=20

As IMPROVISATIONS  progressed, it incorporated visual elements that defy
performance, or would require long rehearsals to achieve with voice and
sound the visual effect that the page conveys. Although I believe my =
written
work stands on its own, I=92ve thought that it would be best presented =
as a
mixed-media event involving multiple readers,=20

a band and a slide or video show of the text and possibly abstract =
figures.
As I write this, it occurs to me that I would need the equivalent of the =
Sun
Ra Solar Arkestra to fuse the elements of sound, language and image =
together
in a way that would raise the work off the page successfully.=20

=20

I don=92t really perform anymore but, having worked with fusing poetry =
and
music, I find myself at least contemplating how I=92d  present work that
increasingly defies performance.=20

=20

If you want to discuss this further, feel free to continue the thread or =
to
backchannel me.

Saddam Hussein - Romance Writer (Who'd have thought?)

By Claudia Strasbaugh

Next Friday, Tokuma Shoten Publishing Company starts selling Saddam's newest=
 text to hit book stores, this version translated from Arabic to Japanese fo=
r 1,500 yen, or 14 U.S. dollars.

Saddam the author, writing love stories, you're thinking?=20

Yes. Tis so.=20











It appears he's not genre handicapped either. Educated and intelligent, Huss=
ain is quite capable of producing books of various types on quite a few diff=
erent subjects.

Actually George Bush's bad man of Bagdad already has a number of titles to h=
is credit, some include "Gulf Crisis", "Our History, Heritage, and Religion"=
, "The Revolution and Women in Iraq", "Thus We Should Fight Persians" and th=
e latest by this prolific scribe, "Devil's Dance" was completed in March of=20=
2003 not long after he was again reelected Iraqi president, shortly before t=
he United States invaded his country. Set near the Euphrates River, this lat=
est manuscript is a story of a tribesman's life 1,500 years ago.=20

Under fire, Hussein's daughter managed to get the original works to safety a=
fter the US attack, according to the publisher.=20

"I think the former president expected a loss and was writing this novel as=20=
a message aimed at raising morale among Iraqi people," so says Japan's trans=
lator, Itsuko Hirata, who suggested to the publisher that this book be print=
ed.

"We are not standing behind Saddam's views", Koichi Chikaraishi was known to=
 have told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa, last week. "We are not trying to spe=
ak for Hussein by publishing his book but the story helps (us) understand th=
e people of Iraq and how they think."

Saddam is presently a prisoner of the current United States whitehouse, accu=
sed of crimes against humanity.

thanks for this miekal.  i wasn't sure how to reply.  you say what i would
want to say.  intelligence has nothing to do with a kid's eagerness to
live, and what else is learning based on?  tol had such a hard time
growing up, things were never easy for him.  i wish i had been able/been
at a time in my life to have given him unschooling, especially if it could
have been with a group of like-minded folks.  i guess what i said about
tol was just to show that home/unschooled kids can dip in and out of the
system, whatever that system is, not to say how smart he is.  blessings, g

The first August Poetry Postcard Fest finished with a few late-arriving poe=
m/cards on Tuesday and Wednesday, and Lana Ayers and I have been awed by th=
e success of the project.=0A=0AOur thanks go out to all participants, inclu=
ding a few from this list: Catherine Daly, Diane di Prima, Gregory Severanc=
e, Matt Timmons, Amanda Earl and Gerald Schwartz. (I hope I did not miss an=
yone.) There were folks all over North America, in London, Iceland and the =
Netherlands. =0A=0AWe are going to continue this project on a more relaxed =
basis, a card a week, until next August, when we hope to have more particip=
ants ESPECIALLY from outside North America.=0A=0AHere's Lana's call for the=
 ongoing project:=0A=0A  Dear Poet, =0A   =0A  Thank you for your participa=
tion in this August Postcard Poetry Fest.  Your inspired participation made=
 this event the amazing success it was.  =0A   =0A  Share Your Experience=
=0A   =0A  Now that the last cards have come and gone, (we hope), we'd like=
 to invite you to share your thoughts about this process.  If=0Ayou'd like =
to write a paragraph or two about the experience, on writing=0Aor receiving=
 the cards, talk about your favorite cards, what you=0Anoticed about the fl=
ow form poem to poem, whatever moved you, that'd be=0Aquite welcome as we s=
eek to expand.  Please send your piece to Paul at splabman at yahoo dot com=
 or post it on the Postcard Fest blog http://www.poetrypostcards.blogspot.c=
om or on facebook http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=3D17361938720.  (Fa=
cebook=0Arequires registration and can be quite a habit).  If you post your=
=0Athoughts about the August Postcard Poetry Fest to your own blog or=0Aweb=
site, please send Paul the links and let us know if we can re-post=0Ayour t=
houghts elsewhere.=0A   =0A  Celebrate the Experience=0A   =0A  For those w=
ho are able to come to Seattle on September 22nd, we will have a celebratio=
n event at Caf=E9 Vega, 7pm at 1918 E. Yesler Way .  This event will be doc=
umented by Andre, the proprietor. If you aren't in the area, gather some fr=
iends and have a celebration of your own.  =0A     =0A  Continue the Experi=
ence=0A   =0A  So=0Amany of us were so taken with the process of writing th=
e cards daily,=0Athat we want to continue this organic connection of words =
on a regular=0Abasis, but at a more casual and meditative pace until next A=
ugust.  So we are now putting together a Perennial Poetry Postcard List.  T=
he idea here is simple, try to write a postcard poem at least once a week, =
and send it to the next person on your list.  Try to write a postcard poem =
at least once a week regardless of whether you receive one or not in order =
to keep the connections=0A flowing.  Remember you have a ready-made and exc=
ited audience awaiting your poems in the mailbox.  When you receive cards, =
do respond to them with cards of your own as well.  Move through the list o=
f names at your own pace and keep going until we reach August 2008.=0A   =
=0A  We will keep the list open and add names whenever someone expresses in=
terest, so you will need to add new people occasionally.  Please share your=
 experience with this process with friends and invite them to join us for t=
he perennial list.  We=0Ahope to make the list as long and broad as we poss=
ibly can. Then in=0AAugust, 2008, we'll go back full-throttle into the dail=
y August=0APostCard Poetry Fest.=0A   =0A  Please email Lana lana.ayers at =
yahoo dot com or Paul splabman at yahoo dot com to sign up for the perennia=
l list.  We'd appreciate it if you could reply by 9/22 so we can roll out t=
he new list and get those cards=0A started again.  And don't forget to forw=
ard this info to all your friends and have them join us too.=0A   =0A  Futu=
re Experiences=0A   =0A  We are planning a weekend of community joining and=
 workshops for September, 2008, on Orcas Island .  We hope you can join us =
and would welcome your effort to help plan/shape the event.  =0A   =0A  Tha=
nks again for your time, your dedication, your postcard poems that created =
this instant and vibrant community of words.  =0A   =0A  All best,=0A  Lana=

Apropos Robert Z's interest in texts that deliberately thwart performanc=
e, the research I know indicates that we subvocalize as we read, e.g. Ro=
bert Grenier's "I HATE SPEECH" inadvertently referencing pitch & volume =
of voice thru capitolization as icons of emphasis.  But reading obviousl=
y is visual as well, & as one develops expertise in reading, one develop=
s visual pathways to (verbal) memory that supercede auditory pathways, s=
o that reading often seems silent.  Further, printed texts (excluding te=
xts like Braile) are significantly visual in as much as they squiggle in=
 patterned ways, b versus d.

The point would be, Robert's categorization into three "other" nonperfor=
mative types of text seems supported by research.  Besides texts that ca=
n be performed, there are texts that are primarily visual.  Of those tex=
ts which can be performed, there are texts that deliberately frustrate a=
 performance & texts that are not especially interesting to perform, bec=
ause they focus on nonperformative (albeit auditory) features in a text.=
  Performance doesn't add much to what a reading achieves.

:-)  And it is also a process which can allow a child who is always being
told that he is is "not intelligent" to discover  the areas where he  in
fact has real gifts or a real passion.  Everybody is different, and not
everybody thrives best in a traditional school setting.

Keep in mind we also have kids in their 20s who visit &
stay here to be unschooled.

Where is "here", mIEKAL?

No, no one did. But she still had that flair for the dramatic when angry, or
could act it in real life, that is characteristic of divas and prima donnas.

from http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905555-3,00.html

"Even Beverly has her breaking point, however. Once, at a rehearsal in
Manhattan, a conductor reprimanded her: "Don't interrupt me when I'm
speaking to somebody else." Beverly said: "I'll go you one better. I won't sing
when you're conducting," and stomped offstage. During the preparations for
her La Scala appearance, she climaxed an argument with the wardrobe
mistress by snatching a pair of scissors and snipping a costume into pieces.
The onlooking cast and chorus burst into applause, an Italian tribute to a flare
of real temperament."

This is very different from the goofy self-effacement of the videos originally
posted, though. Sill's nickname in the opera world was "Bubbles" because she
was a genuinely nice person. But nice, too, is very different from that goofy
self-effacement of some of today's young women poets.

Sorry for being so cryptic. I esp. apologize if I offended anyone. If you wo=
uld like my reasons for writing what I did they are a result of my personal=20=
experiences which are not concepts but realities and you are free to backcha=
nnel me. In any event, there is always an assumption that we all have the sa=
me brains, capable of conceptualization--ie; the concept of "unschooling" is=
 totally impossible for certain brains to comprehend. and it is, in the end,=
 a concept. i, by the way, have tried every method of schooling possible (i,=
 in=C2=A0fact, could serve as a resource person for anyone searching for var=
ious methods of=C2=A0teaching)=C2=A0including homeschooling in terms of my o=
wn situation. My response is always to unexamined concepts, generalizations=20=
which are not examined in their totality. this is a poetics list so it is si=
lly for me to go further. people take positions--that is fine--but sometimes=
=C2=A0our personal=C2=A0situation is such that positions cannot be taken/ it=
 boils down, at times, to "what works"--bobbi

I have heard "diva" used pejoratively, but I don't particularly like
that use. I use it positively, for any great female singer, pop to
jazz to classical or other, from Joni Mitchell to Denyse Graves to
Betty Carter, etc. I might even use it for a great male singer,
although I know that would be an unexpected use. My daughter, it
appears, is going into either opera or some other form of classical
music singing, and I sometimes call her the "diva" of our family,
meaning it with some humor (she just turned 18 less than 2 months
ago) but also with love & respect.

The other thing that comes to mind with "Diva" is the movie with that
title. And what I remember most about that movie is the voice, singing.

Split This Rock Poetry Festival

CALL FOR PANEL DISCUSSION PROPOSALS



Split This Rock calls poets to a greater role in public life and
fosters a national community of activist poets. Building the audience
for poetry of provocation and witness from our home in the nation's
capital, we celebrate poetic diversity and the transformative power of
the imagination.



Split This Rock Poetry Festival: Poems of Provocation & Witness

March 20-23, 2008, Washington, DC



Split This Rock Poetry Festival will bring poets and writers to
Washington DC on the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, in the
midst of the presidential election. The festival will feature
readings, workshops, panel discussions, youth programming, film,
activism, and walking tours - opportunities to build community, hone
our activist skills, and celebrate the many ways that poetry can act
as an agent for social change. To read more about the festival, see
our website at: www.SplitThisRock.org.



In addition to featured readings by guest poets, Split this Rock
invites proposals for panel discussions and workshops on a range of
topics at the intersection of poetry and social change. Possibilities
are endless. Challenge us. Let's talk about craft, let's talk about
mentoring young poets, let's talk about working in prisons, connecting
with the activist community, sustaining ourselves in dark times, the
role of poetry in wartime. Let's remember great poet activists and
discover new, let's think international, visual, collaborative, out of
the box.



A panel may consist of 3-4 persons, with one person designated as
facilitator. Please title your panel and include brief biographical
information for each participant, along with a two paragraph
description of your panel=97what are the questions you wish to
explore=97why is this conversation timely and necessary at this time=97how

We have a strong interest in interactive conversation and community
building, so please indicate how you will involve participants in the
discussion.



Please note that panel presenters must register for Split This Rock
Poetry Festival. Some scholarships will be available. There is no
limit to the number of proposals you may send, but please be sure that
all proposed presenters have agreed to be part of your proposed panel.
Also, we are a small, mostly volunteer group, so please send only your

Robert,

I thought a lot about this. In fact, a poem I wrote in the mid nineties, "Io's
Song," is about that.

Unlike strictly concrete poetry, where the focus often is visual,
sculptural  -and not performative- a  space can be created on a page  where
the relationship among words suggest utterances, vectors which can not be
verbalized. I call this borderline space silence. Unlike the purely visual,
silence belongs to the left side of the spectrum of sound. It is full of,
pregnant with sound, a meditative, pre-coital state of verbal performance.
As a poet, my last fifteen years have been obsessed with how to
transform/project this silence as performance, without losing its element of
silence.

Ciao,

Murat

Bruce,

In all this analysis, a binary of choice is established, one abolishing the
other. What I am interested in is the simultaneity of these two
possibilities. That is what makes this relationship problematic in a very
provocative and fertile way. Barthes, in his essay "Loyola," talks about
this simultaneity -as the last step in Loyolan meditation- where the
reader/meditator has to make a jump (for Loyola into God). Jack Spicer is
talking about the same thing in his Vancouver Lectures.

Ciao,

Murat

Thanks for the link. Check out the article about Hannah Arendt.


September 07   We Ourselves Are to Blame: Hannah Arendt’s Jewish Writings  Zachary Braiterman

  Reviewed:
Hannah Arendt,
The Jewish Writings
Schocken Books, 2007

  In dark times such as our own, a flurry of publications attests to the abiding importance of Hannah Arendt as a great theorist of totalitarianism. Her recently published collection of essays, The Jewish Writings, will also cement her reputation as an unblinking critic of Zionism and the Jewish establishment, and a paragon of cosmopolitanism.
  Arendt was born in 1906 to an assimilated German Jewish family. She studied philosophy with the famed Martin Heidegger and wrote her dissertation under the direction of Karl Jaspers on the concept of love in the work of Augustine. With the Nazi rise to power, she fled to Paris where she worked with Jewish refugees. She escaped France in 1941 for New York, where she wrote for the weekly Aufbau, an émigré German Jewish paper. After the war, she worked with a number of Jewish organizations, such as Youth Aliyah and Schocken Books, under whose auspices she introduced the writings of her friend Walter Benjamin to English readers. She went on to teach at a number of American universities, including the New School for Social Research, until her death in 1975. Arendt’s most famous works are the Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), The Human Condition (1958), and Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963).
  Scholars will be happy finally to have in one volume an exhaustive collection of Arendt’s published and unpublished writings on Jews and Jewish politics. These writings cover the entire gamut of 20th Jewish political culture: the German Enlightenment and Emancipation, assimilation and anti-Semitism, and Zionism and the Holocaust. A reader inspired enough to plow through all five hundred pages of the collection will find that Arendt was consistent to the point of repetition.
  Those who want to read more judiciously might start in the 1940s and 1950s with the articles written for Aufbau. They might then proceed to the justly famous “The Jew as Pariah: A Hidden Tradition,” “Zionism Reconsidered”(an important first salvo against official Zionism), “The Jewish State,” “Peace or Armistice in the Near East,” and Arendt’s response to her critics after the publication of Eichmann in Jerusalem. Reflections by Arendt’s niece Edna Brocke, entitled “Big Hannah,” make for a genuinely touching afterward.
  A modern icon in her own right, Arendt’s oeuvre provides an ethical-political clarity for our own times, troubled as they are by the September 11th attacks, war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the struggle against terror, and the feeling felt by some of a creeping totalitarianism after years of monolithic Republican rule. The Jewish Writings speaks similarly to a grim contemporary Jewish scene – with no apparent exit from intifada or terrorism, occupation or siege, and new rounds of polemical bloodletting between intrepid critics of Israel and “the Jewish establishment.”
  The two main themes that animate Arendt’s larger body of work – the centrality of the political, understood as an active human connection focused on public life, and the imperative of individual freedom and responsibility, marked by a strong aversion to mass society and culture – appear also in her Jewish writings. These twinned themes both distinguish and distort her criticism of Zionism from the 1950s and, most controversially, her report on the 1961 Eichmann trial.
  In the articles written for Aufbau in the 1940s Arendt wrote insistently on the need to conduct the fight against Hitler under the auspices of a Jewish army. She complained bitterly about the British, who opposed the formation of such an army, arguing that, in doing so, the British sought to render the Jews silent and invisible. But she also faulted the Jews for failing to appear as a political entity. Taken together, the Aufbau articles present an early, inchoate formulation of “the space of appearance,” which Arendt later developed in her arguably most important work of political philosophy, The Human Condition. The space of appearance is a conception of the public space where things are allowed to be seen and heard, where “action” takes place in the unpredictable and open-ended public space of politics, and “the social” is denigrated as that ends-driven place of “work,” mediocrity, and conformism.
  An elitist, Arendt despised passivity on principle. In practice, this principled stance led to results that were often unbalanced, even early in her career as a writer and thinker. In not a few of the Jewish writings penned from the safety of Manhattan, Arendt spoke out against the Jewish instinct for “mere survival.” Death, she opined, “begins [its] reign of terror when life becomes the highest good.” This sentiment against “mere life” and “mere survival” is a curious thread repeating itself throughout the Aufbau articles (which are peppered with statements about the “readiness to kill,” the “readiness to die,” “dying on [one’s] knees” etc.). In her estimation, a Jewish army and armed Jewish resistance in the ghettos were the sole expressions of an active Jewish political will possible at the time.
  Unlike these heated appeals for a Jewish army, Arendt’s writings on Zionism were more sober overall. On one hand, she was not unimpressed by the Zionists’ willingness to fight. But first and foremost, she opposed “suicidal gestures.” Arendt saw the pre-state Yishuv and then the State of Israel threatened by the Nazi advance across North Africa under Rommel, and later by hostile Arab neighbors, whom the Zionists had done nothing to placate. Herzl was wrong. A Jewish State was vulnerable and could not protect the Jews from anti-Semitism. Against the game of Realpolitik, Arendt therefore opposed any and all attempts to cut deals with imperial powers, be they Turkish or British. Instead, she championed the cause of solidarity with other oppressed peoples, especially Arabs and progressive forces in Europe, in which she still placed great stock.
  Preoccupied by the problem of anti-Semitism, Arendt’s chief concern was that Zionist politics was isolationist, especially in its rejection of the Diaspora. In failing to create an all-inclusive Jewish organization, including Jews from Europe and the United States, and in failing to stand up for the Diaspora, the Zionists sabotaged their own movement. Instead of a Jewish state, Arendt supported a “homeland” in Palestine as a recognized zone of Jewish settlement, part of the British Commonwealth or some other European federative system. In her view, the only way to defeat anti-Semitism, a nationalist scourge, was by non-nationalist politics. Palestine, we see, was to be a part of Europe.
  Despite the underlying Eurocentrism of these thoughts, Arendt was an early critic of the inability of mainstream Zionism to see the competing Arab national claim to Palestine. It was on this basis that she objected to the push for a Jewish state at the 1942 Biltmore Conference and to the later proposal to partition Palestine into two separate states, one Jewish and one Arab. Arendt was in a minority, but hardly alone. However, unlike other Zionist critics of partition (Martin Buber, Gershom Scholem, other German Jewish members of the Ichud, as well the leftwing Hashomer Hatzair), Arendt rejected any reconciliation to the fait accompli of 1947-8.
  It might be said that Arendt was wrong about a lot of things. Was an Arab-Jewish agreement possible in Palestine prior to partition, and if so on what organized basis? Did Herzl lack a political understanding of anti-Semitism? Were the Zionists not right to give up on Europe in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (!)? At this time, were not the Jews surrounded by enemies? Was it the Zionists who broke solidarity with the peoples of Europe and not vice-versa? Was it possible to “combat” anti-Semitism? Did it not make sense to escape from Europe? To what practical purpose should a Jew have stayed to fight at this particular juncture? Did she herself not escape?
  While it might be true that Arendt was wrong about many things (and for all her antipathy to mainstream Zionism), it is too simple to say that she was an anti-Zionist. In their distress, Arendt never opposed mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and she always feared the worst for them (and very little, it seems, for the Arabs). For all its collaboration with the British, she rejected the contention that the Zionist settlement itself was a colonialist enterprise. Despite her critique of Labor Zionism, she believed in its human potential. In letters to Carl Jaspers and Mary McCarthy, Arendt was practically ga-ga about Israel’s victory in 1967 and expressed profound concern about the future of the State during the Yom Kippur War. On top of that, she despised the “spurious selflessness” of “Jewish radicals” who “furiously deny the existence of the Jewish people.” Like the poet Heinrich Heine, she was “not deceived by this nonsense of ‘world citizenship,’” which she called
 “an academic pipedream.” What Arendt understood perhaps better than her critics was that the Jewish people, in the Diaspora or in Israel/Palestine, cannot exist in isolation from each other and from non-Jews.
  At the fore in The Jewish Writings is stubborn dedication to principle. In the case of Zionism in the 1940s, she stuck to the principle of internationalism despite the failure of internationalism to stand up to the challenges posed by the Holocaust and by Arab opposition to Jewish settlement. Regarding the Holocaust, she upheld the principle of individual responsibility, even if this meant crossing the line to blame the victim. Arendt’s political judgments were always couched as absolute moral judgments.
  Arendt rejected the sentimental notion that the Jews were innocent victims of history. In her estimation, the identification of the Jews with the absolutist state in the 1700s was an important contributing factor to the formation of modern anti-Semitism; and she always held the Zionists up short for their failure to counter it effectively. In an Aufbau article, she argued against cooperating with the lesser evil. Writing early in the midst of World War II, she insisted that “the best English friends and the best armies in the world will not save us from this fate for which we ourselves are to blame.” The notion that Jews throughout history were historical actors in their own right and not merely victims is now a staple in contemporary Jewish Studies scholarship. But in turning this into a philosophical principle and applying it to the Holocaust, Arendt, we see, began to run up against rough ground.
  It was Eichmann in Jerusalem that brought upon Arendt’s head the fury of the Jewish community. As a correspondent for New Yorker magazine, Arendt covered the 1961 trial of Adolph Eichmann, who had been captured by the Israeli Mossad in Argentina and brought to stand trial in Jerusalem. In her insightful analysis, Eichmann, who engineered the deportation of the Jews to the ghettos and camps, appears as nothing more sadistically demonic than a bureaucrat beholden to clichés and stock phrases. The book was not about the Holocaust itself as much as it was about the individual and individual conscience and responsibility (hence her hostility to Ben-Gurion whom she accused of organizing a political circus). Arendt now sought to convey “the banality of evil,” reversing her position in The Origins of Totalitarianism affirming the existence of “radical evil,” where she wrote, “an absolute evil appears [absolute because it can no longer be deduced from humanely comprehensible
 motives].”
  While the phrase “banality of evil” was a subtle philosophical point little understood by her antagonists (they did not see how the human, non-monstrosity of the person Eichmann made him and his crimes all the more monstrous), her indictment of the Judenräte for co-responsibility in the Nazi genocide was crystal clear. That the leaders of the Jewish Councils cooperated with the Nazis in running the ghettos in Poland and organizing deportations was and remains a fact hard to digest. But Arendt did more than simply state facts, and it was disingenuous of her to suggest that this was all that was at stake in her reportage. More than simply stating facts, Arendt passed on her own normative judgment. In her view, the members of the Jewish Councils were not coerced to cooperate and could have always chosen, if not active resistance, than at least the possibility of doing nothing, of not cooperating (even if the historical record suggests otherwise).

 Unlike these heated appeals for a Jewish army, Arendt=E2=80=99s writings on=

ewish State was vulnerable and could not protect the Jews from anti-Semitism=
.=20
gainst the game of Realpolitik, Arendt therefore opposed any and all attempt=
s=20
o cut deals with imperial powers, be they Turkish or British. Instead, she=20
hampioned the cause of solidarity with other oppressed peoples, especially=20
rabs and progressive forces in Europe, in which she still placed great stock=
.=20
 Preoccupied by the problem of anti-Semitism, Arendt=E2=80=99s chief concern=
 was that=20
ionist politics was isolationist, especially in its rejection of the Diaspor=

n failing to create an all-inclusive Jewish organization, including Jews fro=
m=20
urope and the United States, and in failing to stand up for the Diaspora, th=
e=20
ionists sabotaged their own movement. Instead of a Jewish state, Arendt=20
upported a =E2=80=9Chomeland=E2=80=9D in Palestine as a recognized zone of J=
ewish settlement,=20
art of the British Commonwealth or some other European federative system. In=
=20
er view, the only way to defeat anti-Semitism, a nationalist scourge, was by=
=20
on-nationalist politics. Palestine, we see, was to be a part of Europe.=20
 Despite the underlying Eurocentrism of these thoughts, Arendt was an early=20
ritic of the inability of mainstream Zionism to see the competing Arab natio=
nal=20
laim to Palestine. It was on this basis that she objected to the push for a=20
ewish state at the 1942 Biltmore Conference and to the later proposal to=20
artition Palestine into two separate states, one Jewish and one Arab. Arendt=
=20
as in a minority, but hardly alone. However, unlike other Zionist critics of=
=20
artition (Martin Buber, Gershom Scholem, other German Jewish members of the=20
chud, as well the leftwing Hashomer Hatzair), Arendt rejected any=20
econciliation to the fait accompli of 1947-8.=20
 It might be said that Arendt was wrong about a lot of things. Was an=20
rab-Jewish agreement possible in Palestine prior to partition, and if so on=20

sm?=20

escape from Europe?=20
o what practical purpose should a Jew have stayed to fight at this particula=
r=20
uncture? Did she herself not escape?=20
 While it might be true that Arendt was wrong about many things (and for all=
=20
er antipathy to mainstream Zionism), it is too simple to say that she was an=
=20
nti-Zionist. In their distress, Arendt never opposed mass immigration of Jew=

=20
srael=E2=80=99s victory in 1967 and expressed profound concern about the fut=
ure of the=20
tate during the Yom Kippur War. On top of that, she despised the =E2=80=9Csp=

 At the fore in The Jewish Writings is stubborn dedication to principle. In=20=

ase of Zionism in the 1940s, she stuck to the principle of internationalism=20
espite the failure of internationalism to stand up to the challenges posed b=

 Arendt rejected the sentimental notion that the Jews were innocent victims=20=

istory. In her estimation, the identification of the Jews with the absolutis=
t=20
tate in the 1700s was an important contributing factor to the formation of=20
odern anti-Semitism; and she always held the Zionists up short for their=20

 It was Eichmann in Jerusalem that brought upon Arendt=E2=80=99s head the fu=

I think you're right, Murat, that I premised my analysis of the subject =
as one involving choices, & I probably did that because I built off the =
phrase, quote poetic texts that resist vocalization/performance, thinkin=
g of such texts as a particular kind & of that resistance as deliberatel=
y constructed.  Neither need be the case.  Further, I agree that there's=
 no need of setting the visual & verbal aspects into opposition, such th=
at choosing one abolishes the other.  That wasn't my intent.  Reading af=
ter all involves both visual & verbal processing, & it's the relation be=
tween the two that I was thinking about.  But are you saying that relati=
on (between the visual & verbal) in a poetic text is after all a problem=
 for performance?  In all cases?  This would seem closer to what Vernon =
is talking of.  Perhaps we can clarify how a text resists "vocalization/=
performance."

The voice has to become a hand sorting among the fragments...Also an
instrument breaking down and rebuilding itself in the presence of the
unsay-able...also a feast borne on the breath in the presence of
famine...the voice must also become a recuperative force in the sick
room of the spavined text.  I attempt this with the aural
reconstructions of Man's Wows (available on-line) with the result in my
beaten-up voice at Penn Sound.  Other experiments at UBU-web and most
recently www.Lichtensteiger.de.  Fuck silence.  Jess

these are works i've wanted to do for a long long time
wanting is always a removal

molecular atomic structures and consorts traveling across metallic plains
of unknown metals these plains
of unknown sounds beyond or beneath sounds these plains

shuddering in very low frequency radio couplings if one so desires
traveling metals and universes through universes
these universes momentarily harden and vibrate imperfect harmonies
or perhaps harmonies perfect in discordance harmonies after enlightenment

who could doubt the breathing of metal or water breathing of fire or air
who could doubt breathing of this or that area
or the breathing of those shallows or hills or sides of hills
the breathing of those areas of sloping hills
those areas somewhere among the shallows
or those breathings in concordance discordance

nothing setting into motion, no things motioning, nothing beckoning
i've wanted to do these for a long time, i prepared carefully
i prepared carefully, i did them, i don't want to do them any more

Poets, another story.

Born too soon, they are.

They think, even now, that there is any difference from their work being

From Jon Corelis:

 Dear Friends:


This email is to announce the completion and availability of my new
performance version in English of Euripides' Hippolytos.

This version is innovative in a number of ways.  Unlike most modern
versions of Greek plays, which tend to be either fairly literal
reading versions done by scholars or more creative performance
versions done by poets or playwrights, this is a version in verse
created for performance, by someone who is thoroughly familiar with
the original as a properly credentialed classicist, but who is also an
internationally published poet.  (My web site, listed at the end of
this email, gives a summary of this background.)  My script's relation
to Euripides' Greek text ranges from almost word for word translation
in some parts to very free recasting in others, and it employs various
levels of diction, some of which satisfy and others of which
deliberately thwart a modern audience's expectations of how people in
a Greek tragedy should talk.

Another innovation, which I believe is original with this version, is
that the choruses are in verse to be set to music taken from medieval
secular songs.  The current script only gives the names of these songs
(since I can't write musical notation myself), but these melodies are
all standard parts of the early music repertory and are available on
CD, as computerized files on the internet, or in scores in scholarly
music works or from specialist publishers.  I can refer prospective
performers to these sources; eventually as a result of working with a
performance group I hope to find someone who will be able to write
musical annotation which I can include with my text.

I'd be glad to hear from any drama group, whether professional,
semi-professional, amateur, or academic, who would like to perform
this new version.  (I'd only expect royalties if it were produced by a
troupe in a position to pay them; I'd willingly give permission gratis
for performance by an amateur or academic group that didn't charge
admission or charged it only to cover expenses.)  Interested parties
can contact me by any of the means indicated in the signature below.

The script is being housed on the internet on the Italian cultural web
site Fieralingue, which may most easily be accessed with the URL:
http://tinyurl.com/3cqhxk  (click on the Euripides' Hippolytos link
for the .pdf file).  There's also a link to it on my web site.
Alternatively, I'd be glad to send the script to interested persons
via email as a .pdf or as a MS-WORD .doc file, or via post in hard
copy or on a data CD.   I'd be most grateful if you'd forward this
email to anyone you think might be interested in it.  Thanks for
reading this.



                                                     Yours truly,


                                                     Jon Corelis

Hi Rob! & others...
=20
re text as a site of difficulty, wherein difficulty is
in fact be the vocalization/performance, I'd bring the visual poetry of=20
Mike Basinski into the mix, as
an example of poetry that, I dunno, feigns resitance? i.e. a
Basinski performance engages the signifier as a radically open site;
he treats reading even his own works as an act of interpretation &
vocalizes the difficulties and possibilities a text "yields." He reads
the texts as though he hasn't written them. The result
is, you might say, the difficulty of vocalization. I assume the Grenier
you have in mind are the "scrawl" poems; I wouldn't exclude their
engagement of the verbal - recalling the seeming glee that Grenier
exuded when he asked his audience to read these poems aloud
(this was at Buffalo 8 years ago or so?). While for Grenier these
may be visual poems, they foreground the act of verbal interpretation
for the reader. Although one might stare at them mutely and that
would be ok too.
=20
I've been thinking about performance & difficulty lately because of a =
student of mine, who's got
a great sense of poetry, a junior who's writing fantastic poems, and is
very intersted in performance, too (she writes multi-vocal performance
pieces). She's got a stutter, and I've been wanting to account for that =
as part of her poetic
material - without pathologizing it - how might she incorporate an =
awareness
of that, rather than glaze over it? I haven't been sure how to broach =
this with her.=20
The only analogue I could come up with so far is Aaron Williamson - but =
I don't think
she's interested in performing stutter or anything like that.  Any =
ideas?
=20
By the say, there's an excellent
essay on Basinski's work by Ric Royer that you might want to check out; =
it's in
a new zine edited by Justin Kato (a student of Bill Howe's & cris =
cheek's
at Miami University Ohio) - the zine's at my office right now but I'll
get you the reference if you're interested. It's a special performance
issue.

Bruce,

In all this analysis, a binary of choice is established, one abolishing =
the
other. What I am interested in is the simultaneity of these two
possibilities. That is what makes this relationship problematic in a =
very
provocative and fertile way. Barthes, in his essay "Loyola," talks about
this simultaneity -as the last step in Loyolan meditation- where the
reader/meditator has to make a jump (for Loyola into God). Jack Spicer =
is
talking about the same thing in his Vancouver Lectures.

Dear List Folks,

Would someone point me to a website where one enters text and receives a li=
st of the number of appearances of each word? I remember someone posting a =
link to a site like this about five or six years ago on the list, but I can=
't find it anymore. If there's no longer such a thing, does any one know ho=

Thanks,
Noah

I don't view visual, textual and musical elements as necessarily being in
opposition to one another. Each has its unique strengths and weaknesses. The
problem is how to make the elements work together. In some cases, they
dovetail. In others, they clash. The question, for me, personally, is how
to make them fit in ways that enhance the work. Sometimes the dovetail works
best, sometimes the clash. And there are many combinations in between.

Some works may be difficult to perform because their creators never intended
them as performance pieces. In this case, the relation of visual and verbal
material would appear most effectively on the page.

Speaking personally, as my works increasingly incorporate visual elements,
I think less frequently of them as performance pieces. But my musical
background makes me very aware of the musicality of the language I employ,
whether I intend to perform the piece or not.

Not all pieces can be performed. Sometimes one component will cancel the
other out in performance, while they hold up perfectly well on the page.
While reading, reciting or performing a poem might give it an extra boost of
energy, it might also limit the full realization of pieces with varied fonts

or parenthetical comments because the voice alone can't convey the nuances
in the material on  the page.

I think you're right, Murat, that I premised my analysis of the subject as
one involving choices, & I probably did that because I built off the phrase,
quote poetic texts that resist vocalization/performance, thinking of such
texts as a particular kind & of that resistance as deliberately constructed.
Neither need be the case.  Further, I agree that there's no need of setting
the visual & verbal aspects into opposition, such that choosing one
abolishes the other.  That wasn't my intent.  Reading after all involves
both visual & verbal processing, & it's the relation between the two that I
was thinking about.  But are you saying that relation (between the visual &
verbal) in a poetic text is after all a problem for performance?  In all
cases?  This would seem closer to what Vernon is talking of.  Perhaps we can
clarify how a text resists "vocalization/performance."

I tend to think of Performance as an economy I must submit to to support
the work I want to do.  I'm used to framing my performance of
alternative writing in the conservative & mainstream venues available in
my area in order to soften the reception. The work I perform--(various
liminal, procedural, a computer-assisted compositions)--I think of as
undermining Voice as that glamour commodity, that jewel I'm supposed to
horde as my creative writing Precious.  I don't think my situation is
unique.

Bruce,

Placement of words on a page create all sorts of directional (and
sequential) vectors. The most traditional and obvious of them is the line
formation where one starts (in English at least) from left to right. In suc=
h
a structures the reader knows what word follows what; therefore the tempora=
l
sequence is fixed. The varieties, flexibilities may occur on the pattern of
stressing certain words or the cadences among them, and also on the
relationship, which can be complex, of the line breaks to the horizontal
momentum of the line. This strict notational structure gives us performance
as traditionally one understands it.

If one begins to move words, centrifugally, away from this horizontal
structure, the certainty of this temporal sequencing becomes unstable. The
"reader/eye" can still see relationship among words, but the vectors are
multiple and often oppose each other. The reader must enter this space, to
some extent be frozen by this multiplicity, and make a choice of a specific
kind. This transforms the very idea of reading (both empowering and
paralyzing the reader) and creates a crisis of performance.

Since, in my view, such a verbal space maintains power to the extent that
words retain tangential relationships which arc across the "silent," empty
space, the poem becomes a tenuous (in that instability mystical) balance
between chaos (Poe's forces of rejection among objects in Eureka) and unity=
.
The reader (also the poem and the poet) focusing on that razor's edge is
going through a process quite similar to the last (10th?)  step in the
Loyolan meditation.

How can or may a reading starting in the non-linear motions of the eye be
performed verbally, that is to say, in real time. That is the crisis in
performance. I can have a few tentative answers. First, in such a
performance the utterance can only be a fragment (or a verbal gesture). The
performance progressing from fragment to fragment, in that way recreating
the space/silence between the fragments in real time. The instantaneity of
perception and the continuity of silence (of the unsaid) is unified.

Second, a given performance is unrepeatable. Since the relationship among
words is, must be unstable, potentially vectored in multiple ways, the
reader/performer each time must repeat the choice, following a different
path. It is this neutrality (what Barthes calls the absolute balance in the
equality of choice) which constitutes the crisis in performance, forcing on=
e
to envision performance in a completely new way. It makes such a visual poe=
m
a great tool for poetic exploration.

I was at Vernon's reading from "Improvizations" at The Poetry Project a few
years ago. My problem with it was that the shape of the performance was
pre-set, in no way reflection the sense of crisis I am talking about. They
remained "improvisations" in an abstract sense. For instance, if I remember
correctly, he had different people performing simultaneously columns of
texts appeared next to each other in the page. To me such a method short
circuits the element of crisis by eliminating the choice.

In "Io's Song" also, I have a number of poems, particularly "Baha-Mas in th=
e
Berkshires," where two columns run down simultaneously on the page. The
reader must constantly shift his or her eye from one to the other =96being
able to stop at one only a moment- because two different, conflicting
perceptions are simultaneously developed (one Ahab on his boat and the othe=
r
Melville in his room on his farm writing the novel). Splitting this
performance into two readers to me is unimaginable.

I gave two performances from Io's Song just when I wrote the poem in the
1990's. One was at the Poetry Project where the majority of the audience (m=
y
fans you might say) thought I had gone insane. The other was a recording of
some of the poems for CD-Rom issue of visual poetry which The Little
Magazine of University of Albany, edited by Chris Funkhauser and Belle
Gironde, which came out about the same time. These performances, which are
recorded, are full of hesitations, stutters of sounds, zigzagging verbal
riffs, false starts which, for that single moment, satisfactorily reproduce
for me, in performance, the texture of (including its space), one
possibility in, the visual text.

About two years later, after the publication of "A Blind Cat Black and
Orthodoxies," I tried to read at the Sun and Moon space in Los Angeles a fe=
w
pieces from "Io's Song." To my shock I found I couldn't. I could not
penetrate the space of the poems. It is at that reading I realized the
resistance, the pull towards silence, towards not to be performed, Io's Son=
g
=96and a poem like it- possess. In 2002 (?), during the writing of Eda, I g=
ave
a reading in San Francisco. I was solo, and Steve Dickison asked me to
perform up to two hours. I was running a fever that day. In my second hour,
I entered a mental space and read aloud Baha-Mas in the Berkshires, to my
satisfaction. It is my only performance of the poem and is recorded. (I tal=
k
about "resistance" in a specific kind of surface in my recent review of Bil=
l
Berkson's Sudden Address).

Since that "failed" performance at the Sun and Moon space, and my
realization of crisis, fragments from Io Song suddenly appear in the middle
of something I am writing, finding a place, a new life there. For instance,
in the Eda Anthology, the translation of k. Iskender's "souljam"
("canguncem") contains two fragments from "Io's Song" which enter the space
of Iskender's poem. In the same book, the section belonging to the poet
Seyhan Eroz=E7elik starts with a sketch (by the poet) of the multiple meani=
ngs
of a  Turkish neologism, "d=FCstanbul," contrasted in the opposite page by =
a
single performance of that sketch (its space) in English.

"Io's Song" was written simultaneously while I was writing "The Peripheral
Space of Photography" (Green Integer Press). The Peripheral Space ends with
a poem from Io's Song, "Formula for Organic Substances," which tries to
recreate what the photographer Man Ray does in his Rayographs. (I hope the
internet does not distort the shape of the arrangement of words on the
page.)

It's at
http://bobgrumman.com/FromHaikuToLyriku/index.html.

The book is about contemporary North American haiku
and related short poems.  I consider it a pretty good
survey of what's going on everywhere in contemporary
North American poetry, for it discusses short
specimens of such poetries as visual poetry and
language poetry as well as of conventional poetry.

Poets from whom I've stolen haiku and related poems
for inclusion in my book are in an index at the
webpage.

AND: I can take credit card orders.  I have a friend
who owns a bookstore, so if you send me your credit
card data, she will process it.

One temporary problem: I forgot to get padded
envelopes to mail the books out in.  So shipment of
books already ordered will be a little delayed.  (I'm
supposed to get a box of padded envelopes on Tuesday
from Staples.)

access the "Find" function. Then search for said word. The search results
should count the number of times that word appears.

Best of luck!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Murat, I appreciate your detailed response, & thoroughly enjoy the
clarification of how a poetic text might induce a crisis in performance.
It's an intriguing project.  My point is beginning to sound trivial in
retrospect.  But I'm not sure where I've mis-spoken, for what you
describe fits Robert's first category, a text which has features that
make it difficult to vocalize, & it was produced intentionally for that
purpose.  Mary Higgins, incidentally, spoke to the same issue in our
interview in February, tho she was chiefly interested in a text that
proliferates possible readings, not resists vocalization.  I obviously
can't speak for Basinski, but it sounds like he also constructs texts
that allow for a proliferation of performances.  Are they difficult to
produce?  (I confess, I'm one for whom performing poetry is crisis
enough.)

Vernon, you seem to agree with my point, inasmuch as the visual need not
be opposed to the verbal.  In fact, you don't seem to be producing texts
that resist vocalization, so much as texts that simply can't be totally
verbal, as when you mention they now include more nonperformative
(visual) material.  This fits into Robert's category of texts engaged
with the visual, tho not to the exclusion of other concerns.

Recall my contention was simply that Robert's three categories were
supported by what little research I've read, & they are formally concise.
 But here's a follow up question:   Because a text is made difficult to
perform, even to the extent of creating a crisis in performance, what
effect does it intend for its audience?  E.g., is it intended to produce
a crisis in reception as well?

Hi there, it's me, Kevin Killian, playing press agent again!  I just
came back from a really good show here in San Francisco and I want to
urge my readers to go and see it.  It's part of the San Francisco
Fringe Festival and it's performed by the Prince Myshkins, a theater
troupe from Madison, Wisconsin, and SF has three more chances to see
it.

The play is really two plays in one, "Great Hymn of Thanksgiving" and
then, without a break, there's one called "Conversation Storm," like
Operation Desert Storm I guess, mixed with a little of My Dinner with
Andre.  The Prince Myshkins I sort of knew, for I had met one of
them, the poet Rick Burkhardt, down in San Diego when he was a
student of Rae Armantrout's--now he's a Ph.D and very august.  Then
there is Andy Gricevich, who I have met more recently, also a
poet--the two of them both crazy talented and very much into the same
sorts of things that occupy my mind, one of them being how to turn
avant-garde energies into agitprop artwork, especially at this time
of peril in our republic.  Well, I don't know how to do it, --but
they do.  There's a third fellow in the troupe who is really cute,
sort of a cute version of oh, Vincent D'Onofrio and/or Joss Whedon,
maybe a little Ryan Reynolds, in other words, he will make a fanboy
out of you believe me.  His name is Ryan Higgins and he is apparently
an ac tor and a musician according to the program, but I say, file
him under: revelation.

"Great Hymn on Thanksgiving" is the more ostensibly "artsy" of the
two playlets, the three man gather around a family dinner table and
eat with exaggerated movements of their knives and forks, eating
invisible food and muttering murky syllables into the business end of
cowbells, which cover their mouths like bedpans.  Little by little
the repetitive scrape of a knife across a china plate, the movement
of a spoon across a tablecloth, a finger around the rim of a water
glass, turns into a symphony of Spike Jones like sounds.  It's like
something out of those old leaked Beach Boys  "Smile" sessions.
They're also drumming the table like toddlers and playing or banging
diverse toy instruments: a toy piano for Ryan, a toy steel drum for
Rick, while Andy plows a violin bow across an old time zither or
autoharp.  The program notes that the muttered sounds come from,
among other sources, the poems of Rae Armantrout.  No!  Yes!  No!  I
didn't hear any, but there were so many things to hear, and all of
the actors pretty deadpan, like Ish Kabibble in the old Kay Kyser RKO
musicals.

In "Conversation Storm" the subject becomes more obviously about
torture as two men, old high school antagonists, meet up 20 years
later with still the same subject positions (liberal vs.
conservative) but with a new openness to torture that has removed it
from secrecy, and now it's open US defense policy thanks to TV shows
like 24 and thanks to the so called "torture memo" from the US
Attorney General's office authored in summer 2002 by Bybee and Woo,
both of them pilloried in "Conversation Storm."  Gricevich plays
several parts, a bored waiter trying to 86 the argusome pair, and a
third classmate who remembers his high school days as an era of
unchecked masturbation.  The back and forth between Higgins and
Burkhardt has to be seen to be believed, or maybe you could hear it
on the BBC radio channel, for they have mastered the art of sarcastic
and haunting timing.  It was like, do you remember Nichols and May?
This was like, Nichols, Nichols, and more Nichols.  If you can
possibly see any of their remaining performances you will be seared
like ahi tuna.  I give the show my highest rating: go, go, go!  (And
so cheap, under ten dollars.  The only drawback: not enough nudity.)

dad

in 1940 this was my dad's last chance at happiness. the glacier was still
there. he used a kodak 620 camera and the colour was beautiful. it's
always sad when the image fades, you have to use your imagination, just
what it was like. and you try to imagine what the sounds were, so you
think it might have been cool out and there might have been a slight
breeze. you can't remember what he told you about the season and how it
was with the war on, france was just over the horizon. he said you could
see the matterhorn. i don't know where he was going, i can't imagine how
he got out of there and he never talked about it. he said it was silent up
there and you could forget everything else in the world and the sky was
clear, not a plane in sight. i don't know what he did when he got off the
wall. i think he might have walked to one side or another, playing with
the depth of the world which descended farther than any of us could
imagine. we weren't alive then. he managed to make it out, that's hardly a
smile on his face and in later years he never smiled. never. was that a
minox he was holding. there wasn't a person in sight. he looks almost
blind. i found this stuff somewhere in the attic. he'd dragged a trunk up
after the flood and most of the stuff in it was alright. the trunk had to
be thrown out. there were photos drying everywhere.

    A friend notified me today that at the Blog of Silliman is a
featured link to the analysis of "The Grand Piano de Parole in
Liberace" in a presentation of Il Maestro G. A. Vidiamodopo.
http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2007/07/its-accessories-necessaries-considered.html

     As a colleague of Il Maestro in Eternal network of Fluxus Street
Theater d' Il Maestro G. Maciunas I duly passed along the news to
Maestro Vidiamadopo, who in turn sent to me a reply, concerning a
perhaps misreading of his analysis of the "Corrective" Collective
Autobiography as Il Maestro amuses himself by referring to it in the
here and there moments in which he does.
      Here the relevant part of the letter to me which Il Maestro
would like me to share with you, esteemed Colleagues, Brothers and
Sisters in the Anarekeyological Actions of Eternal Heraclitean Flux.

        "Estimado, El Colonel de Securidad Nacional, Sector
"Languagismo" R. Silliman :

         Thank you for the honor bestowed of the selection of my
humble paper for the readership of your often cited Blog, home I hear
to the formation of opinion and shaping of  taste with in the
august parlance of baseball fans such as myself, "Friendly Confines"
of the  storied laurel vine covered Walls of the stadium of the Grand
Piano of the Collective of the Corrective Autobiography.
        It is with many happinesses I find myself among such an
assemblage of the luminaries, eminences grises and laureati of the
laurels of the Lyric Art.
        I need however to call attention  to one shortcoming in the
formulation of the indication of the existence of my examination of
the Grand Piano di Parole in Liberace.
      This is the use of the words "A Literal Interpretation of the
Grand Piano" which must be touched cyber-style to be linked to my
presentation.
        Perhaps you have knowledge in the form of the reading of his
works of the poet Jean-Nicholas Arthur Rimbaud?  Whether yes or not,
this poet well beloved to the hearts of millions across the spheres of
Poesia, this poet in regards to a question as to the meanings of his
works famously replied:

        "They mean what they say, literally and in every sense."

         Therefore, rather than confining the illustrious readership
of the blog to  the very
narrow "literal" reading which alone could produce the sense that my
piece is a "literal interpretation" alone--the repeition of this word
is in order to underline my need to overcome its loneliness--I want to
point out that my interpretion is like that propounded by the
well-beloved Rimbaud.
          In other word, my interpretation is "literal AND IN EVERY SENSE."
          That is, it is to be understood in a far more vast "realms
of the senses," to play on the title of a film by the Maestro Oshima.
          The examination  is in each and every word opening into ever
more areas of the senses in all their senses.
       I hope that via these senses the deeper sense of my words may
begin to "make sense" to the readers and yourself of the simultaneous
"amplifying" and "chiseling"  of my critique which in its employ of
these  methods of the Isouian conception of Lettriste literary
historical periodicity is essaying a far more complex and wide ranging
presentation than that kept narrowly confined within the heretofore
alluded to  "Friendly Confines" of a method which can see only that
which is of its own necessity  limited to define as a  "literal"
"interpretation." that which in fact is not so narrowly confined at
all.
             To use a street inflection from the repertoire of the
milieu of the Fluxus Street Theater, El Colonel, in my work I "don't
play that," that being the "literal," for as noted, I am dealing in
the full throated and bodied  Rimbaldien expression of the "Literal &
In Every Sense" according to the "long reasoned derangement of the
senses" for in the end to "reach the Unknown."
             For its from this Unknown that the positions of the known
may be examined in the methods and manner which I have employed and so
have indeed reached from this Unknown an understanding of the known
which I have presented in my  generous assesment of the Grand Piano di
Parole Liberace's achievement, which perhaps you may have missed in a
misreading of my examination as existing solely within the "Freindly
Confines" of your own "literal" reading of that which is not confined
to the literal alone.
       Here is the simple conclusion which was reached by the
employment of my methodology, drawing on the teachings and examples of
a great many brilliant predeccessors and colleagues of the present
moment:



Only the finest cabinets are used in the preservation of the
documents, archives, recordings and files of the Grand Piano--

for in preservation in its purest state lies posterity in state--

in archival preservation lies the Grand Piano salvation of the
materialist word--

In sum, my friends and colleagues, by surveying in a
review-examination the cultural-materialist construction for the
presentation and maintenance of the "Grand Piano", one has developed
an awareness of the targeted directions of its discourses, its
performative aspects, as well as its "in-dwellings" as it were.

I think it is safe to say--for in my position I must take into
consideration above all your security--I think it is safe to say that
the object here considered for review-examination is one easily
commanding entry into the data-zones of citation, bibliography and
notes, while also sure to generate further examinations of its
modifications of previously existing versions of the already existing
files under which this particular "Grand Piano" has already been filed
many times over. I find it safe to presume that its revisionings and
revisionisms of extant files will
be of at least a minor interest to those engaged in the minutiae of
this particular trope of a narrowly conceived discursive presentation.

      Here it is shown that even with the most "literal" readings from
within the "Freindly Confines" that the "interpretation" is not at all
limited to the "literal" but indeed has been embracing of the "LiTERAL
AND IN EVERY SENSE" and does indeed present a commentary-conclusion
reached by this widely-arrayed Anarkeyological examinition of the
presented materials.

In Parole Seimpre in Liberace,
G. A. Vidiamodopo

  Thanking you again for the great honor to be included among the
highlighted links to the various galaxies constellated in your
assemblage for this day.

"This is the voice of the Global Corporation. You are now being
admitted into the labour camp where you will spend the rest of your
days. You will suffer what you will suffer, without recourse, without
mercy. You are a criminal of the state. And you will pay the ultimate
penalty for your acts of subversion. Perpare yourselves for the
sentence you have been awaiting. It is beginning now--everything is
nothing, and nothing is everything. You will be assigned the following
GC identification numbers. You do not need to memorize them. The GC is
memorizing you. You will never be free again--"

 You begin to sense the byshadows that stretch from the awe of global
 dominance. How the intersecting systems help pull us apart, leaving
 us vague, drained, docile, soft in our inner discourse, willing to be
 shaped, to be overwhelmed -- easy retreats, half beliefs. Works of art
 are complex formal interventions within discursive traditions and their
 myriad filiations. These interventions are defined precisely by their
 incomparable capacity to trace the dynamics of historical process in
 paradoxical gestures of simultaneously prognostic and mnemonic
 temporalities.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from { brad
brace }. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history. This
discourse, far from determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding
the ground on which it could find support. It is trying to operate a
decentering that leaves no privilege to any center.

  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present
of the Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

~ This interminable, relentless (online) sequence of imagery began in
earnest on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been
over twenty-five years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for many years` worth of
12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour image
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

 	 The image was to make nothing visible but their connection with
 	 one another by space and air, yet each surrounded by the unique
 	 aura that disengages every deeply seen image from the world of
 	 irrelevant relationships and calls forth a tremor of
 	 astonishment at its fateful necessity. Thus from artworks of
 	 dead masters, over-life-size strangeness whose names we do not
 	 know and do not wish to know, look out at us enigmatically as
 	 symbols of all being.

 Big Grey Bricks: This project also serves as a rehearsal for its
 culmination as a series of offset-printed volumes: each 800+ full-bleed
 pages (5x8"_300lpi), where the full integrated rhythm of
 greyscale-sequence can be more intricately resolved. I'd provide all
 design, prepress and production.

This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some
opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet duotones
or extended-black quadtones. Other supporters receive rare copies of the
first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books. Contributions and requests for
12hr-email-subscriptions, can also be made at
http://bbrace.laughingsquid.net/buy-into.html, or by mailed cheque/check:
$5/mo $50/yr. Art-institutions must pay for any images retained longer
than 12 hours.

If you've figured out a way to fuck silence, let me know.  I'd love to try it.  Otherwise, please refer to John Cage, sadly deceased a long time now.  I haven't read Jesse's original post yet, though, so who knows?

for the Word Hoard in 2d&I, I played around with a lot of concordance
freeware, and linguistics word counting things, but found it easier to
just write a macro set (but I had a really long text that the freeware
couldn't handle)

this is a page of links to freewares, including the one Jilly posted
http://www.teaching-english-in-japan.net/directory/cat/86

the one I used isn't a top google hit anymore.  well, it HAS been a few yea=
rs.

just insert a paragraph mark everywhere there's a space, select all,
sort, apply autonumber, then convert the field to hard numbers?
although then you have to weed it out

THE PROGRAM @ FIREHOUSE 13
presents
poetry & noise music performances by

- Chi Fu (UK)
- The Pretty Panicks (NYC)
- Ryan Dobran (NYC)

8pm Tuesday September 11th

@ FIREHOUSE 13
41 Central Street, Providence

free food / cash bar

http://plantarchy.us/the-program/

THE PROGRAM @ Firehouse 13 is a new monthly series featuring multimedia
performances by poets from the US and abroad. The series is organized by
individuals taking part in Brown University's electronic writing community,
and sponsored by the poetry publisher Critical Documents. Firehouse 13 is a
gallery space and artists' residency located in south Providence, dedicated
to sheltering exciting, innovative and contemporary creative works. THE
PROGRAM's opening night features performances by Chi Fu, The Pretty Panicks=
,
& Ryan Dobran, who will experiment with the boundaries between poetry and
music performance.

BIOS

Chi Fu honed his shaolin style in the UK under the collective jive
minaret of Jabba the Prynne and Kessie "Lard" Akinfemiwa. Representing
the international avant-retard at junior level, he currently lives,
writes and smokes five packs a day in Ryan Dobran's kitchen underneath
the extractor fan.

The Pretty Panicks - sara wintz is lead singer of the pretty panicks press,
a small press printing and making rock n roll music, wires and hair strands
procedures in NYC. <myspace.com/prettypanicks>

Ryan Dobran LIFECOACHes out of Brooklyn, where he edits said peculiar
rag, culling late clips of commercial paranoia, spicy d=E9tournement,
and philosophical reflexions from exclusive sectors.  He plans to
avenge the "Lard"/Crusoe violation of October 2006 via a series of
organ donations and Radical Passivity brochures.

Linda -- great to hear from you.  I was hoping you'd chime in.  Thanks,
too, to everyone else.  Linda's correct; the Grenier we were talking
about was the "scrawl" poems -- partly because I remember the same
incident Linda describes.  One of the things these poems bring out, as
others have mentioned, is that performance is embedded within language.
Even the most visual of poems engage with the vocalization we will give
to them in reading.  Which is why, I suppose, we always come back to
talking about visual and acoustic as two vectors that are active in
pretty much any poem, to greater or lesser degrees.

My music colleague was wondering about this from the practical level of
performance.  For instance, we talked a lot about the treatment of the
text in Shadowtime (about which I'm also writing right now), the way
that Ferneyhough so stylizes, elongates, and layers Bernstein's libretto
that the text becomes unintelligible.  For a performer (I'm told), this
makes the opera very difficult to sing.  For the listener, one of the
more interesting effects (I find) is that it is somehow still very
important that we identify these voices as human voices making these
sounds -- I'm reminded of Don Cherry on "teo-teo can," for instance, or
Nate Mackey's poem written in response to it.  Though the sounds seem to
be non-semantic, this seems to only heighten their affect (which also
reminds me of Schoenberg's Erwartung).

One way we were thinking about this was in relation to Ferneyhough's
piece Bone Alphabet, which is written for solo percussion.  The piece
does not assign specific instruments, though it characterizes the types
of sounds they should make.  But, what's perhaps most interesting is
that Ferneyhough wrote the piece after studying the way a percussionist
friend of his plays.  He wrote the piece so as to work against his
friend's habits, thus defamiliarizing his process of playing and
reintroducing his body into the performance -- Ferneyhough's argument
being that as performers perfect their skills, they necessarily take the
"bodiness" of their bodies for granted.

So, what poems, poetic gestures, poetic techniques, etc. might be
analogous to Ferneyhough's writing against the performer's grain?  In
lyric, for instance, I'm tempted to say...pretty much everything that
makes it lyric.  Everything that makes lyric "performative" (to use very
loosely a term that is already flabby), is what differentiates it from
the usual flow of language.  As concrete poetry raises the stakes on
visuality, it is the remainder of the voice in the language....

Finally, Linda -- please do send along the 'zine info you mention.  It
sounds terrific.

Cheers,
Robert

Hi Rob! & others...
=20
re text as a site of difficulty, wherein difficulty is
in fact be the vocalization/performance, I'd bring the visual poetry of=20
Mike Basinski into the mix, as
an example of poetry that, I dunno, feigns resitance? i.e. a
Basinski performance engages the signifier as a radically open site;
he treats reading even his own works as an act of interpretation &
vocalizes the difficulties and possibilities a text "yields." He reads
the texts as though he hasn't written them. The result
is, you might say, the difficulty of vocalization. I assume the Grenier
you have in mind are the "scrawl" poems; I wouldn't exclude their
engagement of the verbal - recalling the seeming glee that Grenier
exuded when he asked his audience to read these poems aloud
(this was at Buffalo 8 years ago or so?). While for Grenier these
may be visual poems, they foreground the act of verbal interpretation
for the reader. Although one might stare at them mutely and that
would be ok too.
=20
I've been thinking about performance & difficulty lately because of a
student of mine, who's got
a great sense of poetry, a junior who's writing fantastic poems, and is
very intersted in performance, too (she writes multi-vocal performance
pieces). She's got a stutter, and I've been wanting to account for that
as part of her poetic
material - without pathologizing it - how might she incorporate an
awareness
of that, rather than glaze over it? I haven't been sure how to broach
this with her.=20
The only analogue I could come up with so far is Aaron Williamson - but
I don't think
she's interested in performing stutter or anything like that.  Any
ideas?
=20
By the say, there's an excellent
essay on Basinski's work by Ric Royer that you might want to check out;
it's in
a new zine edited by Justin Kato (a student of Bill Howe's & cris
cheek's
at Miami University Ohio) - the zine's at my office right now but I'll
get you the reference if you're interested. It's a special performance
issue.

Bruce,

In all this analysis, a binary of choice is established, one abolishing
the
other. What I am interested in is the simultaneity of these two
possibilities. That is what makes this relationship problematic in a
very
provocative and fertile way. Barthes, in his essay "Loyola," talks about
this simultaneity -as the last step in Loyolan meditation- where the
reader/meditator has to make a jump (for Loyola into God). Jack Spicer
is
talking about the same thing in his Vancouver Lectures.

Ciao,

It's interesting how the list of responses is now label'd an
"archive-in-process" and how it now "aggregates responses and reviews
selected by one or more of THE GRAND PIANO authors." The key word is
"selected," innocuous enough until one realizes that some less than

This may interest some on the list:

The Department of English at the University of Albany invites
applications for a tenure-track position in creative writing and
literature at the rank of Assistant professor, to begin August 2008. We
seek a poet interested in working in an active undergraduate literature
and writing program, and in a graduate program leading to an M.A. and a
doctorate that can include creative writing.  The candidate is also
expected to make substantial contributions to the creation and editing
of a new literary magazine (with both online and print elements).
Candidates with additional teaching interests in contemporary U.S.
ethnic literatures and/or world literatures are especially welcome, as
are those who can teach in genres other than poetry (fiction, creative
nonfiction, drama). Candidates should possess a Ph.D. from a university
accredited by the U.S. Department of Education internationally
recognized accrediting organization, although an appropriate advanced
degree and evidence of substantial professional experience and
achievement in creative writing may substitute for the Ph.D.  Evidence
of successful teaching and significant scholarly potential is expected.
Candidates should also have a demonstrated ability to work with and
instruct a culturally diverse group of people.  Send letter of
application, c.v., dossier of letters of reference, and a writing sample
of no more than 30 pages, postmarked by November 9, 2007 to Pierre
Joris, Chair, Search Committee, English Department, HU 333, University
at Albany, 1400 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY   12222.  The University
at Albany is an EO/AA/IRCA/ADA employer.

Note:

Milwaukee is the sister city of Carora, Venezuela, and as the Ambassador no=
tes below, Wisconsin is Venezuela's 11th largest trading partner.

Milwaukee has become one of the highest poverty rate cities in the USA, amo=
ng the highest in violence and a perennial leader in teen pregnancies. Wisc=
onsin continues to lose or have return seriously wounded and psychologicall=
y disturbed a high rate of its residents due to the Wars in Iraq and Afghan=

A sign of the changing times in the Americas is that Venezuaela and Milwauk=

e United States, despite the huge number of campaign appearances here by Pr=
esident Bush during and since the 2000 "election," has done very little at =
all for the city.=20

What makes a performance meaningful is our decision and subsequent
reconstruction of it as meaningful?  Music is meaningful because of the
recognition of pattern--or a construction/projection of pattern after
the fact.  An illusion of--or decision for--meaning in the recognition
of a human voice, regardless of the sounds it's making?  The context
gives it its meaning, tells us it must be poetry, or a gesture against
"poetry?" Silliman talks about this in an early essay.  So does
Hejinian: context makes meaning.
=20
There's something in __Writing Degree Zero__ about any cosmic event
being meaningful if a human decides it is.  Hale Bopp is meaningful,
thus suicide, or the suicide. . .And we see human faces on Mars, or we
project theoretical frames on performances.  But all of this is too much
based on a reader/auditor reception which makes this too
convention-based.  Too much of that in art, yes?

Maybe the artist decides on the meaning of a performance before it
happens? No.  No meaning in a vacuum.  No solitary meanings springing
fully grown from the heads of geniuses.  And we don't have time for--and
don't want-- masterpieces, given the pace of digital environments.  It's
all pleasure and suggestion for the next production.=20

Subject: Re: Voice and the Performance of Poetry

Linda -- great to hear from you.  I was hoping you'd chime in.  Thanks,
too, to everyone else.  Linda's correct; the Grenier we were talking
about was the "scrawl" poems -- partly because I remember the same
incident Linda describes.  One of the things these poems bring out, as
others have mentioned, is that performance is embedded within language.
Even the most visual of poems engage with the vocalization we will give
to them in reading.  Which is why, I suppose, we always come back to
talking about visual and acoustic as two vectors that are active in
pretty much any poem, to greater or lesser degrees.

My music colleague was wondering about this from the practical level of
performance.  For instance, we talked a lot about the treatment of the
text in Shadowtime (about which I'm also writing right now), the way
that Ferneyhough so stylizes, elongates, and layers Bernstein's libretto
that the text becomes unintelligible.  For a performer (I'm told), this
makes the opera very difficult to sing.  For the listener, one of the
more interesting effects (I find) is that it is somehow still very
important that we identify these voices as human voices making these
sounds -- I'm reminded of Don Cherry on "teo-teo can," for instance, or
Nate Mackey's poem written in response to it.  Though the sounds seem to
be non-semantic, this seems to only heighten their affect (which also
reminds me of Schoenberg's Erwartung).

One way we were thinking about this was in relation to Ferneyhough's
piece Bone Alphabet, which is written for solo percussion.  The piece
does not assign specific instruments, though it characterizes the types
of sounds they should make.  But, what's perhaps most interesting is
that Ferneyhough wrote the piece after studying the way a percussionist
friend of his plays.  He wrote the piece so as to work against his
friend's habits, thus defamiliarizing his process of playing and
reintroducing his body into the performance -- Ferneyhough's argument
being that as performers perfect their skills, they necessarily take the
"bodiness" of their bodies for granted.

So, what poems, poetic gestures, poetic techniques, etc. might be
analogous to Ferneyhough's writing against the performer's grain?  In
lyric, for instance, I'm tempted to say...pretty much everything that
makes it lyric.  Everything that makes lyric "performative" (to use very
loosely a term that is already flabby), is what differentiates it from
the usual flow of language.  As concrete poetry raises the stakes on
visuality, it is the remainder of the voice in the language....

Finally, Linda -- please do send along the 'zine info you mention.  It
sounds terrific.

Cheers,
Robert

Hi Rob! & others...
=20
re text as a site of difficulty, wherein difficulty is
in fact be the vocalization/performance, I'd bring the visual poetry of=20
Mike Basinski into the mix, as
an example of poetry that, I dunno, feigns resitance? i.e. a
Basinski performance engages the signifier as a radically open site;
he treats reading even his own works as an act of interpretation &
vocalizes the difficulties and possibilities a text "yields." He reads
the texts as though he hasn't written them. The result
is, you might say, the difficulty of vocalization. I assume the Grenier
you have in mind are the "scrawl" poems; I wouldn't exclude their
engagement of the verbal - recalling the seeming glee that Grenier
exuded when he asked his audience to read these poems aloud
(this was at Buffalo 8 years ago or so?). While for Grenier these
may be visual poems, they foreground the act of verbal interpretation
for the reader. Although one might stare at them mutely and that
would be ok too.
=20
I've been thinking about performance & difficulty lately because of a
student of mine, who's got
a great sense of poetry, a junior who's writing fantastic poems, and is
very intersted in performance, too (she writes multi-vocal performance
pieces). She's got a stutter, and I've been wanting to account for that
as part of her poetic
material - without pathologizing it - how might she incorporate an
awareness
of that, rather than glaze over it? I haven't been sure how to broach
this with her.=20
The only analogue I could come up with so far is Aaron Williamson - but
I don't think
she's interested in performing stutter or anything like that.  Any
ideas?
=20
By the say, there's an excellent
essay on Basinski's work by Ric Royer that you might want to check out;
it's in
a new zine edited by Justin Kato (a student of Bill Howe's & cris
cheek's
at Miami University Ohio) - the zine's at my office right now but I'll
get you the reference if you're interested. It's a special performance
issue.

Bruce,

In all this analysis, a binary of choice is established, one abolishing
the
other. What I am interested in is the simultaneity of these two
possibilities. That is what makes this relationship problematic in a
very
provocative and fertile way. Barthes, in his essay "Loyola," talks about
this simultaneity -as the last step in Loyolan meditation- where the
reader/meditator has to make a jump (for Loyola into God). Jack Spicer
is
talking about the same thing in his Vancouver Lectures.

Ciao,

      I've found this discussion very interesting and to some degree
curious.  The Visual Poet Matthew Stolte was In Milwaukee this weekend
and we were able to meet for two very stimulating discussions.  Among
the topices was just this question, though slightly different in
formulation and area of in gress.
       Matthew asked me if a Visual Poem can exist which does not have
any words or even letters. (Geof Huth also asked me this when we met.)
       For myself, a visual/tactile poem does not need any lexical
ingredients whatsoever, let alone a score confined to the page.
       Zukofsky wrote of "Upper limit music, lower limit speech."
This is a very limited range with which to work, both sonically and in
terms of a "score/text."
       I think the range of poetry is that of the human ear and its
abilities to listen to and hear beyond its ear capabilities with the
use of a great variety of very simple to very sophisticated  technical
means.
       Rather than Zukofsky's formulation one has then a spectrum
extending from near "silence"--(for the human ear doesn't completely
"hear silence"--though it may SilEncE)--to Noise.
        White Noise in a sense may be thought of as a paradoxical form
of this "near sielnce" in that ir the noise in which it cannot be
distinguished a "clear message" becomes a form of "unutterable,
unbearble" "silence" in terms of "information".  At a certain level,
the Noise and the "Silence" converge--and become as though "mirror
images" of each other.  The steady state of Noise becomes a form of
"silence" and the steady state of "Silence" becomes Noise depending on
how the listener "feels about it" or is aware of it.   ("The position
of the observer/listener" and the "observing/listening" in themselves
can oscillate between and among these terms, or simply exchange
them--)
         Bob Cobbing was the first Visual/Sound Poet to make Visual
Poems without any evidences of letters, words at all--as well as
extending the Visual/Sound Poem into the realms of the haptic by using
the touching of objects, surfaces as things to be sounded.  He also
experimented widely with the uses of the tape recorder, in ways
similar to and also very different from for example Henri Chopin, one
of the first great avatars of the uses of tape for extending sonic
ranges beyond those limiting ones of the sole dependence on the
lexical.  The tape recorder not only extends sound in its ranges, but
also in Time.   Durations become another elements which may be
ollaged, cut up, "amplified," and "chiselled" to use Isidore Isou's
terminology, though pushing past Isou's conceptions of the Lettriste
score.
           When i met Bob Cobbing ten years ago I didn't know of the
historical existence of these practices, but  had been working along
banging about in the alley ways of this area for  many years.  How to
present to/for/with  others the ways one sees/hears/touches things
simultaneously and then to work with shaping these simultaneities in
such ways as one can, to  begin to arrange them, moving among their
interrelationships, synesthesias, overlaps.  Meeting Bob and seeing
huge panels of his was the moment of a "shock of recognition," in
which one finds suddenly that one is not alone in this  at all, but
there are others who experience, think, see, touch this and essay
working with it as others do with the various elements elements of
more familiarly known media.
         Walking down streets sounding sidewalk cracks, sounding the
movements of tree shadows on pavements, sounding the blotches and
blurs, smudges, patternings of light and shade, the touch of a door
knob, the feel of the dirty linoleum flooring, the rust welts on
collapsing metals, splits in the seams of paint on battered doors and
walls, the --found everywhere around one hidden in plain
site/sight/cite is this limitless teeming active changing flow of
"material" not bound and to some extent gagged by the limitations of
the "material word".  (Which may be in a away thought of as one of
Plato's levels of abstractions, a removal of the material into the
realm of the immaterial,  and in Marx's terms a reification of
"materiality" into the areas in which "signs are taken for wonders".)
        Paul Celan wrote:  "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it
exposes itself."  In the encounter with the poetry of that which is,
as it exposes itself, one is is moving actively among the
sites/sights/cites which are always already expressive/expressing and
are making contact if one is open to them, as much as one oneself is
essaying contact with them.  "Stop (or move, walk, run, dance), look
and listen"--and learn.  And respond as one learns.  One "finds the
way", a way.  "I do not seek, I find," says Picasso--there is no
imposing of a preconceived seeing, saying, writing, construction made
of abstractions.
         "Nature abhors a vacuum"--yet poetries of Celan's "imposing"
kinds essay to approach as much as possible what amounts to  a
semblance of a vacuum, via evacuation and cleaning as much as possible
to a "purity of the language of the tribe" (Mallarme).  In a sense, it
is an interest paradoxically on imposing "silence" on the "noise" of
that which seems "barbaric," in the sense that the Greeks used the
word originally.  (That is--on hearing other languages, the Greeks
heard "ba-ba-ba"--since of course, being Greek, they couldn't
say--"sounds like Greek tome"--they used the word "ba-ba
ba-barbaric".)  Rather than Phil Spector's "Wall of Sound," the
imposing of "writing" becomes the attempt to create a "Wall of
Silence" between the "noise" of the "barbarians" and the "purity of
the language of the tribe."  Writing becomes a sign of seperation, in
the manner in which historically it had been, with only certain castes
or members of societies being permitted to learn the arts of writing
and of reading in the proper codified ways. A "Wall of Silence" helps
to create "Ivory Towers" which preserve the preserves as it were of
language for the ones who rule and make the rules.  The further
removed from "noise" the writer/reader becomes, the more "silent"
reading becomes--as Saint Jerome demonstrated to Saint Augustine. The
question of silence in relation to writing and reading then becomes
the opening of immensities of possibilities within the arenas of
control and its resistances through and with written"silent"
language.  To stand inside a bureaucratic office in which various
aspects of one's "fate" are being determined and seeing a sign which
reads "If it is not in writing it never happened," is to find again
the dread of this realization for those who do not participate in the
writing that is imposed inside the Walls of "purity". "Silence"
becomes something highly valued in writing as well as something which
can be employed in all sorts of ways as a weapon, an instrument of
control, a device for deception.  (it can also, as Foucault writes of
power, be constructive, has its positive aspects.That is, like power,
it "produces." And so one enters the realms of discourse re the
"production of writing." )
        When one is presented with the "opposition" of the "opacity"
and "transparence" of writing--these are effects of imposing "silence"
on writing--from the point of view of seeing "silence" as
sounding--the very idea of "opacity" is a kind of "transparent" ploy,
just as the idea of "transparency" is.  In both cases, one is required
to perform the fiction reader's "willing suspension of disbelief."
One is supposed to believe that "opacity" is "really opaque" and
"transparency" "really transparent."  The reader is required in both
cases to take the writer "at their word."  In effect, the reader is
supposed to be silenced by this 'word" which is the bearer of
"reality."  "No questions asked."
         Cannot one see opacity and sound it--and in sounding it,
"sound out" what may indeed be a "transparent ruse" to "cover up" the
message being imposed?  And transparency--may also be sounded--into a
depth in which the transparency is "a thinly veiled threat" made up to
appear a cheery smile in order to hide its rotting snaggle toothed
fangs?
         In Visual Poetry for a long time a distinction was--and still
is--made between the "Clean" and "Dirty" "Schools of works.  (I think
the use of digital means of making Visual Poetry have greatly
increased the prevalence of the "Clean" School--a very interesting
development, opening further and further areas of investigations --in
terms of this discussion and many others.)  Writing of these two
"Schools," jw curry noted that "at the extreme end of the spectrum, so
far as to be another School all their own, are Bob Cobbing and David
Chirot, the Quck'n'Dirty School."  Being the only one of us left now,
of course the works have been called "the Dirtiest of the Dirty."  I
have no idea  or not this is true and besides there isn't a
competition anyway.  What matters is that the "dirty" does not come
about by the imposition of a preconceived method, a seeking in
Picasso's terms, but from a finding of that which is exposed
everywhere around one, forgive the repetition, of that which is hidden
in plain sight/sight/cite.  In archeology and the study of Rock Art in
the landscape, of ruins, fragments,shards and bones, this is known as
taphonomy, the study of things in their current state.  The noise,
dirt and battered, muted soundings, murmurings, whispers, the screams,
shouts, songs, psalms of things in their journeys through time, as
they exist in a present which is in moment passed--a well as a hint or
vision, a calling of a future--these "quick'n'dirty" responses,
recordings,collaborations with the materials as they are--one could
"wax poetic" or "become dogmatic" about al of this, and very quickly
diminish and confine it back into the words of which it is only partly
made. "The Tao which can be named is not the Tao,"--why put a hat on a
head which isn't interested?
         Perhaps al one say is that it is the disbelief in what Robert
Smithson called "cultural confinement," and in going into the areas in
which Smithson's  "the artist's art of looking" can create art with a
glance, not confined to the production process and the production of
any object, which are quickly subsumed into systems of value imposed
from outside of the "time of the artist."  To enter into these areas
is to be finding, not seeking, that which is already there, that which
is, ignored by seekers, unconcerned with conventions, discarded as
refuse and carrying the energies to refuse the definitions which make
it so, all these things that make the "black matter"of existence
hidden in plain site/sight/cite  and with which one finds that
necessity is indeed the motherfucker of invention, for here where
"nothing" is is the "ground zero" with which one works.
       The "artistic dallying with forms" which Artaud saw as the "one
hellish, truly accursed thing in our time,"  is being smashed to
smithereens as fast as possible to make way for the new Walls, the new
"writings of silence," the new materializations and materialisms of
the "material word" as a  language of control and confinement.  Artaud
 writes that instead of the "artistic dallying with forms," --which
can be a complicity and collusion, a compromise with the new Walls in
exchange for "security"--  there is the necessity of "being like
victims burnt at the stake, signaling through the flames."
         Yet that as well requires a "willing suspension of
disbelief," a seeking in which the victim and martyr create the
theater of cruelty. Breton wrote that the purest Surrealistic act
would be to enter a crowd with a revolver and start firing at random.
Artaud's victim can be seen as the gestures, the signalings, towards
the "role" of the suicide bomber, who both enters the crowd with a
"revolver" as does Breton's Surrealist--and kills not only others at
random, but includes her/himself in the victims signaling through the
flames.  To be simultaneously victim and executioner--isn't that what
makes the suicide bomber so "monstrous" compared to the nice clean
killings carried out by "targeted assassinations"' in which the pilot
moving at high speed high above the crowd, fires into it, killing both
the "target" and innocent bystanders called "collateral damage"? And
isn't the  hypocritical discourse over the superior ethical position
of the pilot to that of the suicide bomber yet again an example of the
"artistic dallying with forms" while the victims on all sides pile up,
signaling through the flames?
             "The most beautiful  world is a heap of rubble tossed
down in confusion/at random" (the translations vary), says Heraclitus'
fragment, enduring through time as a piece of rubble itself. To enter
this "most beautiful world" as a ground zero of neccesity's
motherfucker of invention, to find in the quick'n'dirty taphonomy of
things hidden in plain sight/site/cite--is a way of "finding out for
oneself" (Olson, after Herodotus's, definition of "historin") --that
the noise and near-silences, the glittering mirroring "opacities" and
"transparencies" of "language" and "writing," the Walls of cultural
confinements--that all of this is to find that all that is imposing
itself as "writing," "silence," "performance," "language," is not so
unlike the Towers of 9/11, whose "ground zero" has been converted as
swiftly as possible into Terror and Security, Surveillance, Silence
and Censorship, Imperialism.  In this way the quck'n'dirty is a
refusal to clean up and cover up the ground zero of black matter
hidden in plain site,sight, cite when that ground zero is expanding at
every greater speeds from New Orleans to  Beirut, Baghdad to DePaul,
Gaza to the Green Zone, the Phillipines to London, Spain, Guantanamo,
from Muzzlewatch to the Patriot Act, from the Occupied Territories to
the halls of academia.
         "One cannot hide from that which never sets"
(Heraclitus)--and isn't that the goal of Imperialism, to be the sun
which never sets, rather than simply that which the sun never sets
upon?
           Isn't that the goal of the text which will never set from
the skies of its blinding silences, its writing purified of speech,
performance, "transparency?"
            Is a kind of final Law of the Text a bound and gagged
reader confined to "opaque," "complex, ambiguous," "writing,"while at
the same time being told that she or he is "free" to be the
co-producer of meanings, vectors, formal radicalisms and the like?
             Doesn't the Silence of the text become in many ways
possible, a silencing of the reader?
             Paradoxically the proliferations of ground zero offer
both the opportunity to create from and with  the rubble's
necessisitating motherfucker of found invention and the possibility of
being buried alive unless one collaborates with the cleanup crews
making ready for the new towers and Walls.
      What is truly terrifying is that the artistic dallying after
forms has  created such "artifices" that the "victims being burnt at
the take signaling through the flames" have been deprived of any
"significance" at all unless they are "one of us".In fact, it has
become rather the fashion to make note of the "bad from" of the
victims' signaling from the point of view of the properly trained
"professional," "official" "signifiers"in their infinite and moral,
judicious, Imperialist wisdom.
       As the Bob Cobbing has it of the poet "sockless in sandals,"
with hawking his or her wares in shrieks and hisses, disturbing the
quiet of the business-like ones'  sober-minded night, their ultimate
judgement and ruling will be--"if he knew what he was doing, he would
do it better."
       Yet for all that a poet wil continue on, even if arrested,
making noise in the quick'n'dirty ground zeros of existence, knowing
that "if he could it better," he'd be confined to the very world that
seems a glittering silent tomb carefully secure with the gated Walls
and the title on the door, the Bigelow on the floor and absolutely no
freedom to speak unless spoken to.
          Can this poetry of the quick'n'dirty be found everywhere?
Matthew Sotle asked me about this.
           Yes it can.  Even in a nice, confined, sterile, near-silent
environment, a gallery, a classroom, a cell, a rest room, a waiting
room--look--listen--touch.  Look at the clothes you are wearing for
example--plenty of materials for sounding with the fingers--zippers,
soles of shoes, shoe laces or button, heels, the linings of jackets,
pipings of trousers, pleats of dresses--scars on the skin, rings,
bracelets, watches, earrings, combs, brushes--the plenitude of
things--even the most minimal--a zipper on a jumpsuit--a raised
lettering sewn in to labels, materials.  The shadows one can make on
the walls, the sounds of a door somewhere way down the hall. . . . the
hum of electric lights--
            Even the smoothest of walls has somewhere a spot of
dust---even the darkest room has sounds, things one finds with the
touch---
             In the most extremely sanitized spaces one has still with
one the germs of  necessity,  the motherfucker of invention.
          Not a victim signaling through flames --
          Someone among the things hidden in plain site/sight/cite--
where the "Dead See Scrawls"--

from Joe Brainard's Pyjamas today....a foretaste of Chapman's new novel in
poetry, and reconceptualization of the mythological narrative...

James Chapman's latest novel is a startling departure from his previous
oeuvre, compelling novels which tend to enter into phenomenologically-based  modes
of social critique. Whether he's writing about the early days of the  A.I.D.s
epidemic when apocalypic narratives and thinking abounded (Our  Plague), or
analyzing the first war in the Gulf through the eyes of a  solitary soldier
realizing with horror what the new embodiment of the  "miraculous" will be in the
21st century (Glass: pray the electrons back to  sand) or seemingly
conceptualizing a human life as material sculpture  (the walls collide as you expand;
dream maple), Chapman's works never  stray far from the soil, the earth itself.
Observe the way natural processes  occurring on the ground enter into each of
his novels, and how the characters  interact with the earth they are walking
upon in pivotal scenes. It's very  subtle but definitely present. Often,
liminal events occurring at this  terrestrial level are suddenly magnified by the
amplifier of poetic prose,  demonstrating how automatic and autonomous the
foundational world is. This might  be prose witnessing the growth of a furry
fungus on a stone, or insects  utilizing human synthetics to construct dwellings,
or a process more  disembodied, less susceptible to unaided human vision. In
one novel it is a  woman in the act of psychic disintegration moving into a
cardboard box which she  decorates with the obsessiveness and meticulousness of
Joseph Cornell  (daughter, i forbid your recurring dream). This catharsis, this
continual returning to earth, might be profitably compared to the act of
grounding which goes on in Buddhist process.    more's to be had  @

The Mountains

We could walk around the borders of our beautiful country, even in 1943,
and face everywhere on earth. It's a small country and one that has always
been full of promise. Wearing our national colours is perfect for mountain
scouting and we walk towards a future unsullied by the war raging around
us. Our leaders ask us to keep our heads up high, learn to love the slopes
and cataracts, glaciers and mighty streams, dark forests and barren
plateaus. Our leaders have written a wonderful song, 'Storm Clouds in the
Distance.' But we are fond of dancing and we are very modern. Restless,
our friends await us in the small cabin we have been converting, such
food.

 Yes, we decided to change the spelling.

Okay, so far I have one excellent prose piece selected, as well as
contributions from 3 excellent poets.

Currently, the poetry quota for this quarter is filled. Any further poetry
contributions will be taken into consideration for the March issue.

I NEED THE FOLLOWING:

PROSE: Essays or short stories not to exceed 2,000 words. (Preference will
be given to essays focusing on DIY (Do-It-Yourself) lifestyle and culture,
however topics of absolutely anything are welcome, and nothing will be
taboo!

VISUAL ART: Photographers and artists send me scans or JPEG picture files of
your work. It can be drawings paitings, whatev. If any of you have comic
strips I'd love to run them!

There will also be an ongoing contributing columnist who prefers to remain
anonymous, although some of you in Ypsilanti may have seen him poke his head
out from time-to-time. ; )

SPREAD THE WORD!

DIRECT ALL SUBMISSIONS TO:

workshop leader; and Tina Kelley, award winning WCW Cooperative reader
& New York Times reporter. Bill Zavatsky, poet and Williams scholar,
will open the reading with a discussion and reading of WCW's works.

The WCWPS held an exciting day-long symposium in 2005, the first
celebration of Rutherford's famous son in 22 years. In 2006 it worked
with the Hispanic Heritage Organization to honor WCW's Spanish heritage
on his mother's side with a poetry reading that featured Puerto Rican
poet Urayoan Noel.

On September 20-21, 2008, WCW's 125th birthday will be celebrated with
a town-wide festival and two-day symposium at the Williams Center.
Formerly the Rivoli Theater, the Center was renamed the William Carlos
Williams Center for the Performing Arts in 1982, when it reopened after
a devastating fire closed its doors. On October 13, 2007 this important
institution will celebrate the 25th anniversary of its renaming with a
Gala Fundraiser to help ongoing renovations.

Hi all, Apologies for the non-Boog/poetry email.

I?m checking in to see if anyone might be interested in buying my
tickets for the last Mets regular season game of this season:

Sunday, Sept. 30, 1:10 p.m.
vs. Florida Marlins
$58

I?ve had a Sunday plan and have sat in the same section for the past
10 years--mezzanine, sec. 2 (behind home plate). I have two tickets
(price above is for the pair), and they?re under the overhang, so you
don?t get burned in the sun or wet in the rain. If you?re interested
in buying them (or know someone who is) you can email me.

Hope this finds you well (and lets go Mets!).

as ever,
David

Jill is a wonderful poet, one of the best of her generation in
Australia and beyond. I wish I could be there.

Subject: US Campaign Adopts Proposals on Apartheid, Boycott, and
NakbUS Campaign Adopts Proposals on Apartheid, Boycott, and Nakba at
6th Annual Organizers' Conference



    More than 100 delegates from more than 50 member organizations of
the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation met this weekend at the
Arlington Campus of George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia for
the US Campaign's 6th Annual National Organizers' Conference.

Delegates to the conference amended and then passed by consensus all
three proposals submitted for consideration.  The proposals, which
will guide the work of the US Campaign for the next year, call for the
US Campaign to:



Organize a national Anti-Apartheid speaking and organizing tour;
Launch a national boycott campaign against Motorola for profiting from
Israeli occupation; and
Commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Nakba through educational
campaigns and days of action



Conference delegates also elected four new members to the US
Campaign's 12-person Steering Committee to replace members whose terms
expired at the conference.  The newly-elected Steering Committee
members are:

Omar Baddar, SUSTAIN-Memphis
Adam Horowitz, American      Friends Service Committee
Judith LeBlanc, United for      Peace and Justice
Ashley Wilkinson, General      Board of Global Ministries, United
Methodist Church

(Organizations are listed for identification purposes only.  Members
of the US Campaign's Steering Committee serve in their individual
capacities, not as representatives of organizations.)

The newly-elected Steering Committee members fill the places of the
following outgoing members who completed their terms:

Huwaida Arraf, International      Solidarity Movement

The US Campaign would like to express its profound gratitude to
Huwaida, Mark, Samir, and Mazin for their hard work and inspiring
guidance over the years.

Other highlights of the conference included an inspiring Friday night
panel entitled "Success Stories in Advocating for Palestinian Human
Rights" and a Saturday night cultural event which featured the
world-premier screening of "The World Says NO to Israeli Occupation,"
a documentary on the US Campaign's June 10 protest in Washington, DC
marking 40 years of Israel's military occupation of the Palestinian
West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip.

Yesterday dozens of conference attendees stayed for the US Campaign's
lobbying day on Capitol Hill.  Conference attendees met with their
Members of Congress and staff to express their opposition to $30
billion in U.S. military aid to Israel over the next ten years; their
support for legislation to ban the export of cluster munitions; their
support for renewed U.S. peace-making efforts based on human rights
and international law; and their concern about the Israel's denial of
the right of entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories to U.S.
passport holders.

The US Campaign would also like to thank Students for Justice in
Palestine at George Mason University for sponsoring and hosting the
conference and the George  Mason University administration and police
department for ensuring that it was safe and successful.  Although
George Mason  University was pressured to cancel the conference, it
admirably stood up for our right of free speech against individuals
who tried unsuccessfully to shut the conference down.

Within the next few weeks, the US Campaign will post videos from the
conference, a conference report, and the texts of the proposals passed
as amended.

Mathesis of Killing Field

It comes down to this: here is an organism of a particular species, or
rather a sample or individual of that species, and here is a second
organism of the same; call the first 2 and the second 1. Then 1 kills 2
for one or another reason, let us say for sexual-territorial reasons or
reasons of anger or insanity. An entire world is lost with the death of 2
and this includes the family of 2 and friends of 2 who must now reorganize
and divides the belongings or nest or nestlings of 2 which most likely,
the last, will not survive. 1 kills 2 with its bare hands. Let us assume
consciousness and ethos, then we will not have a problem with this equa-
tion, the acquaintance-world of 2 may then retaliate. But I say 1 is a
criminal and if there is justice in this world or any other, then 1 must
be rendered impotent, that is the actions of 1 must be short-circuited,
circumvented, 1 must be rendered useless, ridiculous, harmless. Let us say
1 has hired or imposed force upon 3 to kill 2, then let us hold 1 doubly
responsible and 3 singly responsible. It comes down to an organism killing
another organism and the implications of habitus, political economy, the
social, on this action which is only, but not for 2, part of a train of
actions, what we might call activity in general. I say 1 is a criminal and
must be treated as such and the justification of 'war' is meaningless in
this regard, if 1 is the violator, even given the activity. I say 1 must
be rendered harmless. I say for example a president who sends people to
war, who insists on war, is not only barbaric, but a criminal situating
itself behind a bureaucracy, rewriting the languages of legality in order
to create a situation otherwise known as murder. It is as simple, I say,
as 1 over or through 2, that is a singularity within which 2 is stopped
through no reason of hir own, that there is a chain between 1 and 2. I say
as well that religion is not justice, religion is the enemy of justice,
and no appeal subvents or justifies the elimination of 2, insofar as 1 has
been aggressor, it does not matter what masquerades as results or
interpretations, what masquerades as the deconstruction of the real, in
this case destruction of the real, concrete, inert destruction. I say our
enemy is among us, our enemy is a president who is doubly an enemy, first
for war and actions against others, second for war and actions against
ourselves, as if we have generated, and we have, this disease in our
midst. Let us think of the habitus of 3, let us mourn 2, let us annihilate
1 who will continue its pyramid of annihilation until all is lost, until
so much is lost that the losing and what is gone have been forgotten. Let
us remember that a performative carries force, not the force of justice,
which has no force, and that the blindness of justice is the only sight
there is. Let us remember that all other sight is invested, and thereby
corporate, even the other-sight of the pre-industrial, that only the
other-side other-sight of the chthonic may remain speechless and true and
just, the slight memory of 3, the deepest and most violent rape of 1, that
2 no longer figures into this broken equation. 1, 3, equivalence sutures
across the pillage of the dead, equivalence no longer exists. I say let us
remember equivalence and its hammer, neutral, neutral neutral. I say 2 is
dead.

Subject:      Notes for a talk on 'human modeling'
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Notes for a talk on 'human modeling'

Human Modeling - including 'sex girlfriend modeling,' analog modeling,
avatar modeling and governance issues, technical skin/fabrication issues,
interoperability issues, psychoanalytical/psychological issues, virtual
and augmented realities, etc.

My early work on the 'topology of intentionality' - structuring of
psychoanalytical transformations within and without the symbolic. I'm
thinking also psychoanalytical modeling in general.

What does it mean to model the human? (What constitutes a model?)

Avatars in Second Life, Poser: modeling paralleling the appearance of the
human body. This might be considered formal mimicry.

Take the formal mimicry down to its basic elements, remapped in Blender
and/or other 3d programs: interrelationships of limbs. Empathetic
identification with emotional 'states' indicated by limb arrangements.

Return to the full body in Second Life: Mapping in which tensions reflect
human behaviors/activities - sexual, angered, submissive, dominant, and so
forth. The _surreal_ body - manipulations impossible in the real world.

The interior of the avatar body: sheaves, intersections, hollows. What
coheres externally falls apart to the point of transparency, disjunctions.
(Imagine pulling a weight around in second life, lungs or heart or liver:
how would that 'be'?)

Think of the system/panoply of gestures in silent film: moving from
gesture to gesture. So there are codes and narratives constructed from
moments of codes.

Issues of scripting: To what level of detail (differentiation, integra-
tion) are behaviors applied? Double level of extrapolation: Poser or
Second Life morphing - then the coding in relation to human morphing
(morphology). In other words <pose1> - {X} - <pose2> where {X} is the
potential set of generated 'betweens' in Poser or human behavior. In Poser
jump-cuts are conceivable if details down to the level of the frame are
perceptibly disparate (disconnected); in human behavior, jump-cuts are
impossible.

In human behavior, matter and time flow continuously; Reichenbach's gen-
identity holds. Poser is cinematic, spatially analogic, temporally
digital; human behavior is spatially and temporally analogic.

Modeling and the 'uncanny' - modeling of human meat. (Disturbances of the
field - Carolee Schneeman, Beuys, early Acconci, are relevant here, a
minimum of props.) What are the empathetic forces at work across the real/
virtual boundary? What are the introjective/projective (i.e. jectivities)
processes?

Consider: humans are always already modeled in relation to each other; to
themselves. Modeling is replete inscription; inscription implies codes and
protocols. The condition is always one of culture; culture characterizes
the organic (think of Heinz von Foerster on negation as fundamental to
organic behavior). There are issues of self/other, body-skein, suturing,
healing, etc.

Human modeling, avatar-creation: 1. the body (space); 2. the body in time
(behavior) - body as behavior-space.

Behavioral coding: neural nets on one hand, bvh files and totalized body
on the other: what are the code interstices/interfaces between them?

Attach a neural net to a Poser body; import into Blender (element reduc-
tion, mapping), import into Second Life (formal description of tension /
relaxation in space-time).

Dear All ---

Listenlight.net (a poetry journal) is now a "Web 2.0" *application* in
the Ruby on Rails platform.  Readers will "interact" with your work in
various and subtle ways.  I know precisely how to implement it, yet I
have all the serious hacking to do before it will look like the
listenlight you know and love.

Sending your work in for review will only expedite the process.

Best,

Bobbi, if China isn't referred to as communist, that's probably because it's
not.  The Chinese government likes to refer to it as communism with Chinese
characteristics, which in fact means capitalism with a highly authoritarian
government.

Elizabeth,
Thank you so much for answering.
That is exactly my point.
It seems the point is always political correctness these days--and yes--i did correct myself according to the new formula/ i did excuse myself just in case.
but the point of this quote was the fact that people need permission from the government for reincarnation (for a limited time only)
thanks--bobbi

Run, don't walk, to your local libraries.

Ok, you can call as well. But go!

Let us help each other by going to or calling as many libraries as we can in
our area and asking them to purchase books we have published.

There are interest groups (such as one composed of writers who publish cat
books) who increase their sales by making library requests, en masse, for
each book a member publishes.

So, I am asking, please go to or call the libraries near you and ask them to
order The Phoenix and the Dragon by Adam Byrn Tritt, from Smithcraft Press.
More info can be found at
http://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Dragon-Poems-Alchemical-Transformation/dp/0979
393507/

Then, let us all know what book WE should all go and request at the library.
Let's not just publish but let's make some actual money from our art and
effort.


Thank you,

Adamus

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT:
=20
BASIC AND BOLD: LOGOS R US =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 9TH
=20
Every writer finds a niche, a gesture, the thing that works in what they do=
.
At some point it may become a style or convention.  Sometimes it becomes a
crutch.  One way to break the mode is to be radical=8Bthat is, return to the
roots.  What brought you to poetry in the first place? This is a workshop
for writers who want to re-look at how the structure and elements of poetry
provide the wherewithal to make poems that are as ambitious, thoughtful and
innovative as you want them to be. There will be in class writing,
assignments, reading, and a revision project called =8BCAN THIS POEM BE
SAVED?=8B in which you bring a poem that simply has not come to closure; seem=
s
to be stuck; or needs to be looked at by fresh eyes in the hope of finding
what could make it work. This workshop is geared toward writers who have
been seriously writing for some time.  Please submit 5-8 pages of poetry an=
d
a brief description of what you=B9d like to accomplish in the workshop by
September 28. African American poet, playwright and cultural commentator,
Patricia Spears Jones is author of two collections, Femme du Monde and The
Weather That Kills.
=20
POETRY LAB: FORMS OF JOYFUL EXPERIMENTATION =AD TODD COLBY
FRIDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 12TH


In this workshop we'll forge new paths to the poem by investigating how far
a poem can depart from being =B3a poem=B2 and yet still be a poem. We'll
experiment with breath, heartbeat, movement, blogs, the alchemy of words,
visions, letters to the editor, spontaneity, psychoanalysis, collaborations=
,
appropriations and self-hypnosis, along with various traditional forms. The
main objective is to create a supportive and inviting atmosphere in our
joyfully experimental "Lab." A partial reading list will include: Hannah
Weiner, Jacques Lacan, Gertrude Stein, Diane Williams, David Markson,
Miranda July, Thomas Bernhard, Bill Knott, Arthur Rimbaud, Alice Notley,
Mina Loy, Charles Olson, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Todd Colby is the author
of Tremble & Shine, Riot in the Charm Factory, Cush, and Ripsnort, all of
which were published by Soft Skull Press.
=20
WORLDLY AND INFINITELY DIMENSIONAL:
A WORKSHOP =AD RACHEL LEVITSKY
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 13
=20
In these times, the possibilities by which we may amplify, record, document=
,
display, shape, formulate, and publish words increases daily. Although
expanded media and its wide reach are in themselves a meaningful fact of ou=
r
times, they don=B9t necessarily enhance a poetry=B9s resonance. How do we, and
by we I mean both ourselves as ones and ourselves as groups, best construct
and perform our poetries so as to be present in these particular times and
yet open to the infinite possibilities of =B3projection,=B2 =B3conception,=B2
=B3performance=B2? Familiarizing ourselves with poets like Abigail Child, Julie
Patton, Cecilia Vicu=F1a, Bob Dylan, Linton Kwesi Johnson (some will be
visiting the workshop), we will consider all means available and any means
necessary to project living works into our world. Individually and
collaboratively we=B9ll construct performances, visual works, sound events,
improvisations, etc. Rachel Levitsky is the author of Under the Sun
(Futurepoem) and is the founder and co-editor of Belladonna Books.
=20
=20
The workshop fee is $350, which includes a one-year individual Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all fall spring and fall classes=
.
Reservations are required due to limited class space, and payment must be
received in advance. Please send payment and reservations to: The Poetry

What are you reading? Poetry or not.

I am reading one of those excellent MIT Press books called =
_Participation_ which gathers essays, writings, curatorial statements =
and various things about art & performance, installation and etc. in one =
book. There are a bunch of these in the series and I think they're =
pretty great.

Ah

The tinkling of a glass of champagne, o lucky couple the next car over
A snatch of a Russian folk-song, hummed by an expectant mother behind me
The humming of the rails across endless plateaus, poplars in the distance
A murmur of twittering birds in the flying snow of dawn
The thrumming of a guitar and endless cheers and toasts
Sleighs and horses' white breath and full speed ahead
A man raises a monocle, a woman smiles slowly, her book upon her lap
A young girl sketches the passing landscape, death is in her eyes
Sweating furiously, the surly playwright stands in the open-air car
Comets and rainbows, something is about to happen

Okay it's not totally poetry, but there's some odd poetry in it. Has anybody
read Percival Everett's new novel(?) The Water Cure? Curious to hear some
opinions. It's a great metaphor for US foreign policy.

Debate Essential To Arab-Israeli Peace

By Amy Goodman

September 13, 2007, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer

http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/331388_amy13.html

I sat down with former President Carter last week at the
Carter Center in Atlanta. The center was hosting a conference
of human-rights defenders, people at the front lines
confronting repressive regimes around the globe. After a
quarter-century of humanitarian work through the Carter
Center, monitoring elections, working to eradicate neglected
tropical diseases and focusing on the poor, Jimmy Carter now
finds himself at the center of the storm in the Israel-
Palestine conflict.

After more than three decades of work on the Middle East,
Carter released a book titled Palestine: "Peace Not
Apartheid." The book's title alone has created a furor. But
Carter is undeterred:

"The word 'apartheid' is exactly accurate. This is an area
that's occupied by two powers. They are now completely
separated. Palestinians can't even ride on the same roads that
the Israelis have created or built in Palestinian territory.
The Israelis never see a Palestinian, except the Israeli
soldiers. The Palestinians never see an Israeli, except at a
distance, except the Israeli soldiers. So within Palestinian
territory, they are absolutely and totally separated, much
worse than they were in South Africa, by the way. And the
other thing is, the other definition of 'apartheid' is, one
side dominates the other. And the Israelis completely dominate
the life of the Palestinian people."

Carter lays much of the blame for the lack of momentum toward
a solution on the absence of debate in the U.S.: "It's a
terrible human-rights persecution that far transcends what any
outsider would imagine. And there are powerful political
forces in America that prevent any objective analysis of the
problem in the Holy Land. I think it's accurate to say that
not a single member of Congress with whom I'm familiar would
possibly speak out and call for Israel to withdraw to their
legal boundaries or to publicize the plight of the
Palestinians or even to call publicly and repeatedly for good
faith peace talks."

As president, Carter brokered the 1978 Camp David Peace
Accords, creating a lasting peace between Israel and Egypt.
President Clinton, who officiated over the failed 2000 Camp
David Summit between Israel and the Palestinians, has been
highly critical of Carter's perspective. Clinton blames the
Palestinian leadership for rejecting Israel's "generous
offer." It's interesting that Israel's chief negotiator,
former Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, told me in 2006, "If I
were a Palestinian, I would have rejected Camp David as well."

While we were in Atlanta, DePaul University in Chicago reached
a settlement with professor Norman Finkelstein. Despite
hailing him as a "prolific scholar and an outstanding
teacher," DePaul denied him tenure, many believe because of
his outspoken criticism of Israeli policy toward Palestinians.
The son of Holocaust survivors himself, Finkelstein has been
praised by leading scholars.

Just months before he died, Raul Hilberg, revered founder of
the field of Holocaust studies, praised Finkelstein's work:
"That takes a great amount of courage. His place in the whole
history of writing history is assured and that those who in
the end are proven right triumph, and he will be among those
who will have triumphed, albeit, it so seems, at great cost."

Open debate on Israel-Palestine should not come at such a high
cost. It is essential to Middle East peace. The Iraq Study
Group, in its bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Report, stated, "The
United States will not be able to achieve its goals in the
Middle East unless the United States deals directly with the
Arab-Israeli conflict."

Carter's book cover has a picture of the "Separation Barrier."
Israel originally designed the wall to run along the
internationally recognized 1967 border. Carter noted that
Israel decided to "move the wall from the Israeli border to
intrude deeply within Palestine to carve out some of that
precious land for the Israeli settlers to occupy." The
International Court of Justice has ruled it illegal. It is
more than half completed, with plans to snake more than 400
miles, mainly through the West Bank. In places the wall is
more than 25 feet high and made of concrete.

Carter describes it as "much worse" than the Berlin Wall.
Elder Israeli peace activist Uri Avnery writes:

"When my friends fall prey to despair, I show them a piece of
painted concrete, which I bought in Berlin. It is one of the
remnants of the Berlin Wall, which are on sale in the city. I
tell them that I intend, when the time comes, to apply for a
franchise to sell pieces of the Separation Wall."

That barrier stands in the United States as well "
metaphorically " around any kind of rational debate for a fair
and just solution in the Middle East. My suggestion: Tear down
that wall.

MuzzleWatch  Jewish Voices for Peace  Update

Petition for Nadia Abu El-Haj is below this, and also is contained in

After Finkelstein: Alan Dershowitz, a Clinton supporter, pressures Obama
The conservative daily, The New York Sun reports that Alan Dershowitz
is pressuring Barack Obama to sever ties with former Carter security
advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski because he defended Stephen Walt and John
Mearsheimer's book, "The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy". In fact,
once informed that an Obama ad appeared on the Amazon page advertising
the book, the Obama campaign had it removed. The Sun reports:

    Amid a firestorm over an initial working paper Messrs .
Mearsheimer and Walt published last year on the Israel lobby, Mr.
Brzezinski rose to their defense, even as he demurred on the question
of whether he agreed with their central arguments. The authors, he
wrote in the journal Foreign Policy, "have rendered a public service
by initiating a much-needed public debate on the role of the ' Israel
lobby' in the shaping of U.S. foreign policy."
    Mr. Obama's campaign took the opposite route earlier this week
when notified that an ad for its Web site appeared on the Amazon.com
page of the Mearsheimer-Walt book. The campaign immediately removed
the ad, saying its placement was unintentional, and issued a statement
saying Mr. Obama believed the arguments in the book were "just wrong."
"I'm glad he's done that, but now he has to dissociate himself from
Brzezinski," Mr. Dershowitz said in an interview yesterday. He said
the Mearsheimer-Walt book was "a bigoted attack on the American Jewish
community" and that Mr. Brzezinski's comments in Foreign Policy last
year amounted to an endorsement.

Harvard law professor and gadfly Alan Dershowitz, who supports Hillary
Clinton's candidacy and gave $1,000 to her campaign, also accused
Brezinski of anti-Israel rhetoric, highlighting his criticism of
Israel's bombing of Lebanon last year.

    In response, the Obama campaign released a statement from one of
its top supporters in the Jewish community, Rep. Robert Wexler of
Florida. " Barack Obama has been a consistent supporter of Israel and
this is an unfortunate case of a fabricated controversy for political
reasons," he said. "I speak with him often on Israel policy, and I can
tell you firsthand that Barack Obama is opposed to the arguments
presented in this book."

    To:  Columbia University/Barnard College

    We the undersigned strongly endorse the tenure case of Nadia Abu
El-Haj at Barnard college. We completely reject every unsubstantiated
allegation made in the related petition
(http://www.petitiononline.com/barnard/) to deny Ms. Abu El-Haj
tenure. Moreover, we wish to register that we find to be deplorable
such unsubstantiated attacks on the autonomy of free academic inquiry
and academic self-government from outside the academy. Ms. Abu
El-Haj's work has undergone peer review and has been published by a
premier academic press (University of Chicago) and it stands on its
own merits, which have been widely recognized in the academic
community. We believe that these attacks on Ms. Abu El-Haj are part of
an orchestrated witch-hunt (reminiscent of course of McCarthyism)
against politically unpopular ideas. We also believe that Ms. Abu
El-Haj has been singled out from among many other authors who make the
same points essentially because of her last name, thus, we suspect
that something like simple ethnic prejudice is at issue here.

    Sincerely,

    The Undersigned

Hello Jane - thanks for your great question to the list!
I'm in medias res the just out posthumous "novel" by H.D. titled The
Sword Went Out to Sea, subtitled "Synthesis of a Dream by Delia
Alton" (one of H.D.'s pseudonyms) insightfully introduced and edited
by Cynthia Hogue and Julie Vandivere.  A mind-blowing entrance into
the workings of H.D.'s head as she travels the occult, envisioning
simultaneities of history and myth. An ardent feminist call against war.
Also just finished Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
The Inheritance of Loss by Anita Desai - transporting descriptive
skills - class in India and among NYC illegals.
Every Goodbye Ain't Gone: Anthology of Innovative Poetry by African
Americans ed. by Aldon Lynn Nielsen and Lauri Ramey.
And revisiting Charles Wright's Collected Poems.
(and, yes, the time-consuming NYTimes)!
Best,

I am leading a "walking & writing" workshop this Fall at Stanford, using the campus as our 'site'. One of the places I want us to walk is into Special Collections, which has the Ginsberg and Creeley archives.
 It would be lovely to find - in advance - any poems by either poet that emerge out of a particular walk. And to have an original mss. available to see, explore.

 I will appreciate any suggestions of titles - poems and/or journal pieces.

 Thanks in advance,

 Stephen Vincent

The following is new and not in general circulation, but it can be had =
through Small Press Distribution, as follows:

THREE POEMS AFTER IMAGES BY NANCY TOBIN

=20

Author: Jerome Rothenberg

Cover: PAPERBACK

Pub Date: 01 July 2007

Publisher: Hawk's Well Press

ISBN 10: 1-887123-77-6

ISBN 13: 978-1-887123-77-8

=20

Price: $15.00

=20

The latest of Jerome Rothenberg's many collaborations with artists, =
Three Poems takes off from Nancy Tobin's brilliantly colored and =
constructed paintings, to create a mutual celebration of the familiar =
and familial.  The initiatory act here follows from Tobin's =
quasi-abstract images and her assessment of the mysteries and =
revelations that her art provides her:

=20

I construct both my paintings and works on paper as a dialogue between=20
the representational and ornamental; which party gets the last word =
remains a mystery until the composition is complete. I start with =
painted or drawn=20
images, then literally cut them down to size with scissors before =
reassembling the components on painted panels or into "quilted" paper =
compositions that I treat with successive layers of paint, ink and =
polymer.

This break-'em-down-to-build-'em-up methodology is my way of capturing =
moments in an expanding universe. Representation is as powerful as it =
futile. Any tableau is illusory; even mountains are in constant flux. =
Particles decay, light bends, and perceptions alter with each =
recollection.

My technique in turn encourages the viewer to approach each work with a =
forensic eye: to examine the constituent parts and try to reconstruct =
their pedigree, then step in and take in the totality of color and form.

The layers I create fade into opacity, however firmly each is fixed in =
memory. Try to peel them back with your eyes, and you'll reach a new =
level each time.

=20

Three Poems after Images by Nancy Tobin also marks the resuscitation of =
Jerome Rothenberg's Hawk's Well Press, an important poetry project of =
the 1960s and 70s.

=20

Printed with three full-color reproductions and book design by Nancy =
Tobin.

British poet and scholar Bill Griffiths was found dead in his home today. Tom Raworth reported earlier that Griffiths was found dead in his home with the television, radio and a computer on.

Aside from running Aram and Pirate Press, Griffiths was an Anglo-Saxon scholar educated at King's College, London, where after receiving his PhD he cataloged the Eric Mottram archive. His first poems were published in the 1970s, in the Poetry Review then under the editorship of Eric Mottram. He was part of and heavily influenced by Bob Cobbing's Writers' Forum. In short, he did a lot, was part of a lot and helped to promote the work of others through his own various imprints.

For those unfamiliar with his work, Salt brought out Mudfort, a selected poems, a couple of years back. There is also the Salt Companion to Bill Griffiths,  a collection of essays on and interviews with Griffiths. The companion is edited by William Rowe and both the companion and Mudfort are still available.

heavy loss / sad day. Bill was a generous man and its a shame to see him exit out so early.

thanks to Matt Chambers for bringing this terrible news to my attention.

Denis Johnson has just published a new novel, The Tree of Smoke. I love the guys work. Anyone read Jesus' Son, or his poetry collected in The Incognito Lounge? He's in the same league with Jim Harrison and Paul Auster. These 3 are visionary authors. They've each written major work in fiction and poetry, as well as first rate short stories and plays. Great writers.

theory. the real. death.


Torture is senseless violence, born in fear. The purpose of it is to force
from one tongue, amid its screams and its vomiting up of blood, the secret
of _everything._ Senseless violence: whether the victim talks or whether
he dies under his agony, the secret that he cannot tell is always some-
where else and out of reach. It is the executioner who becomes Sisyphus.
If he puts _the question_ at all, he will have to continue forever.

Sartre (in the afterword to Henri Alleg, The Question, 1958)

Experiment solitary touching the impossibility of annihilation.

100. There is nothing more certain in nature than that it is impossible
for any body to be utterly annihilated; but that as it was the work of the
omnipotency of God to make somewhat of nothing, so it requireth the like
omnipotency to turn somewhat into nothing. And therefore it is well said
by an obscure writer of the sect of the chemists, that there is no such
way to effect the strange transmutations of bodies, as to endevour and
urge by all means the reducing of them to nothing. And herein is contained
also a great secret of preservation of bodies from change; for if you can
prohibit, that they neither turn into air, because no air cometh to them;
nor go into the bodies adjacent, because they are utterly heterogeneal;
nor make a round and circulation within themselves; they will never
change, though they be in their nature never so perishable or mutable.

from Francis Bacon, Sylva Sylvarum or A Natural History, 1627

Hi Stephen:

I don't know of any poems by Ginsberg or Creeley that come from a walk. =
You'd think that at least Ginsberg would have one. I did go on a walk =
with Allan, and Phil Whalen, one of the circumambulations of Mt. =
Tamalpais. Although Snyder wrote a poem on one of these walks (Allan =
wasn't on that one), as far as I know Ginsberg didn't. I mention the one =
with Allan on the first page of Reality Dreams: =
http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/weishaus/Real/real-1.htm

Best,
Joel

I am leading a "walking & writing" workshop this Fall at Stanford, using =
the campus as our 'site'. One of the places I want us to walk is into =
Special Collections, which has the Ginsberg and Creeley archives.
 It would be lovely to find - in advance - any poems by either poet that =
emerge out of a particular walk. And to have an original mss. available =
to see, explore.
=20
 I will appreciate any suggestions of titles - poems and/or journal =
pieces.

 Thanks in advance,

Subject:      Frustration
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Frustration


Two crystal radios (crs) in parallel through the same antenna/ground
system.

The larger, older one is in the box and can fine-tune through a vario-
coupler, loose coupler, and now an air condenser. The output is drawn from
the larger.

The system is increasingly frustrating and baroque, more and more stations
are picked up, the tuning peaks are sharper, the sensitivity and amplitude
much greater. Everything is passive and metal, except for the diodes - two
in parallel for the older cr, one for the newer.

It's frustrating. The output is always similar, content-dependent, and I'm
not interested in content, or rather the content of the wave-envelopes -
interference, noise, static, and spherics included.

But the frustration - the content dominates, so I've now thrown filter
after filter at it, reducing everything to nonsense, nothing but spew.

Why listen? Because it's a symptom of frustration.

The cr itself is of interest - every inductor has resistance and capaci-
tance, every capacitor has inductance and resistance, every resistor has
inductance and capacitance. But there are no resistors, only a small rf
choke. I arrange and rearrange components, trying for the highest q-
factor (filter sharpness), the loudest output. Sometimes a clip loosens
and everything changes for the better or worse. Sometimes my hand brushes
a coil and things change again. Reverse the clips, antenna/ground or the
diodes, and things change yet again. Nothing's predictable, but the q and
amplitude tends towards the same old thing. If I look for a signal in the
noise beneath the signals, it's canceled out even in the noise. Or some-
times not; you can hear straight-forward voices in the middle of crs.mp3,
even with all the manipulation.

Again, it's metal come to life, arrangements of metal, nothing else, even
the earphones are coils and magnets and thin metal diaphragms. There's
none of the interiority of electronics, vacuum tubes, solid state, except
for the diodes of course. Use a razor-blade diode, and even the solid-
state's eliminated.

And manipulation of the output? Reverberation, hiss filters, hard limit-
ing, normalizing, equalizing. To no point at all except to eliminate my
own nausea. This might have been a search for aesthetic pleasure; instead
it's grounded in an impossible novelty - what with the tuning coils and
capacitor, cr sound is narrowly defined, almost traditional. I need a
violin. I need something.

crs1 and crs2 are images of the interior of the older cr, which has now
been placed in a box. There's a cat around. cr3 is the second cr on top of
the closed box. The fourth file is the mp3.

http://www.asondheim.org/crs1.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/crs2.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/crs3.jpg
http://www.asondheim.org/crs.mp3

(I wonder in terms of the poetics and phenomenology of the 'thing' here -
they lie in arrangements, in channels - stations and noise, etc. are par-
asitic, the whole a swirl, entanglement. Listen through the cross-sec-
tions. There's also the semiotics of the flesh, the relationship and
placements of antennas and grounds, the body, flustered, moving all those
coils and dials. The oldest radio sets have a variety of tuning mechanisms
- everything balances on everything. I'd say the pleasure quickens fast in
all of this, but then, like plate cameras, a kind of exactitude emerges
and delight when something after all comes clear. I'm thinking of modeling

Walking with Elihu

Poems by Taylor Graham

Home Economics, 1825 | Seasons in the Smithy | Adolescent Myths
Out of Work | After the Prayer Meeting | A Matter of Pennies
Journey's End | Sanskrit | Forging Iron with Coal

Author's Note: Elihu Burritt, the Learned Blacksmith (1810-1879), grew up
in a poor family in New Britain, Connecticut, and apprenticed himself to
the local blacksmith to help support his family. While working full-time
at the forge, he taught himself mathematics, astronomy, geography, and
about fifty languages. Even though nearly penniless, he took on
humanitarian causes and traveled to Europe, where he helped organize
international peace congresses. To learn more about the land and people of
Britain, especially farming practices, he walked from London to the
northern tip of Scotland and then from London to Land's End in the south,
and published journals of his walks. He was appointed consular agent at
Birmingham, England, by President Lincoln. These poems are from a
collection in-progress, working title "Walking with Elihu," which is
looking for a publisher.

Taylor Graham is a volunteer search-and-rescue dog handler in the Sierra
Nevada, and also helps her husband (a retired wildlife biologist) with his
field projects. Her poems have appeared in International Poetry Review,
The Iowa Review, The New York Quarterly, Poetry International, Southern
Humanities Review, and elsewhere, including the anthology California
Poetry: From the Gold Rush to the Present (Heyday Books, 2004). Her latest
book, The Downstairs Dance Floor (Texas Review Press, 2006), was awarded
the Robert Phillips Poetry Chapbook Prize. Taylor Graham's poems, "Cessna
Down," "Last Seen at the ATM," "3/5, the Andes by proxy," and her essay,
"The Search and the Poem," appeared as Mudlark Poster No. 1 (1997),
inaugurating the Mudlark Poster Series.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Steve, When The Incognito Lounge came out (it's named after a place very cl=
ose to here), I memorized the whole title poem, and continue to celebrate m=
any of the pieces in that book. The feel of the poems included changes acro=
ss years, but I have always loved it - just in different ways. I knew Denis=
 a bit when he was here in the Valley, and joined him and others in a writi=
ng group occasionally. =0A=0AHe is indeed poetic and visionary as a novelis=
t, as well. Looking forward to the new novel. Well received so far.=0A=0ARe=
garding Harrison, his ghazals are splendid, and I've read most of his work,=
 also. =0A=0AI can see why you are taken with the work of these two, in add=

a question.

i'm making a piece that lets the user configure various 'brushes' that are
set in 'painting' motion simultaneously. i'm looking for a term to describe
such a set of 'brushes'. let us call it x for the moment. you can create a
new x and configure it. you can edit the brushes of an x (add, delete,
configure). you can save an x.

since there can be several brushes in an x at once, i'm thinking x should
relate to the many-handed. the hindu gods shiva and vishnu come to mind, but
it seems inappropriate and presumptuous that x=shiva or x=vishnu.

the 'brushes' are virtual, and they 'paint' in ways related to

suggestions?

theory.  the real. death.


Torture is senseless violence, born in fear. The  purpose of it is to force
from one tongue, amid its screams and its  vomiting up of blood, the secret
of _everything._ Senseless violence:  whether the victim talks or whether
he dies under his agony, the secret  that he cannot tell is always some-
where else and out of reach. It is the  executioner who becomes Sisyphus.
If he puts _the question_ at all, he will  have to continue forever.

This is sad.  Sorry to those who know him.  I've noticed a drop  off in
obituary announcements on Poetics -- I think the obituaries are very  important in
alerting us to the contributions and accomplishments of people who  have
worked in the arts & poetry.  I have hoped the drop off is due to  fewer recent
deaths -- we have been blessed in recent years in the long lives of  our poets!

I was listening to the npr program "On The Media" yesterday while repairing and attaching a new table leg to my daughter's "special table," when Ari Fleischer was being interviewed by Brooke Gladstone about the Image Wars regarding the Iraq War.

Fleischer pulled out all the typical ad hominems and spins 1) about MoveOn.org--which performed its own ad hominems in their advertisement about General David Petraeus being a "General Betray Us" (a rhyme so pitifully obvious that it made me cringe to see it in print, even though I giggled over it when I thought of it myself), 2) about the peace movement, 3) about the left, 4) about the war in Iraq. Apparently, one ad (which you're welcome to watch and vomit in your mouth over), uses the typical rhetoric that essential blames the left in advance for making a guy feel like he's wasted his sacrifice...and he's lost both his legs in the war. But the sinister aspect of the ad, which Gladstone rightly confronts Fleischer on, is that ugly slippage in the "they" attacked us line. Really, Iraq attacked us?! WTF?!!!! I forgot, all of "them" are alike. Which leads me to Hal Johnson's "White Man's Burden," which is a phrase canonized by imperial poet Rudyard Kipling.  (I should mention
t!
hat Petraeus quoted Kipling in his address to Congress.) Here's Kipling's poem, and then Johnson's.

White Man's Burden

Take up the White Man's burden--
Send forth the best ye breed--
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild--
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child.

Take up the White Man's burden--
In patience to abide,
To veil the threat of terror
And check the show of pride;
By open speech and simple,
An hundred times made plain
To seek another's profit,
And work another's gain.

Take up the White Man's burden--
The savage wars of peace--
Fill full the mouth of Famine
And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
The end for others sought,
Watch sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to nought.

Take up the White Man's burden--
No tawdry rule of kings,
But toil of serf and sweeper--
The tale of common things.
The ports ye shall not enter,
The roads ye shall not tread,
Go make them with your living,
And mark them with your dead.

Take up the White Man's burden--
And reap his old reward:
The blame of those ye better,
The hate of those ye guard--
The cry of hosts ye humour
(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:--
"Why brought he us from bondage,
Our loved Egyptian night?"

Take up the White Man's burden--
Ye dare not stoop to less--
Nor call too loud on Freedom
To cloke your weariness;
By all ye cry or whisper,
By all ye leave or do,
The silent, sullen peoples
Shall weigh your gods and you.

Take up the White Man's burden--
Have done with childish days--
The lightly proferred laurel,
The easy, ungrudged praise.
Comes now, to search your manhood
Through all the thankless years
Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,
The judgment of your peers!

***

We all need to help them ay-rabs get their act together and love freedom, right?

***

Robert Fisk was in the first group of journalists to enter the
Palestinian refugee camps on 18 September 1982, after the 48 hour war
crime massacre ordered by Ariel Sharon ("The Butcher of Baghdad,"
called "A Man of Peace" by GW Bush) and carried out by Phalangist
forces.

Hello everyone,

The summer gallery of Blackbox is now live.? Please check it out.? Lots of good submissions; not easy to whittle it all down to a manageable grouping.? Obviously the submission period has ended.? I simply can't handle any more.? Plus I haven't received any new candidates over the past few days, so it seems like a good time to call time.

This season's gallery contains work by Karl Kempton, John M. Bennett and C. Mehri Bennett, Vernon Frazer, Marco Giovenale, Kaz Mazlanka, Nicholas Karavatos, Sheila E. Murphy -- a nice combination of regulars and newcomers.? It ain't easy for a newcomer to crack the Blackbox code, so let's give those guys a hand.???

Per usual, go to WilliamJamesAustin.com and follow the Blackbox link, or go direct to WilliamJamesAustin.com/Blackbox.html.? Then take a long stroll (scroll) through the galleries until you reach the latest.? Be sure to check out previous galleries on your way.

As always, mucho thanks to everyone to submits and contributes, whether or not s/he make it into this season's gallery.

Best, Bill

"Sundog  / Zodiac of a Fingernail," by T.A. Noonan

If you could clip me, I would be waxing crescent / Once I was a mouth,
gibbous until I closed over you / You took my name from Ptolemy-terra
australis-to balance me against something higher / My shape was all flats
and ice / Katabatic winds rended my plateau at the edge / Interior, they
moderated themselves / Sometimes the sun touched my white skin, and I burned
like Brazil / My diamond dusts shimmered carnivale, radiation tricky as an
open circuit / Now, this ridge slit through, a quick: something little,
rough / The nail in front of your face slides under your waistband,
parhelios to the snow / Parhelios to the snow, the nail in front of your
face slides under your waistband / Now, this ridge slit through, a quick:
something little, rough / My diamond dusts shimmer carnivale, radiation
tricky as an open circuit / Sometimes I burn like Brazil when the sun
touches my white skin, and the interior moderates itself / Katabatic winds
rend my polar plateau at the edge / My shape is all flats and ice / You take
my name from Ptolemy--terra australis--to balance me against something
higher / At once I am a mouth, gibbous until I close over you / I could /

(this is a forward.  please don't respond to me.
good luck!)

St. Mary's College of Maryland at Historic St. Mary's
City is seeking a tenure-track assistant/associate
professor of Creative Writing, PhD or MFA, to
begin August 2008.

The successful candidate will join a department in
which creative writing and literary analysis are
unusually well integrated, with many colleagues who
publish and teach in both fields. He or she will be
encouraged to participate in the departmental
development of creative writing activities, in
what is already a vibrant and rich campus writing
community. Teaching responsibilities of three classes
per semester, among them creative writing at all
curricular levels; while we welcome candidates who are
themselves poets, novelists, dramatists, or essayists,
we would prefer a candidate who can comfortably teach
in at least two genres. All faculty share in some way
in the teaching of the Core Curriculum, which includes
literature and expository writing classes, as well as
first-year seminars and independent year-long senior
theses.

St. Mary's College of Maryland, a public Carnegie
Baccalaureate, Arts and Sciences institution located
in Historic St. Mary's City, is Maryland's
designated public honors college for the liberal arts,
and candidates must be committed
to providing a liberal arts education within a small
college setting. With highly selective admissions
policies, academically talented students,
and a rigorous curriculum, we offer a small college
experience similar to that found at exceptional
private colleges. St. Mary's faculty benefit from a
comprehensive program of support for scholarship,
research, travel, and curriculum development,
including course releases for pre-tenure faculty and
leaves for tenured faculty. The quality of life is
enhanced by the recreational opportunities of
the Chesapeake region and by our proximity to
Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.

To apply, please submit a cover letter, curriculum
vitae, writing sample of no more than 15 pages, and at
least three letters of recommendation
to Ruth Feingold, Chair, St. Mary's College of
Maryland, 18952 E. Fisher Rd., St. Mary's City, MD

KIVA AT CHACO CANYON

The kiva meditates on herself
On the roundness of the soul
On the eagle's circular vision.
=A0
Lie on your back, little girl-
Notice the sky! It's contained
In its own infinite funnel.
=A0
I know this kiva. We are old friends-
The mother we never had.
I recognize her! It's she
Who forces one toward the middle.

In the kiva there is only middle.
=A0
Looking out through her bald blue eye
It's me:
Looking in, looking out.

emotions decrees music zero


3 solos reflecting a state of consciousness brought about by j indicating
she can tell my moods by the titles for example frustration indicating so
though s/he misses the excitement behind which i'm neutral though the
stuff i make most likely isn't and going broke doesn't help things along
the way as i try to fasten onto 'something creative' so this part's true
my nails cracked something about stress and sleeping in the office at
brown and then i don't want to think about much most music stresses me but
mine doesn't why is that so anyway this is all play-arounds because i
can't do my usual with the right hand there are always other paths. but
really bio stuff - when i'm happiest i write ferocious about torture well
when miserable something comes along out the window tentacle glass lens of
the camera always on the loose it's moi moi moi

what frightens me most? that philosophy always the result of a damaged
life will be itself damaged at best that i'll have nothing to say or it
will be read as symptom or state-of-mind which shouldn't be a leverage at
all any more than if i'm building /dev/nul it doesn't mean suicide or
working as root isn't a sign of megalomania. the interstices of the text,
the working-out of root issues against /dev/nul, the work of modeling a
damaged species, this is fundamental. the sound of moi moi moi builds
rooms where harmonics play against non-existent walls, play against them-
selves, think of walls defined by harmonics, that is wavelengths, nothing
material, you might have quantum rooms like that with music like this
going on in them

Mike Basinski and Karlen Chase will be performing 9/20 and Karlen will

A few months ago, a discussion strand began that involved into one pertaini=
ng to the Cascajal block:  an object belonging to the Olmec culture, a pre-=
colombian culture=20
that predates the Maya, the remains of which are  located primarily in what=
 is currently Mexico.   Anthropologists uncovered the block in 1999 and beg=
an publicizing it in=20
2006.  I have been working on developing and designing the scope of an ongo=
ing literary/artistic project that will and is treating the problem of the =
block:  that problem=20
namely being that it is a language=97or bears enough similarity to what we =
might call a language that it might teach us something about what exactly a=
 language is=97that=20
has no companion texts and is therefore totally untranslatable/incomprehens=
ible.  Some members of the list expressed a wish that I might keep everyone=
 up to date on=20
where the project is taking me.  There are very few ideas that thrill me mo=
re than thinking that members of the listserv might be interested in helpin=
g to expand the=20
girth and possibilities of this project.=20=20

I have started putting together a blog of the work I've been doing.  If int=
erest happens:  http://glyphmachines.blogspot.com/2007/09/cascajal-block-ha=
nd-drawn-
reproduction.html  or just http://glyphmachines.blogspot.com.=20=20

I'm also writing this post in the form of an <b>S.O.S.</b>.  Part of my hop=
es for this project is that it might form the basis of a Fulbright grant pr=
oject.  Everything has=20
been going very well for me, except that in order to apply for a Fulbright =
to go to Mexico you must have a LETTER OF AFFILIATION from someone belongin=
g to a relevant=20
institution or involved in a relevant field in that country.  I have tried =
contacting anthropologists, administrators and artists alike with no luck a=
t all.  I'm kind of coming=20
to a wits end.  Is there anyone who might be able to help me?  Who knows a =
Mexican poet, professor or scientist who  might be interested enough in a p=
roject like this to=20
agree to write a letter of affiliation for me?   I must admit that I person=
ally feel that it is completely absurd to ask a complete stranger for a fav=
or of this nature=97I don't=20
understand how exactly the Fulbright committee has come to believe that it =
is acceptable to make this demand of someone applying for a Fulbright.  Aft=
er all, I believe=20
people apply for grants like these specifically because they do not have th=
e means to complete a project on their own.  Anyway.  If there is anyone wh=
o could help...  I=20
would be overwhelmed with gratitude.=20=20

Or if anyone has any ideas about the block and unraveling its mystery.  Tha=

While I'm way ahead of the next Listenlight (at least by the Gravity Way

Allen wrote a poem called "Mugging Poem" during which he was mugged and then talked to some neighbors and or potential witnesses.  This obviously involved walking and or running a bit, if I remember correctly, although it's not the kind of, I suspect, peaceful meditative walk you're contemplating.  That Allen's kept his presence of mind enough to write this poem of course is meditative, in another way.  Anyway, there's another earlier poem of Allen's called At Apollinaire's Grave in which he visits Pere Lachaise in Paris.

I am leading a "walking & writing" workshop this Fall at Stanford, using the campus as our 'site'. One of the places I want us to walk is into Special Collections, which has the Ginsberg and Creeley archives.
It would be lovely to find - in advance - any poems by either poet that emerge out of a particular walk. And to have an original mss. available to see, explore.

I will appreciate any suggestions of titles - poems and/or journal pieces.

read this message and got the line "walking back into the retreat house"
in my head -- I don't know where this appears in AG's corpus, but the
passage below was used on Hydrogen Jukebox, the Philip Glass/Ginsberg
collaboration:

"Cabin In The Rockies"

Sitting on a tree stump with half cup of tea,
sundown behind mountains -
Nothing to do.
Not a word! Not a word!
Flies do all my talking for me -
and the wind says something else.
Fly on my nose,
I'm not the Buddha,
There's no enlightenment here!
In the half-light of dawn
A few birds warble
under the Pleiades.
An hour after dawn
I haven't thought of Buddha once yet!
- walking back into the retreat house.

Creeley:

"The Book" in _The Gold Diggers_.

"Walking" and "The Circle (Houses in" in _Words_.

***

The following two texts discuss walking in Creeley:

Chung, Ling. "Predicaments in Robert Creeley's _Words_." _Concerning =
Poetry_
2, no. 2 (Fall 1969): 32-35.

Collings, Raymond Douglas, Jr. "Four Short Story Writers from Black =
Mountain
College." M.A. thesis, University of North Carolina, 1968.

***

In addition:

Jerome Mazzaro wrote of Creeley's stumbling in _Pieces_ (_Kenyon Review_ =
32,
no. 1 *(whole no. 128)(Spring 1970): 163-68.) as well as in _For Love_ =
and
_Words_ ("Witnessing: Robert Creeley's 'I.'" _Crazyhourse_, no. 24 =
(Spring
1983): 59-78.

Other texts on his "practice stumbling" (N. Mackey) in terms of prose =
style,
but that's not what you want, right?

Call for Papers:

 "The Politics of Global Modernism: Revisiting Colonial Modernity"

39th Convention, Northeast Modern Language Association (NeMLA) April
10-13, 2008 Buffalo, New York

This panel proposes to examine the modernist cultural production of
marginal territories falling outside the Paris-London-New York nexus.
While contemporary criticism has emphasized the global dynamics of
modernist aesthetics, dominant understandings of modernist
internationalism seldom do away with the preponderance of
Anglo-French models of cosmopolitanism, whose encounters with
non-Western cultures more often than not reproduced imperialist,
orientalist dynamics. We will investigate alternative forms of
engagement with modernism on the part of marginalized artists, in
particular in a colonial context dominated by exclusive concepts of
Eurocentric modernity. How did marginalized cultural production from
the colonies undermine the imperialist patterns of appropriation of
"primitive" art and culture by mainstream modernism? In what forms
did vernacular modernisms, which distanced themselves from the mere
imitation of Euro-American models, emerge? How did these alternative
understandings of modernity engage with issues of cultural difference
on the global level? How do their contributions help
(re)conceptualize the relations, contradictions, and genealogies of
modernism and the modern? To what extent does their critical focus on
the vernacular provide a revision of modernism that would
successfully reflect the ever-shifting global dynamics of the
concept? While "modernism" will be primarily understood in its
aesthetic sense, papers investigating the intersection of vernacular
cultural productions and the theoretical/political critique of
modernity will be favored. Papers only addressing works and artists
from the Euro-American tradition will not be considered. Please send
250-word abstracts and short CVs to Edwige Tamalet Talbayev, UC San
Diego (etamalet@ucsd.edu) by September 30, 2007.

 Please include with your abstract:
Name and Affiliation Email address Postal address Telephone number
A/V requirements (if any)

The complete Call for Papers for the 2008 Convention will be posted
in June: http://www.nemla.org. Interested participants may submit
abstracts to more than one NeMLA panel; however panelists can only
present one paper.  Convention participants may present at a paper
session panel and also present at a creative session or participate
in a roundtable.

Sunday September 16 was the benefit for San Francisco State's august
Poetry Center and featured Robin Blaser at Knuth Hall in the Creative Arts
Building, rather a utilitarian auditorium well dressed by Steve Dickison
and staff to give a feeling of warmth, even sumptuousness, and a vase on
the floor startling with tall sunflowers.  Blaser avoided the podium and
sat with his material well marked in hand, in an orange jacket that picked
up something of that eerie sunflower light.

Being 82 hasn't taken away much of Blaser's glamor or erudition, and he
has always known how to switch up in the middle of a reading between the
heights of cosmogony and a low, earthy humor like Sophie Tucker, and thus
it was last night.  He came partly to celebrate the new editions of his
poems (THE HOLY FOREST) and essays (THE FIRE), and his reading ranged
widely--he announced that he was happy to hear that new editions of the
collected poems of Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer are on their way--

It was a thrill to hear Blaser read the “Great Companions: Robert Duncan”
and also the letter “to Robin” that’s in Spicer’s “Admonitions.”  (And
three poems by Spicer, including 2 from "15 False Propositions Against
God."  Then we got to hear maybe half an hour's worth of his own work, new
and old; and when I say "new,"there are apparently fourteen poems written
within the past 10 months, and the ones we heard were crackerjack.

Many of the usual suspects were there, including Michael McClure, Michael
Palmer, Norma Cole, Bob Gluck, Fran Herndon, David and Hilde Burton,
Christopher Wagstaff, Ariel Parkinson, Mark Linenthal, dozens more—I got
to meet Ken Bullock who was responsible for the super profile slash
interview that had appeared in the Berkeley Daily Planet last week--and to
which Ron Silliman linked on his blog.  Lots of the gang from UC Press,
who put out both THE FIRE and THE HOLY FOREST (forgive the Billy Joel like
pun!) but also tons of young people which was so nice to see.  Michael
Smoler and Marcus had driven up from LA to be there at this event--and
rousing rounds of applause which gratified Blaser—you could tell—to the
point of tears, this crazy loud applause which I hadn't heard since I used
to see Callas lecture at Juilliard in the early 70s.  Made me feel quite
an old hand it did!  But afterwards I told Dodie I was convinced that this
was not the last time we'd see Robin, far from it, he seems wonderfully
fit and he'll be around for many years--don't ask me how I know--I flunked
out of medical school--and I was only psychic one time--but come back to
me in 10 years and you'll see, he'll still be stumping the States.

Go to the third page of the album, where the most recent signs are
recorded, and click on each picture to get a larger image and each
sign's story.

During this past week the sidewalk blogger

--put up a roadside memorial to the war dead (or some of them)
--acquired a co-conspirator, L.S., who put up three signs on Kahekili
Highway
--put four signs up on two pedestrian bridges over major windward O`ahu
roadways, the Likelike in Kane`ohe and Kalanianaole Highway in Kailua.

Human modeling again (notes for a talk)


I think 4 aspects - psychoanalytics, avatar-skin, medical modeling, AI
communality/behavior/sociality - to be considered.

Well: Avatar-skin: surface of being human which is always a fiction; there
is no exacting boundary where body ends and environment begins (think of
breath, other processes). So this is splines, Bezier curves, NURBs, early
polygon work, etc. now automated by Poser etc. Avatar-skin also applies to
audio (later touch, scent, taste, etc.) - everything perceived from one
human or other organism to another.

Well: AI communality/behavior/sociality: the internally-automated behavior
of the avatar-skin; think of this as diachronic avatar, and avatar-skin as
synchronic; each moves through the other. With AI, avatar is somewhat
spread across the social; communication and communality extend the opaque
body (metaphorically) into the translucent.
Fundamental rules of the 'game' tending towards description.

Well: Medical modeling: Both diachronic and synchronic, the projected/
introjected organs of the avatar-skin, always on the level of a model,
i.e. a beating heart is fabricated on a subtextual level again from poly-
gons, curves, splines, etc. The ontology is different as long as one
remains within the realm of computational modeling. (One might say that
_inscription_ in the real is paralleled by _fissure_ in the virtual.)
Medical modeling is fundamental description tending towards explanation.

Well: Psychoanalytics: Here is where the following have to be taken into
account:
1. The abject: epistemological/ontological/inscriptive 'smears' across
domains. Corrosive and irreducible to the other categories.
2. Introjection/projection ('jectivity') - formation of internalized
images from virtual to real.
3. Obscenity and interjections: Breakdowns of communication within
communication.
Psychoanalytics are not susceptible to mathesis beyond topology.
(Level of the metaphoric: No verification procedures.)

But of course all of this is rough, not exactly accurate; ontology and
epistemology, various branches and techniques of mathematics, can be
thrown around heedlessly. Still I'd want to begin from the four aspects
described here: body/surface, psychoanalytics/'mind', AI/habitus, and
medical/observation-experimentation. One would have to further consider
the role of apparatus, observation, observer, in all of this.

One final note - the concern - that, with formal and informal modeling
systems of organisms/physics/mathematics: How is consciousness in
relation? In other words, _what are the effects on the reader/programmer/
experimenter? How do these relate to abjection and jectivity if at all?

thanks, jason.

'brush set' isn't as evocative as 'octopus' or 'ratking', but it conveys the
concept better, and it dawned on me today that's mainly what the primary
language around it has to do.

'mask set' would be accurate, because the 'brushes' are 'masks'. a 'mask' is
a grayscale graphic that hides and reveals some other graphic, in various
degrees of opacity, depending on the shades of grey in the 'mask'.

but 'mask set' is a bit esoteric.

'brush set' will give people something simple to begin with. it will get a
bit more complicated and, hopefully, exciting from there; hopefully, it'll
open into the creation of types of graphics no one has seen yet.

in transition from 'dbslideshow' to 'dbcinema'.

Hey, interesting stuff. Hope to hear more about it as you go.

Sam Weber at UCLA, by the way, is doing some interesting related work
on the skin as a sampling device, or a screen. and Wlad Godzich at UC
Santa Cruz is working with the possibility of using the DNA metaphor
for thinking about posthuman identity.

See also Steve Barker's book 'Autoaesthetics' which was quite early
and so, sometimes limited but the first two chapters are quite good.

There is a lot, I think to be done in thinking about iterative
identities. fluid dynamics and chaos theory are in some ways providing
us with a real chance to break down all of these body/surface
dualisms, (the brain, Godzich likes to say, is a very densely folded
skin, made out of that same material, he says).

And the insects/swarms are realy related to all of this, right?

i had an idea about avatars, and why this possibility of being in
multiple places at once, via virtuality, requires precisely if not an
iterative way of thinking than at least a relativistic, comparative
one, but it's a long story, moire patterns, duchamp. etc.

forward from Kimberly Nightingale:

Saint Paul Almanac Release Party is on Thursday, September 20, 6-9 p.m.

Everyone is invited to the Saint Paul Almanac book release party,
Thursday, Sept. 20, from 6 to 9 p.m. at the Black Dog Cafe & Wine Bar to
celebrate the release of the 2008 Saint Paul Almanac. The Black Dog is
in the heart of Lowertown, at 4th and Broadway in Downtown St. Paul, MN.

We're closing down the street just in front of the Black Dog, and the
Rondo HalfPintz Drill Team, Irish dancers Scoil na DTri, Hmong cultural
dancers and bagpiper Mike Breidenbach will be performing. Irv Williams
will play his butter-smooth sax with pianist Aane Fosse. You can also
street dance with the traditional folk band House Blend.

Many quintessential Saint Paul characters will mingle in the crowd,
including the Winter Carnival Royalty, Klondike Kates, and Wabasha
gangsters. Free appetizers will be served throughout the evening, and
we'll have doorprizes from Saint Paul retailers.

This is a free, family friendly event.

The Saint Paul Almanac celebrates the stories, poetry, history and other
writings related to Saint Paul and the people who've lived here.

This year's Almanac includes writing from Garrison Keillor, Alexs Pate,
Carol Connolly, David Mura, Ethna McKiernan, Mahmoud El-Kati, Phebe
Hanson, May Lee, and Brian Thao Worra.

We hope to see you there!

Best wishes,

Kimberly

...actually there's also Rae Armantrout reading this Thursday at the Kelly
Writers House on the Penn campus at 6pm, but that one seems to have gotten
lots of coverage.

At first I wasn't sure if I could get this link to stick, but this is a link
which then links up the 3 readings I was talking about:

I think this works!  If it does not work, just go to The PhillySound and
scroll to Sunday, 9/16

If you're in Philadelphia in September there's poetry every week, somewhere.

Sheila, it's good to hear from another Denis Johnson devote. I picked up a copy of The Incognito Lounge over, I think, 2 decades ago when I was miserable and living in Jacksonville, Florida. I got the book from the library. I picked it up because I thought it had a cool cover. I've been reading Johnson ever since. I haven't read the 'Nam novel yet, but I've heard it referred to as a "masterpiece" on more then a few occasions. It is interesting how the best poetry stays with you over the years. Having come across his work by chance is the sort of thing that normally happens in a Paul Auster novel. Johnson's poetry helped convince me to leave Jacksonville. I haven't regretted that decision. Take care,
                                                  Steve Russell

  Steve, When The Incognito Lounge came out (it's named after a place very close to here), I memorized the whole title poem, and continue to celebrate many of the pieces in that book. The feel of the poems included changes across years, but I have always loved it - just in different ways. I knew Denis a bit when he was here in the Valley, and joined him and others in a writing group occasionally.

He is indeed poetic and visionary as a novelist, as well. Looking forward to the new novel. Well received so far.

Regarding Harrison, his ghazals are splendid, and I've read most of his work, also.

I can see why you are taken with the work of these two, in addition to Auster's whose work are less directly familiar to me at this time (but it won't be too long).

Denis Johnson has just published a new novel, The Tree of Smoke. I love the guys work. Anyone read Jesus' Son, or his poetry collected in The Incognito Lounge? He's in the same league with Jim Harrison and Paul Auster. These 3 are visionary authors. They've each written major work in fiction and poetry, as well as first rate short stories and plays. Great writers.

Subject: theory. the real. death.

theory. the real. death.


Torture is senseless violence, born in fear. The purpose of it is to force
from one tongue, amid its screams and its vomiting up of blood, the secret
of _everything._ Senseless violence: whether the victim talks or whether
he dies under his agony, the secret that he cannot tell is always some-
where else and out of reach. It is the executioner who becomes Sisyphus.
If he puts _the question_ at all, he will have to continue forever.

Sartre (in the afterword to Henri Alleg, The Question, 1958)

Experiment solitary touching the impossibility of annihilation.

100. There is nothing more certain in nature than that it is impossible
for any body to be utterly annihilated; but that as it was the work of the
omnipotency of God to make somewhat of nothing, so it requireth the like
omnipotency to turn somewhat into nothing. And therefore it is well said
by an obscure writer of the sect of the chemists, that there is no such
way to effect the strange transmutations of bodies, as to endevour and
urge by all means the reducing of them to nothing. And herein is contained
also a great secret of preservation of bodies from change; for if you can
prohibit, that they neither turn into air, because no air cometh to them;
nor go into the bodies adjacent, because they are utterly heterogeneal;
nor make a round and circulation within themselves; they will never
change, though they be in their nature never so perishable or mutable.

Dear Grant,
thank you so much for compiling this!--it's so hard to keep track of how many independent bookstores are closing--it's happening so fast--thanks for the help with finding out how many are still open.

One of my favorite writers also. One line from the title story of JESUS SON=
 stands out: the drug-addled narrator, no hero, finds himself alive in the =
midst of gore after a car crash. In response to some request for help that =
he cannot accommodate (too stoned), he says(I'm paraphrasing slightly), "Li=
ke I'm the president of this tragedy."

My copy of the book is at my office or I'd look it up. Better yet, everyone=
 read the story to find the actual quote.

I've thought about this line many times in the last seven years.

I lent my copy to a friend who moved to New York.  She claims to have returned it to me.  I think I would have remembered.

  One of my favorite writers also. One line from the title story of JESUS SON stands out: the drug-addled narrator, no hero, finds himself alive in the midst of gore after a car crash. In response to some request for help that he cannot accommodate (too stoned), he says(I'm paraphrasing slightly), "Like I'm the president of this tragedy."

My copy of the book is at my office or I'd look it up. Better yet, everyone read the story to find the actual quote.

I've thought about this line many times in the last seven years.

>Sheila, it's good to hear from another Denis Johnson devote. I picked up a copy of The Incognito Lounge over, I think, 2 decades ago when I was miserable and living in Jacksonville, Florida. I got the book from the library. I picked it up because I thought it had a cool cover. I've been reading Johnson ever since. I haven't read the 'Nam novel yet, but I've heard it referred to as a "masterpiece" on more then a few occasions. It is interesting how the best poetry stays with you over the years. Having come across his work by chance is the sort of thing that normally happens in a Paul Auster novel. Johnson's poetry helped convince me to leave Jacksonville. I haven't regretted that decision. Take care,

He's in the same league with Jim Harrison and Paul Auster. These 3 are visionary authors. They've each written major work in fiction and poetry, as well as first rate short stories and plays. Great writers.

Linda,

That's such a coincidence. I just taught JUST that paragraph last week in my intro creative writing class. I typed up the paragraph and asked my students (in pairs) to rewrite it in a way that would be as sentimental and cliché as possible. It was pretty funny.

best,

Joanna

One of my favorite writers also. One line from the title story of JESUS SON stands out: the drug-addled narrator, no hero, finds himself alive in the midst of gore after a car crash. In response to some request for help that he cannot accommodate (too stoned), he says(I'm paraphrasing slightly), "Like I'm the president of this tragedy."

My copy of the book is at my office or I'd look it up. Better yet, everyone read the story to find the actual quote.

I've thought about this line many times in the last seven years.

Linda

I highly recommend folks spend a few moments trolling around.  Simply
for signing up for one of their newsletters I got more than 50%
discounts.  Special gems I got are a hard cover of Silliman's Age of
Huts for like $7 & Maximus Poems for $20.

I also got a few wine books I've wanted for a long time.

Notes from the Structure of Reality


In my Structure of Reality (which is under review), there are three funda-
mental layers to what I call the 'topology of intention'; these are of
interest since they critique any structuring, conscious or unconscious,
'like a language.' The layers are the real, interpretation, and language;
there is a 'zone' between the real and interpretation, and mappings all
across the layers. The real is knowable through interpretation which does
not presuppose language (syntactics, sememe); the mappings are tight, how-
ever, between interpretation and language. One might think of this as a
pre-linguistic representation without the thwarting embodiment of lan-
guage. You can see this at work when the 'unnamed' of the real skews into
anomaly - in other words, when anomaly appears without the aegis of lang-
uage. Consider for example something falling without the presence of an
ostensible object; the 'something falling' might be construed as such by a
thud or less-interpretable sound. Repeat this enough and a name is gener-
ated; if it remains on the level of a singularity or the anecdote, it
might be quickly forgotten - except for the possibility of a marker of
some sort, for example, a recording.

Heinz von Foerster: "Since nothing in the environment corresponds to
negation, negation as well as all other 'logical particles' (inclusion,
alternation, implication, etc.) must arise within the organism as a
consequence of perceiving the relation of itself with respect to its
environment." (From "Thoughts and Notes on Cognition.") SoR p. 69

Cyclical chains sailing past O and I - maybe modeling through the tangent
function. Is the repetition assumed to be 'complete'? A cyclical chain is
a loop with any number of nodes; think of one as nul, O, and another or
the same as universal, I. Then circle. What happens? One moves from 0
through infinity perhaps then back again. The simplest equation here:
tangent. Each revolution is marked perhaps by sliding along the x-axis:
equivalent but not identical graphs. And so we're there. We can visit as
many times as we like.

Does distributivity really fail w gesture? (The old Land experiments in
color vision as well as a structural analysis of gesture seem to imply
that distributivity in Aristotelian logic fails in daily life - which
further implies the potential for superimposition as the basis for a logic
of gesture.)

The thinness of language - ontologically existing on the level of the
sheave - language carries no weight at all. From within the avatar, the
sheaves, surfaces, have zero-width, one-pixel width, nul-width, as 2d
mathematical manifolds embedded within 3d space; they've all got the same
measure as the continuum, but zero volume in the embedding space - like-
wise language has zero volume.

Language, speaking, is always frustrated, flustered. It can't get around
things. Meaning: One can't get around things through language, not even
through performatives (which indicate real-material embodiment elsewhere).

Meditation medication goes nowhere.

Aristotle's Problems - sexual problems related to fluidity, abjection, in
part iv - numbers pp 327-328, Loeb edition. The beginning of the fifteenth
book is of great interest - he describes number systems with different
bases which is fascinating given the apparent absence of zero.

Conservancy of the Problems, Bacon of all people working through them
almost two thousand years later; not that much had changed. The Problems
are on the level of the anecdote - curiosity cabinet, wonders - same as
any fundamentalist text - wonder upon wonder without internalized
structure or subtext - everything is new, raw, unrelated. Or causality is
pushed back into categories which are taken for granted, even though, like
heat or air, they're composite.

What is meant by modeling? Think of a 'world-particle' W whose scope is
anything, process, etc.: W( ... ). what does that tell us? What are the
processes of narrowing the scope, increasing the information - in other
words filtering?

Along these lines, modeling is always a filtering.

Four negations: annihilation, -x s.t. --x > x; 'chain negation' s.t. -x >
y; -y > z or whatever; combinations of these; negative of the 'set-aside'
- form of retrievable absence.

States and nodes of graphs represented/mapped into states and nodes of
graphs - this includes the possibility of 'foreign' graphs which are
disruptive. The whole becomes an excursion into description rather than
explanation, which is seen as a subset.

There should be limited copies of the Structure of Reality online/offline
- dates from 1977, I wasn't a child.

FootHills Publishing is pleased to announce the release of

"The Night We Danced With the Raelettes"

Occurrences In and Around College Park Maryland
in the 1960s  For the Most Part
To the Best of My Recollection

a collection of poems by Charles Rossiter.

(Ordering information below)

It's all here: leaving home for the first time, hanging out with guys from the dorm; road trips; summer jobs as diverse and improbable as delivering yeast for Budweiser, supervising a pick-your-own strawberry patch, and sweating it out in the coal fields of Bethlehem Steel.  There are also musings about life, literature, friendship, and the bliss and pain that comes with searching for, finding, and losing love.


"Charlie Rossiter's book takes us a high-speed journey into memory and the past. It makes the 60's come alive again. More importantly, it makes us laugh and cry. Tender, funny, evocative, this book is one not to be missed."

>From the Book:

When Someone Asks Me Who Was First

We still lived in dorms
segregated by sex
but I lived on the first floor
in back
which meant that
once we decided
it was easy
to lift her through the window
walk around
and come in the front door
as if nothing monumental
were about to happen
but it did
right there
in my narrow iron dorm bed
just a wall away
from the distant din
of rowdy dorm guys
without dates
on saturday night.

When someone asks me
who was first
I think of Nanya
and that night
which is not precisely true.
There was someone or two
before her, I'm almost certain.
I forget the details
and the names.

But the night I lifted
Nanya through the window
as if she were
a princess, Lady Guenivere,
Rapunsel-in-Reverse,
and I were Galahad
or Robin Hood
or any stirring figure
out of myth or legend.

That night
she became the first.


Charlie Rossiter, NEA Fellowship recipient and threetime Pushcart Prize nominee, hosts the audio website poetrypoetry.com.  A widelypublished poet, his work has been featured on NPR and numerous statewide public radio networks.  During the `90s he hosted the Poetry Motel TV program, still seen on cable stations in some parts of the Northeast.  His chapbook, What Men Talk About, won the first Red Wheel Barrow Prize from Pudding House Press.  Other publications include CR's Greatest Hits: 19752001 and Around the House, also from Pudding House Press. He recently performed at the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival in NJ, and was among a handful of poets selected to perform at the 2005 Chicago Blues Festival.  An expanded 2nd edition of Back Beat, his co-authored book of memoir and poetry was published by Fractal Edge Press (2006). He is profiled in Contemporary Authors.  Some of the poems in this collection formed the basis of The Night We Danced With the Raelettes, a
 one-person play produced at Victory Gardens Theatre in Chicago.

Yeah, what a fantastic reading. Such incredible writing, and such a gorgeous, mellifluous voice. It felt historic, and very present. I feel fortunate to have been able to make it to SFSU before heading back to Madison. Still reeling from Blaser, from Norma Cole and Robert Gluck's lovely speeches... I had told myself, "you've got the Coach House edition--don't be too hasty..." but here I am, with the expanded "Holy Forest" and "The Fire," and thoroughly the better for it. He's an inspiration, no doubt about it.

Subject: Charles Rossiter Poetry Book Published


FootHills Publishing is pleased to announce the release of

"The Night We Danced With the Raelettes"

Occurrences In and Around College Park Maryland
in the 1960s  For the Most Part
To the Best of My Recollection

a collection of poems by Charles Rossiter.

(Ordering information below)

It's all here: leaving home for the first time, hanging out with guys from
the dorm; road trips; summer jobs as diverse and improbable as delivering
yeast for Budweiser, supervising a pick-your-own strawberry patch, and
sweating it out in the coal fields of Bethlehem Steel.  There are also
musings about life, literature, friendship, and the bliss and pain that
comes with searching for, finding, and losing love.


"Charlie Rossiter's book takes us a high-speed journey into memory and the
past. It makes the 60's come alive again. More importantly, it makes us
laugh and cry. Tender, funny, evocative, this book is one not to be missed."

Maria Mazziotti Gillan
Founder & Executive Director, Poetry Center, Passaic Co. CC,
Paterson, NJ and editor, Paterson Literary Review.


From the Book:

When Someone Asks Me Who Was First

We still lived in dorms
segregated by sex
but I lived on the first floor
in back
which meant that
once we decided
it was easy
to lift her through the window
walk around
and come in the front door
as if nothing monumental
were about to happen
but it did
right there
in my narrow iron dorm bed
just a wall away
from the distant din
of rowdy dorm guys
without dates
on saturday night.

When someone asks me
who was first
I think of Nanya
and that night
which is not precisely true.
There was someone or two
before her, I'm almost certain.
I forget the details
and the names.

But the night I lifted
Nanya through the window
as if she were
a princess, Lady Guenivere,
Rapunsel-in-Reverse,
and I were Galahad
or Robin Hood
or any stirring figure
out of myth or legend.

That night
she became the first.


Charlie Rossiter, NEA Fellowship recipient and threetime Pushcart Prize
nominee, hosts the audio website poetrypoetry.com.  A widelypublished poet,
his work has been featured on NPR and numerous statewide public radio
networks.  During the `90s he hosted the Poetry Motel TV program, still seen
on cable stations in some parts of the Northeast.  His chapbook, What Men
Talk About, won the first Red Wheel Barrow Prize from Pudding House Press.
Other publications include CR's Greatest Hits: 19752001 and Around the House
 also from Pudding House Press. He recently performed at the Geraldine R.
Dodge Poetry Festival in NJ, and was among a handful of poets selected to
perform at the 2005 Chicago Blues Festival.  An expanded 2nd edition of Back
Beat, his co-authored book of memoir and poetry was published by Fractal
Edge Press (2006). He is profiled in Contemporary Authors.  Some of the
poems in this collection formed the basis of The Night We Danced With the
Raelettes, a one-person play produced at Victory Gardens Theatre in Chicago.

Had I done what a lot of people seem to do, you would have received a
dozen screens of unncessary quoting.  Please edit your replies and cut

It gets in the way of my reading Alan Sondheim's marvelous posts.

The Dangerfield Prize

I'm naming this post after something completely chimerical, as real at
present as /Nessiteras rhombopteryx/ (the Loch Ness monster) or other
triumphs of cryptozoology. But the Dangerfield Prize, and prizes like it,
may have more going for them than cryptids like Nessie.

Last month I mentioned the scholarship recently established for a student
graduating from first Canadian poet laureate George Bowering's old high
school in Oliver, British Columbia, who "must have a demonstrated interest
in writing and be a bit of a pain in the ass."

This scholarship, as I said at the time, opens up all sorts of new
imaginative vistas for awards. I'm forced to think about awards in the fall,
when I have to decide whether to nominate ten people (plus any number of
single works in journals or other small press publications) for the Pushcart
Prize. If I decide to participate, as I've done since 2002, my ten nominees
will get a letter from Pushcart asking them to send their own selection from
their 2007 small press-published work for consideration for the next year's
anthology. If I also nominate single pieces from magazines and anthologies,
the editors of those publications will get slightly different (but similar)
letters.

If any of my nominees actually wins, they'll become contributing editors as
well and get to send in their own lists of nominations in future years.

So why do I have to think about whether to go through this drill? Why isn't
it more fun? Because since I've been doing it, only one of my nominees has
actually won a Pushcart. The sheer number of nominations pouring in to
Pushcart's P.O. box in Wainscott, NY, is enormous and (do the math: each
year's winners become nominators) growing like kudzu every year. So any
individual nominee stands a vanishingly small chance of winning.

On top of this, there's more than a small aesthetic difference between my
taste and that of the annually-chosen poetry editors. Bill Henderson, who
founded Pushcart because of his own frustrations with the literary
establishment, is, I suspect, a sterling guy who's pursued his mission with
nothing short of heroism. Unfortunately, though, we don't happen to be on
the same page (for the most part) about what constitutes an outstanding work
of poetry in a given year.

That, I think, is to be expected: these are /his/ awards, his bailiwick, and
his taste (and that of his chosen editors) rules the day. But as a result I
have to wonder: shall I really trouble, say, Rae Armantrout with another
nomination, when she's never won? Why should she bother to go through the
fairly onerous drill, only to lose yet again?

Even worse, if I do nominate her again, and she puts herself through those
paces, doesn't she begin to associate me with the absurdity of it all? Have
I really done her a good turn, or have I wasted her time? Questions like
these have made me puzzle over my nominations year after year, never
seriously considering some extremely worthy candidates because I know they
stand zero chance, and apologizing in advance to those I do nominate for
what may be a particularly thankless errand.

All this, plus the fact that there is almost universal frustration with
awards of all kinds, has made me wonder: what's stopping any of us from
taking a page from Bowering's book, or Henderson's, and launching our own
awards?

After all, there is actually no prize with a Pushcart Prize, other than
publication. The scholarship given in Bowering's name (though probably not
endowed from his personal kitty, though I don't have the inside poop) is
obviously something most of us can't dream of setting up. But even if the
prize loot were extremely modest indeed, or nonexistent -- other than some
sort of fuss made by announcement and (for example) publication of the
winning work(s) somewhere -- wouldn't it, at the very least, make some
deserving writer's day, and be an absolute hoot?

And, if the standards exercised were rigorous enough -- or witty and
cryptozoologically wild enough -- couldn't it become more than that? Would
it be ridiculous to hope that (in some small way) it could actually help to
shape the aesthetic environment of the times?

That's why I'm musing on a still very-much-imaginary Dangerfield Prize, and
why I hope others will indulge in similar musings of their own.

Could the ancients hear spherics directly? Oh, I think so!
Otherwise the drums would not have been constructed with additive
functions in mind.
Nor with spectral tonalities in mind.
Remember, they harbor air and other spherics, closed and vibrating!
But surely not the aurora, is that additive?
Or magnetic storms, antipodean lightning strikes, are they additive?
Every particle has its split-second say! The drum reflects!
The drum resonates! Eight fingers, two thumbs, the drum resonates!
Whose counting? I am.

Axton Poetry Fellow,
University of Louisville, Fall 2008

Writers who have received their terminal degree within
the last five years in Creative Writing are invited to
apply for an Axton Fellowship in Creative
Writing.  The purpose of these fellowships is to
provide recent graduates with time to further their
own work, to associate them with a distinguished
faculty, and to allow them to contribute to a vibrant
creative writing community.

Two fellows, one in poetry and one in fiction, will be
appointed for the academic years 2008-2009 and
2009-2010, and will be awarded a stipend and benefits.
Each fellow will give a reading in the Axton reading
series once during her or his tenure, will run one,
two-day literary seminar, and will teach one
course each semester.  Of these courses, one will be
of the fellow's design, another will be on the
teaching of creative writing, and the other
two will be upper level creative writing or literature
courses.  The fellows will be expected
to be in residence in Louisville during their
fellowship period.

The fellowships will provide a stipend of $25,000 a
year plus benefits for two years.

Candidates for the fellowship should submit the
following documents:
a) a current CV
b) a one-page proposal for an undergraduate course
c) a writing sample-no more than 25 pages
d) at least three letters of recommendation.

Applications must be postmarked by November 2, 2007.

Mail applications to: Axton Fellowships, Paul Griner,
Director of Creative Writing, Department of English,

Music Scholar Barred =46rom U.S., but No One Will Tell Her Why

By NINA BERNSTEIN
Published: September 17, 2007

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/17/nyregion/17musicologist.html

Nalini Ghuman, an up-and-coming musicologist and expert on the =20
British composer Edward Elgar, was stopped at the San Francisco =20
airport in August last year and, without explanation, told that she =20
was no longer allowed to enter the United States.

The latest news and reader discussions from around the five boroughs =20
and the region.
Go to City Room =BB

Her case has become a cause c=E9l=E8bre among musicologists and the =20
subject of a protest campaign by the American Musicological Society =20
and by academic leaders like Leon Botstein, the president of Bard =20
College at Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., where Ms. Ghuman was to have =20
participated last month in the Bard Music Festival, showcasing =20
Elgar=92s music.

But the door has remained closed to Ms. Ghuman, an assistant =20
professor at Mills College in Oakland, Calif., who is British and who =20=

had lived, studied and worked in this country for 10 years before her =20=

abrupt exclusion.

The mystery of her case shows how difficult, if not impossible, it is =20=

to defend against such a decision once the secretive government =20
process has been set in motion.

After a year of letters and inquiries, Ms. Ghuman and her Mills =20
College lawyer have been unable to find out why her residency visa =20
was suddenly revoked, or whether she was on some security watch list. =20=

Nor does she know whether her application for a new visa, pending =20
since last October, is being stymied by the shadow of the same =20
unspecified problem or mistake.

In a tearful telephone interview from her parents=92 home in western =20
Wales, Ms. Ghuman, 34, an Oxford graduate who earned her Ph.D. from =20
the University of California, Berkeley, said she felt like a =20
character in Kafka.

=93I don=92t know why it=92s happened, what I=92m accused of,=94 she =
said. =20
=93There=92s no opportunity to defend myself. One is just completely =20
powerless.=94

Kelly Klundt, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection in the =20
Department of Homeland Security, said officers at San Francisco =20
International Airport had no choice but to bar Ms. Ghuman because the =20=

State Department, at its discretion, had revoked her visa. The State =20
Department would not discuss the case, citing the confidentiality of =20
individual visa records.

Mr. Botstein, who wrote to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in the =20=

hope of having the visa problem resolved before the music festival, =20
said Ms. Ghuman=92s case is symptomatic. =93This is an example of the =20=

xenophobia, incompetence, stupidity and then bureaucratic =20
intransigence that we are up against,=94 he said, also citing the case =20=

of a teacher of Arabic at Bard who missed the first weeks of the =20
spring semester this year because of visa problems. =93What is at stake =20=

is America=92s pre-eminence as a place of scholarship.=94

Ms. Ghuman is certainly not alone in her frustration. Academic and =20
civil liberties groups point to other foreign scholars who have been =20
denied entry without explanation at an airport, or refused a visa =20
when they applied. A pending lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties =20
Union contends that the Bush administration is using heightened =20
security measures to keep foreign scholars out on ideological grounds =20=

in violation of the First Amendment rights of American scholars to =20
hear them.

But Ms. Ghuman=92s case does not seem to fit such a pattern. Few =20
believe that her book in progress, =93India in the English Musical =20
Imagination, 1890-1940,=94 or her work on Elgar, best known by =20
Americans for =93Pomp and Circumstance,=94 could have raised red flags =
in =20
Washington. And if it were a question of security profiling, nothing =20
in her background fits.

She was born in Wales. Her mother is a British homemaker, and her =20
father, an emeritus professor of educational psychology at the =20
University of Wales, was born in India to a Sikh family and moved to =20
Britain in the 1960s. Last semester, Ms. Ghuman tried to teach her =20
students by video link. This academic year, she is on an unpaid leave =20=

of absence.

=93The arbitrary and inexplicable exclusion of Dr. Ghuman has been a =20
personal tragedy for her and a cause of distress to Mills and to =20
American higher education,=94 said Janet L. Holmgren, the president of =20=

Mills College, who called her =93one of our most distinguished faculty =20=

members.=94

=93She seems to be in this limbo,=94 said Ms. Ghuman=92s fianc=E9, Paul =20=

Flight, 47, who has visited her three times in Britain and is =20
considering a move there. Mr. Flight, a countertenor, co-directed =20
Darius Milhaud=92s opera about Orpheus and Eurydice with Ms. Ghuman at =20=

Mills three years ago.

Ms. Ghuman=92s descent into the bureaucratic netherworld began on Aug. =20=

8, 2006, when she and Mr. Flight returned to San Francisco from a =20
research trip to Britain. Armed immigration officers met them at the =20
airplane door and escorted Ms. Ghuman away.

In a written account of the next eight hours that she prepared for =20
her lawyer, Ms. Ghuman said that officers tore up her H-1B visa, =20
which was valid through May 2008, defaced her British passport, and =20
seemed suspicious of everything from her music cassettes to the fact =20
that she had listed Welsh as a language she speaks. A redacted =20
government report about the episode obtained by her lawyer under the =20
Freedom of Information Act erroneously described her as =93Hispanic.=94

WHAT ARE THESE FISH

Please help me, what are these fish? Large schools gathered
tightly together in the Providence River, Rhode Island.
They're about 18" in length. I can only guess invasive species,
maybe ocean-hungry spawning but I DON'T KNOW FISH.

Time: late afternoon/early evening.

Behavior: Swarming, schooling, occasional 'flashing' of sides.
Color: Seemed almost transparent, grey-blue, dull.

I believe the fish may be herring, which are found in the Providence River.  Herring also have a black spot behind their gills, as do those in your photos.  Eighteen inches is pretty large for Atlantic herring, but not unheard of.  Hopefully, you can confirm this with someone familiar with the fish population in your area.

Very cool photos!  Thanks.

If thin, smelt or alewives. If chubby, shad.

As soon as I saw them the word "menhaden" came to mind...I don't remember
ever encountering this word consciously, so I looked it up...

if they are indeed menhaden....

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT:
=20
BASIC AND BOLD: LOGOS R US =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 9TH
=20
Every writer finds a niche, a gesture, the thing that works in what they do=
.
At some point it may become a style or convention.  Sometimes it becomes a
crutch.  One way to break the mode is to be radical=8Bthat is, return to the
roots.  What brought you to poetry in the first place? This is a workshop
for writers who want to re-look at how the structure and elements of poetry
provide the wherewithal to make poems that are as ambitious, thoughtful and
innovative as you want them to be. There will be in class writing,
assignments, reading, and a revision project called =8BCAN THIS POEM BE
SAVED?=8B in which you bring a poem that simply has not come to closure; seem=
s
to be stuck; or needs to be looked at by fresh eyes in the hope of finding
what could make it work. This workshop is geared toward writers who have
been seriously writing for some time.  Please submit 5-8 pages of poetry an=
d
a brief description of what you=B9d like to accomplish in the workshop by
September 28. African American poet, playwright and cultural commentator,
Patricia Spears Jones is author of two collections, Femme du Monde and The
Weather That Kills.
=20
POETRY LAB: FORMS OF JOYFUL EXPERIMENTATION =AD TODD COLBY
FRIDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 12TH


In this workshop we'll forge new paths to the poem by investigating how far
a poem can depart from being =B3a poem=B2 and yet still be a poem. We'll
experiment with breath, heartbeat, movement, blogs, the alchemy of words,
visions, letters to the editor, spontaneity, psychoanalysis, collaborations=
,
appropriations and self-hypnosis, along with various traditional forms. The
main objective is to create a supportive and inviting atmosphere in our
joyfully experimental "Lab." A partial reading list will include: Hannah
Weiner, Jacques Lacan, Gertrude Stein, Diane Williams, David Markson,
Miranda July, Thomas Bernhard, Bill Knott, Arthur Rimbaud, Alice Notley,
Mina Loy, Charles Olson, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Todd Colby is the author
of Tremble & Shine, Riot in the Charm Factory, Cush, and Ripsnort, all of
which were published by Soft Skull Press.
=20
WORLDLY AND INFINITELY DIMENSIONAL:
A WORKSHOP =AD RACHEL LEVITSKY
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 13
=20
In these times, the possibilities by which we may amplify, record, document=
,
display, shape, formulate, and publish words increases daily. Although
expanded media and its wide reach are in themselves a meaningful fact of ou=
r
times, they don=B9t necessarily enhance a poetry=B9s resonance. How do we, and
by we I mean both ourselves as ones and ourselves as groups, best construct
and perform our poetries so as to be present in these particular times and
yet open to the infinite possibilities of =B3projection,=B2 =B3conception,=B2
=B3performance=B2? Familiarizing ourselves with poets like Abigail Child, Julie
Patton, Cecilia Vicu=F1a, Bob Dylan, Linton Kwesi Johnson (some will be
visiting the workshop), we will consider all means available and any means
necessary to project living works into our world. Individually and
collaboratively we=B9ll construct performances, visual works, sound events,
improvisations, etc. Rachel Levitsky is the author of Under the Sun
(Futurepoem) and is the founder and co-editor of Belladonna Books.
=20
=20
The workshop fee is $350, which includes a one-year individual Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all fall spring and fall classes=
.

Lyrical Fiction Writing Workshop for Intermediate & Advanced Writers
(Greenwich Village or other location in the vicinity)

I'm a widely published fiction writer and poet, the
publisher/editor-in-chief of an increasingly popular and respected
literary/multi-media e-journal, and an instructor/workshop leader of fiction
writing and performance reading at an arts center in Queens, where I've
received glowing reviews. I've also been an adjunct instructor of English in
two area colleges, a copy-editor/writer for a well-known glossy magazine,
and a featured reader in many prose and poetry series in the vicinity and
elsewhere. I run my own series at the KGB Bar. Finally, I have a Master's
Degree in Social Work, with a concentration in community organizing and
social group work. The skills I learned during my pursuit of the degree come
in very handy in a workshop setting. Ok. Enough about me already!

If enough writers are interested (two have responded thus far), I will offer
the following workshop, including a session or two on performance reading,
at participants' request. I envision leading 6 - 8 intensive, weekly, or
bi-monthly meetings in my apartment or elsewhere in the Greenwich/West
Village vicinity. Dates and times will be scheduled according to
participants' needs and preferences. Cost will be reasonable and dependent
on several factors.

This is not a typical write by rules "how to" workshop; it's for serious
writers of literary fictions, fusions, and/or poems. If you're a fiction
writer, you might end up writing some poetry, as one of my students did,
much to her shock and delight!


LYRICAL FICTION WRITING

The discovery and development of one's authentic voice/s through surrender
to process is a liberating experience, sometimes exhausting, but always
energizing in the deepest sense. This workshop will sharpen writing skills,
with a focus on process and language, language as music and visual art, via
discussions, writing exercises, prompts, and readings of other authors'
prose, as well as prose by participants. How can we tap into our unique
thinking, feeling and knowing processes to discover and develop our own
special voices, create prose that sings, and images that startle, delight,
and disturb? This workshop is for intermediate and advanced writers
interested in exploring what they can do with language. It is also a
stimulating and inspiring course for those who suffer from so-called
writers' block.

Thanks everyone! I think they're menhaden which are fascinating fish -
there are enormous numbers, important for ocean ecology, filter-feeders
and little known, related to herrings. It was amazing watching them.
Menhaden grow to 15" which seems about right.

Thanks again! - Alan

      Pulitzer Winner to Take Over as New Yorker's Poetry Editor

  Paul Muldoon will become poetry editor of The New Yorker.


  By MOTOKO RICH
  Published: September 20, 2007
    Alice Quinn, the poetry editor of The New Yorker, is stepping down after 20 years and will be succeeded in one of the most influential posts in the poetry world by Paul Muldoon, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet.
  Mr. Muldoon, 56, will remain chairman of the Princeton University Center for the Creative and Performing Arts. An Irish-born poet who has published 10 volumes of verse, he will also continue to write and teach at Princeton.
  Ms. Quinn, 58, will leave the magazine in early November. She is executive director of the Poetry Society of America and an adjunct professor at Columbia University's School of the Arts. She said she wanted to devote more time to those jobs as well as to a collection of Elizabeth Bishop's journals and notebooks that she is editing. "I had to keep stealing days to get up to the archive during the week," she said, referring to the collection of Ms. Bishop's papers at Vassar College. "I don't want to take five or six years doing this book."
  Mr. Muldoon quickly emerged as the leading candidate after Ms. Quinn announced her intentions.
  "It's not just a matter of picking the best poet you can think of," said David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker. "It's also somebody who would know how to be in touch with an enormous range of poets, and that narrows it down a little bit more. And also somebody who's not in Alaska."
  Mr. Remnick added that the selection of Mr. Muldoon, who had his first poem published when he was just 16, did not represent "some sort of radical aesthetic or theoretical shift."
  He added, "It's not as if we went from a structuralist to a post-structuralist or a Beat to a conservative."
  In her tenure at the magazine, Ms. Quinn, who was also a fiction editor for 14 years, worked with a range of poets that included Joseph Brodsky, Jane Kenyon, Louise Glück, Yusef Komunyakaa, John Ashbery, Charles Simic, Eavan Boland and Mark Strand. Ms. Quinn said she was particularly proud of having introduced so many poets in translation to New Yorker audiences.
  The magazine has sometimes been criticized for publishing the same poets repeatedly and playing favorites, but Ms. Quinn said that 85 percent of what she published came to her in the mail "with little or no notice." She said that the magazine regularly received more than 600 poems a week.
  Mr. Muldoon said he had no particular agenda for the job, which is a part-time post. "One would want to be absolutely open to the poem that one simply did not expect to have made its way into the world and somehow suddenly falls on one's desk," he said.

My grandfather was a herring broker. Unfortunately, I can't stand herring.

I wonder what David Bromige thinks of herring.

Well I certainly got good use out of the old exchange rate--did Vancouver
on $1 to $1.50 rate just a few years ago, but nothing lasts forever...and
I'll still be up there when I get a chance, and I'll still be using rte 3
from Buffalo to Detroit because it's such a much more pleasant drive on
the north side of the lake.  In fact, I'll be there next month.

So, enjoy, my Canadian friends...perhaps more of you will come down for a
visit, readings, etc.

There is a recent book about menhaden by H. Bruce Franklin, called "The Most
Important Fish in the Sea" -- apparently the menhaden fishery is one of the
largest industries in the atlantic.  They are an important source of oil,
and a major ingredient in pet food.  They also eat algae, and the
overfishing of menhaden causes red tides etc. that obliterate all forms of
sea life.

Alan, stop by the store later today and I'll sell you a copy of that book...

China's government has discussed the possibility of exercising the "nuclear option" for some time - most often on CCTV9, English language programming modeled after CNN and promising a "Chinese perspective". And the media, necessarily, is state-controlled - at least on the Mainland. Yes, one enters Hong Kong, at least I do, to the comforting activism of human rights organizations and locals very much a part of what's political culture. Be warned and, perhaps, wary, because the world is gonna look different soon. And having been away from life in the U.S. for so long, nearly nine years, I cannot help but to wonder, head in hands, all idealism decapitated, how it is the "riotous many" Stateside have manage to f@*k things up so badly. Start reading Sun Tzu's "Art of War". Consider, too, what a "win-win situation" actually means.

China threatens 'nuclear option' of dollar sales
By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard
Last Updated: 8:39pm BST 10/08/2007



The Chinese government has begun a concerted campaign of economic threats against the United States, hinting that it may liquidate its vast holding of US treasuries if Washington imposes trade sanctions to force a yuan revaluation.



Two officials at leading Communist Party bodies have given interviews in recent days warning - for the first time - that Beijing may use its $1.33 trillion (£658bn) of foreign reserves as a political weapon to counter pressure from the US Congress.

Shifts in Chinese policy are often announced through key think tanks and academies. Described as China's "nuclear option" in the state media, such action could trigger a dollar crash at a time when the US currency is already breaking down through historic support levels.

It would also cause a spike in US bond yields, hammering the US housing market and perhaps tipping the economy into recession. It is estimated that China holds over $900bn in a mix of US bonds.

Xia Bin, finance chief at the Development Research Centre (which has cabinet rank), kicked off what now appears to be government policy with a comment last week that Beijing's foreign reserves should be used as a "bargaining chip" in talks with the US.

"Of course, China doesn't want any undesirable phenomenon in the global financial order," he added.

He Fan, an official at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, went even further today, letting it be known that Beijing had the power to set off a dollar collapse if it choose to do so.

"China has accumulated a large sum of US dollars. Such a big sum, of which a considerable portion is in US treasury bonds, contributes a great deal to maintaining the position of the dollar as a reserve currency. Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced the their dollar holdings.

"China is unlikely to follow suit as long as the yuan's exchange rate is stable against the dollar. The Chinese central bank will be forced to sell dollars once the yuan appreciated dramatically, which might lead to a mass depreciation of the dollar," he told China Daily.

The threats play into the presidential electoral campaign of Hillary Clinton, who has called for restrictive legislation to prevent America being "held hostage to economic decicions being made in Beijing, Shanghai, or Tokyo".

She said foreign control over 44pc of the US national debt had left America acutely vulnerable.

Simon Derrick, a currency strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon, said the comments were a message to the US Senate as Capitol Hill prepares legislation for the Autumn session.

"The words are alarming and unambiguous. This carries a clear political threat and could have very serious consequences at a time when the credit markets are already afraid of contagion from the subprime troubles," he said.

A bill drafted by a group of US senators, and backed by the Senate Finance Committee, calls for trade tariffs against Chinese goods as retaliation for alleged currency manipulation.

The yuan has appreciated 9pc against the dollar over the last two years under a crawling peg but it has failed to halt the rise of China's trade surplus, which reached $26.9bn in June.

Henry Paulson, the US Tresury Secretary, said any such sanctions would undermine American authority and "could trigger a global cycle of protectionist legislation".

Mr Paulson is a China expert from his days as head of Goldman Sachs. He has opted for a softer form of diplomacy, but appeared to win few concession from Beijing on a unscheduled trip to China last week aimed at calming the waters.

I'm not sure, but I believe that the canals that run through downtown
Providence are extensions of Naragansett Bay, and most of the "rivers" in
the neighborhood are in fact estuaries...

Menhaden?  in a river?  I thought these were in a river.  American Shad are

 Poet Helen Ruggieri will be in NYC for the AWP Conference January 30 - Feb.
2, 2008.  She'd be a great featured reader (I've heard her myself), so if
any of you series curators can fit her in, preferably but not necessarily on
any other eve but the 1st, when yours truly is curating a KGB Bar reading
(starring online publishers/editors plus guest star Rikki Ducornet), please
let me know.  Thanks! -- Carol

 Helen Ruggieri's "Glimmer Girls," a book of poetry,  from Mayapple
Press."creates a landscape in which girls practice becoming women. The
universality of the adolescent experience is rendered in these insightful
poems with grace, ease and understanding."  SHe loves reviewers who say nice
things.

A book of short prose journal pieces about Japan, "The Character for
Woman,"  is available from Foothills Publishing.  Reviewers called it "down
to earth" because it answers unasked questions about living in a foreign
culture like, should  I hang my undies on the line outside? Her haiku have
won international competitions in Japan:  to understand war/share a
driveway/with new neighbors.

Other poems and prose pieces have recently been in Spoon River Poetry
Review, Poetry Midwest,  Hawaii Pacific Review (Best of the Decade),  Cream
City Review, Mystic River, Adirondack Review, and in many
anthologies.  She's a columnist for Mad Hatters' Review.  Google "Helen
Ruggieri" or visit www.helenruggieri.com.

Ruggieri lives in Olean, NY along the Allegheny River. She is a journal
keeper,  a master gardener, and has a black sash in tai chi.

They are, they're rivers as well of course, but the fish move up through
them apparently.

Sorry for the late reply - I want to thank you for this. I've found a
couple of books that are useful - especially Aesthetic Computing, edited
by Paul Wishwick, MIT - which covers similar ground. There's also the
Second Life "The Official Guide" which I just got - mainly for the URLs
and stuff on scripting.

Is this the same Sam Weber who was doing theory work years ago? Do you
have URLs?

Thanks greatly - Alan

"However, notwithstanding this apparent variety, mantras are always regar-
ded as a form of speech differing from language in that, unlike language,
they are not bound by 'conventions' nor associated with objects, but on
the contrary are oriented toward the very origin of the Word and of the
energy."

From Vac, The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu Tantras, Andre Padoux,
SUNY Press, 1990.

"The pleasure in the act of Venus is the greatest of the pleasures of the
senses; the matching of it with itch is unproper; ahtough that also be
pleasing to the touch. But the causes are profound. First, all the organs
of the senses qualify the motions of the spirits; and make so many several
species of motions, and pleasure or displeasures thereupon, as there be
diversities of organs. The instruments of sight, hearing, taste, and
smell, are of several frame, and so are the parts for generation.
Therefore Scaliger doth well to make the pleasure of generation a sixth
sense; and if there were any other differing organs, and qualified
perforations for the spirits to pass, there would be more than the five
senses; neither do we well know whether some beasts and birds have not
senses that we know not; and the very scent of dogs is almost a sense by
itself."

From Bacon, Sylva Sylvarum, 693.

"The spline that is numbered as six defines the top of the breasts. It
curves in to form the hollow of the back and the shoulder blades. This
spline is also the widest of the three, because the area between splines
five and six will overlap into the attached arms.

"Spline number seven outlines the middle of the breasts. Its effect on the
shape of the breasts can be seen the clearest in the top view. The nipples
are modeled separately and attached at the very front and slightly to the
sides of spline number seven.

"The eighth spline [...] profiles the base of the breasts. In the front
view, both splines seven and eight curve around to form the roundness of
the breasts. While seven and eight curve down in the front view, number
six curves up. The middle front vertices of splines seven through nine are
moved up to form the thoracic arch. All three splines curve inward at the
back for the shoulder blades and spine."

From 3-D Human Modeling and Animation, Peter Ratner, Wiley, 1998.

"Why do all men, both foreign and Greek, count in tens, and not in any
other numbers? For instance, they might count 2,3,4,5, and then repeat
one, five, two five, and so on as now they say eleven, twelve, and so on.
Or why do they not stop at a number beyond ten and repeat from there? For
each number is made by putting a preceding number and one, two, and so on
with another number before them, and hence another number is formed, but
they always count from ten as a limit. For as this is invariably done it
clearly cannot be due to chance; for what is invariable and occurs in
every case cannot be a chance arrangement but must be due to nature. [...]
Or is it because all men have ten fingers? Having then counters of a
natural number, they number all other quantities by this number. The
Thracians are the only race who count in fours, because like children they
cannot remember very far, nor have they any use for any large number."

From Aristotle, Problems, XV, 3, trans. W. S. Hett, Loeb, 1926.

"Their lives are graced through my reading their works come alive.
Devouring their living works compress their lives into one.
Insolence of their letters directed actions of my own.
Coming into fruition of work and life through my reading of them."

From Textbook of Thinking, Alan Sondheim, open-lock, 1991.

Also known as Bunkers or Bug fish, the latter because of a large parasite
that lives in the mouth. More pounds of Menhaden are landed each year than
any other fish species in America. It is an important commercial fishery
species.

ABOUT THE READERS

In 1960, David Meltzer's poems appeared in the ground-breaking anthology,
The New American Poetry. He has gone on to create a substantial body of work
that is pervaded with "a kind of bop-perfection." Having arrived in San
Francisco in 1957, he is associated both with the Beats and the San
Francisco Renaissance, often reading with jazz musicians at bars and
coffeehouses. His recent book, Beat Thing (La Alameda Press), winner of the
PEN Oakland Josephine Miles award, is both tribute to down-in-the-street
wildness and rant against the romantic commodification which surrounds the
Beat Generation. Meltzer brings forth the original spirit of Beat in an
encyclopedic cascade of details whose dense, deep, fierce, funny, raucous,
free-associative jazz energy infuses every line. Beat Thing is an ecstatic
chant of defiance and celebration. Meltzer's Copy: The Selected Poems,
edited by Michael Rothenberg, has now come out with nearly 50 years of
Meltzer's poetry and provides ample evidence of his stylistic breadth as
well as the music and humor active in it.

Michael Rothenberg's work as an editor is well known, not only for David's
Copy, but also As Ever: Selected Poems of Joanne Kyger; Overtime: Selected
Poems of Philip Whalen; Way More West: Selected Poems of Edward Dorn and the
Collected Poems of Philip Whalen. He is also editor of Big Bridge,
www.bigbridge.org , a prominent online literary zine. Rothenberg is the
author of The Paris Journals; Monk Daddy; Grown Up Cuba; and recently
Unhurried Vision from La Alameda Press, which charts the year Rothenberg
spent caring for the terminally ill Philip Whalen. In 1976 he moved to
California and co-founded Shelldance, a bromeliad and orchid nursery in
Pacifica. An active environmentalist, Rothenberg has been a leading force in
the protection of Bay Area coastal lands and endangered species.

Light on ancient text.
Flicker of word
Moving into word.
They ask me what I do.
Enough.

Abruptly Europe dies.
Bloody tallis I wave
To cars to eyes. Dies.
The silk blazing.

Noisily yank a failed poem
out of the typewriter roller.
My hair falls into the keys.
Not grey but silver
whose light
reminds me of work
to be done.

It isn't fame or failure
just so many books to read
so many words to write

Paradise. I could spend

SIMPLIFY INFINITY, by Michael Rothenberg



Rain slaughters the balcony

I'm invisible



Flowers blown off red skeletons

I'm describing my death



My mother tells me come inside

But there's nothing inside worth imagining



It's all outside

Starlings in confusion



Where the body is purified by danger

I wonder how many people in this thread are in RI or thereabouts.
That's where I'm from, although I've been living in Atlanta, GA for
several years now.  I visit RI several times a year to see family and
friends.

Yes, Sam Weber left UCLA years ago -- His 2004 book THEATRICALITY AS MEDIUM
lists him as Avalon Professor of Comparative Literature at Northwestern -- As
was true during his UCLA years, he spends part of each year in Paris, where he
now directs Northwestern's Paris Program in Critical Theory.  That book also
contains his essay "Scene and Screen: Electronic Media and Theatricality."  It
was my good fortune in the late 90s to be one of the members of Weber's NEH
summer seminar on seriality --

From Hilton Obenzinger:

 Yom Kippur is the day that Jews ask for forgiveness for sins and
transgressions.  Years ago I wrote my own version of the
 enumeration of shortcomings and sins and sent it out to friends.  A
magazine printed it, and I received a message from a professor of
folklore that the piece had been circulating around, attributed to
that prolific author, Anonymous, and he was going to present a paper
at a conference on its folkloric spread.  So, I have updated it
slightly, and I send it out again.  May you all be inscribed in the
Book of Life.

 Yom Kippur Liturgy

 Once we were strangers in someone else's house,
 Now we are strangers in our own heads =96 forgive us.
 Forgive the beatings, the burlap bags that suffocate heads,  the
suffocating dread
 And forgive us the fig trees uprooted and dead.
 The houses torn down, villages no longer seen,
 Mothers and children stuffed down the wells of Deir Yassein.
 For these and all our transgressions, may all Creation
 Forgive us for what we have done to them and to ourselves.
             Amen.

 Once we were strangers in someone else's house,
 Now we are strangers in our own heads =96 forgive us.
 Forgive us for driving them out and the theft of their homes,
 For the colonies that exclude, the occupation enforced by guns.
 Forgive us the vanity =96 the flags and soldiers and Knessets =96
 That makes us forget the voices of Prophets.
 For these and all our transgressions, may all Creation
 Forgive us for what we have done to them and to ourselves.
             Amen.

 Once we were strangers in someone else's house,
 Now we are strangers in our own heads =96 forgive us.
 Forgive us the hatred, the violence, the pain.
 Forgive us all the evils we have done while crying "Never Again."
 We have planted, but we pray that no one reaps.
 Forgive us for driving Palestinians to do the same.
 For these and all our transgressions, may all Creation
 Forgive us for what we have done to them and to ourselves.
             Amen.

 We are ever strangers in someone else's house,
 But we can always be at home in our heads =96 redeem us.
 Bless Palestinians and Israelis to seek only peace.
 Take off the masks, the grand ideas, take down the Wall, and uncover
the sweet flesh.
 Allow us to feel our hearts, to feel compassion, each other's distress.
 Give us the wisdom to free ourselves from war, to allow each other's
contrition.
 For these and all our transgressions, may all Creation
 Allow us to make amends for what we have done to them and to ourselves.
             Amen.

 Hilton Obenzinger

aha. yes, you're right about Northwestern. I still think of a UCLA
guy...California loyalties. humph.

Here's are some good links. And the annoucement for the
paper-in-progress that you may want to ask about. I heard excerpts
from it at a talk at UC Santa Cruz, date & title, etc. below.

The official web page w/ e-mail address.
http://www.german.northwestern.edu/faculty/weber.html

and

texts of some of his work here:
http://www.hydra.umn.edu/weber/
(the one on digital democracy/displaced bodies is really good)

a good bibliography of his work with links to many other intresting
folk as well:
http://www.egs.edu/faculty/samuelweber.html

More info on the paper with his skin/sampling thoughts that I was so
excited to hear:

Thursday, March 22, at 5:00 pm, Room 420 Humanities One,
On the Politics of Protection and Projection
Samuel Weber, Avalon Foundation Professor of Humanities, Northwestern
University

Samuel Weber studied with Paul de Man and Theodor W. Adorno, whose book,
Prisms, he co-translated into English. The translation of and
introduction to Theodor
Adorno's most important book of cultural criticism helped define the
way in which
 the work of the Frankfurt School would be read and understood in the English-
 speaking world. Professor Weber has also published books on Balzac, Lacan, and
 Freud as well as on the relation of institutions and media to
interpretation. His most
 recent books include Theatricality as Medium (2004) and Targets of
Opportunity (2005).
 Currently, he is completing work on a book entitled Benjamin's-abilities.

Fresh from the presses and on the cusp of the retail pipeline is the
first full-length collection in English by Mexican poet Dolores
Dorantes. */sexoPUROsexoVELOZ /and/ Septiembre:/ a bilingual edition of
books two and three of /Dolores Dorantes/, by Dolores Dorantes.
*Translated by Jen Hofer. Published with Counterpath Press.

/sexoPUROsexoVELOZ/ and /Septiembre/ are books two and three of Mexican
poet Dolores Dorantes lifelong project titled /Dolores Dorantes/. These
works consist of fragmented interlocking sequences of poems that create
a scaffolding to frame Dorantes’ vivid explorations of the intensely
personal and intensely social questions that inhabit the space called
“Dolores Dorantes.” Dorantes writes, “May be / I had to forget how…” ;
it is from within the particular experience she offers of forgetting
/how/ that we might, perhaps, begin to remember /why/.

Dorantes was born in Veracruz in 1973 and has lived most of her life in
Ciudad Juárez, where socioeconomic violence and politically-charged
daily brutalities have informed her radically humane and beautifully
incisive work as a poet, journalist, and cultural worker. Dorantes is a
rare presence in Mexican literary communities, in that she takes a
wide-ranging international stance toward poetry and poetics while
refusing to accept state support from a government she cannot respect.
She has published four book-length works of poetry in Mexico, and is a
founding member of the border arts collective Compañía Frugal (The
Frugal Company), which counts among its activities publication of the
monthly poetry broadside series /Hoja Frugal/, printed in editions of
4,000 and distributed free throughout Mexico.

Feel free to send out the following announcement.

Poetry Reading
Asian American Poetry Now
Berkeley Art Museum
Location/Entrances
2626 Bancroft Way
2621 Durant Avenue
Between College and Telegraph
October 21, 2007; 3:00 p.m.
Gallery C

How are young Asian American poets grappling with
some of the issues that have engaged the artists
featured in One Way or Another? Eight West Coast–
and New York–based Asian American poets, from the
same generation as the exhibition artists and
with a comparable range of cultural backgrounds,
will read from work that parallels the
"post-identity" premise of One Way or Another.
Their poetry displays a range of exciting
experimental styles that depart from the focus on
identity politics that has marked the work of
many Asian American poets since the 1960s.

Poet and UC Berkeley Ph.D. candidate Chris Chen,
whose dissertation explores experimental currents
within contemporary Asian American and African
American poetry, will introduce and moderate the
program. Featured poets are Eileen Tabios,
Tsering Wangmo Dhompa, Cathy Park Hong, Paolo
Javier, David Lau, Barbara Jane Reyes, and Truong
Tran.

Public programs for One Way or Another are
supported by UC Berkeley's Consortium for the
Arts, Doreen B. Townsend Center for the
Humanities, and Asian American Studies Program,
and cosponsored by Asia Society Northern
California.

Hello Friends,

This is just a brief reminder of two rare events
kino21 sponsors next week in San Francisco.
http://www.kino21.org/


THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 27TH, 8PM
Artists' Television Access
992 Valencia, at 21st. St.

Guy Debord's Last Feature Film
IN GIRUM IMUS NOCTE ET CONSUMIMUR IGNI

A Latin palindrome also known as "The Devil's Verse"
is the title of Debord's look back on his life of
adventure and resistance.  Hugo Ball Room Labs has
dubbed Ken Knabb's ENGLISH TRANSLATION onto the
soundtrack so you can watch and listen instead of read
your way through Debord's narration of the film.  Our
similar presentation of Debord's "Society of the
Spectacle" last year sold out, so arrive early!

his wicked interpretation of WEST SIDE STORY.  David
Brazil, Amanda Davidson, Jennifer Nellis, Wayne Smith,
Konrad Steiner and Stephanie Young are also performing.

Dearest Listers,

Have a day or two to kill in Chicago beginning of next week,
wondering from any residents thereof what's crucial attendance. Never
been in my natural life. Back or forward channel.

thanks,
Dillon

I've just paid my fourth visit to the exhibit "Jess: To and From the Printed Page" here in Madison. It's amazing; if you're near one of the places it's visiting, go!!! Here's the link with the itinerary:

http://www.ici-exhibitions.org/exhibitions/jess/jess.html

And now my question:
One of my favorite pieces in the exhibit it Jess's "Didactic Nickelodeon no.2" (I've written a bit about it on my blog, if you're interested--the link to that's at the end of this). The text in this series is taken from, or inspired by, Sir Charles Sherrington's 1938 work Man on His Nature. I've only been able to find that text under the oppressive umbrella of JSTOR, from which I'm excluded, stuck in the rain of extra-academic life. Is it possible for anyone to grab the PDF and email it to me?

(I could ask some college friends here, but this gives me the opportunity to point out the existence of this great and strange work to those who might not know of it).

If not, does anyone know whether the Jess piece quotes Sherrington literally or processes it in some way?

Thanks for your help!

all the best,

Andy

In1907, Indian literary critic and researcher Haraprasad Shastri =
discovered Charjapadas (or Charyapadas)
- the earliest recorded poetry of North Eastern India written approx. =
between 8th-12th century C.E. It was
a palm-leaf manuscript, carefully preserved, containing 47 padas =
(verses) written by 23 Buddhist poets
from an area now covered by the Indian states of Assam, West Bengal, =
Bihar, Orissa and the country
of Bangladesh. These poems were written in a pro-Sanskrit form of early =
Bengali language.

Is it hard to love? The long road on which there shall
be no parking at anytime also cannot define gravity
albeit denser and more shallow and also spattered with
lights. Even in Einstein sitting quietly is distance
and sitting louder against the woods is some miles
more. Filters can pill those bitter arid notes on a
guitar. Though sometimes at night you come upon that
curve behind thickening trees where broadway’s video
pollution bends to your heels shuffling elyria ave
pebbles ahead of you for breadcrumbs. Life’s most
magnificent wonder is god’s mercy it says. Sure but i
never want to be perfect. Leave me alone you’d say
i’ll just die and everyone would be better off would
go the outer shirt but where would i put my cigarettes
i think i’m being crushed. Would it be hard to evolve?
That night it dipped below 40. You saunter through the
curl behind sheffield centre. Dips in the road studded
with neon delicate and jutting fold your shadow into
curbs to protect it from these cannibal streetlights
in which your mother’s silences listen as you silk
past the mill undetected but for this. The skunk pads
swiftly across your path. That might be how neal
cassady died. Just dropped in to see what condition my
condition was in. Oh, the yellow placards denoting wet
floor the soundtrack with the gain all the way down
the islets of shadows trees make on the sidewalk after
midnight after midnight the down the street the down
on all four! It threatened rain both of those days but
it never did and now it’s clear to everyone breathing
the same old exhaust you look up from walking held to
earth and some lawns unowned are allowed to grow wild.
I’m just relieved to be able to crack my knuckles
again. Two deer chasing safety under streetlights
pothol’d with silk lisps and empty aftermidnight
concrete through which these veins of stress and
trembling run. One day our core will cool. Do you find
it difficult to stripe across pavement that way? A
woody smear of burn turns onto reid ave a wallowing in
learnedness where birdhouses look like pallid floating
faces in the dark. There you’re humming a monster love
ballad for the universe. The highs wash over you
swallow the walls and shit light back at the moon the
lows traul o’neil blvd for wombs to angel and crave
vertices to the pit of their mantles. You’ll fracture
your hands pouncing and skimming through dense grasses
trying to grasp what has always and ever been void.
And on those nights clouds crazed the sky like a
history of pressure pressed in rock? Then the
headlights trouble you the newest churches calmly
sleep as you pass by.

Tuesday, September 25
8:00pm


The Living Lab
at the Living Theatre
21 Clinton St. (below Houston)


8pm
James Ilgenfritz - solo bass works from composers Gordon Beeferman, Steve
Rush, Miller Puckette, Jeffrey Treviño, Brian Griffeath-Loeb, Anthony
Braxton, Luciano Berio, and Jimmy Giuffre
+
9pm
The Musetry Project
featuring vocalist Ellen Christi (ellenchristi.com)
poet Steve Dalachinsky
and special guest, bassist James Ilgenfritz
with
Adam Lane (bass)
Eddy Rollin (oboe and assorted instruments)
Ravish Momin (percussion)
and Ty Cumbie (leader, guitar)


$10 partly benefits the Living Theatre (http://www.livingtheatre.org/)
and its ongoing struggle to wake up the world and pay the rent!


++++++++++++


The Musetry Project moves forward with its first performance including
poet Steve Dalachinsky, and its second with the seasoned and highly
gifted vocalist Ellen Christi. Musetry is a truly experimental project
that attempts to create a fusion form from music and poetry. Whether or
not it succeeds is almost irrelevant. The interest – and entertainment –
lie in witnessing the attempt.


The Living Lab is an experimental music and performance labaratory begun
in May, 2007 at the Living Theatre in downtown Manhattan. The Living Lab
provides opportunities for experimenting musicians, poets and performing
artists to develop and present their work to the public. Although the
Living Lab is independent, it shares the Living Theatre’s 60-year-old
commitment to contributing to positive social awareness and change
through mind-expanding performance work. With a new venue, the Living
Theatre, a new name and a new emphasis on experimentation with combined
disciplines, The Living Lab is poised to become an important entity in
New York alternative culture.




Living Theatre Mission Statement
To call into question
who we are to each other
in the social environment of the theater,
to undo the knots that lead to misery,
to spread ourselves across the public's table
like platters at a banquet,
to set ourselves in motion
like a vortex that pulls the spectator into action,
to fire the body's secret engines,
to pass through the prism
and come out a rainbow,
to insist that what happens in the jails matters,
to cry "Not in my name!"
at the hour of execution,
to move from the theater to the street
and from the street to the theater.
This is what The Living Theatre does today.
It is what it has always done.

Forwarding this from David Bromige [dcmb@sonic.net]:

I feel obliged to participate in this herring that you are holding.  As a
boy in England, I often ate herring.  I believe it must have been one of the
cheaper foodstuffs in those days.  I ate it for breakfast with potatoes left
over from the night before.  But nonethe-less, I grew up thin as a rake.  I
believe herring are now an endangered species and I no longer eat them.  My
diet still consists mainly of potatoes, somewhat to the consternation of my
wife who grew up on pasta.  What does George Bowering eat?  David

Okay, a work of genius.  I will admit that with some difficulty.  But I bet
Blowering never spent Christmas in Helsinki with his in-laws, eating
lutefisk.

Lutefisk is whitefish cured with lye.  The lye turns it into a sort of
gelatinous mass:


So much depends
upon

a grey lye
fish

glazed with K-Y
jelly

beside the white
in-laws.

Dear Bobbie:

I didn't write this, as you can see it is from Hilton Obenzinger.
My father's father was Jewish, but my father never knew him.=20
My youngest son's grandfather was a refugee from the Holocaust.
My niece is Jewish and grew up and lives in Brooklyn.

I take full responsability for sending the letter because I think it is  pr=
ayer for compassion, for the heart to open to compassion, to ask for forgiv=
eness for one's wrongs, to not  hold on to the darknesses of the past but t=
o build the future with light.

I think that what Dr. Obenzinger is saying about the piece being called "fo=
lkloric" and written by "anonymous" is a sign that many people find the mes=
sage of compassion  a beautiful one that is also in their own hearts.  It i=
s a prayer that does  not "belong" to any one specific person so to speak, =
but to "anyone".  It is a message of peace.=20


Dr. Obenzinger does not at all say the Holocaust is the fault of the Jews. =
Please read his words more carefully.=20

Here in Milwaukee is the nation's only Black Holocaust Museum, founded by D=
r. James Cameron, the survivor of a mass lynching.  Looking out my window, =
walking the neighborhood, there's no need of Jena or Katrina to understand =
the concept of a Black Holocaust in America.  It's effects are ongoing ever=
y minute.

Since my father had hardly any family I grew up identifying with my mother'=
s French-Indian side of the family.  When I was about five my Great-Aunt to=
ld me the horror story of what happened to almost all the Indians in the fa=
mily  loaded on trains and given infected blankets. My first wife is a Moha=
wk. Last week I went to a rez with a friend.  Again, a Holocaust that went =
into the building of the USA, and one whose effects are ongoing every minut=
e.

When I read Dr. Obenzinger's prayer, I feel it is for an end to Holocausts.=
=20
An end to Holocausts against one's people and also those actions on this wa=
y by one's people against others.
In short, a prayer for Peace.

Does anyone know anything about websites, especially in North America, being
unavailable at the moment?

I've been trying to access LEME (Lexicon of Modern English) for the last day
or so, without success.  It's hosted by the University of Toronto.  Their
main site is up, but the library links as a whole seem to be down, not just
LEME.

There are also a couple of major financial sites in the US that seem to be
unobtainable.

Odd.  Is there a cyber attack or something underway?

Or is it just coincidence?

Anyone else been having problems with sites that should be easily available?

I would show you, but if I put a photo here the Comintern in Buffalo
would reject my posting.

I can say that if I am ever in Newfoundland again I will eat a cod fish

Hello All,

  Can anyone recommend a good place to start to learn how to publish a hypertext? I am editing a text that has wonderful theoretical affinities with hypertext. In addition to the printed version I wanted to give hypertexting a whirl even if only a portion of the original text made it into a hypertext. I have very little specific knowledge about how to write code or how to begin to think about producing a hypertext, but for what I lack in specificity I think I can make up for with ambition and creativity-- maybe. So, can anyone recommend a book or a web page or point me in the right direction. I only post to the list about this because I am working with a deadline and I have already opened my mouth with a proposal, so I figured with the amount of knowledge on this list I might be able to avoid some obstacles that a naivete would be sure to encounter. I am extremely thankful to anyone who could possibly help.

  Best for now,
  Warren

Rachel didn't mention that you bury this lutefish in lye in a hole,
and dig it up much later.

Hi Warren,

It would be useful to hear more about what you want to do before making any
recommendations about how you might proceed.

There are some HTML editors around, such as Dreamweaver from Adobe, that are
quite nice for editing HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents. One of
the blessings/curses of Dreamweaver is that you don't have to learn HTML at
the code level (until it goes wrong). Google 'Dreamweaver' or 'HTML
editors'.

It is useful to know HTML at the code level, however, particularly if you
plan to make a habit of HTML. If you google 'HTML tutorials', you will come
across many. I often use http://w3schools.com (bookmark this) when I need to
look up something concerning HTML or CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) or
Javascript. Also, if you learn HTML at the code level, you don't need
Dreamweaver or other HTML editors. Though I know HTML at the code level and
use Dreamweaver. It allows me to work faster than I would otherwise, and
that usually means more creatively.

Warren, hi,

First, good luck with your project. Jim Andrews has already suggested
Dreamweaver, and not knowing much about the nature of your project or
the deadline you're under, I am not sure if alternatives will prove
helpful or not.

That said, for composing hypertexts that you could then export to the
web, take a look at Storyspace (Mac and Windows), or Tinderbox
(currently Mac only) from Eastgate Systems.

<http://www.eastgate.com/storyspace/>

<http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/>

These tools may not meet your immediate needs, but could prove useful
in the long run if you choose to explore authoring hypertexts with
tools that can provide more flexibility than the web offers. Another
option might be to write in or export to a wiki.

Hope this helps,

Hugh

home and film


1. Why the turtle in turtle.jpg.
The turtle was there on the grounds; the film of the real was projected
beyond or across the world of the turtle, or one should say, home.

2. Why the film of the real.
We watched the screen for hours on end in our home; leaves and branches,
buildings and a solitary star anchored the image changing as the day
changes, and the night.

3. Why the film.
The film was visible in the home of the day, which is to say the tiredness
or sleep of the night; perhaps the night's dream played upon us for those
days and weeks without end.

4. Why is the audience facing elsewhere.
Recording the mise en scene it was more than clear that so many of us are
used to action, the propriety of seizure, grasping at straws; still, there
was something inexorable in the uncanny image which practically slept its
way across the homeland screen.

I know text was from Hilton Obenzinger just as I know your other text came f=

Nonetheless, I have no idea what a prayer for Yom Kippur (the day after Yom=20=

I know Obenzinger does not say the Holocaust is the fault of the Jews. That=20=

I agree with you re: the situation in our country. And I truly have compassi=

I am very happy to read this prayer you sent is a call for an end to all hol=

Thank you for your communication.

  Warren, hi,

First, good luck with your project. Jim Andrews has already suggested
Dreamweaver, and not knowing much about the nature of your project or
the deadline you're under, I am not sure if alternatives will prove
helpful or not.

That said, for composing hypertexts that you could then export to the
web, take a look at Storyspace (Mac and Windows), or Tinderbox
(currently Mac only) from Eastgate Systems.





These tools may not meet your immediate needs, but could prove useful
in the long run if you choose to explore authoring hypertexts with
tools that can provide more flexibility than the web offers. Another
option might be to write in or export to a wiki.

Hope this helps,

I don't know anything about Tinderbox, but Storyspace does not "provide =
more flexibility than the Web offers". Storyspace was used to create =
some influential literary hypertexts back, erm, what?, in the early to =
mid nineties? But it hasn't been particularly popular, even in literary =
circles, since HTML editors proliferated with the rise of the Web in =
94-97. I understand Storyspace was wonderful at the time: it was maybe =
the first and best tool developed by literary folks for literary folks, =
as a tool for the development of a new type of literary work. Pretty =
exciting, at the time.

I read that one may export Storybook projects to HTML. But you certainly =
could not contain all the functionality provided even just by Javascript =
in Storybook. Javascript is a fullblown programming language. I don't =
think Storyspace provides a fullblown programming language.

ooh... can I come too?=20=20

what to do in Chicago:  art institute, yes, bean assuredly (that's the big =
bean shaped object if you walk a little north=20
of the art institute).  The MCA is probably worth a go to.  There are often=
 free concerts outdoors at Millenium Park,=20
which is that giant Frank Ghery pompadour right behind the bean.  Most of a=
ll, though: take a ride on the el,=20
especially if you haven't really been here before.  Riding around up there,=
 surveying the rooftops, it's my favorite=20
thing! for the first four months I lived here I felt like i was on a non-st=
op roller coaster ride (except without the=20
nausea).  But make sure you get a window seat!  Also Chicago's landscape is=
 fascinatingly diverse.  Get on the orange=20
(or, if you're adventurous, the green) line and go all the way down south, =
then come back up and take the red line all=20
the way up north and then pop into the Green Mill off the Lawrence Red line=
 stop for some drinks and some jazz=97
hoppin' til 4am!).=20=20=20

And then... there's one of my favorite places in all of Chicago.  It's a li=
brary of artists books=97books that artists made.=20=20
It's small and quiet and up on I think the 7th floor of an art institute bu=
ilding.  I don't think I have the exact address=20
and finding it online might prove difficult.  The best way to do it (the wa=
y I've done it in the past) is to go to the=20
library at the museum of the art institute and ask them there about it.  I =
believe it's on Wabash.  They should know.=20=20
It's one of the most wonderous places in the world and its full of treasure=
s.  But downtown Chicago is like that too.=20
The architecture along the Chicago river is absolutely stunning (I think th=
ere's some kind of boat tour you can do=20
that's supposed to be pretty good).=20=20

And absolutely the best, most chicago, best most chicago restaurant (this i=
s if you really want to understand what is=20
amazing about Chicago!) take a cab up to Hot Doug's.  I mean, just check ou=
t this website and tell me it doesn't=20
sound amazing.  http://www.hotdougs.com.   It is.  And in the true Chicago =
style, it's probably not worth the cab fare=20
if you're a vegetarian.=20=20

And then, my PERSONAL favorite place in Chicago (besides my apartment), if =
you're going to be in town on a Saturday=20
or a Sunday is The Green Lantern Gallery and Press at 1511 Milwaukee and Ho=
nore... pop in on a Sunday between 1=20
and 6 and I'll give you the tour.  But, you know.  That's a lot.=20=20

Can you tell I heart Chicago?

Hope that helps.

HI Waren,

Storyspace is an interesting program to write in.
Butjust a reminder that the problem with storyspace
is that only other readers with storyspace software
can read your hypertext. Too bad there isn't a freeware
hypertext writing program out there that everyone can
use.

As has been mentioned previously, there is a number of idiotproof
wikis out there that are available for free.  If yr just starting out
& can't install yr own, pbwiki is a good one to check out.  You can
create a site with your own subdomain.  Of course with free there is
some ads but these guys are pretty good at keeping the wikispam off
their sites...

http://pbwiki.com/

I use phpwiki for our various projects & like it alot.  Most hosting
solutions have an autoinstaller for an early version of this.  Here's
a project that Maria D & I have been working on for a few years.

OK since we are giving recommendations for Chicago

1) Hot Dogs-  Super Dawg on Milwaukee it is far away from Yuppie Land (where Hot Dougs is) and is pure Chicago also Gene and Judes is very good.
2) Music- Rosas Lounge in Humboldt Park
3) Beefs- (Yes in Chicago they are beefs) Mr Beef on Orleans but only for lunch
4) Good Food- LULA on Logan Square by the monument
5) Bar- Green Mill full of slammers but why not??
6) DELI- Manny's Deli is off of Roosevelt it is one of the last parts of the Maxwell Street Area still that exists.
7) Bookstores- Go to Hyde Park and spend the afternoon at Seminary Coop

The below appears in section 15 of Benjamin's "Art in the Age of Mechanical=
 Reproduction". I'm having a hard time getting at this. any help?

Christophe


"The distracted person, too, can form habits. More, the ability to master c=
ertain tasks in a state of distraction proves that their solution has becom=
e a matter of habit. Distraction as provided by art presents a covert contr=
ol of the extent to which new tasks have become soluble by apperception. Si=
nce, moreover, individuals are tempted to avoid such tasks, art will tackle=
 the most difficult and most important ones where it is able to mobilize th=
e masses. Today it does so in the film. Reception in a state of distraction=
, which is increasing noticeably in all fields of art and is symptomatic of=
 profound changes in apperception, finds in the film its true means of exer=
cise. The film with its shock effect meets this mode of reception halfway. =
The film makes the cult value recede into the background not only by puttin=
g the public in the position of the critic, but also by the fact that at th=
e movies this position requires no attention. The public is an examiner, bu=
t an absent-minded one."

Hi Jim, Warren, j, all

Jim, thanks for the feedback. Perhaps I should've said that Storyspace
offers a different kind of flexiblity than html. I read Warren's first
post as an indirect statement of lack of familiarity/fluency with
html, and by extension Javascript. Re: j's point: Storyspace readers
can be distributed for free with hypertexts published in Storyspace,
and though I haven't worked with any of the open-source
note-taking/hypertext tools in the last year, there are still a number
available. See for example, <http://www.w3.org/Status.html>

Within the hypertext research community, discussions and definitions
of the field, the nature of links, and a number of other core topics
are on-going. Ted Nelson, who coined the term "hypertext" has stated
in no uncertain terms that the web is not hypertext. It is certainly a
version, and quite obviously the most popular and most accessible one.
My main point was that there other options, and reflects my lack of
fluency with Dreamweaver, which in my experience presents some
interesting learning curves, like all the other tools out there.

Ted Nelson and his team are still working on xanadu, and from what I
saw at Hypertext 2007 earlier this month, progress is being made on
alternative visions.

<http://www.sigweb.org/ht07/>

all bests,

Hugh

If Ahmedinajad denies the Holocaust, then he is obviously just simply wrong.  But American propaganda on all things being suspect, who knows if he ever really said that.  Anyway, just as Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, the government of Iran may be telling the truth when it says that it is developing nuclear power for peaceful uses.  Who knows?  Anyway, I'm glad someone in NYC outside the UN is giving Mr. Ahmedinajad a forum in which to express himself.  Is he really going to read poetry?  This must be the first time I've heard of a "world leader" writing poetry since the former head of the Sandinistas read some poetry  he'd written on a trip I took to Nicaragua many years ago.

Dear Bobbie:

Please stop confusing me with someone else.
I did not send the Hannah Arendt text to this list, nor did I make any comm=
ent on it.
As Casey Stengel used to say, "You can look it up."

You write that "I'm not so much into reading text as into context and subte=
xt"--I think one addresses all three.  If one is cavalier with texts and im=
mediately jumps to their contexts and subtexts, via  a "not so much"  readi=
ng, this often results in misrepresentations, misapprehensions, mis-informa=
tion. This can in some cases become the smearing of others based on an igno=
ring of the actual text at the privileging of a skim-reading which sees may=
be two buzzwords and ignores the rest of the writing.

I.E A text itself needs to be read deeply and in full as having within it c=
ontext and subtext, as well as taking place within these.

Again, if you will "look it up," the original message was sent on Yom Kippu=
r, not the day after, as you allege.

If you knew the text was from Hilton Obenzinger, why did you address all yo=
ur assumptions and questions to me, as though I had written it?  And now yo=
u say I am making conclusions from a Hannah Arendt article which I didn't e=
ven send or comment on.

At the same time as misidentifying me with others' texts, you demanded I ex=
plain my identity.=20

If a prayer doesn't belong here on this list, I am sure the Poetics Moderat=
or would let me know.  It's being here means that the Moderator accepted it=
 as being within the bounds of the Poetics List's conversation. After all, =
all manner of topics relatively tangential to poetics are discussed, and a =
Liturgy does not seem too far beyond the pale.

I find it saddening and ironic that you grill me about my identity and at t=
he same time misattribute texts and posts to me as well as conclusions whic=
h I have never made here nor anywhere else nor ever would even entertain th=
e remotest idea of. =20

And beyond that, I find it frightening, for you accuse me of something I th=
ink is unthinkable, sickening, insane and horrific.
That is, that the Jewish people are to blame for the Holocaust.  How you ev=
er arrived at this conclusion by  your method of "not so much into reading =
text as into context and subtext" I think shows the need to be much more at=
tentive with all three--text, context, subtext.   The appalling assertion o=
f a  "conclusion"  you attribute to me is not only something  that's never =
occured to me, (it's completely factually false so why would one think it?)=
,  your assertion is based on a text not even sent by me, and is your own c=
onclusion in judging that text. =20

You ask what place a post of a Liturgy has to do with poetics.  Yet what ki=
nd of poetics are you advocating by this example?  A poetics which interrog=
ates the sender of a post with a text not written by themselves, as though =
they are the author, and attributing to the author and the sender a conclus=
ion which is not found with either?  And, upon that being refuted, attribut=
ing a post and comment never sent by the person to them, and again drawing =
a completely false accusation from this?

I don't see how reading for "context" and "subtext" works very well when on=
e does not pay attention to the text in the first case, and in the second c=
ase, the fact that the text is not even from the person whose identity you =
have been so demanding in having defined seems to render the entire issue n=
ull.=20

It would seem that you have a floating context and subtext which you are ap=
plying arbitrarily to texts which are not closely examined at all.   "Conte=
xt" and "subtext" in search of a text, an author to "frame" as it were, a "=
suspect" who "fits the profile" as long as the actual evidence, the text, i=
s almost completely ignored. The sender, who is not even the author of the =
text, needs to be interrogated, while the text itself is not given any real=
 form of examination.  =20

From a "poetics" view alone--setting aside the ethical and real-life potent=
ial consequences--this method is very irresponsible,   as it does not read =
texts, but projects onto them pre-fabricated readings which imprison the te=
xt, the writer, the non-writer supposedly the writer, in a series of cells =
constructed of pre-framed "evidences."  One is not reading, nor finding evi=
dence, but simply interrogating the identity of the subject supposedly the =
"author" whether or not they actually are, and then, without having read th=
e text, but having "read" the author/non-author/sender of the text, reading=
 out the ultimatum of the pre-framing context and sub text to the condemned=
.=20

In discussing texts, it is important to include the text (as idiotic as thi=
s may sound, that, yes, to discuss a text one needs to include the text--) =
as well as the context and subtext--otherwise, one begins to be discussing =
an empty space which becomes framed from without by pre-judgements, prejudi=
ces, imposed conclusions, all based on things not present in the text itsel=
f, which, being nearly  erased as it were, can be used as a palimpsest for =
the Authoritatively inscribed projections of the one who sits in  judgement=
.

In other words, the American Homeland Security methods of the "Justice" Sys=
tem being transposed to poetics, if one carries it far enough.=20
And who wants this,  in life and poetics?

In my own work I use and think very much on this phrase by Paul Celan:  "Po=
etry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."

A poetics which imposes conclusions, pre-fabricated contexts and subtexts, =
demands proofs of identity, ignores facts--to me, in my way of thinking of =
Celan's words, this is not poetry nor poetics. =20
It's the way Holocausts, genocides, dictatorships, ethnic cleansings, junta=
s, repressive regimes and institutions of all sorts,   often begin--

The Lincoln Park conservatory or the Garfield Park conservatory, both
free and open to the public. The Garfield Conservatory is probably
better, it has the "fern room", the largest indoor collection of ferns
in the world, as well as an incredible cacti room. It happens to be in
a horrible neighborhood, but all you have to do is take the Green line
to Conservatory. The Lincoln Park Conservatory is right near the lake
in a better, if not more yuppie, neighborhood. Plus it is right next
to one of the few free zoos in the land, the Lincoln Park zoo.

Some other great suggestions here, but I would try one of Chicago's
garden conservatories first.

Best,

Eric

What's the Baraka 9-11 poem you're referring to?

And how do we know that this Ahmedinajad appearance won't just be Kent John=
son in a keffiya?

Please excuse this 'generalized' and delayed response to all the various and kind responses to this Creeley-Ginsberg (and now Eigner) request for walking poems in the Stanford archives!  I have been on the road for a bit - even, accompanied by Allen Bramhall, (a real multi-generational Yankee local), a delightful Indian summer walk around Walden Pond (a narrow, for good counter-erosion reasons, wire fenced trail) with joggers, baby strollers, just plain strollers, and Pond swimmers amongst afternoon trees, shadows, sun, and that still oddly juxtapositional still operative railroad track at the pond's upper edge.

 And Concord as the country's early Lit breadbasket, a delight to stroll within, as well.

 Thank you, all.

 It would be lovely to find - in advance - any poems by either poet that emerge out of a particular walk. And to have an original mss. available to see, explore.

 I will appreciate any suggestions of titles - poems and/or journal pieces.

 Thanks in advance,

It's unspeakable, George, as you might imagine. You have to soak the
lutefisk in water for days in order to make it edible and whatever you =
soak
it in becomes unusable for any other purpose.

Serve with a dollop of whipped cream. Yum!

But have you heard of surstr=F6mming? This is fermented Baltic herring, =
sold
in cans which start to bulge like footballs as the fermentation process
continues. You want to open the cans underwater in the bathtub, because =
they
might explode.

And the smell, apparently... I haven't had the pleasure, but am told =
that
surstr=F6mming is usually served outdoors.

  Israel has been at times an obsession of mine, although I claim no Jewish roots, none. Zionism seems problematic, to put it mildly. A recent book (the 2 author's names escape me, the book is entitled Why the Jews), makes the claim that anti-Zionism is no different then anti-Semitism. If this is true, that would mean the whole bloody issue is off limits to anyone other then Israelis or Palestinians. Seems a bit extreme. A book entitled Hannah Arendt's Jewish writings has recently been released. I'm going to pick it up. I can trust Hannah in a way that I can't trust the half truths of the above mentioned authors.

Tom,

I watched some of Ahmedinejad's talk at the Mational Press Club. He refused
to say that the Holocaust did take place. In my vocabulary this means he is
denying it or obfuscating its existence. I must say Ahmedinejad talks like
every cheap politician in The United States. In the same talk, in answer to
a question, he basically denied Israel's right to exist. It was so bad that
someone blinked out his initial response in Persian, which basically was
that "we (Iran) had already made their decisision about the matter." He use=
d
a very final word for decision "idam," which also means "sentence of capita=
l
punishment." When the sound came back, the answer was softened a bit to
something like "why should the Arabs pay for the sins of the Europeans. Of
course here he is using the lawyerly rhetoric of: "it did not happen, but
even it did why should the Arabs suffer for it."

In actuality, Ahmedinejad looked much creepier that I thought he would.

Ciao,

Murat

there is a freeware available and that is html.
in half a day you can learn the basics to coding hypertexts in html.
how hard is it to write <a href=nextpage.html>click here to go to next page</a>
that is the code for linking the document the code resides in to
another document ie nextpage.html

not everyone deserves to be heard in an invited forum. how about hitler?
ever see the SNL parody of The News Hour? "Good evening, Mr Hitler, we're s=
o
glad you could join us tonight." "Thank you for expressing your opinion,"
etc. He has often denied the Holocaust & wants to see all Jews destroyed.
Think of how he treats his own people, not to mention the Christians & Jews
in Iran.

Xenakis at Target

The True Artist finds Inspiration everywhere. Here I was, in the popular
Target "Department Store" searching for inexpensive miniDV tapes, when I
noticed the speaker system began acting up in a most unusual way, as if it
were consciously imitating the famed composer Xenakis. What to do, what to
do! I quickly took out my surround-sound Zoom H2 solid-state audio recor-
der, and began recording the remarkable Sound, as I paced from speaker to
speaker, passing shoppers who paid little attention to the Beauty in their
midst. Now my only hope is one of them, perhaps someone purchasing toys or
kitchenware, will come across these files, and realize, with a sense of
Loss and Ecstasy, what they had missed, and what has been returned. Ah,
how little Memory is necessary when the hard molecular structure of the
World gives us the Gift of the Past, space-time at our fingertips, silent
Beauty sounding once again.

storyspace is a little more complex.
you can link words to other words, for example,
within the same page  and view the hypertext story
like a visual map to see how the links establish a
particular rhizomic structure. html is limited is this
regard.

No, but I'm pretty sure his wife is still in Athens, GA.

  We kept meaning to go see him and then the day we decided to go, we found out he had died.

  Good luck though!

(where Hot Dougs is) and is pure Chicago also Gene and Judes is very good.
2) Music- Rosas Lounge in Humboldt Park
3) Beefs- (Yes in Chicago they are beefs) Mr Beef on Orleans but only for
lunch
4) Good Food- LULA on Logan Square by the monument
5) Bar- Green Mill full of slammers but why not??
6) DELI- Manny's Deli is off of Roosevelt it is one of the last parts of
the Maxwell Street Area still that exists.
7) Bookstores- Go to Hyde Park and spend the afternoon at Seminary Coop

true. also, it's interesting to learn something about the architecture of
the html document. the <head>. the <body>. the <meta> tags. the simple 'tag'
model where 'tags' start and then end. the head begins with <head> and ends
with </head>. the way any tag is like that. bolded text starts with <em> and
ends with </em>, etc.  mark-up language.

it gives you a different view on the document. in english classes, one
learns about a different type of architecture of the document. the sentence,
the paragraph, the chapter, the quatrain, the architectures of argument,
rhetoric, drama, poetry. whereas to learn html is to learn the architecture
of the document that allows computers and programs to operate on the
document. parse it. mark it up appropriately. display it properly. but also
do other things to different parts of it.

and these different architectures are not without some common purposes.

I can certainly imagine Xenakis' ghost infiltrating the corporate supercenters of the world.

This one reminds me of his early "crackling lumps of coal" piece.

Beautiful stuff--and courageous of you to wander the hellish halls of T.

America is just giving this guy the go ahead/ giving him more and more credi=

not everyone deserves to be heard in an invited forum. how about hitler?
ver see the SNL parody of The News Hour? "Good evening, Mr Hitler, we're so
lad you could join us tonight." "Thank you for expressing your opinion,"
tc. He has often denied the Holocaust & wants to see all Jews destroyed.
hink of how he treats his own people, not to mention the Christians & Jews

Tom,
I watched some of Ahmedinejad's talk at the Mational Press Club. He refused
o say that the Holocaust did take place. In my vocabulary this means he is
enying it or obfuscating its existence. I must say Ahmedinejad talks like
very cheap politician in The United States. In the same talk, in answer to
 question, he basically denied Israel's right to exist. It was so bad that
omeone blinked out his initial response in Persian, which basically was
hat "we (Iran) had already made their decisision about the matter." He used
 very final word for decision "idam," which also means "sentence of capital
unishment." When the sound came back, the answer was softened a bit to
omething like "why should the Arabs pay for the sins of the Europeans. Of
ourse here he is using the lawyerly rhetoric of: "it did not happen, but
ven it did why should the Arabs suffer for it."
In actuality, Ahmedinejad looked much creepier that I thought he would.
Ciao,
Murat

Dearest List Poetics:

I bring you news of coming events. When I refer now to Yt Communication, I
refer to three London poets: Sean Bonney, Frances Kruk, Sophie Robinson.
They're actually not just from London they're from Hackney and they're not
just from Hackney, they're from Armed Hackney, and they're not just from
Armed Hackney, they're from the Payback & Affinity Yt Crackers Wing Commando
Lineament Bee of Armed Hackney, which has to do with making known that their
poetry will make your already-glowing SHIT Actually Flicker 2-Dimensionally.
SO.

These "poets", being my friends and allies in a world of Finite Love, these
Poets being the generative pattern emanating from the ground beneath all the
best stuff thereby making them a primary node in the international
lattice-aura homotrope, these POETS will be reading poems loudly and showing
films and making sounds with machines and distributing small small press
books and essentially handing out receipts to the recognized. If you're
there and you understand then you'll understand. This is all happening one
week from now, 8pm Tuesday October 2nd at Firehouse 13 (41 Central St, off
Broad), being the 2nd event in the media poetry series called The Program.


Repeat.

*

Sean Bonney * Frances Kruk * Sophie Robinson * Joshua Strauss
* 8pm Tuesday October 2nd *
@ Firehouse 13, Providence - Directions<http://firehouse13.org/direction.php>

*

Doors @ 7, live music by The Gentleman, and all of it featuring the discrete
physician Joshua Strauss (Buffalo). Snacks too and a cash bar. little
donation at door. please see me there. i'll be pleased to see you. and do
pass this on. website: http://plantarchy.us/the-program/

Also do note that these poets are touring the States en route from Buffalo,
so check them out at Rust Belt on Thurs Sept 27th  @ 7pm (with Ric Royer)
and then the next day at the Adam Mickiewicz Library on Fri Sept 28 @ 8pm.
Then follow their 1-Dimensional stroboscope to Providence and lace out with
us.


FINITE LOVE

dear poetics folks, i'm sorry, i've got to wade in here.  there are many
maniacs ruling countries in this world.  we _have_ to question quite
cynically why our own maniacs (whom i now consider extremely evil--
definitely horrific creatures, and they are our problem, not some other
peoples') are interested in attacking some of them but not others.  why is
the u.s. spending billions to support israel and more billions to wipe out
iraq, a country that threatened neither israel nor the u.s.?  why was
israel "founded" in the first place?  was it really because the u.s. and
england love the jewish people so much?  (both countries rejected the idea
of allowing jewish refugees to immigrate after WWII.) or was it another
cynical move to make sure the u.s. and england have a foot to control
stability/instability in teh middle east, home of oil fields that supply
both east and west and of a christian crusade that has gone on for 1000
years?  surely it's clear that christians have a much worse record than
moslems when it comes to slaughtering jews.  what does this new cosying up
mean?  i don't trust it at all.

ahmadinejad may be a lunatic too, though in an interview by 60 minutes,
(http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/21/60minutes/main3286690.shtml?)
he sounds more like a man very carefully aware that his country could well
be the target of the next u.s. shock and awe.  it is not our job to go
around making sure that leaders of other countries are treating their
people right.  right now the burmese are up in arms against their gov't.
the iranians have overthrown their leaders many times before.  it is a
very ancient civilization.  we had better look to our own mess.

the extremely difficult and painful situation begun by outside empires
fiddling with the status quo in different parts of the world
(pakistan/india, north and south ireland, hawaii, israel and the arab
countries surrounding it, africa as a whole) requires us to step back a
bit from immediate gut reactions and look at the bigger picture.

the leaders of countries are not the ones suffering.  it is always the
people.  and it will be us too, more and more, if the craziness that is
our lot now in the u.s. goes on.  all best, gabe

You may be right, Murat.  I watched him last night on the Charlie Rose Show and while he sidestepped the issue of the Holocaust, he said repeatedly that Iran and he wanted to be friends with the people o f all nations.  When asked about the purpose of his nuclear program, he insisted again that it was for peaceful purposes.  I watched his face very carefully.  On this latter point, there seemed to be sincerity emanating from him.  Maybe I've just been conned by him.  There is no way of knowing any of the truth of this matter without going to Iran.  Nevertheless, he was convincing.  I can usually tell when our politicians are lying, which is most of the time.  If he is more cunning than he appeared, I had no way of telling that.

Tom,
I watched some of Ahmedinejad's talk at the Mational Press Club. He refused
o say that the Holocaust did take place. In my vocabulary this means he is
enying it or obfuscating its existence. I must say Ahmedinejad talks like
very cheap politician in The United States. In the same talk, in answer to
question, he basically denied Israel's right to exist. It was so bad that
omeone blinked out his initial response in Persian, which basically was
hat "we (Iran) had already made their decisision about the matter." He used
very final word for decision "idam," which also means "sentence of capital
unishment." When the sound came back, the answer was softened a bit to
omething like "why should the Arabs pay for the sins of the Europeans. Of
ourse here he is using the lawyerly rhetoric of: "it did not happen, but
ven it did why should the Arabs suffer for it."
In actuality, Ahmedinejad looked much creepier that I thought he would.
Ciao,
Murat

Tom,

Do you believe that Ahmedinejad believes there are no gays in Iran? Is he
sincerely stupid or is he a lier or something we do not understand. I think
the second one.

Perhaps he believes God is almighty and Iran is run by God's laws and the
punishment for homosexuality is execution -Idam, the same word he used for
Israel.- Since God's laws (and their executions) are ideal and perfect, all
homosexuals are executed. Therefore, there are no homosexuals in Iran. Do
you want to follow this argument?

You must be aware that Ahmedinejad is following the same argument about
Israel. Since the existence of Israel is against God's law -the argument
being why should the Arabs pay for Europeans' sins ("if the Holocaust
occurred at all")- therefore, Israel does not exist, its mere physical
existence requires "execution" of the law. Israel does not exist the way
homosexuals do not exist. Do you want to follow this argument also?

The physical human reality -in the sense we understand it- does not seem to
be relevant to Ahmedinejad- easily to be executed out. Do you believe in
this kind of sincerity?

I am trying hard not to scream and talk about the beady eyed smirk on his
face.

Ciao,

Murat

om,
 watched some of Ahmedinejad's talk at the Mational Press Club. He refused
 say that the Holocaust did take place. In my vocabulary this means he is
nying it or obfuscating its existence. I must say Ahmedinejad talks like
ery cheap politician in The United States. In the same talk, in answer to
uestion, he basically denied Israel's right to exist. It was so bad that
meone blinked out his initial response in Persian, which basically was
at "we (Iran) had already made their decisision about the matter." He used
ery final word for decision "idam," which also means "sentence of capital

dear poetics folks, i'm sorry, i've got to wade in here.  there are many
aniacs ruling countries in this world.  we _have_ to question quite
ynically why our own maniacs (whom i now consider extremely evil--
efinitely horrific creatures, and they are our problem, not some other
eoples') are interested in attacking some of them but not others.  why is
he u.s. spending billions to support israel and more billions to wipe out
raq, a country that threatened neither israel nor the u.s.?  why was
srael "founded" in the first place?  was it really because the u.s. and
ngland love the jewish people so much?  (both countries rejected the idea
f allowing jewish refugees to immigrate after WWII.) or was it another
ynical move to make sure the u.s. and england have a foot to control
tability/instability in teh middle east, home of oil fields that supply
oth east and west and of a christian crusade that has gone on for 1000
ears?  surely it's clear that christians have a much worse record than
oslems when it comes to slaughtering jews.  what does this new cosying up
ean?  i don't trust it at all.
ahmadinejad may be a lunatic too, though in an interview by 60 minutes,
http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/21/60minutes/main3286690.shtml?)
e sounds more like a man very carefully aware that his country could well
e the target of the next u.s. shock and awe.  it is not our job to go
round making sure that leaders of other countries are treating their
eople right.  right now the burmese are up in arms against their gov't.
he iranians have overthrown their leaders many times before.  it is a
ery ancient civilization.  we had better look to our own mess.
the extremely difficult and painful situation begun by outside empires
iddling with the status quo in different parts of the world
pakistan/india, north and south ireland, hawaii, israel and the arab
ountries surrounding it, africa as a whole) requires us to step back a
it from immediate gut reactions and look at the bigger picture.
the leaders of countries are not the ones suffering.  it is always the
eople.  and it will be us too, more and more, if the craziness that is

 Hitler's rise. And I am not, in any way, being dramatic. He's pulling
 women off the street for not covering up enough/ he's tearing academics
 from their positions, he's calling himself the messiah for

 not everyone deserves to be heard in an invited forum. how about hitler?
 ver see the SNL parody of The News Hour? "Good evening, Mr Hitler, we're
 so glad you could join us tonight." "Thank you for expressing your
 opinion," tc. He has often denied the Holocaust & wants to see all Jews
 destroyed. think of how he treats his own people, not to mention the

Does anyone out there know how I could get in touch with Edith Jarolim,
the editor of Paul Blackburn's Collected Poems?  I think I may have
found a few unpublished poems by Paul Blackburn.

No, Bobbie, you are not an alarmist. But Ahmadinejad does not have anywhere near the power Hitler had. The Sunni's are the majority in the greater mid-east. Still, I understand your concern. I'm convinced that the shitty U.S. policy in the mid-east is largely responsible for our being in the mess we're in. If we hadn't overthrown the democratically elected (?), and replaced him with our mole, the shah, perhaps we wouldn't be having this discussion.

Thank you.
Yes, Ruth, not only that but the Iranian people themselves don't want this maniac ruling their lives. Letting him speak at Columbia gives the Iranian people a very sad picture of America: they want America to help them and America is just giving this guy the go ahead/ giving him more and more credibility with their gullibility. And yes, he wants all the Jews destroyed, and yes he wants Israel blown off the map (I'm not saying it/ HE is PLEASE LISTEN TO WHAT THIS MANIAC IS SAYING (it's not so hard to do/ he's saying it every day) and then, for those who don't care about Israel, well guess who's next: America. And anyone who knows me knows I'm no political fantatic and I'm no alarmist and I'm not on the right or any of the rationalizations you might want to put on me but I'm listening to this guy and I hear him and I think we owe it to ourselves and to the entire world to listen to him and realize he is as serious as Hitler was when he outlined HIS plan just as clearly, (both
 of these horrific creatures have been very clear of their goals) with just as many people not listening to him. First of all, we owe it to the Iranian people to show them we stand for something other than "scoops" or whatever the media sees themselves doing by bringing us "all the news that's fit to cover"--too bad they leave so much out. And if anyone wants to believe his sweet talk, and won't listen to what he's actually saying (and I'll repeat it again: listen to his daily speeches translated directly from Farsi) then I'd say we are back in the days of Hitler's rise. And I am not, in any way, being dramatic. He's pulling women off the street for not covering up enough/ he's tearing academics from their positions, he's calling himself the messiah for godsakes--don't you hear what he's saying? It's scary for me that people aren't listening to what he's saying. Please see below and listen to Ruth: she knows what she's talking about.

not everyone deserves to be heard in an invited forum. how about hitler?
ver see the SNL parody of The News Hour? "Good evening, Mr Hitler, we're so
lad you could join us tonight." "Thank you for expressing your opinion,"
tc. He has often denied the Holocaust & wants to see all Jews destroyed.
hink of how he treats his own people, not to mention the Christians & Jews

Okay, Murat.  His attitude toward homosexuality was not discussed on the program.  I only heard of this today from someone else and saw something about it in today's New York Times.  Thirty seven years ago when I was briefly in Teheran on the way to Afghanistan and India, I was told by two young men that men in the Muslim world had sex with one another until they got married.  I had no idea whether this was true or not but because I was twenty-two at the time, it stuck with me.  More recently, in Afghanistan under the Taliban, the punishment for being caught in homosexual activity was to be placed in a house which was then collapsed onto you.  If you survived this ordeal you were let go.  Which is the more primitive and inhumane, even anti-human, since homosexuality is natural and human, I don't wish to speculate.  Anyway, since I'm now told homosexuals are executed in Iran, I would certainly never go there until this changed.  Regards, Tom Savage

Murat Nemet-Nejat <muratnn@GMAIL.COM> wrote:  Tom,

Do you believe that Ahmedinejad believes there are no gays in Iran? Is he
sincerely stupid or is he a lier or something we do not understand. I think
the second one.

Perhaps he believes God is almighty and Iran is run by God's laws and the
punishment for homosexuality is execution -Idam, the same word he used for
Israel.- Since God's laws (and their executions) are ideal and perfect, all
homosexuals are executed. Therefore, there are no homosexuals in Iran. Do
you want to follow this argument?

You must be aware that Ahmedinejad is following the same argument about
Israel. Since the existence of Israel is against God's law -the argument
being why should the Arabs pay for Europeans' sins ("if the Holocaust
occurred at all")- therefore, Israel does not exist, its mere physical
existence requires "execution" of the law. Israel does not exist the way
homosexuals do not exist. Do you want to follow this argument also?

The physical human reality -in the sense we understand it- does not seem to
be relevant to Ahmedinejad- easily to be executed out. Do you believe in
this kind of sincerity?

I am trying hard not to scream and talk about the beady eyed smirk on his
face.

Ciao,

Murat

he IS cunning--he has tried to get 500 centrifuges. he imprisons
dissendents. he calls his gvot a democracy but only people approved by the
council are even allowed to run. he intimidates minorities. he is a thug. h=
e
wants to destroy israel. he uses language in the most slippery way.
columbia is known for inviting 'leftists' even if they are dictators, which
he is. he had plenty of opportunity to speak at the UN, & to C. Rice, & on
60 Mins. w/out columbia inviting him & giving him a US forum which will
reflect well on him in his own country--he will be seen as a powerful world
leader who can get people in the US to applaud when he denies the Holocaust=
.

New York, NY - On August 7, violinist Billy Bang received a much needed
hip replacement surgery at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, NJ (thanks to
the Jazz Foundation of America for making the procedure possible).  Billy
is recovering nicely, but he has not been able to work at all for the
past few months.   He needs to continue to rest and recover for at least
another three to four weeks.  In an effort to assist him in meeting all
of his expenses, his friends have organized a benefit which will include
performances by some of the best musicians living in New York.


The benefit will be taking place at the home of sculptor and avantJazz
enthusiast Alain Kirili and his wife photographer Ariane Lopez-Huici.
Alain Kirili has a history of collaborating with musicians of the
avantjazz scene.  In fact a Bang solo CD, "Commandment" was recorded
during a live performance in Kirili's loft in March of 1997.


Please come by to check out what will no doubt be an amazing night of
music, all for the worthy cause of keeping Billy Bang in the black!

Last I heard, the US has quite an arsenal of nuclear weaponry.  And they dropped weapons of mass destruction on two separate cities of no military value a few years back.  (By the way, what's with the "cunning" bit?  Ah, those tricky Iranians -- ready to swindle you on a carpet deal like the bazaar merchants they are).

In truth, the Israeli government's doing a pretty good job of that already.  See Uri Avnery's writings.

he uses language in the most slippery way.

THAT doesn't sound like Bush, who can't even articulate.  But here again, we have the devious, effete Persians about their nefarious business, pulling the wool over brave, plain-spoken Murican eyes.  Press the start button on the film "300" or whatever it was called.  But wait!  Poets use language in a slippery way too!  Can it be that, like Donald Rumsfeld, Ahmedinejad could potentially subscribe to this list?

Sorry, like it or not, he was fairly elected (probably more so than Bush in either 2000 or 2004), and since "all politics is local," most of those voting for him thought he would bring about an improvement in their economic condition.  That didn't happen.  But because of all the "West's" hand-wringing and saber-rattling (hard sometimes to tell them apart), the jerk has been able to play the nationalist card.  And if the far-right Ahmedinejad is a leftist, I'm Dick Cheney.

Free speech -- gosh, what an inconvenience it is.  Better we should only listen to people we agree with; it's certainly more comforting.  Anyway, what gives you such insight into how Ahmedinejad will "be seen" by Iranians?  A lot of them are pretty sick of the guy.

you can do that in html also. like this:

i've seen html editers that let you view the links as visual maps. such as
ms frontpage. and web browsers that let you view the document's tag
structure as a collapsable/expandable tree.

Very interesting how naming this xxxXenakis immediately frames the
listening experience.  When I listen with Xenakis in mind I
immediately hear a direct connection & that sense of sprawling sonic
architecture.  However if you had named this something other like
whiningbrats.mp3 I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have made the connection.

It may well be the case that just about anything that Storyspace can do
can also be done in HTML and add-ons like javascript.  This is true even
of a feature that no other hypertext editor has, guard fields (which
allow you to construct a page such that the first time you come to the
page and click a link you go one place, whereas the second time you come
to a page the same link will take you to another place...a very powerful
tool for structuring the reader's experience).  But you have to do the
scripting yourself, or find someone else's and apply it...very tricky.

And let it be said that there are plenty of things that HTML will do
that Storyspace doesn't do, or doesn't do as easily.

But for me that's not the point.  For me, the primary draw of Storyspace
isn't its features, cool though they are.  The primary draw is the speed
and ease with which you can construct hypertexts.  Double-click, write a
title, you have a new page (it's even faster if you skip the title).  A
couple of clicks, you have a link.  So it is quick and easy
(technically, anyway, the creative act is another matter) to create
hypertexts that have hundreds of pages and thousands of links.  And
since it is much faster to sketch out complex multi-page, multi-linked
structures in Storyspace *and edit them* than in HTML, Storyspace is
great for trying out first drafts (which can then be exported to HTML,
although I don't find this as easy as Eastgate's advertising lets on).

All of which is to say the obvious, that all of these tools do different
things.  And that it's creatively fructifying to try them out when you
have the chance.

points taken, christopher! but it is generally known that when he talks
around the world he does so for local consumption.
not against free speech but if they are going to invite thugs they shd
invite all thugs or none. not just 'left' ones.
come on, he is cunning (did you hear him on Charlie Rose?), in fact
journalists sd he was crazy in the beginning till they realized he was
manipulated his image of himself. why defend a guy who wants to wipe out a
people & oppresses his own people?
have you read what he says in his weekly speeches at home?

that's why i've been teaching html code to first year arts students
for 10 years.
it helps in being able to code hypertexts but also once knowing how
to code links the possibility for hypertexts greatly increases.
it also is a great way of understanding the relation between text and
it's graphic representation, thus introducing the concept of
poly-semiotic reading of texts, especially when just as easily as
text, images, sounds and animations can be introduced into the
hypertext.

for me learning about hypertexts, and there are plenty of
universities teaching hypertext literature, is far better when
students also learn how to construct these texts in html code. it is
like learning about sonnets without a knowledge of their construction
and structure.

If you are living in the Bay Area, you are welcome to join my Walking & Writing workshop on the Stanford Campus as part of the Continuing Studies program.
 Dates: Saturday, October 20 and 27 from 10 to 4.
 We will explore parts of the campus, including a visit to look at walking poems in manuscript by Ginsberg and/or Creeley in the Library's Special Collection.
 "Light" walking, much writing, both quiet ambling and discussion. Should be fun and illuminating, as well. For further course description and enrollment info go to:
 http://www.continuingstudies.stanford.edu/course/WSP112.asp

 You may also contact me for more info.

 Let your friends know, too.

 Thanks,

MIME-Version: 1.0

SL - theoretical approaches


Second Life behaviors come as animations which may eventually go down to
the frame, but are packages in any case. There is a relation with older
silent film and melodrama patterns - what have been dubbed histrionic
gestures. A good text here is Bharata's Natyasastra, which discusses,
among other things, rasa and pattern presentations. Patterns are used as
generators of audience psychological response. The text not only considers
patterns independently, but as group structures.

Second Life bodies touch on the abject, but don't 'enter' within it; there
are issues of purity and corruption. Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga, Path to
Purity, is extremely important in this regard, especially in relation to
illusion and suffering. There are also kasinas which are may be related to
landscape 'focal points' in SL. A second important text is the Hevajra-
tantra with its multiple bodies; it might be worth looking at the works of
Tsong Ka-Pa in this regard as well. (Again, Kristeva's Powers of Horror,
Lingis, Mary Douglas, all come to mind.)

In terms of ontology, Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika, The Fundamental
Wisdom of the Middle Way, is critical, given its analysis of dependent
(co)-origination ad emptiness. This correlates almost too neatly with the
ontology and epistemology of protocols on one hand and the abject body on
the other. Dependent (co)-origination can also be related to Indra's Net
and the relation of the Net to the Internet as a collocation of nodes, at
least on an epistemological level.

One might ask what is the ontology of SL from _within_ protocols - and
whether such a question makes any sense at all.

To self-active an SL avatar - use the screen itself as vision, motion-
detection across the image - feed this into AI neural networks - output
back into SL through encoded behaviors. Note the ontological and epis-
temological shifts involved: from digital readout through analog screen
(2D) interpretation.

Finally there are the old MOOs - MUDs-object-oriented, where MUDs stood
for multi-user-dungeon (or some such - out of the old D&D gaming). MOOs
are text-only virtual realities, somewhat similar to SL. One of the
biggest differences: MOOs are open-source and can easily be set up on any
linux/unix box. Now MOOs (like SL) have a system of unique identification
tags for every object, player, etc., and this is hierarchical (much like
unix itself, with the root / ). Explore the earliest numbers (which re-
flect the sysadmins, wizards, MOO structure as a whole. Remap through
dependent (co)-origination. (It should be noted that the Sharp Zaurus,
which runs on embedded but easily terminal-accessible linux, has a file
structure which 'resonates' with itself - one can literally go in circles
through it. How can one think through these dependencies, proxies, etc.?)
This might be a way of clarifying the philosophical issues - for example,
one might think of both absolute and relative ontologies (much like URLs)
- and then how the former maps onto the latter, or how all of this dis-
appears. (Just as things disappear, mathematical objects appear to appear.
So problems related to SL and avatars: the mapping of protocols, networks
in relation to the visual; to mathesis and abstract ontologies; and to
hardware implementations: static (ROM or storage where configuration is
mapped thing that is read as virtual thing), and dynamic (where transmis-

Robert Kendall developed Javascript code for just this sort of thing. It's
freely downloadable at http://www.wordcircuits.com/connect . The project is
called The Connection Muse. Robert has been quite involved with hypertext
for many years, so I suspect this project was at least partially inspired by
some StorySpace features.

I don't wish to denigrate StorySpace. I think it was clearly ahead of its
time.

It was such a good idea that it wasn't long before browsers such as Mosaic
and so on were developed. And, since then, I can't begin to estimate the
number of significantly talented information architects, computer
scientists, programmers, artists, and others who have put uncounted
person-years into the development of the technologies of the Web, such as
HTML, browsers, HTML editors, Javascript, Director, Flash, Java, and on and
on. An entire economic boom history was predicated on it. So it is little
wonder that the contemporary versions of hypertext and the accompanying
contemporary tools outstrip StorySpace by leaps and bounds, when we consider
the truly massive developmental efforts put into these technologies compared
with the resources available to the people who put StorySpace together.
StorySpace has an important place in the history of hypertext.

Agreed.

And the Yale Collection also may be the only place that has the reel-
to-reel archives of Anne Sexton's rock band,
Anne Sexton and her kind--if you consider that a strength. When I was
doing some detective work (because the
PSA in NYC wanted me to recreate her rock band, well, before Alice
Quinn took over---long story--), I couldn't find it anywhere in NYC
and luckily Caroline Crumpacker and I found it in Yale (even if they
wouldn't let us make a recording of it,
but we had to sit in the rare tape room).

No, no, he's actually planning to attack Canada.  Haven't you heard him
railing against maple leaves and ice hockey?  It's not in most of the
English-language versions of his speeches that you see, but there are some
direct translations out there that include it.

Also, Iraq and Afghanistan aren't states.  States still have a few more
rights (or apparent rights) than they do.

The architecture boat tour was great when I took it (you go to Navy Pier and wander around--it's just south of the massive thing--can you tell I don't live in Chicago?), though the tour guide was a friend with subversive political tendencies who gave us a lot of dirt on the origins of those buildings, and he now lives in Italy.

If you need late night Mexican food, El Charro (on Milwaukee Ave., near Logan Square) has great chilaquiles.

I don't like slam poetry at all, but the Green Mill slam is not only the origin of the thing, but a blast--the readers tend to be much less focused on out-hipping each other than at other slams I've witnessed, and are great entertainers. It's like if standup comedy were good. Marc Smith is an amazing emcee and a great host.

Devon Street has about thirty of the best Indian restaurants in the country, all within a few blocks. Plenty of vegetarian-friendly Indian buffets at lunch and dinner (some of them continuing until 10 or 11 at night). Pretty far north in the city, but worth it.

The Neo-Futurists put on "Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind" every weekend. The format is: thirty plays in sixty minutes, with the audience choosing the order. The bad plays are like lame Saturday Night Live skits or high school angst poems. The good ones range from the merely hilarious to the aesthetically complex and amazing. It happens, I think, at 11 or 12 Fri. & Sat., and at 7 or 8 on Sun. My introduction to Chicago in high school, and well worth it. The Neo-Futurarium is at Ashland & Foster. Around the corner are the first Middle Eastern restaurants I ever ate at; Andie's is really good.

There's probably other good theater going on there as well. If you're interested, ignore the Chicago Reader critics and just look at the listings.

Series A has good poets reading, as does the U of C. I never make it down for those.

The Art Institute is indeed a must, one of the better big museums I've been to. Take the el train downtown though; I don't know if you'll be driving, but parking is, when available, horrifically expensive.

I like Chicago.

have fun!

This was a very good article on Ahmadinejad.  Thanks for posting the link. As for the Columbia president, he's just a stooge either for the Bush administration or for the establishment view which for some reason he felt obliged to expound while introducing the Irani leader.  Judging from the account in The Nation, it appears that the general impression left by the address was very similar to that presented in the interview on Charlie Rose's program, which I saw.  I tend to be so suspicious of anything put out by the American government now that I wanted to see and hear Amedinajad's speaking for himself.  Nevertheless, his views on homosexuality and many other things are abhorrent to me.  I don't endorse his attitude toward many things.  But I'm glad I heard what he had to say from his mouth rather than from America's newspeak puppets.  Regards, Tom Savage

Just yesterday I was looking at the image discussed in this article
and thinking about how the proliferation of methods of surviellance
and recording, of video cameras, mics, drones, all sorts of portable
and huge military apparati are being deployed to present "evidence"
or/of attacks, actions and also how these are used to "profile" and
"sort" people.  As much as anything can be "documented," it can also
be "posed," faked, "set-up," "framed."  Documentation can create
erasures, insert people or things that were not actually there in
"real time," "translations" like those supplied to the American media
by MEMRI can be filled with dis-translations, planted articles, from
'eal" sources.  "Now you see it, now you don't."  The discrepancy
between the eye witness (whose account is valued or devalued depending
on whose side they are on) and those of the "superior" machines which
are "objective" except for the facts of their being specifically
aimed, focused, edited, enlarged, shaded, and so forth. Which one,
who, "witnessed the event"?

This is a fascinating article is it investigates not only the images
but the language used by the various "experts" on the two images.

How much of what one sees is one being continually trained to see by
the proliferation of images across the media one encounters every day?
 How many things one passes by daily that are not seen or heard or
read because of the disciplining of the senses? And how many inserted
there due to presuppositions, preconceptions?

The article is about the photograph known as "The Valley of the Shadow
of Death"--

it could be called--"The Valley of the Shadow of (a) Doubt"--

Ruth -- Of course Ahmadinejad speaks for local consumption, trying to keep the (entirely understandable) nationalism of Iranians to the forefront so they will overlook his ineptitude in other areas.  Again, he's not on the left.  And the business about "inviting all thugs" -- I'd wager that Alvaro Uribe, President of Colombia whose government has some ties to real paramilitary death squads (worse than the admittedly thuggish Revolutionary Guards in Iran out of which Ahmadinejad came), has made at least a couple of appearances at Columbia (or NYU) without the Daily News or the New York Post frothing at the mouth over it or Lee Bollinger acting like a rude host with no home training.

I don't defend the guy; he's a buffoon and a repressive right-winger with uncanny similarities to the apocalyptic religious right in this country (many of whom are gung-ho defenders of Israel for their own bizarre theological reasons -- be careful of the company you keep, it may rub off): did you know that he is counting on the return of the Twelfth Imam sometime soon and has spent millions of dollars refurbishing some monument or other in Iran for that purpose?  Sure, he oppresses his own people, but Iranians (like people everywhere) tend to be much smarter than those governing them, and they will be the ones to suffer from any US attack (the possibility of which you conveniently overlook).

And neither should we get all self-righteous about the man's bizarre denialism -- remember the bit about motes and beams in the eyes?  Let's look at all the other Holocausts that have happened in history (the Middle Passage? the conquest of the Americas? colonialism? wars in the Congo that have claimed at least 4,000,000 lives in just a few years without too much fuss in a developed world that depends on that region for the coltan that makes their cellphones work?)  And let's also look at the refusal of the US warmongers in Iraq to consider the human costs of their policies: the civilian deaths (which they don't keep track of) and the massive internal displacement and external migrations.  THAT is denialism on a lethal level, and deserves somewhat more of our attention than the rhetorical excesses of a guy who in any case will probably be out of power in a couple of years, unless the US gives him an excuse to declare emergency measures.  As the Mexicans say, "God creates the
m and they get together."  Or as Groucho Marx said, "Hey, you big bully, why are you hitting that little bully?"

All best,

Chris

LYRICAL FICTION WRITING WORKSHOP facilitated by experienced workshop leader,
well-published poet and prose writer, multi-media e-journal
publisher/editor, reading series curator
NYC:  Greenwich Village/Chelsea
to be offered this Fall/early Winter
Email for details re fees, frequency, dates/times.  Goal: maximum 8
participants, 8-10 sessions. Two sessions on performance reading will either
be included as an option or made available as a separate short course.

The discovery and development of one's authentic voice/s through surrender
to process is a liberating experience, sometimes exhausting, but always
energizing in the deepest sense. This workshop will sharpen narrative
writing skills, with a focus on process and language, language as music and
visual art, via discussions, writing exercises, prompts, and readings of
other authors' prose, as well as prose and poetry by participants. How can
we tap into our unique thinking, feeling and knowing processes to discover
and develop our own special voices, create prose that sings and images that
startle, delight, and disturb? This workshop is for intermediate and
advanced writers interested in exploring what they can do with language
within the context of narrative prose. It is also a stimulating and
inspiring course for those who suffer from so-called writers' block.

I'd like to think we can know something about the situation without
ourselves visiting Iran. Studying the eyes or the press appearances of a
political figure seems a dangerous way of taking measure, a tactic worthy of
President Bush actually. Whatever kind of man he may be, and despite the
often outrageous rhetoric, fixating on the surfaces is a great way to make
sure you lose the shell game.

Hi Chris,

Certainly most of what you say is undeniable. I don't dispute it. But bec
the right in some other countries & in our own does so many despicable
things doesn't mean we have to defend someone who is horrible, do we?
Certainly history is covered with billions of bodies of those killed in
holocausts, but why eve give a denier of the Nazi holocaust a voice? do we
have to give everyone no matter how uncaring about human life a voice by
inviting him to speak? no one is stopping him from speaking at the UN & on
TV--isn't that enough? he got what he wanted.

Best,

Ruth

but he imprisons & kills dissidents. he wants to kill all jews. he is a
holocaust denier. he is a narcissist who loves publicity & a charleton who
speaks out of both sides of his mouth. you assume what he said is sincere?
he prob will not be chosen as pres again & anyway haas less power than the
ayatolah, who does have the power to start a nuclear war. he got in the the
promise of boosting the economy & has done n othing in that regard--things

Here's a terrific new piece by Andy Campbell called Dim O'Gauble:
http://www.dreamingmethods.com/uploads/dimogauble

Move the mouse around before clicking stuff.

I'm a big fan of Andy Campbell's work. The attention he puts into every
element--the writing, the visuals, the sound, the interaction, the
navigation--is unusually strong. The atmospheres of his work are strongly
his, not of Flash or the browser or whatever.

Also, he has been at it for a long time. As you see at
http://www.dreamingmethods.com/?idno=3 , he started out doing digital
fiction on the Amiga. From the start, he's been interested in a synthesis of
text and visuals.

A pretty good idea, if (1) we want to get a line on him, and (2) if we

Short version for the attention challenged: If you want none, say
nothing. This is all about opt-in. But please do feel invited, you
are.

I'm doing something a little different, in order to be proactive in
dealing with a large swathe of my frustrations with the patterns of my
current communication and information gathering/dissemination.

It's not working for me, and I want to change it rather than continue
to be frustrated with it.

What I'll be doing over the course of the next couple of days is
leaving all the mailing lists, community sites, messaging systems and
feed readers I've used in the past. I'm going into more of a
broadcast-only-plus-private-email mode. I'm really good at
handling/processing emails. I'm not as good at dealing with everything
else, and over the past year or so the overall signal-to-noise ratio
has brought me to the realization that I'd much rather be spending my
finite amount of time in this world more efficiently.

I'm telling you this for a couple of reasons:

1) I'd like for you to realize that from here on out I won't see your
   announcements or other communications unless you email them to me
   at dwaber@logolalia.com. Please do not forward me other people's
   announcements unless you're reasonably certain there's no way they
   (or someone else) hasn't already sent it to me. Use your judgment,
   and err on the side of not-sending.

   Definitely don't send me anything whose subject line looks like:
   FW: FW: FW: TRULY AMAZING PICS!!!!! or any kind of PowerPoint
   Presentation.

   Please do not send large attachments to that/this email address. I
   prefer to receive large attachments as links to files that can be
   downloaded, through a large file sending service such as
   yousendit.com, or if neither of those is practical for you, please
   send them to logolalia.announce@gmail.com. "Large" means anything
   much bigger than a megabyte. If you'd like me to see the large
   attachment right away, please send a text email to
   dwaber@logolalia.com to let me know you've sent something to the
   gmail account as I don't regularly check it.

2) I'd like for you to know that you can receive snail mail art and
   snail mailed announcements from me from time to time if you'll
   provide me with your current mailing address. It costs nothing but
   your expression of interest. If you received Kite Tail Press
   publication #22 back in May/June of this year, I have that
   address. If you did not, I don't have it.

3) If you'd like to have email notifications of what I'm up to on a
   semi-regular basis, please take a moment to send me an email at
   dwaber@logolalia.com to opt-in to one or more of the following:

   a) when I have new work on the web
   b) when I have new work in print/gallery/performance
   c) Paper Kite Press/Gallery/Studio events (if you're already on the
      pkp.announce@gmail.com list please don't opt-in to this as it
      will only duplicate those emails)
   d) oddball projects and things that need beta testers or people to
      act as sounding boards for ideas that need reality-checking
   e) family related things
   f) all of the above

   If you do not wish to receive any email notifications of any kind,
   you do not need to do anything. That is the default I will be
   assuming. If you want none, say nothing.

   Please only opt-in to the aspects you are genuinely interested in
   receiving news about. You may, of course, change your preferences
   at any time, but, because I have no desire to be sending anyone
   anything they're not interested in, I will not be sending anything
   to anyone (even if you're sure I know you're interested) who hasn't
   specifically opted-in. No one. My feelings won't be hurt, really.

4) If you'd like to receive notification when the minimalist concrete
   poetry site, the ars poetica site, the mail art site, the beasties
   site, the abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz site, the altered books site,
   or most any other site at logolalia.com is updated, please find
   yourself a good RSS feed reader. I can recommend netvibes.com from
   experience, but the options are myriad--heck, your browser may even
   do it.

   The only exception to that is the cantoos, which do not generate an
   RSS feed, and never will. I invite you to visit them at your
   leisure, wherever you find it. That's how they're best experienced.

Thank you for your time (if you made it this far, or made it through
anything else I've sent your way over the years), I look forward to
corresponding directly with any and all interested, and wish the rest
of you all the joy your joy receptors can handle.

Regards,
Dan

I've read the link. His remarks seem deliberately coy. I guess there isn't a revolution. Perhaps it's a counter revolution, although considering the history of Iran, it's hard to determine what exactly is counter-revolutionary. So much for attacking Florida... I had my hopes... disallusionment, lick me...

I'm resigning from the mid-east debate due to incompetence. Check out the flap at the Poetry Society of America, ( New York Times ). It seems that John Hollander has pulled of the equivalent of the Imus "Nappy headed ho" remark. Amazing. What wonderful times we live in. I guess the idiot hasn't read Yusef K or Rita Dove, to mention merely 2 superstars.
  He pissed off more then Afro American poets. He referred to cultures without literature-- West African, Mexican, and Central American. He needs a refresher course. He should read Octavia Paz.

Toronto poet Mark Truscott will be reading and discussing his poetry as
part of the Transparency Machine Reading Series, in the Oak Room of Vanier
Hall, University of Windsor, on Monday 1st October at 3:00 PM. All welcome
to this free public event.

The Transparency Machine Reading Series invites a poet to discuss his or
her work in the context of other texts selected by the poet. These texts
are available for download from English News&Events at <
http://web4.uwindsor.ca/english>.

Mark Truscott's first book, Said Like Reeds or Things (Coach House, 2004),
was shortlisted for a ReLit award and received an Alcuin citation for
Darren Wershler-Henry's design. Poems appear in Pissing Ice: An Anthology
of 'New' Canadian Poets (BookThug, 2004) and Shift & Switch: New Canadian
Poetry (Mercury, 2005). In Toronto, he curates the Test Reading Series, <
http://www.testreading.org/>.

The Transparency Machine Reading Series is a discussion event by poets
about the practice and theory of writing poetry -- including practices and
theories of prefixing poetry ("anti-"; "non-"), adjectivizing poetry
("poetic"), and capitalizing poetry (first letter; letters at random).
Poetry prismatically refracts social, political, scientific, aesthetic
languages, transforming them into something exciting and strange. How does
poetic form do that? This new poetry discussion series explores questions
about the language of poetry. The series aims to offer readers and writers
a multi-dimensional experience of the shapes and sounds of contemporary
poetry by inviting leading and emerging innovative practitioners of the
art.

This event is sponsored by the Canada Council and the Department of
English Language, Literature, and Creative Writing. For further
information, please contact lcabri@uwindsor.ca.

Tom,

Bollinger's speech was really embarrassing, demeaning the name of Columbia
University. It speaks to the insanity, bad manners, jingoism of our times.
The American higher education has been one of the glories of this country,
and to see it mistreated like it was depressing. Of course, the Bush
government has been wasting the good will and relative positive reputation
The United States has achieved during the previous sixty years like a
drunken sailor.

On the other, I am glad the event occurred and one the whole it was useful.
Ahmedinejad, from what I understand, wanted to present the Iranian point of
view to the Americans, and he did that. Now no one can doubt that he is
denying the holocaust, that he is after the elimination of Israel, that he
believes homosexuals don't exist in Iran, etc. These are not Bush spin or
propaganda; that is what he says.

This does not mean everything he said was untrue. His points about the
sufferings of the Palestinians are completely justified, and his argument
why should the Arabs pays for the sins of the Europeans is legitimate from
the point of view of the Arabs. Bu one should be aware that Ahmedinejad
showed absolutely no interest in reaching a compromise of co-existence; his
solution is a destruction of Israel (his language relating to that in Farsi
was couched in theological and criminal terms; the word "idam" has both
implications). That is to say, the idea of a dialogue with him is an
illusion, since his position is so absolutist), and he himself was kidding
himself when he said he was involved in an "exchange of ideas."

As to the question of the right to build an atomic bomb. Many of his
arguments are correct. The United States, and not the Iranians, ever used
the atomic bomb, that there is something self-righteous and self-serving in
the Western arguments. But, if Iran obtains atomic bombs, and if the
implacable purpose of Iran to eliminate Israel, what is Israel supposed to
do? Of course, possibly for some of you the elimination of Israel is a
rational possibility; but I am not one of them and am not addressing them.
One question: what does one think will happen to several million Jews living
in Israel now? What is happening in Iraq now, all the ethnic cleansing and
the civil; war, will seem a picnic in comparison.

The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Obviously, the Iranian government
did not feel it was successful in its purpose and cancelled a lot of
interviews in the last day. The CNN interview with Amnapoor was shortened to
one single question. I noticed one thing in this interview: Ahmedinejad had
removed his glasses and was not smirking any more. These smirks usually
occurred when Ahmedinejad had turned one of his logical twists which he
assumed was irresistible to his audience. (This often happens to people who
develop the habit of talking only to the choir.) I assume the Iranian
government realized that was not the effect his talk produced and asked him
to remove his glasses and stop smiling.

Another interesting detail: I understand the sentence that homosexuals don't
exist in Iran was removed from the official Iranian written transcript of
the Columbia talk and its Q&A.

Ciao,

Murat

              Ask Bollinger 10 Questions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Here are ten questions that Iranian University Chancellors have for
their esteemed colleague:

http://www.farsnews.com/English/newstext.php?nn=8606300370 ---


The timing of the events at Columbia is very interesting.

The Iranian President was invited last year, but the University
changed its mind due to "outside pressures."
So why, despite even more pressures being applied this year, was he
invited again, and now?

 Columbia's controversial President Bollinger, who is a First
Amendment scholar and champion, righteously defended this decision in
the name of Freedom of Speech, only to stand up before the world, and
for the benefit of his own "home crowd" give an introduction not
unworthy of Pat Robertson introducing Hugo Chavez.  (Minus the death
Fatwa on Chavez Big Pat announced.  Pat was the only Presidential
candidate the Israeli leader met with during his visit to the USA at
the time Pat ran.)

This summer Bollinger and 7 other American University presidents were
flown to Israel to meet for several days with heads of government,
education and the private sector, being briefed in many different
areas.  The final day of the visit was spent with the military.
As a wag asked at the time--what were they doing with the IDF?
Learning how to quell campus unrest?

Since his return, Bollinger has been the pointman for a US campaign
against the Academic Boycott of Israel begun in Britain and spreading
to other countries.  He headlined a huge full page ad to this effect
in the NY Times in late August.

One of the controversies surrounding Bollinger is that he has argued
for the use of the new Eminent Domain laws in order to demolish
neighborhoods in Harlem in order to greatly expand the size of
Columbia and its campus.  (The protests at Columbia in the late 1960's
were also in good part about this same issue. The difference now is
the new laws which Bollinger is invoking. These were primarily
supported by Democrats.  Conservatives opposed them as government
intrusion in private lives. Politics does make strange bedfellows.)

    Not surprisingly, this is an aspect of the Israeli universities
that the Boycott protests--the illegal confiscation of Palestinian
lands within Israel and on the borders of the Occupied Territories,
for the  construction of greatly expanded campuses and research
facilities.
    The Boycott also protests the complicities of Israeli universities
and institutions with the military and the illegal Occupation, Wall
and the war crime of "collective punishment". The universities work
with the military and industrial complex to develop technologies of
security, surveillance, and aid in the development of theoretical
approaches for military applications, (the Deleuzian "infestation" of
buildings, etc).

      This should be familiar to Americans who protested the same
complicities of US Universities during the Vietnam War and the boycott
and divestment  protests against South African Apartheid, which was
supported and supplied by the US and Israeli governments and
militaries.

(Israel is now the fourth largest arms exporter in the world,
specializing in security and surveillance technologies.  One of their
"showrooms" exhibited to prospective clients is the "success" of
Gaza's living entombment. Despite booming success, Israel demanded and
was recently awarded by the US a guaranteed $30 billion in military
aid over the next ten years. The freedom loving Saudis in turn had to
placated with another military  giveaway.)

      After bowing to pressure last year not to allow the Iranian
President to speak, this time around what better thing could the
embattled Bollinger do then have the Spectre of Evil come and speak in
the name of his cherished Freedom of Speech, and at the same publicly
attack the man with all the "courage" and self righteousness of a "man
of conscience"  surrounded by his own police, security, helicopters
overhead and the news media at his feet?

      As the war drum beating gets louder  everyday to attack Iran,
only the slightest of provocations or thinest shreds of "evidence" is
needed to trigger the blitzkrieg American and Israeli forces have been
holding training exercises for since early this year. What better time
than to have the Iranian President arrive in NYC?  All it does is
throw gasoline on the fires of hatred and war mongering and bring to
frothing howls the blood lusting mouths of fear and murder, of the
arms manufacturers, the economic "disaster capitalism"  technicians of
Naomi Klein's "Shock Doctrine".

And who better to be leading the charge than the point man of the
anti-boycott movement, fresh from hobnobbing with the movers and
shakers and militarists abroad?
A brilliant move on the part of whoever in Washington dreamed it up.

     And regardless of what the PR effects and fallouts are outside
the USA, the main goal was achieved.  Yesterday the Senate basically
gave its approval ahead of time to anything the President of the USA,
who has a personal speaking relationship with none other than God, may
"decide" as "the Decider" to do with the 72 million people of Iran.

   The Senate also recommended that the President, the Great Decider,
Decide to call the Iranian Republican Guards a "terrorist"
organization.  This opens even wider the opportunities for "threats"
and "events" worthy of massive preemptive "reprisals".


     The Iranian President is a terrifying playground loudmouth when
you look at his competition, the Real Players.   Isreali leaders and
the former head Rabbi have openly described methods for the "Final
Solution" to the "Palestinian Question." (The Rabbi advocates carpet
bombing until "there never was such a thing as a Palestinian" in Golda
Meier's words,  as it does not put Jewish lives at risk and so is in
accordance with Jewish Law.) Currently Israel is in open violation of
65 Human Rights guarantees, by far the most of any nation since these
were instituted in 1948.  The new official policy of "collective
punishment" of the 1.5 million residents of Gaza, is an
internationally defined war crime.  The new plan, described as "a
diet" to be applied to a population already 80% of which is starving,
is also called "suck(ing) the infrastructural oxygen out of Gaza."
       Meanwhile the United Sates has completely destroyed Iraq, to
the tune of over a million dead and over four million refugees, half
of them in Syria, recently bombed by Israel.  Afghanistan is back to
the hell of a world fought over by drug lords, war lords, tribal
chieftains and the Taliban.  Heroin production with each opium poppy
crop breaks all time records in volume and strength of the drug.  Not
surprisingly, most of it arrives in the USA.

     For now the Iranian President is being called the most dangerous
man in the world, the greatest threat to our lives and our allies'
lives.  The biggest threat since--God--wasn't that just four years ago
that Saddam was the worst evil the world had ever known and on the
verge of attacking USA, Great Britain and Israel with the deadliest
cache of WMDs ever?  Wasn't he the sure cause of 9/11, the worst
attack ever experienced in history by anyone on the face of the earth?
 Whatever happened to him? I thought we had rid the world of all Evil
when he was hung!!!
       But--wait a minute!!  A few years before Saddam  wasn't the
most hated and wanted and Evil person ever to degrade the soil of
Mother Earth Osama Bin Missing?  What's up with that?
      Do you think maybe the Iranian President is Osama in disguise?
       Or maybe Osama is hiding among the two million refugees in Syria--?
          Why not just nuke and carpet bomb until nothing moves and
not a stone is left upon a stone?
            "Kill them all and let God sort them out."
                "We have met the enemy and he is us."
                     Isn't it about time to stop designating ever more
of the world as "terrorists" and every year or so pinning up
target-marked posters of  the  latest Most Evil Man Who Ever Lived?
                    How many people have to be killed to make sure all
the bogeymen are really gone?
                       Remember how in Vietnam they "had to destroy
the village to save it?" Now it's whole countries and "no such things"
that have to be destroyed to be "saved" or Final Solutioned.

                         President Bollinger and his revival of the
Sixties Columbia problems is a marker of how far out of control the
situation is spinning.
             And next month, don't forget--Islamo-Fascism Awareness
Week is coming to 200 American Campuses!!!!  (And a couple in Israel
also.)

             In 1984, George Orwell's workers had a break everyday for
the Two Minutes of Hate. Aren't American experiencing  six years so
far of Hate being ratcheted continually towards mass destruction?  How
far up can we crank that hate?  How many civil liberties are worth
losing for the Freedom to Hate 24/7 the latest most Hated? How many
people have to die to sate all that hate?
           Do we really want to find out?  We just may be sooner than
anyone knows--unless some real democracy gets put into action--by the
people for the people--or has the "right of assembly" been suspended
in the middle of the night?

Trapped in the Closet

I love you: the first lesson
gunplay teaches. I find my breath
under the table, a tourniquet
not needed at the moment.
I open my eyes and the wall bleeds you.

Everyone dreams big these days.
For instance, universal war,
or grab a massive advance
on a memoir about growing up
in a family of bankers,

trusting in quiet accumulation
of capital, as though that's
a natural fact. Was it really me
under the table? I couldn't be sure,
but I knew my leg hurt a hell of a lot.

Everyone dreams of love, why not?
I'm no different from you,
even if I take strange pride in my beard,
the way a couple of gray strands
seem to announce a certain challenge

met: we both made it this far.
Out by the beach the jets are keeping
us safe. It only burns for a second,
this composure, this disease
we accept as the cost of ourselves.
~John Beer


on Terry Cuddy’s *The Harriet Complex* (video):
Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery and personally led over 70 slaves to freedom. During the U.S. Civil War, she led raids, and served as a nurse, a scout, and a spy for the Union Army. After the war, she settled in Auburn, NY, where she founded and oversaw a home for the aged until her death in 1913.

The Harriet Complex is about the Harriet Tubman legacy in contemporary Auburn. Here elementary school students perform plays about Tubman while local officials debate whether her significance is worthy of a memorial highway. Her name can inspire pride, expose apathy, or provoke disdain. This phenomenon is dubbed “the Harriet Complex.”

The Harriet Complex combines documentary techniques with poetic devices to challenge viewers to engage history in an experimental way. Archived texts, photographs, recorded interviews, electronic maps, and theatrical performances are recomposed into montages. This is a re-imagining an American hero and the city she chose.

"There are still too many trees"
~David Hilliard quoted in Jean Genet's *Prisoner of Love*

Dear Murat, of course the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran would not be a good thing; not for the Israelis, not for the Iranians themselves in the long run.  I've heard for years that Israel has a secret nuclear program which the world allows that country not to acknowledge publicly.  Is this true?  If not, I apologize for bringing up the issue.  But, if they do have nuclear weapons or the power to create them, a nuclear confrontation between Israel and Iran would be a horrible thing if the Israelis were forced to use whatever they have as defense or counteroffensive against Iran, whatever the situation might be.  This could wreak widespread destruction upon the region if the conflict lasted for any length of time and create many other horrible conditions as well.  I think of the effects the Chernobyl disaster had on a large part of Europe at the time it occurred.  Of course, this isn't the same thing.  It could possibly be worse.  Even if Israel doesn't have nuclear
 arms or the power to produce them, the fallout from Iran attacking Israel could effect not only Israel but it's Arab neighbors as well, if I am not mistaken. This is not to minimize the effect on Israel, just to mention that the effects would not  be limited to that country. Regards, Tom Savage

Bollinger's speech was really embarrassing, demeaning the name of Columbia
University. It speaks to the insanity, bad manners, jingoism of our times.
The American higher education has been one of the glories of this country,
and to see it mistreated like it was depressing. Of course, the Bush
government has been wasting the good will and relative positive reputation
The United States has achieved during the previous sixty years like a
drunken sailor.

On the other, I am glad the event occurred and one the whole it was useful.
Ahmedinejad, from what I understand, wanted to present the Iranian point of
view to the Americans, and he did that. Now no one can doubt that he is
denying the holocaust, that he is after the elimination of Israel, that he
believes homosexuals don't exist in Iran, etc. These are not Bush spin or
propaganda; that is what he says.

This does not mean everything he said was untrue. His points about the
sufferings of the Palestinians are completely justified, and his argument
why should the Arabs pays for the sins of the Europeans is legitimate from
the point of view of the Arabs. Bu one should be aware that Ahmedinejad
showed absolutely no interest in reaching a compromise of co-existence; his
solution is a destruction of Israel (his language relating to that in Farsi
was couched in theological and criminal terms; the word "idam" has both
implications). That is to say, the idea of a dialogue with him is an
illusion, since his position is so absolutist), and he himself was kidding
himself when he said he was involved in an "exchange of ideas."

As to the question of the right to build an atomic bomb. Many of his
arguments are correct. The United States, and not the Iranians, ever used
the atomic bomb, that there is something self-righteous and self-serving in
the Western arguments. But, if Iran obtains atomic bombs, and if the
implacable purpose of Iran to eliminate Israel, what is Israel supposed to
do? Of course, possibly for some of you the elimination of Israel is a
rational possibility; but I am not one of them and am not addressing them.
One question: what does one think will happen to several million Jews living
in Israel now? What is happening in Iraq now, all the ethnic cleansing and
the civil; war, will seem a picnic in comparison.

The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Obviously, the Iranian government
did not feel it was successful in its purpose and cancelled a lot of
interviews in the last day. The CNN interview with Amnapoor was shortened to
one single question. I noticed one thing in this interview: Ahmedinejad had
removed his glasses and was not smirking any more. These smirks usually
occurred when Ahmedinejad had turned one of his logical twists which he
assumed was irresistible to his audience. (This often happens to people who
develop the habit of talking only to the choir.) I assume the Iranian
government realized that was not the effect his talk produced and asked him
to remove his glasses and stop smiling.

Another interesting detail: I understand the sentence that homosexuals don't
exist in Iran was removed from the official Iranian written transcript of
the Columbia talk and its Q&A.

Ciao,

Murat

Tom,

You are right. As far as I know Israel does possess nuclear weapons. My
point is that Iran possessing it also would exponentially increase the
instability in The Middle East. My belief is that the most foolish things
countries do do them out of fear (look at The United States history in the
last six years). The Iranian claim on the destruction of Israel, coupled
with Iran possessing the atomic bomb, will, I am afraid, make a hellish
Middle East War where a lot of Arabs, Iranians and Israelis will die almost
inevitable. I think the euphoric arrogance which possessed The United States
after the fall of The Soviet Union is now possessing The Iranians, without
taking into consideration how many of their own people without any doubt at
all will also die in the process. Here is the core of the insane danger
Kasinejad's religious fervor presents. For Kasinejad, such losses may be
acceptable for a divine purpose. What you saw in Kasinejad's face, his
smile, is the assurance of a religious fanatic. That's what made my blood
boil.

Ciao,

Murat

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Israel has had nuclear weapons for a very long time.(see the timetable
below)  I recently read they may also have nuclear armed submarines.
The man who first revealed this information --to the BBC--was
kidnapped and spent 18 years in solitary confinement in Isreali
prison.  Upon his release, he was not allowed to leave the country and
is not allowed to talk to anyone from outside.  His life was taken up
at one point by human rights groups as people were encouraged to make
daily life a hell for him in public.  I think he may have been sent
back to jail i the last few months as he spoke with a foreigner at a
cafe.  Having been in solitary for so long it is hard to imagine what
he could say that is so dangerous

during the writing of his book Cohen experienced a great many
harrassments and censorships, though he was able to assemble a very
large amount of documentation.
This is from  the 1998 book, that is, what was allowed to be known ten
years ago.

I am amazed people on this list didn't know Israel has the bomb.
It's been known for abt thirty years now.
That is why Jonathan Pollard's treason and stealing of documents for
the Israelis was of such immensity.  He was stealing some of the most
crucial American secrets and classified documents and peddling them to
Israel.  Efforts to have him released continue, on the grounds the
secrets were stolen and sold to  an ally.

Isreal  is the only Nation in the world with the nuclear bombs which
is not a member of any treaty regarding nuclear weapons.  Iran is a
signer of the same treaties as everyone else who actually does have a
bomb.

Isreal could destroy all its enemies very easily as the only country
in the Middle East with a huge nuclear arsenal.

As this time table shows, Israel also is exempt from inspections and
has been for close to 40 years.

It is the only nation in the world in regards to nuclear weapons which
basically lives on a different planet from all the rest, able to do as
it pleases, without regard for laws and treaties which are demanded
most rigorously of everyone else.  Only Blackwater and a few other
private contractor-armies have been able to attain this status of
being  above laws which apply to all other humans.
This was part of the rationale behind the hiring in New Orleans by one
of the richest communities of an Isreali security contractor, rather
than have to depend on the American police.


 Even Netanyahu a few years ago got everyone mad at him for saying
publicly that everyone knew Israel had the bomb.

Israel and the USA in 1988 were the only two nations not to sign an
anti-terrorism treaty and document.

They did not sign because the document says, like the Human Rights
documents of the UN that a people occupied and oppressed have the
right to fight back if there are no other means available.  Israel did
not sign because it would not recognize the rights of Palestinians to
self-defense or to resistance  if all other avenues failed.  (This is
why a freedom fighter if Palestinian is called a "terrorist"--to hide
the fact they have the right to resist.)  The USA refused to sign
because of the commitment to the Apartheid Regime in South Africa,
which Isreal has  mow replaced as the world's one official Apartheid
regime with the passing of recent laws regarding Arabs living inside
Israel.as well as in the Occupied Terrritories.


Here is the timetable from Dr Cohen's book, Israel and the Bomb:

# In the period 1955-1957 a heated debate took place within the small
scientific and policy community in Israel regarding the feasibility
and desirability of the nuclear weapons option. When Shimon Peres put
together the Dimona deal in 1957, and obtained massive French
assistance, Ben Gurion gave the go-ahead to the project.

# The United States "discovered" the Dimona project in late 1960,
almost three years after it had been launched. The late discovery of
Dimona is one of the colossal blunders of American intelligence. (In
comparative terms, this failure was more severe than the failure to
identify the Indian test in 1998.) Israel and the Bomb revisits this
intelligence failure.

# President Kennedy was the only American president who made serious
efforts to curb the Israeli nuclear project. Based on a volume of
newly declassified documents as well as interviews, Israel and the
Bomb reconstructs the details of Kennedy's efforts. Cohen suggests
that Ben Gurion's resignation in 1963 may have been triggered, in
part, by Kennedy's pressure.

# The visiting American scientists never found direct evidence that
Israel engaged in weapons-related activities. The book explains why.
The book also reveals that the CIA, since the early-mid 1960s,
understood and presumed that Israel was determined to develop nuclear
weapons. By late 1966 the CIA circulated reports that Israel completed
the development phase of its nuclear program, and was only weeks away
from having a fully assembled bomb. Such information was never shared
with the inspection teams that visited Dimona, nor was it accepted by
the State Department.

# By late 1966 Israel completed the development phase of the nuclear
project. Yet Prime Minister Eshkol forcefully disallowed a nuclear
test, knowing that such an act would violate the unique set of tacit
understandings he had with the United States.

# The June 1967 War had an important nuclear dimension. New and
little-known Israeli and American sources suggest that Israel had
improvised two nuclear devices and placed them under alert. Cohen
suggests that some time prior to the Six-Day War Israel had achieved a
rudimentary nuclear weapons capability, and during the tense days of
the crisis in late May it placed that capability under "operational
alert." By the eve of the war Israel had two deliverable explosive
devices.

# The advent of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968 set the
stage for the most direct confrontation between the United States and
Israel on the nuclear issue during the Johnson era.. Based on newly
declassified documents and oral history Israel and the
Bombreconstructs the details of the last American-Israeli
confrontation on the nuclear issue. The two prime players in that
confrontation were Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin and Assistant Secretary of
Defense Paul Warnke.

# A new set of American-Israeli understandings on the nuclear issue
came into being in 1970 through meetings between President Richard
Nixon and Prime Minister Golda Meir. The United States no longer
pressed Israel to sign the NPT; it also ended the visits at Dimona. In
return, Israel is committed to maintaining a low profile nuclear
posture: no testing, no declaration, no acknowledgment. With these
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" understandings nuclear opacity was born. Those
understanding persist today.

Beauty Talk & Monsters: Masha Tupitsyn + Nora, a film + Gay Boy Hustlers +
music by Amelia

Masha Tupitsyn is a fiction writer and feminist critic who lives in New Yor=
k
City. She received her MA in Literature and Cultural Theory from the
University of Sussex in England. Her fiction and criticism has been
published or is forthcoming in the anthology Wreckage of Reason:
XXperimental Women Writers Writing in the 21st Century, Make/Shift, and
Bookforum, among other places. Beauty Talk & Monsters, her first book, is a
collection of film-based stories recently published by Semiotext(e). She is
currently working on her new book, Showtime. Masha=B9s reading will be
accompanied by a screening of Nora, a short narrative by Portland-based
artists Holly Andres and Grace Carter, in which an afternoon encounter
between two lovers plays out in an unusual fashion. The film examines gende=
r
roles in terms of sexuality, power, violence and commerce by using tools of
the classic suspense/thriller genre, most notably Hitchcock's Psycho. Holly
Andres approaches her work in a multidisciplinary manner and has worked in
film, photography, sculpture and installation. Her work has been featured i=
n
the Oregon Biennial at the Portland Art Museum, The Portland International
Film Festival and the Perpetual Art Machine in New York. She is presently
the featured artist in the exhibition "Girl Machine" at the Honfleur Galler=
y
in Washington DC and her work was recently shown at The Jen Bekman Gallery
in NYC as part of the "Hey, Hot Shot!" competition/exhibition. Grace Carter
has been working in theatre arts, performance and filmmaking for the past
seven years in Portland OR. Her films have been screened at several
festivals including The Portland Documentary and Experimental Film Festival=
,
The Portland International Film Festival and the Oregon Biennial at the
Portland Art Museum. Grace was the recipient of a Regional Arts and Culture
Council project grant in 2007 (NORA). She has worked as an actor on many
film projects, most recently, Paranoid Park, a new feature film by Gus Van
Sant. Update! The night will also include Joe's Corner, a video installatio=
n
by the artist Maureen Catbagan and a performance by Brooklyn-based musician
Amelia. Joe's Corner is a life-size video portrait series where androgynous
girls dress up as Joe Dallesandro (icon from Andy Warhol=B9s factory) and pos=
e
as gay boy hustlers who stare seductively and taunt viewers. A Victor
Victoria spin on Warholian gritty glamour. Maureen Catbagan is originally
from Manila, Philippines and currently lives and works in New York City .
She received her BFA in Painting at SUNY Binghamton , and a MFA in Sculptur=
e
at CUNY - City College . She has shown in a number of museum, galleries, an=
d
art festivals including The Contemporary Museum in Honolulu, Lab Gallery,
Jack Tilton, A.I.R. Gallery, ABC No Rio, and D.U.M.B.O. Arts Festival.
Amelia is from Maine and Georgia and Florida and now she lives in Brooklyn.
She plays the guitar and makes songs by herself. You can be her internet

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT:
=20
BASIC AND BOLD: LOGOS R US =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 9TH
=20
Every writer finds a niche, a gesture, the thing that works in what they do=
.
At some point it may become a style or convention.  Sometimes it becomes a
crutch.  One way to break the mode is to be radical=8Bthat is, return to the
roots.  What brought you to poetry in the first place? This is a workshop
for writers who want to re-look at how the structure and elements of poetry
provide the wherewithal to make poems that are as ambitious, thoughtful and
innovative as you want them to be. There will be in class writing,
assignments, reading, and a revision project called =8BCAN THIS POEM BE
SAVED?=8B in which you bring a poem that simply has not come to closure; seem=
s
to be stuck; or needs to be looked at by fresh eyes in the hope of finding
what could make it work. This workshop is geared toward writers who have
been seriously writing for some time.  Please submit 5-8 pages of poetry an=
d
a brief description of what you=B9d like to accomplish in the workshop by
September 28. African American poet, playwright and cultural commentator,
Patricia Spears Jones is author of two collections, Femme du Monde and The
Weather That Kills.
=20
POETRY LAB: FORMS OF JOYFUL EXPERIMENTATION =AD TODD COLBY
FRIDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 12TH


In this workshop we'll forge new paths to the poem by investigating how far
a poem can depart from being =B3a poem=B2 and yet still be a poem. We'll
experiment with breath, heartbeat, movement, blogs, the alchemy of words,
visions, letters to the editor, spontaneity, psychoanalysis, collaborations=
,
appropriations and self-hypnosis, along with various traditional forms. The
main objective is to create a supportive and inviting atmosphere in our
joyfully experimental "Lab." A partial reading list will include: Hannah
Weiner, Jacques Lacan, Gertrude Stein, Diane Williams, David Markson,
Miranda July, Thomas Bernhard, Bill Knott, Arthur Rimbaud, Alice Notley,
Mina Loy, Charles Olson, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Todd Colby is the author
of Tremble & Shine, Riot in the Charm Factory, Cush, and Ripsnort, all of
which were published by Soft Skull Press.
=20
WORLDLY AND INFINITELY DIMENSIONAL:
A WORKSHOP =AD RACHEL LEVITSKY
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 13
=20
In these times, the possibilities by which we may amplify, record, document=
,
display, shape, formulate, and publish words increases daily. Although
expanded media and its wide reach are in themselves a meaningful fact of ou=
r
times, they don=B9t necessarily enhance a poetry=B9s resonance. How do we, and
by we I mean both ourselves as ones and ourselves as groups, best construct
and perform our poetries so as to be present in these particular times and
yet open to the infinite possibilities of =B3projection,=B2 =B3conception,=B2
=B3performance=B2? Familiarizing ourselves with poets like Abigail Child, Julie
Patton, Cecilia Vicu=F1a, Bob Dylan, Linton Kwesi Johnson (some will be
visiting the workshop), we will consider all means available and any means
necessary to project living works into our world. Individually and
collaboratively we=B9ll construct performances, visual works, sound events,
improvisations, etc. Rachel Levitsky is the author of Under the Sun
(Futurepoem) and is the founder and co-editor of Belladonna Books.
=20
=20

Project membership and tuition for any and all fall spring and fall classes=
.

Last month in Newfoundland I had some smoked mackerel
that my host's teen daughter caught the day before.

Yum and yum.

I had always thought that fish was smoked for days and days.

Women, Action & the Media:
A Conference for Activists, Journalists & Everyone
MIT’s Stata Center, Cambridge, MA
March 28 - March 30, 2008

2008 CALL FOR PROPOSALS
http://www.centerfornewwords.org/wam/call_for_proposals.php

At Women, Action & the Media (WAM!) 2008, we’ll share
facts and ideas, develop skills, build collaborations,
and create action plans to amplify progressive women’s
public voices in society. We’re bringing together more
than 400 participants to exchange observations, ideas,
experiences, opinions, and tools for change—and plan
together for action.

We invite you to submit a proposal for a workshop,
panel, strategy meeting, digital multimedia
presentation, or other conference session. We want to
hear your ideas whether you’re a media producer or a
PR strategist, a journalist, an activist, an academic,
a community organizer, a funder or philanthropist, a
“citizen” media watchdog, a media policy advocate, an
alternative-network-builder, a blogger, writer,
teacher, artist, technology trainer, cartoonist,
deejay, (etc!) — we especially encourage proposals
from women of color, women under 25 and over 65,
low-income women, professionals/producers working in
broadcast and online media, and students.

Please send us your session proposals. We encourage
you to be creative not only with your proposed topic
and content, but in your means of presentation—we’re
seeking interactive, provocative, dialogue-rich
sessions that might as easily involve multimedia,
collaborative projects, skills training or live
performance as a panel or standard speaker.


To Submit a Proposal
Please submit a proposal (not more than 500 words)
including:
o Presenters’ first and last names (please only
propose presenters whose availability to attend has
been confirmed)
o Relevant biographical information for each presenter
(please be sure to include any information which will
help us ensure equitable representation of speakers on
the basis of race/ethnicity, class, sexual
orientation, gender identity, degree of physical
ability, and age)
o Goal of the session: What are the
presenter/organizers goals for producing this session
and what do you hope will happen?
o Format of presentation, plus unique features, e.g.,
equipment needs
o What type of audience your presentation is geared
toward. Please be specific as to what you assume
people attending your session will already know, what
skills or experience they should have, etc.
o Email address
o Mailing address
o Telephone number(s)
o Title of the presentation
Incomplete proposals may not be considered.

Length: 250 to 500 words

Preference will be given to sessions that:
o involve at least 50 percent women of color as
presenters or session leaders
o involve low-income women as presenters or session
leaders
o involve women under 25 and/or women over 65 as
presenters or session leaders
o have a goal of fostering post-conference action or
activism by the participants

Formats for presentations may include:
o multimedia/performance - e.g., video, guerrilla
theater, etc.
o lecture (must include significant time for q&a)
o workshop (hands-on skill-building)
o strategic planning, collaboration or
action/organizing meeting
o panel discussion with moderator (must include
significant time for q&a)
o media action brunch (planning for post-conference
action)
o combinations of these formats, or other formats
entirely!

All sessions should run for 90 minutes.

Timeline and Important Dates:
Proposal submission deadline: 10/12/2007
Notification of acceptance or rejection: 11/9/2007

Please feel free to call us with questions as you
prepare your proposals: 617-876-5310. Submissions will
be reviewed and evaluated by the steering committee.
Please send your submission to
wam2008@centerfornewwords.org with the subject line

Subject: New Perforations call for material: THE INHUMAN/...SPIRIT

Public Domain Inc. announces the call for submissions for Perforations 31:
*
The Inhuman: Anticipations, Thresholds, Technics -
Special Effects of the Spirit.

*

Any mention of 'spirit' is sure to induce a spirited discussion with
us moderns, unless we believe there is a New Age a'coming (and which
is perpetually on the way)-- or not -- and we've already made up our
mind.

But everyone likes a good supernatural horror flick, a good ghost
story, or a good performance artist who spazzes out or the latest
paranormal reports of sprites, spirits, the  possessed, ufos, Virgin
Mary apparitions, crop circles, the latest Halo 3.0 release, and much
more.

At the same time, the technical apparatus which surrounds us, enters
us, comes from us, makes us doubt what the  'human' is and what the
limits and borders of that may be and whether a technical
civilization is on the way to crossing the Nietzschean bridge to ...
something else.

this issue of perforations is interested in the 'something else'
that folds into the 'spirit.'

For a more considered exploration of the Perf 31 problematic please go to:

http://www.pd.org/Perforations/perf31/index-perf31.html

Node 31 of Perforations will entertain your multi-media
contributions. videos, hyper-texts, articles, reviews.
Deadline: April 2008
Thank you for your consideration..

To code is not to produce codework; it is to produce code on the level of
the code or interface. Bridged code, embedded code, is not codework; the
irreversible spew of cellular automata is codework, all the better if the
rules are noisy. The cultural production of codework abjures
intensifications, strange attractors, descriptions such as this (which is
the oldest game in the book). The hunt and reception of short-wave number
codes is codework. Writers on the edge are circumscribed by codework,
malfunctioned psychoanalytics, scatologies endlessly coded and decoded;
the codes are dissolute, partial, always already incomplete: the differend
is codework.

To my sorrow I came across
http://www.oceansalive.org/eat.cfm?subnav=bestandworst&link=hp, which
has a pull-down menu of commercially-available fish, with ecological
and health ratings. Herring and the mackerel we're most likely to
find in the market are fine, a lot of other favorites not so.

I was in Holland for the annual herring fest. Fillets of young
herring were given out free and fresh from the ocean in celebration
of the new season. It's been probably 20 years, but I can still taste them.

ooohhh, mackerel! i love mackerel, smoked or not.

shines like rotten mackerel

alton brown's website on food network had a way to make a smoker :
basically two large flowerpots, a hotplate, a large (10 gal?) metal
pasta pot, wood chips, a grate, and a thermometer.

works best to smoke fish -- our hot plate burned out after two smoking
sessions tho

All best,

Was just trying to compile a list of songs which people find the most offensive vis-a-vis women and those which are perceived to set the clock back the furthest on feminism/equality?? My first vote is for Sheena Easton's "(My Baby Takes)The Morning Train," which seems to be an anthem for those who feel women are parasitic sex bunnies and happiest thus....of course there are the so-called obvious songs like "Stand By Your Man," although I always focused on the line "After all, he's just a man..." as a very funny condescending line...any suggestions? send to Bewitjanus@aol.com and the final top ten or twenty or whatever will be blog-logged at Joe Brainard's Pyjamas (www. joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com)?...merci. Bill

To my sorrow I came across http://www.oceansalive.org/eat.cfm?subnav=bestandworst&link=hp, which has a pull-down menu of commercially-available fish, with ecological and health ratings. Herring and the mackerel we're most likely to find in the market are fine, a lot of other favorites not so.?
?
I was in Holland for the annual herring fest. Fillets of young herring were given out free and fresh from the ocean in celebration of the new season. It's been probably 20 years, but I can still taste them.?

*Air Force refused to fly weapons (nukes) to Middle East theater*

By Wayne Madsen
Sept. 24, 2007
Author's website

WMR has learned from U.S. and foreign intelligence sources that the B-52
transporting six stealth AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles, each armed with a
W-80-1 nuclear warhead, on August 30, were destined for the Middle East via
Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

However, elements of the Air Force, supported by U.S. intelligence agency
personnel, successfully revealed the ultimate destination of the nuclear
weapons and the mission was aborted due to internal opposition within the
Air Force and U.S. Intelligence Community.

Yesterday, the /Washington Post/ attempted to explain away the fact that
America's nuclear command and control system broke down in an unprecedented
manner by reporting that it was the result of "security failures at multiple
levels." It is now apparent that the command and control breakdown, reported
as a BENT SPEAR incident to the Secretary of Defense and White House, was
not the result of a command and control chain-of-command "failures" but the
result of a revolt and push back by various echelons within the Air Force
and intelligence agencies against a planned U.S. attack on Iran using
nuclear and conventional
weapons.

The /Washington Post/ story on BENT SPEAR may have actually been an effort
in damage control by the Bush administration. WMR has been informed by a
knowledgeable source that one of the six nuclear-armed cruise missiles was,
and may still be, unaccounted for. In that case, the nuclear reporting
incident would have gone far beyond BENT SPEAR to a National Command
Authority alert known as EMPTY QUIVER, with the special classification of
PINNACLE.

Just as this report was being prepared, /Newsweek/ reported that Vice
President Dick Cheney's recently-departed Middle East adviser, David
Wurmser, told a small group of advisers some months ago that Cheney had
considered asking Israel to launch a missile attack on the Iranian nuclear
site at Natanz. Cheney reasoned that after an Iranian retaliatory strike,
the United States would have ample reasons to launch its own massive attack
on Iran. However, plans for Israel to attack Iran directly were altered to
an Israeli attack on a supposed Syrian-Iranian-North Korean nuclear
installation in northern Syria.

WMR has learned that a U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and conventional
weapons was scheduled to coincide with Israel's September 6 air attack on a
'reputed Syrian nuclear facility' in Dayr az-Zwar, near the village of Tal
Abyad, in northern Syria, near the Turkish border. Israel's attack, code
named OPERATION ORCHARD, was to provide a reason for the U.S. to strike
Iran. The neo-conservative propaganda onslaught was to cite the cooperation
of the George Bush's three remaining "Axis of Evil" states -- Syria, Iran,
and North Korea -- to justify a sustained Israeli attack on Syria and a
massive U.S. military attack on Iran.

WMR has learned from military sources on both sides of the Atlantic that
there was a definite connection between Israel's OPERATION ORCHARD and BENT
SPEAR involving the B-52 that flew the six nuclear-armed cruise missiles
from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale. There is also a
connection between these two events as the Pentagon's highly-classified
PROJECT CHECKMATE, a compartmented U.S. Air Force program that has been
working on an attack plan for Iran since June 2007, around the same time
that Cheney was working on the joint Israeli-U.S. attack scenario on Iran.

PROJECT CHECKMATE was leaked in an article by military analyst Eric Margolis
in the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper, the /Times of London/, is a program
that involves over two dozen Air Force officers and is headed by Brig. Gen.
Lawrence Stutzriem and his chief civilian adviser, Dr. Lani Kass, a former
Israeli military intelligence officer who, astoundingly, is *now involved in
planning a joint U.S.-Israeli massive military attack on Iran* that involves
a "decapitating" blow on Iran by hitting between three to four thousand
targets in the country. Stutzriem and Kass report directly to the Air Force
Chief of Staff, General Michael Moseley, who has also been charged with
preparing a report on the B-52/nuclear weapons incident.

Kass' area of speciality is cyber-warfare, which includes ensuring
"information blockades," such as that imposed by the Israeli government on
the Israeli media regarding the Syrian air attack on the alleged Syrian
"nuclear installation." British intelligence sources have reported that the
Israeli attack on Syria was a "true flag" attack originally designed to
foreshadow a U.S. attack on Iran. After the U.S. Air Force push back against
transporting the six cruise nuclear-armed AGM-129s to the Middle East,
Israel went ahead with its attack on Syria anyhow in order to help ratchet
up tensions between Washington on one side and Damascus, Tehran, and
Pyongyang on the other.

The other part of CHECKMATE's brief is to ensure that a media "perception
management" is waged against Syria, Iran, and North Korea. This involves
articles such as that which appeared with Joby Warrick's and Walter Pincus'
bylines in yesterdays /Washington Post/. The article, titled "The Saga of a
Bent Spear," quotes a number of seasoned Air Force nuclear weapons experts
as saying that such an incident is unprecedented in the history of the Air
Force. For example, Retired Air Force General Eugene Habiger, the former
chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, said he has been in the "nuclear
business" since 1966 and has never been aware of an incident "more
disturbing."

Command and control breakdowns involving U.S. nuclear weapons are
unprecedented, except for that fact that the U.S. military is now waging an
internal war against neo-cons who are embedded in the U.S. government and
military chain of command who are intent on using nuclear weapons in a
pre-emptive war with Iran.

CHECKMATE and OPERATION ORCHARD would have provided the cover for a
pre-emptive U.S. and Israeli attack on Iran had it not been for BENT SPEAR
involving the B-52. In on the plan to launch a pre-emptive attack on Iran
involving nuclear weapons were, according to our sources, *Cheney, National
Security Adviser Stephen Hadley; members of the CHECKMATE team at the
Pentagon, who have close connections to Israeli intelligence and pro-Israeli
think tanks in Washington, including the Hudson Institute; British Foreign
Secretary David Miliband, a political adviser to Tony Blair prior to
becoming a Member of Parliament; Israeli political leaders like Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert and Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu; and French Foreign
Minister Bernard Kouchner, who did his part last week to ratchet up tensions
with Iran by suggesting that war with Iran was a probability. * *Kouchner
retracted his statement after the U.S. plans for Iran were delayed.*

Although the Air Force tried to keep the B-52 nuclear incident from the
media, anonymous Air Force personnel leaked the story to /Military Times/ on
September 5, the day before the Israelis attacked the alleged nuclear
installation in Syria and the day planned for the simultaneous U.S. attack
on Iran. The leaking of classified information on U.S. nuclear weapons
disposition or movement to the media, is, itself, unprecedented. Air Force
regulations require the sending of classified BEELINE reports to higher Air
Force authorities on the disclosure of classified Air Force information to
the media.

In another highly unusual move, Defense Secretary Robert Gates has asked an
outside inquiry board to look into BENT SPEAR, even before the Air Force has
completed its own investigation, a virtual vote of no confidence in the
official investigation being conducted by Major General Douglas Raaberg,
chief of air and space operations at the Air Combat Command.

Gates asked former Air Force Chief of Staff, retired General Larry Welch, to
lead a Defense Science Board task force that will also look into the BENT
SPEAR incident. The official Air Force investigation has reportedly been
delayed for unknown reasons. Welch is President and CEO of the Institute for
Defense Analysis (IDA), a federally-funded research contractor that operates
three research centers, including one for Office of Science and Technology
Policy in the Executive Office of the President and another for the National
Security Agency. One of the board members of IDA is Dr. Suzanne H. Woolsey
of the Paladin Capital Group and wife of former CIA director and arch-neocon
James Woolsey.

WMR has learned that neither the upper echelons of the State Department nor
the British Foreign Office were privy to OPERATION ORCHARD, although Hadley
briefed President Bush on Israeli spy satellite intelligence that showed the
Syrian installation was a joint nuclear facility built with North Korean and
Iranian assistance. However, it is puzzling why Hadley would rely on Israeli
imagery intelligence (IMINT) from its OFEK (Horizon) 7 satellite when
considering that U.S. IMINT satellites have greater capabilities.

The Air Force's "information warfare" campaign against media reports on
CHECKMATE and OPERATION ORCHARD also affected international reporting of the
recent International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolution asking Israel to
place its nuclear weapons program under IAEA controls, similar to those that
the United States wants imposed on Iran and North Korea. The resolution also
called for a nuclear-free zone throughout the Middle East. The IAEA's
resolution, titled "Application of IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East," was
passed by the 144-member IAEA General Meeting on September 20 by a vote of
53 to 2, with 47 abstentions. *The only two countries to vote against were
Israel and the United States. *However, the story carried from the IAEA
meeting in Vienna by Reuters, the Associated Press, and Agence France Press,
was that it was Arab and Islamic nations that voted for the resolution.

This was yet more perception management carried out by CHECKMATE, the White
House, and their allies in Europe and Israel with the connivance of the
media. In fact, among the 53 nations that voted for the resolution were
China, Russia, India, Ireland, and Japan. The 47 abstentions were described
as votes "against" the resolution even though an abstention is neither a
vote for nor against a measure. America's close allies, including Britain,
France, Australia, Canada, and Georgia, all abstained.

Suspiciously, the IAEA carried only a brief item on the resolution
concerning Israel's nuclear program and a roll call vote was not available
either at the IAEA's web site -- www.iaea.org -- or in the media.

The perception management campaign by the neocon operational cells in the
Bush administration, Israel and Europe was designed to keep a focus on
Iran's nuclear program, not on Israel's. Any international examination of
Israel's nuclear weapons program would likely bring up Israeli nuclear
scientist Mordechai Vanunu, a covert from Judaism to Christianity, who was
kidnapped in Rome by a Mossad "honey trap" named Cheryl Bentov (aka, Cindy)
and a Mossad team in 1986 and held against his will in Israel ever since.

Vanunu's knowledge of the Israeli nuclear weapons program would focus on the
country's own role in nuclear proliferation,* including its program to share
nuclear weapons technology with apartheid South Africa and Taiwan in the
late 1970s and 1980s. *The role of Ronald Reagan's Director of the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency Ken Adelman in Israeli's nuclear
proliferation during the time frame 1983-1987 would also come under
scrutiny. Adelman, a member of the Reagan-Bush transition State Department
team from November 1980 to January 1981, voiced his understanding for the
nuclear weapons programs of Israel, South Africa, and Taiwan in a June 28,
1981 /New York Times/ article titled, "3 Nations Widening Nuclear Contacts."
The journalist who wrote the article was Judith Miller. Adelman felt that
the three countries wanted nuclear weapons because of their ostracism from
the West, the third world, and the hostility from the Communist countries.
Of course, today, the same argument can be used by Iran, North Korea, and
other "Axis of Evil" nations so designated by the neocons in the Bush
administration and other governments.

There are also news reports that suggest an intelligence relationship
between Israel and North Korea. On July 21, 2004, New Zealand's /Dominion
Post/ reported that three Mossad agents were involved in espionage in New
Zealand. Two of the Mossad agents, Uriel Kelman and Elisha Cara (aka Kra),
were arrested and imprisoned by New Zealand police (an Israeli diplomat in
Canberra, Amir Lati, was expelled by Australia and New Zealand intelligence
identified a fourth Mossad agent involved in the New Zealand espionage
operation in Singapore). The third Mossad agent in New Zealand, Zev William
Barkan (aka Lev Bruckenstein), fled New Zealand -- for North Korea.

New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff revealed that Barkan, a former
Israeli Navy diver, had previously worked at the Israeli embassy in Vienna,
which is also the headquarters of the IAEA. He was cited by the /Sydney
Morning Herald/ as trafficking in passports stolen from foreign tourists in
Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. New Zealand's One News reported that
Barkan was in North Korea to help the nation build a wall to keep its
citizens from leaving.

*The nuclear brinkmanship involving the United States and Israel and the
breakdown in America's command and control systems have every major capital
around the world wondering about the Bush administration's true intentions.

As I think on this one, because there have been songs that have crossed my
path where I've said, "Ooh!  Yikes!  Don't like that message!", I want to
mention what I heard on the radio on my way into work this morning.  Some
research discovered that men, on the whole, are happier than women, which is
the opposite of when this was last done in the seventies or something like
that.  One of the radio personalities gave us all the idea to consider:
"Have women's lib and equality made women less happy?"  The message I
heard-- women were happier when they were subservient to their husbands....
Yuck!

Cheers,
Tracey

Hi everyone,

I just moved back to Boston this month from San Francisco, where I did my
MFA, and I was wondering if anyone on this wonderful listserv of ours knew
any interesting reading series, any good places to finds lists of lectures
and readings, and good small presses, any workshops or salons, etc. in the
city.  I lived in Boston years and years ago when I was in college, but I
wasn't the invested poet that I am now.  I've heard of Grub Street, but
that's about it.

Thanks!

Patrick

In the new edition of the Guiness book of Records, it is a guy in India
who holds the record for how many fish you can put in your mouth and
eject from your nose. Check it out.

yeah, but amanda, please be careful with the sushi....i really got sick recently from sushi...i'm not sure all the fish they use for sushi is fresh enough...but that's just my separate, individual, personal experience with a restaurant on mac dougal street in new york...it may not even be there anymore...but i stopped eating sushi ever since....in any event, i'm all for the smoked fish idea...can't help it...do you ever eat smoked white fish?--just be careful of the bones--otherwise, it's great esp. on a bagel with tomato and red onion (and cream cheese, of course--and please don't bother with flavored cream cheese--the plain cream cheese is the best for this particular sandwich i mentioned above)...bobbi

I'll be doing a couple of readings Oct 6 & 7 in Central NY (Kanona and
Vestal)--both are roughly in the Binghamton area) with my new book "The

Kanona.  If anyone's up for a poetic roadtrip drop on by. . .

Saturday Oct 6, 3 pm in Kanona, NY

Hey List Folks,

Just a note to say that my new book is out now. John Ashbery picked it for =
the National Poetry Series.=20

From Publishers WeeklyStarred Review. The prolific Gordon here takes his cu=
es from Ashbery=97who picked this collection for the National Poetry Series=
=97but also from poets ranging from Rilke to Peter Gizzi. In alternating pa=
ges of prose and spare verse lines, he plays freely in the realm between th=
eory and lyric: Sculpture seeks articulation of the air around it. Thus, a =
heron thrusting overhead mutes modernism. Each of the 50 one-paragraph pros=
e poems starts with a proposition and then attempts to both follow through =
on its initial lunge and also force the reader off the most obvious trails =
of thought, usually by tossing in a few surprises: an Ajax bottle, Alice Ne=
el, a dab of wisteria and a strip of duct tape make appearances in two line=
s of one poem. Gordon closes each poem with an artfully clumsy rhyming coup=
let=97One packs in what one can, as the real point of art is the subtle rei=
teration of the is, ain't it? The way I see it, we're all partially tainted=
=97alternately lending irony and vulnerability. While this is a difficult b=
ook steeped in canonical and postmodern poetic traditions=97meaning it won'=
t appeal to everyone=97it's packed with thrills and discoveries that might =
engender some discussion. (Sept.) Copyright =A9 Reed Business Information, =

"Gordon's poems take the form of jotted notes in an artist's notebook (I wa=
s reminded in particular of Odilon Redon's). Each day one begins anew to we=
ave the web, having moved a step forward (or sometimes backward), since yes=
terday's attempt. Thus each prose bloc, modified or modulated by the ghostl=
y fragments that interleave them, sharpens the focus by which he 'attempt[s=
] via the unknown to give grammar a purpose.' The effort in itself is its o=
wn reward, and a prodigal one." =97John Ashbery
=20
"In this collection of prose poems, Noah Eli Gordon's dark portrayal of wha=
t we've come to circa 2007 rings true again and again. A moribund psychosoc=
ial system has seldom been depicted with greater acumen and flair."=97Rae A=
rmantrout
=20
"Control being an ongoing subject, vice, tool, and problem for poetry is at=
 the heart of the speaker's mind in Gordon's book. When the poet says, 'per=
haps unreliability is the locus of representation,' he's not trying to club=
 you with irony; he's trying to figure out how the whole shebang, the big p=
icture, hangs together. This book is about life, art, form, and perception.=
 It functions musically, it's an amiable read, and I hope it damages you as=
 much as it's damaging me, gently speaking." =97Anselm Berrigan

There's a review by Michael Tomasky of 'The Assault on Reason' by Al Gore at
http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20593

Among other things, I found this review interesting for its mention of
Gore's thoughts on the relation of contemporary USA politics and the
Internet. Tomasky quotes from Gore's book:

"Today's massive flows of information are largely in only one direction. The
world of television makes it virtually impossible for individuals to take
part in what passes for a national conversation. Individuals receive, but
they cannot send. They absorb, but they cannot share. They hear, but they do
not speak. They see constant motion, but they do not move themselves. The
"well-informed citizenry" is in danger of becoming the "well-amused
audience.""

And, later, the Tomasky says: "In his concluding chapter, Gore places his
hopes in the Internet as the source of a new civic forum with the potential
to change the way we talk to one another."

What you want is a Cameron Stovetop smoker -- great for fish of all kinds, and you don't have to mess with flowerpots!

basically two large flowerpots, a hotplate, a large (10 gal?) metal

works best to smoke fish -- our hot plate burned out after two smoking

one of my dreamiest recent experiences was a day in July 2004 in
Stenbjerg, a small fishing town in northern Denmark where my cousin
lives; one day a year they turn the whole town over to hosting a huge
buffet style all-you-can-eat sitdown meal of fish, roe and shellfish
dishes cooked (or not) by the locals: enormous platters of poached
salmon, marinated herring, fried flounder fillets, shrimp, patés,
everything, for abt $15.  Beer and schnapps a bit extra. A band of three
accordions and a guitar play old corny songs, the kind my mother used to
sing around the house. old ladies swayed over their beers and tapped
time on the long tables with blissful expressions. The two young men
across the table from my cousin, her boyfriend and me dropped their jaws
in astonishment at the heapingness of my plate; i wasn't gonna miss out
on *anything.* I even went back for seconds.  I was the only tourist
there.  In another fishhouse across the small street was dessert and
coffee; i had me a whipped cream and strawberry cake orgy.  it really
was unbelievable. Afterwards we walked on the beach of the west coast,
drove around, stopped at a viking graveyard i happened to have seen in a
tourist book, and picked up fresh strawberries and cream for dessert the
next day, when we also picked wild blueberries and visited a stork nest
in someone's back yard.

JOHN CAGE'S MUSICIRCUS:
You won't hear a thing; You'll hear everything

FREE
Sunday, October 7th
Chicago Cultural Center, 78 E. Washington
http://www.musicircus.chicagocomposers.org

LECTURE, 11am Art Is Life:
An Introduction to John Cage & His Musicircus
Cultural Center’s Claudia Cassidy Theatre 2nd floor

MUSICIRCUS, 12-4pm

CHICAGO COMPOSERS FORUM presents "art as life" with
hundreds of Chicago musicians, artists, and performers
in a single four-hour collaborative performance.  The
underlying idea of Musicircus reflects Cage's social
philosophy of autonomy and responsibility in which
each performer or "act" individually contributes to a
greater whole.  John Cage first brought the idea of
the Musicircus to fruition in 1967 at the University
of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana where its first
performance included jazz bands, pianists, dancers,
mimes, vocalists, films, slides, black lights,
balloons, cider and popcorn.  Musicircus merges
diverse art forms into a single, largescale event that
celebrates all of these forms at once.

OVER 125 MUSICIRCUS acts this year, including:
Lester Jenkins Jr, GreenSugar, Irina Feoktistova,
Jennifer Karmin, Free Improvisation Ensemble,
Aleksander Garibashvili, The Chicago Cobra Ensemble,
Saalik Ziyad, Asimina Chremos, Johnny Tokyo, Eric
Leonardson, The Unknowns, Tony Chen, Plasticene,
Michelle Tupko, A D Jameson, Sid Yiddish, Nana
Shinelfug, Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestra, Marita
Bolles, Janet Schmid, Preston Klik's Synphoric OM
Choir, Rodney Jones, Marvin Tate, Chicago Bass
Ensemble, Mahjabeen Karim, Erin Carlisle Norton, Bill
MacKay, Jessica Hudson, Blank Line Collective, Wannapa
P-Eubanks, Beatriz Albuquerque, Guillermo Gregorio,
End of the World Band, Lois Veenhoven Guderian, Chris
Powers, Kaiju Daiko, Northern Illinois University
Percussion Group, Thomas Tabora, Sonic Inertia
Performance Group, and many many many more.

The Chicago Composers Forum is a non-profit
organization whose mission it is to serve audiences,
performers and composers in the creation and shared
experience of new music.
http://www.chicagocomposers.org

This 2007 production of John Cage’s Musicircus is part
of Chicago Artists Month, the twelfth annual
celebration of Chicago’s vibrant visual art community.

vis-a-vis role models than a girl slinking from guy  to guy in a video sliding
her hands in and checking the pockets of a long array  of sartorially splendid
well-heeled gentlemen and going with the thickest  wallet...of course the
comeback would be "This is parody!" or "Madonna 'made it'  in precisely the
opposite manner...instead of trusting to the corporate male  elite who wanted to
handle and shape her, she took over very early on and  became the head of her own
music/publishing/etc empire"...but the rejoinder  to that would be, does a
six or seven year old understand irony at that  level....they just see "when
mommy needs money she should just reach in daddy's  pockets....or some other guy
who looks like he has it" lol...well gotta give her  props because lyrically
she bring the song around in a circle "experience has  made me rich and now
they're after me" where the whole cycle repeats with the  young gigolos going
after the old dowager pop star....wonder if it will happen?  check back in twenty
years or so....

Sheena Easton is almost a paradigm of the eighties pop courtesan with songs
like "Morning Train," "For Your Eyes Only" and who can forget the lyrically
oh-so-subtle "Sugar Walls," I believe penned by Prince. But lest you confuse
her  with a singing pleasure model replicant, she got all "tough" on
"Strut"...."come  on baby what you TAKING ME FOR?" Pop is too funny.

Either gender. Or Hedwig. Anyone can be offensive lol. I thought it was
really interesting when Tori Amos did that album a few years back where she
interpreted only songs written by men, many of them written about women. She did
some great ones...like Lloyd Cole and even covered a Metallic song I believe. I
 forget the name of the c.d. but can easily visualize her long string of
personae  in the fold out sleeve, makeup by the nonpareil (late) Kevin Aucoyn
(sp?).

Israel bought the land. Their policy in the mid-east is largely bullshit, brutal. But I suspect the religiosity of Amid. I don't fear being nuked by a secular state. Israel has no choice but to look out for its self-interest. They couldn't nuke their neighbors without inflicting major damage to themselves. How many nukes do they have? Enough, I think, to destroy a continent and destroy themselves. Enough. I posted a Goddamn poem.

By Wayne Madsen
Sept. 24, 2007
Author's website

WMR has learned from U.S. and foreign intelligence sources that the B-52
transporting six stealth AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missiles, each armed with a
W-80-1 nuclear warhead, on August 30, were destined for the Middle East via
Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

However, elements of the Air Force, supported by U.S. intelligence agency
personnel, successfully revealed the ultimate destination of the nuclear
weapons and the mission was aborted due to internal opposition within the
Air Force and U.S. Intelligence Community.

Yesterday, the /Washington Post/ attempted to explain away the fact that
America's nuclear command and control system broke down in an unprecedented
manner by reporting that it was the result of "security failures at multiple
levels." It is now apparent that the command and control breakdown, reported
as a BENT SPEAR incident to the Secretary of Defense and White House, was
not the result of a command and control chain-of-command "failures" but the
result of a revolt and push back by various echelons within the Air Force
and intelligence agencies against a planned U.S. attack on Iran using
nuclear and conventional
weapons.

The /Washington Post/ story on BENT SPEAR may have actually been an effort
in damage control by the Bush administration. WMR has been informed by a
knowledgeable source that one of the six nuclear-armed cruise missiles was,
and may still be, unaccounted for. In that case, the nuclear reporting
incident would have gone far beyond BENT SPEAR to a National Command
Authority alert known as EMPTY QUIVER, with the special classification of
PINNACLE.

Just as this report was being prepared, /Newsweek/ reported that Vice
President Dick Cheney's recently-departed Middle East adviser, David
Wurmser, told a small group of advisers some months ago that Cheney had
considered asking Israel to launch a missile attack on the Iranian nuclear
site at Natanz. Cheney reasoned that after an Iranian retaliatory strike,
the United States would have ample reasons to launch its own massive attack
on Iran. However, plans for Israel to attack Iran directly were altered to
an Israeli attack on a supposed Syrian-Iranian-North Korean nuclear
installation in northern Syria.

WMR has learned that a U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and conventional
weapons was scheduled to coincide with Israel's September 6 air attack on a
'reputed Syrian nuclear facility' in Dayr az-Zwar, near the village of Tal
Abyad, in northern Syria, near the Turkish border. Israel's attack, code
named OPERATION ORCHARD, was to provide a reason for the U.S. to strike
Iran. The neo-conservative propaganda onslaught was to cite the cooperation
of the George Bush's three remaining "Axis of Evil" states -- Syria, Iran,
and North Korea -- to justify a sustained Israeli attack on Syria and a
massive U.S. military attack on Iran.

WMR has learned from military sources on both sides of the Atlantic that
there was a definite connection between Israel's OPERATION ORCHARD and BENT
SPEAR involving the B-52 that flew the six nuclear-armed cruise missiles
from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale. There is also a
connection between these two events as the Pentagon's highly-classified
PROJECT CHECKMATE, a compartmented U.S. Air Force program that has been
working on an attack plan for Iran since June 2007, around the same time
that Cheney was working on the joint Israeli-U.S. attack scenario on Iran.

PROJECT CHECKMATE was leaked in an article by military analyst Eric Margolis
in the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper, the /Times of London/, is a program
that involves over two dozen Air Force officers and is headed by Brig. Gen.
Lawrence Stutzriem and his chief civilian adviser, Dr. Lani Kass, a former
Israeli military intelligence officer who, astoundingly, is *now involved in
planning a joint U.S.-Israeli massive military attack on Iran* that involves
a "decapitating" blow on Iran by hitting between three to four thousand
targets in the country. Stutzriem and Kass report directly to the Air Force
Chief of Staff, General Michael Moseley, who has also been charged with
preparing a report on the B-52/nuclear weapons incident.

Kass' area of speciality is cyber-warfare, which includes ensuring
"information blockades," such as that imposed by the Israeli government on
the Israeli media regarding the Syrian air attack on the alleged Syrian
"nuclear installation." British intelligence sources have reported that the
Israeli attack on Syria was a "true flag" attack originally designed to
foreshadow a U.S. attack on Iran. After the U.S. Air Force push back against
transporting the six cruise nuclear-armed AGM-129s to the Middle East,
Israel went ahead with its attack on Syria anyhow in order to help ratchet
up tensions between Washington on one side and Damascus, Tehran, and
Pyongyang on the other.

The other part of CHECKMATE's brief is to ensure that a media "perception
management" is waged against Syria, Iran, and North Korea. This involves
articles such as that which appeared with Joby Warrick's and Walter Pincus'
bylines in yesterdays /Washington Post/. The article, titled "The Saga of a
Bent Spear," quotes a number of seasoned Air Force nuclear weapons experts
as saying that such an incident is unprecedented in the history of the Air
Force. For example, Retired Air Force General Eugene Habiger, the former
chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, said he has been in the "nuclear
business" since 1966 and has never been aware of an incident "more
disturbing."

Command and control breakdowns involving U.S. nuclear weapons are
unprecedented, except for that fact that the U.S. military is now waging an
internal war against neo-cons who are embedded in the U.S. government and
military chain of command who are intent on using nuclear weapons in a
pre-emptive war with Iran.

CHECKMATE and OPERATION ORCHARD would have provided the cover for a
pre-emptive U.S. and Israeli attack on Iran had it not been for BENT SPEAR
involving the B-52. In on the plan to launch a pre-emptive attack on Iran
involving nuclear weapons were, according to our sources, *Cheney, National
Security Adviser Stephen Hadley; members of the CHECKMATE team at the
Pentagon, who have close connections to Israeli intelligence and pro-Israeli
think tanks in Washington, including the Hudson Institute; British Foreign
Secretary David Miliband, a political adviser to Tony Blair prior to
becoming a Member of Parliament; Israeli political leaders like Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert and Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu; and French Foreign
Minister Bernard Kouchner, who did his part last week to ratchet up tensions
with Iran by suggesting that war with Iran was a probability. * *Kouchner
retracted his statement after the U.S. plans for Iran were delayed.*

Although the Air Force tried to keep the B-52 nuclear incident from the
media, anonymous Air Force personnel leaked the story to /Military Times/ on
September 5, the day before the Israelis attacked the alleged nuclear
installation in Syria and the day planned for the simultaneous U.S. attack
on Iran. The leaking of classified information on U.S. nuclear weapons
disposition or movement to the media, is, itself, unprecedented. Air Force
regulations require the sending of classified BEELINE reports to higher Air
Force authorities on the disclosure of classified Air Force information to
the media.

In another highly unusual move, Defense Secretary Robert Gates has asked an
outside inquiry board to look into BENT SPEAR, even before the Air Force has
completed its own investigation, a virtual vote of no confidence in the
official investigation being conducted by Major General Douglas Raaberg,
chief of air and space operations at the Air Combat Command.

Gates asked former Air Force Chief of Staff, retired General Larry Welch, to
lead a Defense Science Board task force that will also look into the BENT
SPEAR incident. The official Air Force investigation has reportedly been
delayed for unknown reasons. Welch is President and CEO of the Institute for
Defense Analysis (IDA), a federally-funded research contractor that operates
three research centers, including one for Office of Science and Technology
Policy in the Executive Office of the President and another for the National
Security Agency. One of the board members of IDA is Dr. Suzanne H. Woolsey
of the Paladin Capital Group and wife of former CIA director and arch-neocon
James Woolsey.

WMR has learned that neither the upper echelons of the State Department nor
the British Foreign Office were privy to OPERATION ORCHARD, although Hadley
briefed President Bush on Israeli spy satellite intelligence that showed the
Syrian installation was a joint nuclear facility built with North Korean and
Iranian assistance. However, it is puzzling why Hadley would rely on Israeli
imagery intelligence (IMINT) from its OFEK (Horizon) 7 satellite when
considering that U.S. IMINT satellites have greater capabilities.

The Air Force's "information warfare" campaign against media reports on
CHECKMATE and OPERATION ORCHARD also affected international reporting of the
recent International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolution asking Israel to
place its nuclear weapons program under IAEA controls, similar to those that
the United States wants imposed on Iran and North Korea. The resolution also
called for a nuclear-free zone throughout the Middle East. The IAEA's
resolution, titled "Application of IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East," was
passed by the 144-member IAEA General Meeting on September 20 by a vote of
53 to 2, with 47 abstentions. *The only two countries to vote against were
Israel and the United States. *However, the story carried from the IAEA
meeting in Vienna by Reuters, the Associated Press, and Agence France Press,
was that it was Arab and Islamic nations that voted for the resolution.

This was yet more perception management carried out by CHECKMATE, the White
House, and their allies in Europe and Israel with the connivance of the
media. In fact, among the 53 nations that voted for the resolution were
China, Russia, India, Ireland, and Japan. The 47 abstentions were described
as votes "against" the resolution even though an abstention is neither a
vote for nor against a measure. America's close allies, including Britain,
France, Australia, Canada, and Georgia, all abstained.

Suspiciously, the IAEA carried only a brief item on the resolution
concerning Israel's nuclear program and a roll call vote was not available
either at the IAEA's web site -- www.iaea.org -- or in the media.

The perception management campaign by the neocon operational cells in the
Bush administration, Israel and Europe was designed to keep a focus on
Iran's nuclear program, not on Israel's. Any international examination of
Israel's nuclear weapons program would likely bring up Israeli nuclear
scientist Mordechai Vanunu, a covert from Judaism to Christianity, who was
kidnapped in Rome by a Mossad "honey trap" named Cheryl Bentov (aka, Cindy)
and a Mossad team in 1986 and held against his will in Israel ever since.

Vanunu's knowledge of the Israeli nuclear weapons program would focus on the
country's own role in nuclear proliferation,* including its program to share
nuclear weapons technology with apartheid South Africa and Taiwan in the
late 1970s and 1980s. *The role of Ronald Reagan's Director of the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency Ken Adelman in Israeli's nuclear
proliferation during the time frame 1983-1987 would also come under
scrutiny. Adelman, a member of the Reagan-Bush transition State Department
team from November 1980 to January 1981, voiced his understanding for the
nuclear weapons programs of Israel, South Africa, and Taiwan in a June 28,
1981 /New York Times/ article titled, "3 Nations Widening Nuclear Contacts."
The journalist who wrote the article was Judith Miller. Adelman felt that
the three countries wanted nuclear weapons because of their ostracism from
the West, the third world, and the hostility from the Communist countries.
Of course, today, the same argument can be used by Iran, North Korea, and
other "Axis of Evil" nations so designated by the neocons in the Bush
administration and other governments.

There are also news reports that suggest an intelligence relationship
between Israel and North Korea. On July 21, 2004, New Zealand's /Dominion
Post/ reported that three Mossad agents were involved in espionage in New
Zealand. Two of the Mossad agents, Uriel Kelman and Elisha Cara (aka Kra),
were arrested and imprisoned by New Zealand police (an Israeli diplomat in
Canberra, Amir Lati, was expelled by Australia and New Zealand intelligence
identified a fourth Mossad agent involved in the New Zealand espionage
operation in Singapore). The third Mossad agent in New Zealand, Zev William
Barkan (aka Lev Bruckenstein), fled New Zealand -- for North Korea.

New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff revealed that Barkan, a former
Israeli Navy diver, had previously worked at the Israeli embassy in Vienna,
which is also the headquarters of the IAEA. He was cited by the /Sydney
Morning Herald/ as trafficking in passports stolen from foreign tourists in
Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. New Zealand's One News reported that
Barkan was in North Korea to help the nation build a wall to keep its
citizens from leaving.

*The nuclear brinkmanship involving the United States and Israel and the
breakdown in America's command and control systems have every major capital
around the world wondering about the Bush administration's true intentions.

  You smile like two ducks necking under a Roman fountain quacking
  You drive like a hippopptamus brushing its teeth in the Tigres at dawn
  Your blond hair waves to me like a saxaphone rolling dice in a pawn shop window
  Dialing 411 while you pick your nose
  The way your name rhymes with wind chimes
  The way you cough & fart
  Stars blush with the urgency of a man handing you roses
  A dolphin calls long distance but you’re not home

I don't think there is any one song that sets feminism back.

Today's Koan: If feminism can be set back by a single pop song, is
feminism worth having?

Tracey---thanks for bringing that up. I definitely see your point,
and as a male I may not be the most qualified to weigh in on this issue,
but I would like to propose another interpretation to that message.
If it's true, that statistics can show that American women in general
are less happy now than they were in the 70s (which is certainly
debatable,
but I don't want to dismiss it out of hand), it's also possible that
American males are less happy now than they were in the 70s,
and in the sense the message can be interpreted less as a divisive
gender issue,
but more as an issue that many of the other cultural changes that
occurred since then (27 years of a Reagan revolution, etc)
have trumped the hard-won liberation struggles that came to a head in
the 55-75 era.
Somewhere I have a citation for a study (which I tend to find rings
true) that makes that claim.
It's interesting they say the seventies, being that that was when
feminism (as well as integration, etc)
seemed to be most embraced by pop-culture.
All I'm saying is I don't think that study necessarily has to be read
in a way that supports a backlash against feminism.
Curious what you and others think

Chris

Wed. Oct 3, 2007, 8:15 pm in Hamilton Hall, rm 702
See campus map for directions from the gate: http://www.columbia.edu/
about_columbia/map/hamilton.html

Not to be confused with Richard H. Tipping, Penn State professor of
theoretical molecular physics, Richard K. Tipping is a sign-maker.
His signs can be found in Adelaide, Australia where he was born as
well as in the book Signs of Australia (Penguin, 1982). In Adelaide,
a sign directing drivers to the Airport turns into a sign directing
drivers to the Airpoet. He also creates poetry sculptures with an
almost Op art tension: meaning changes as the observer finds new ways
of seeing the words presented. He studied at Flinders University and
received his MA at the University of Technology, Sydney. In 1969, he
founded the magazine Mok. He has published three books of poetry
(Soft Riots, Domestic Hardcore, Nearer by Far) with the University of
Queensland Press and has appeared in many anthologies. He lives in
Newcastle, South Wales where he works at the School of Design,
Communication and Technology at the University of Newcastle.

Excerpts from article originally written in German -
and quickly translated in English from Czech:

"The current crisis in Burma has been prepared for
years, yet a number of countries seem to be suprised
by the recent events which have taken place there and
have no clue with regards to what to do. How many
times has something like this happened in various
parts of the world? We hear emotional proclamations
about human rights at various international
conferences on almost daily basis. How come then that
the international community is unable to react
efficiently to prevent the Burmese army leaders to
increase violence against Buddhist temples?"

"For a number of years the international community has
been debating how to reform the UN in order to protect
human dignity in conflicts such as the one in Burma or
Darfur.
It is not the victims of the oppression who lose their
dignity, rather it is the international community,
whose inability to take action leaves it watch the
victims of the conflict being left to their fate."

"The dictators of this world know very well how to
interpret the lack of commitment of the international
community and its inability to coordinate its actions.
The message this sends to them is that of a
confirmation of their status quo and an approval to
continue what they have been doing."

"Without broad and coordinated international support
in political, economic and media sphere, the
courageous monks in Burma and the development there
can be thrown 20 years back."

play--our play--was invented by nature. to strengthen and train the body. to
learn survival skills. to learn the social order. to learn or play by the
rules of the game not always the hard way.

cheating is an advanced form of play.

a sense of justice is yet more advanced. it does not arise simply from play,
in the way cheating does, but from awareness of the larger contexts of the
play, the drama, and a multi-perspectival approach to fairness, or fair
play.

many animals play, for the above sorts of reasons. play works. play is
reinforced. play survives.

Hi Patrick,

I've just moved back here too. In addition to Ruth and Mairead's suggestions,
you can keep abreast of what's going on in town here:

http://bostonpoetry.blogspot.com

As far as small presses, there's Katalanche Press (Cambridge), Pressed Wafer
(Boston), Bootstrap Productions (Lowell), CARVE Poems (various sofas in Greater
Boston), and at least several others.

Welcome back.

Aaron

>>Hi everyone,

I just moved back to Boston this month from San Francisco, where I did my
MFA, and I was wondering if anyone on this wonderful listserv of ours knew
any interesting reading series, any good places to finds lists of lectures
and readings, and good small presses, any workshops or salons, etc. in the
city.  I lived in Boston years and years ago when I was in college, but I
wasn't the invested poet that I am now.  I've heard of Grub Street, but
that's about it.

Thanks!

ABOUT THE READERS ON OCTOBER 8, 7pm, at Z MANSION, 200 N. Church

In 1960, David Meltzer's poems appeared in the ground-breaking anthology,
The New American Poetry. He has gone on to create a substantial body of work
that is pervaded with "a kind of bop-perfection." Having arrived in San
Francisco in 1957, he is associated both with the Beats and the San
Francisco Renaissance, often reading with jazz musicians at bars and
coffeehouses. His recent book, Beat Thing (La Alameda Press), winner of the
PEN Oakland Josephine Miles award, is both tribute to down-in-the-street
wildness and rant against the romantic commodification which surrounds the
Beat Generation. Meltzer brings forth the original spirit of Beat in an
encyclopedic cascade of details whose dense, deep, fierce, funny, raucous,
free-associative jazz energy infuses every line. Beat Thing is an ecstatic
chant of defiance and celebration. Meltzer's Copy: The Selected Poems,
edited by Michael Rothenberg, has now come out with nearly 50 years of
Meltzer's poetry and provides ample evidence of his stylistic breadth as
well as the music and humor active in it.

Michael Rothenberg's work as an editor is well known, not only for David's
Copy, but also As Ever: Selected Poems of Joanne Kyger; Overtime: Selected
Poems of Philip Whalen; Way More West: Selected Poems of Edward Dorn and the
Collected Poems of Philip Whalen. He is also editor of Big Bridge,
www.bigbridge.org , a prominent online literary zine. Rothenberg is the
author of The Paris Journals; Monk Daddy; Grown Up Cuba; and recently
Unhurried Vision from La Alameda Press, which charts the year Rothenberg
spent caring for the terminally ill Philip Whalen. In 1976 he moved to
California and co-founded Shelldance, a bromeliad and orchid nursery in
Pacifica. An active environmentalist, Rothenberg has been a leading force in
the protection of Bay Area coastal lands and endangered species.


from THE ART / THE VEIL, by David Meltzer

Light on ancient text.
Flicker of word
Moving into word.
They ask me what I do.
Enough.

Abruptly Europe dies.
Bloody tallis I wave
To cars to eyes. Dies.
The silk blazing.

Noisily yank a failed poem
out of the typewriter roller.
My hair falls into the keys.
Not grey but silver
whose light
reminds me of work
to be done.

It isn't fame or failure
just so many books to read
so many words to write
and the backyard garden is
Paradise. I could spend
all day naming things and all night
breaking promises

Though it's probably a good idea to remember that feminism is an ism,
female is a gender.

But oh well. "Soldier Soldier Will You Marry Me" and the hundreds of

 Some initial notes and photographs in response to the "Christopher Okigbo International Conference" Harvard and UMass Boston, September 19 - 23, 2007. Okigbo, a poet of the generation of Wole Soyinka and Chinua Achebe was killed in 1967,  a soldier, in the first months of the Biafran/Nigeria Civil War. Up to just prior to the War, I was a lecturer, and coordinator of the campus poetry group at the University of Nigeria, Nssuka, the intellectual seat of what became Biafra, as well as home to the opposition to the separaton. As part of the Conference, organized by Chukwuma Azuonye - a  former student and research fellow at Harvard's Du Bois Institute - I was invited to participate and read in a reunion of my former students, colleagues and contemporary younger poets. Let alone my personal experience, in the reflective context of the diaspora of Nigerian writers and intellectuals, the whole event was quite incredible. Excerpt:

 ....The Conference, its historical moment, reconnected many of currents that produced the initial war - the drive toward Biafra’s succession, and the forces of reconciliation. Soyinka, a Yoruba, though he was imprisoned by both sides - and a ferverent opponent of military rule, tirelessly worked for a Federalist form of reconciliation, inclusive of the Ibo, and inclusive of the minority tribes within Biafra, many of whom opposed the war. Achebe, an Ibo, and Biafran supporter, despaired of any rapprochement. Both writers were school mates and close friends of Okigbo. To have Achebe and Soyinka seated together on a public panel, reflecting on the life, work and decisions of the poet to support Biafra felt like a monumental moment, practically heart breaking in its emotional intensity. You could have cut the air with a knife...

A CLOCK FROM ANOTHER TIME

There is a sense in which
we come to feel at home in the world,
in our bodies, in our lives.
This never happened to me.
As each year of my life passes
I feel more and more of an alien,
more and more the unlikely choice.
Alone here, inside my body,
I continue to watch and wonder,
as the distance grows
between the world and me,
like a clock from another time.
As a child watches other children
to learn how to behave, so
I watch other people from my window,
their perfect bodies,
their beautiful hair, their lives
unfolding like flowers.
I cover my mouth when I speak.
Keep my eyes on the ground when I walk
as though a quick line were drawn
around all my faults.
Who would want such painful shyness?
Embarrassed by my own life,
I have invented a new normality,
a standard of one
in a world you never see,
where silence is king and I am queen.
For who could think of anything to say
when there is everything to say,
and who would want to say anything at all
when to say everything is not enough.
Look for me there,
ask for me in that world,
where everyone is welcome,
on the other side of shyness.

Chris- i'm interested in seeing the citation of that study, if you don't
mind. i find that people in general are more unhappy, it seems (granted, i'm
only 22 years old so take that with a grain of salt). it seems there has
been a lot of degeneration of culture in general, but i'm not entirely sure
if it can be linked to solely one event/movement.

as for the sexist pop song, i've always considered ABBA's "Dancing Queen"
particularly exploitative and sexist. it seems to portray this "the perfect
female is 16, can dance, etc." image.

and then on the other hand, i actually find most pop songs today (i.e.
Britney Spears) sexist as well- it's as if female artists have tried so hard
to come from this submissive position that they overcompensate and
essentially make THEMSELVES out to be little more than sex machines.

How about songs that don't predate the sexual revolution?

Like this gentle lyric from Ol' Dirty Bastard (ODB): "You walk around,
your bra's too tight. It's alright. You're still getting fucking
tonight."

Dennis Hopper and I were first hatching the idea of making a film of Dante'=
s Inferno--to be shot in the Val d'Enfer in Provence--sitting in a bar behi=
nd Fenway park in the early spring--
when a Sheena Easton video cameo on the tv--Dennis wanted to know who she w=
as right away--
i told him and he said--
said--wel that will be our Beatrice!--
if you think she has enough cheekbones--
i said with makeup it seemed she had probably enough from the camera angles=
--
in the video--made them more prominent with the way it was lit--
(no memory at all of the song--we weren't paying attention to it anyway--)
thus begin the saga of composing the script--

randomness is often the "key to it all"--
a face glimpsed someplace --on a screen in the 24/7 twilight of a sports ba=
r--
between Punk Rock clubs of Kenmore Square and the backside of Fenway park--

becomes Beatrice--

seen through eyes of cocaine and vodka--and coke and  speed and pepsi---

yes, I think with the right cheekbones, sure, yeah--Beatrice!!
"and went down down down
into a burning ring of fire . . . "
