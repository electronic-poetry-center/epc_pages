Did Crowe start in "Neighbours"? I remember him from wonderful films like
"The Sum of Us", "Romper Stomper" and "Proof", all landmarks of Australian
cinema...

Radha Mitchell is great, I agree. I should catch up on what films she's
doing now.

Kevin,

You are right. The movie was called "High Art," and I am glad that you have
liked it too for essentially same qualities. Patricia clarkson is my favorite
part too. Interesting also the link to Fassbinder.

Another point about the movie. I think the photographs taken of the
interviewer are in black and white (am I correct) as opposed the other photos
which have the intense, drugged out, deep hued, interior feel to them. If so,

Now, if you had said SALLY STRUTHERS
instead of Suzanne Sommers
I'd flex my druthers
and insist that no others
descend to that hollowed place
for the poet who lacks commercial face
except SALLY STRUTHERS!!!

Her smile will be forever in our hearts!(TM)
I mean, when you think of Robert Pinsky, do you ask yourself, "will his
smile be forever in our hearts?"  No!  But Sally is the complete opposite.
I mean, that's the first thing we ask when we think of Sally!

She's doing good work in Africa these days, saving the children (she had to
travel far to find people more in need than her).
She played a character who dated a guy named meathead who in turn argued
with a bigot for 13 years and that bigot was her character's father, and the
man who played the bigot recently died after helping fight the crime n
punishment war against drugs.  She even did a spin-off.  Now that's poetry
worthy of dishonor.  Or unpoetry worthy of honor.  Take your pick.

now i know there are some people around here who know some fancy words.  but
has anyone given any thought what "anti-laureate" must mean?  whoever earns
this distinction will be worthy of great dishonor, and so instead of having
laurel placed on the anti-laureate's head i think hurling feces in the
bearer's general direction might be appropriate.  It's kind of a horrible
ceremony, but hey, pageantry isn't achieved so easily!

My post got sent before it was finished. Here is the complete version:


Kevin,

You are right. The movie was called "High Art," and I am glad that you have
liked it too for essentially same qualities. Patricia clarkson is my favorite
part too. Interesting also the link to Fassbinder.

Another point about the movie. I think the photographs taken of the
interviewer are in black and white (am I correct) as opposed the other photos
which have the intense, drugged out, deep hued, interior feel to them. If so,
the film is also making a distinction between art as a public object (black
and white), mutually exploitable by artist and public, and art as a private,
"useless" activity (the color photographs of friends, of the interiors).

Another film with poets in it: Andrei Codresku's "Road Scholar" (Andrei
himself, Allen Ginzberg, Ferlinghetti, and i think others).

And there was, in the last decade or so, a film about
a blind photographer. Since my mind's becoming more
and more like a steel sieve, I've forgotten its title.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Thanks to Robert Archambeau for initiating what looks like an interesting
exercise in counter-representation. However, I think the anti-Iowa ground
rule can be questioned on the following basis.

I would think the "anti-Laureate" award should go to a poet who most undoes
the system of representation on which such awards are based. Therefore,
positive criteria (such as Alice Notley's being a "national treasure")
would not be most to the point. What is being affirmed with such criteria
is a kind of counternationality, an other America let's say, for which
Alice is a quite representative poet. I'm all in favor of an "other
America" as a condition of this award.

But the "Iowa exclusion" criterion seems questionable. A poet might get a
very focused view of precisely the system of representation that makes
laureatehood politically dubious precisely at the Iowa Workshop, founded by
that paragon of popular representability, Paul Engel.

I think there are many poets who could compete for the prize of most
undoing the system of representation on which the Poet Laureate is based.
And it can be done in many ways. One poet who seems most consistently to
have done so is in fact an Iowa graduate, my nominee: Robert Grenier. His
entire work is about the undoing of the representativeness, if not the
representability, of "the poet." I would like to see his work recognized
for its unrepresentativeness.

Friends,

I'm trying to line up a list of the "best"  autobiographies by poets -- =
from, say, the 1920s onwards, but with special emphasis on those published =
since the 1950s.=20

Can you help with some titles? And help, too, by saying briefly why you =
are suggesting the book--what does it do well or poorly? Many thanks.

--Thom Swiss

Apologies to those who get this more than once

Writers Forum yesterday published part two of _ON WORD_, a part work
"anthology of contemporary poetry and method" edited by Bob Cobbing and
Lawrence Upton

This part publishes the Canadian poet Meredith Quartermain, the Uruguayan
poet Clemente Padin, the Irish poet resident in USA Gilbert Adair and 2
British poets: Bill Griffiths and the late Alaric Sumner

Each poet contributes poems and statements. (Sumner's statements have been
extracted from the texts of some of his talks.)

Quartermain and Padin contribute selections.

Adair contributes the latest complete section of his ongoing _Jizz Rim_.
(The bulk is available over several publications from Writers Forum; and the
opening 11 pages of the section in progress, which follows directly what is
published here, is an issue of my own _Signal Passed at Danger_)

Griffiths wrote _The Mackerel_ for this publication

Sumner's contribution is the first 10 pages of _LETTERS for dear AUGUSTINE_
(publication of the whole of which is still in preparation) and a black and
white version of _Reification's Program_, a polychrome visually-oriented
text he made for a 1995 Dartington College of Arts Conference

Like part one, part two is 64pp

ISBN for the whole 16 part anthology ISBN 1 84254 000 9

ISBN for this part ISBN 84254 002 5

Price each for parts one and two in UK £3.50 + postage

Direct from New River project, 89a Petherton Road, London N5 2QT (send
return postage if you are not sending full payment please) or from your
bookseller.

Those outside UK who do not have a sterling bank account have a problem of
course: bank charges knock the cost up massively. Perhaps some kind
bookseller will import it for you, especially if she / he can be offered a
number of subscribers. Talk to them

Part three is scheduled for late September 2001

my attacks on stupid presidents

registering disgust in sparkling ways
opposing by incantation
collapsing violent and ignorant statements
carrying his politics to their logical conclusion
abbreviating his language to irrational particulation
violating the very idea of his presidency
returning his policies of evil to his flesh and blood
transforming the body politic into the political body
surrounding him with taunts and debris
refusing him the satisfaction of etiquette and proper speech
influencing others through his presence as dissected stain
furiously disseminating abject critique
spamming his corporate distribution mechanism
destroying the anatomy of his spoken word
turning his ruined demographics against him
inverting his policies of ruthless extinctions
writing through and within obscenity
attacking engorged flesh and his political ancestry
humiliating his stupidity and its terminal effects
opposing his camaraderie with sparkling innuendo

Announcing, sort of.

After being nagged from various quarters, and even chided, I have
reluctantly posted a hit and miss confection or collection of my own work,
under the header's title.

If you care to look at it do not take anything literally. I'm an
unfortunately imaginative person.

The 'it' can be found at:

I'm looking for people who translate innovative poetry from Japanese, =
Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Cambodian....Tinfish will be doing an =
Asian-focused issue (#12) because the covers have come in demanding text =

Another piece from Carolyn Gereau, all of which I know is a snail mail
address of Carolyn Gereau, Communications Network, 1800 K St. NW, Washington,
DC.  And that it was a wonderful early spring day, with a soft breeze off
the Potomac when I briefly corresponded.



Rings

Jane, the perfect girl name, pictures painted perfect still painting
Shiny still hand grenade with wax that roommates use in hair.  Picture
The moment, look love to the camera.  Oh it's obvious?  She dumbs
You down?  Poetry, the point, the paintbrush, turns with you.  Language
Drums you down with limits.  I said to Mary, no and there was no word
For her disdain in that moment nor this.  Twenty two rings inside me count
Those minutes and see what tv-less moments have made.
--

Second moon coming soon and birds in v's do not alone make poetry but
Eyes lies sugar sighs.  You ate cheesecake maniac buys pretty shoes and I sat
On swings in vain.  Running calves she grabbed and said you have been jogging
Like the event was a story.  Scorpion does not know his place, this time and the failure
For the beast to act like a beast
creates space like a bad
museum exhibit.
--

That which returned to makes for empty.
I in, something found.  I. In. found.  Found
In something.  I in being found in.  Being.
Presidential ins.  Royal Ins.  Stripper ins.

That which makes for good bye.  That in
Moment.  Making.  It was the second to turn.
The alteration.  Movement.  Declaration of
A fact.
--


You sank my mindset with milk
And ginger snaps.  Twenty two days
Til it's even possible for 60 degrees.  Until then
Wear wool like skin.  on busses that people
With too wide shoulder sit next to me, pinned to window
With grease smudge.  I was to be which today
Is with you.  Twelve, carpenters dream and lollipops at bank
I still get now.
--

Forgive  flaws enough to give
to you.  To red.  In blue.  And I
Feel pulsating pulls into depths I never
Wanted.  Pulling thoughts
silence like wanting to know
what lies.  Dream
afraid will end. And raspberry gum, filling mouth
In ecstasy there was too much and I
decide between spitting.  Swallowing
Running not a wave, but a storm green.
--


The work week beginning makes  preface
job with bullshit.  Hunters and Gathereres never thought
This way nor does the homeless guy with his cart
who never says I am a bullshit bum.  Spare Change?
Signed, the bullshit bum which my mother gave him, the Vietnam
Dressed vet near the Vietnam wall but mom, that guy looks 25
Not born before Vietnam means you can't serve. bum hears.  laughs.
--

Pictures that look like vulvas or something similarly
Phallic or carrots or whole, my body is not  flower
I cannot seem to keep alive, plants living 3 months.  Must get
Overly excited about the life
water too much or too little
life doesn't leave so early but oh a pie in the face
Equals dash, half assed, equals who decides how it is best
To decorate a Christmas tree, I insisted the Jewish boy didn't know
And that because my mother was a nun the lights should be strung
From the top of my consciousness floating in and out  play the drums
And think left foot every other right hand 8 right foot 4 and left hand
Every other it's enough to make me write poetry or go to church
Which could be my job, since a priest applied to be the new boss here, our father
I've been writing poetry when I'm supposed to be working
And yes I repent but I'll do it tomorrow with or without paper
This began because it got too long for my head to contain you do it
To characters you see, their lives, I would like to know your perception of you
The ugliest moments have their clarity and models grow old, plastic surgery
Kept up becomes a play boy horror story.

Patent leather shoes reflecting my ruffles panties which
Only illuminates my blush which allusions the moment
Elude your thoughts until you find it down, sewer wise,
Called him Sarge like the pitbull, no beatle bailey
Was I seven or five the day became tell me
What made you that way, question you are fucked, answer.

Testifying testimonial tell me was it wrong did you
Song sty, singing meadow, couple placed on an
Island with singles waiting to be buggard
Is your love worth the beauty, and std free videoed
Voyeur.  It made you think more than the movied out
Social critique gone wrong.  Cigarettes cause cancer
And your unique little lungs are replaceable
what to do with a busted brain.

Okay, folks,

The United States Anti-Laureate Commission has been up late, guzzling
Oolong tea in a Chinese restaurant and tabulating votes.

With just over a day to go, the race for the anti-laurels is
neck-and-neck, with Anselm Hollo and Rosmarie Waldrop narrowly ahead of
Gustaf Sobin.  A grassroots movement for Kenneth Koch picked up a little
steam, too, so stay tuned -- and remember, the polls are open!

From my Imac at a secret location in a small Chinese restaurant on the
outskirts of Chicago,

=46LUXRECORDS LAUNCHES 226-DAY AUDIO MARATHON
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After nine months of continuous work, Flux Records is pleased to announce
the international web launch of FLUXRECORDS.COM Rothkamm 1982-2002. This
digital label, dedicated to the solo and collaborative audio works of Frank
Rothkamm, will release one track a day for 226 days selected by an
algorithmic DJ.

-> 1) The complete public audio works of Rothkamm will be released as a
conceptual continuum to all subscribers. Subscription is free via the
=46LUXRECORDS.COM site.

-> 2) FLUXRECORDS.COM is launched as a web application. It combines mp3,
napster and relational database technologies to give anonymous and free
access to the complete public audio works of Frank Rothkamm. Searchable data
can be downloaded or streamed in realtime.

-> 3) Minimum requirements: Any 4.x browser and 56k modem. DSL internet
access or better are recommended for HiFi streams.

=46lux Records was founded in 1993 in New York City with a mission to produc=
e
and release the limited edition CDs, vinyl albums and books created by Frank
Rothkamm, the originator of SUPERMODERNISM, and by the elite stable of
artists he selected. The label moved to the internet in 1994, to the web in
1996 and has been in exclusive digital production and distribution since
1998. In 2000 it moved on to become a dedicated server, operating various
domains from Hollywood, CA.

"Starting in 1992 I reworked tracks that were never released or were left
unfinished and toyed with the idea of making some kind of super structure of
audio works created over a twenty-year period. As time went on I began to
see all my tracks as making up one conceptual continuum. This formulated the
aesthetic of SUPERMODERNISM. As my work unfolded with one style following
another, I was very careful to avoid redundancy. The disparate parts are now
coming together to form an aesthetic whole," says Rothkamm.

And indeed, as many artists are forced to build their own spaces to
present something unusual, Rothkamm had to build a supermodern digital
infrastructure to present FLUXRECORDS.COM on a full-blown 226-day scale.

SALLY STRUTHERS!

I hereby nominate myself to be the anti-anti-anti-anti-laureate.  if two
negatives don't make a positive and two wrongs make no right turns to glory,
then by george crown me with a cow patty!  i mean, why would someone want to
be a christmas tree?

or someone mentioned kylie minogue recently.  i mean, the name alone
deserves all glory and honor.  so i nominate kylie minogue as well.

and this by tom waits, who casts laurels in their proper perspective:
alongside hardy.

Well, I'm a jitterbug boy, by the shoe-shine
Resting on my laurels and my hardys too
Life of Riley on a swing shift, gears follow my drift
Once upon a time I was in show-biz too
I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers playing at Ebbets Field
Seen the Kentucky Derby too
It's fast women, slow horses, unreliable sources,
And I'm holding up the lamp-post if you want to know
I've seen the Wabash Cannonball, buddy, I've done it all
'Cause I slept with the lions and Marilyn Monroe,
Had breakfast in the eye of a hurricane
Fought Rocky Marciano, played Minnesota Fats,
Burned hundred-dollar bills, I've eaten Mulligan stew
Got drunk with Louis Armstrong, what's that old song?
I taught Mickey Mantle everything that he knows
So you ask me what I'm doing here holding up the lamp-post,
Flipping this quarter, trying to make up my mind
And if it's heads I go to Tennessee, and tails I buy a drink,
If it lands on the edge I keep talking to you



I think that it's just *great* that we all want to nominate our own king,
but isn't this just giving us more monarchy?  I've had it up to here with
leaders as it is, and everywhere I go to get away from them, there's another
one coming. perhaps the appropriate nominee is someone who doesn't exist.
araki yasusada, because when you knock on his door, there's no one home.

sorry to be a party pooper and all, but suddenly things aren't resting too
well in me gullet.

Patrick

Hi Cassie, check out

http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_218312.html

yes check out this link in which Russell reminisces about joining
"Neighbours" to break up Kylie and Jason (1987).  When I seek to know
more about on Crowe, I go to the fabulous fan site, "Russell Crowe:
The Prose and the Passion," which for some reason takes as its
epigraph Forster's famous line from "Howards End" -- "Only connect
the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted...."

Halvald Johnson replied:

And there was, in the last decade or so, a film about
a blind photographer. Since my mind's becoming more
and more like a steel sieve, I've forgotten its title.

This is indeed "Proof," one of the films Cassie was referring to.
Hugo Weaving (so evil in "The Matrix" and so funny in "Priscilla
Queen of the Desert" was the blind photographer, and Russell was this
loser dishwasher guy whom Weaving falls in love with.

Pete Spence added:

the films generally discussed so far are all very middle of the road films
all only slight alternatives to the dominant film culture almost ordinary
etc etc//

Hi Pete!  I myself have acted in many unusual "underground" films
that represent complete challenges to Hollywood hegemony.  I bet a
lot of people on this list will say the same, if pressed.  Is this
the kind of thing you mean?  But innovative works of art or poetry
seem to derive themselves just as rapidly from the middle-of-the road
cinema (what would Joseph Cornell's "Rose Hobart" be without Rose
Hobart herself?) as from the films of say Stan Brakhage or Sadie
Benning.  Thus Hart Crane's "Chaplinesque" or Frank O'Hara's "Lana
Turner has collapsed" etc etc, so we're in a double dilemma that
resolves itself eventually down the road.

Dear Oolong, The more I think about this, the more I realize that there
can't be one anti-laureate. Anti-laureatship requires at least the whole
list you've assembled, preferably with the names erased. But better to add
more names first. Sylvester

Hey guys,

The general gender and racial composition of the nominees for anti-poet
laureate so far are, unfortunately, shaking up to be approximately that of
the poet laureate list. I think we all need to be more reactionary on this
front and invert these numbers. Therefore, I nominate Bernadette Mayer,
Harryette Mullen and Cecilia Vicuna.

Best,
Marcella

i find it fascinating that all the anti laureates
considered by this list are not "anti" but
"alternative" - and i mean "alternative" in the
same way the music industry co-opted the term -
no alternative at all if it's being shoved down
your throats

i have little problem with many names mentioned -
the ones i am familiar with - but aren't they all
anthologised? citizens of official verse culture?

i suspect anyone nominated by the members of this
list could *not* be an anti laureate

a true anti laureate could not speak for poetry
or poets - only themselves

they would not offer comfortable visions

they would probably be locked away in a mad
house, because they would more likely be using
their own blood to write on walls than pen and
paper

we wouldn't like them - we would not want to be
their friends

a true anti-laureate would be opposed to
everything the laureate stands for

Multi-Literary Event at the Flying Saucer Cafe!


Nada, Alan, and Azure are pleased to announce another event in a new
reading/video/film/performance series in Brooklyn at The Flying Saucer
Cafe at 494 Atlantic Avenue, between Third Avenue and Nevins, Brooklyn

Tuesday, July 10, 8:00 p.m.:


******PATRICK HERRON and ELLEN ZWEIG******


Reading and Video


PATRICK HERRON lives outside Chapel Hill, NC where he is a data programmer
and interface designer. Patrick's digital and textual works have appeared in
places such as Rhizome.org, README, Oasia Press, VeRT, and in the recently
released _100 Days: An Anthology_, a collection of poems on the Bush
presidency (Barque Press). Patrick has recently completed two volumes of
poetry, one a conceptual work, and the other, a loose collection. He is also
working on a poem-play loosely based upon Captain Ahab and Oedipus.  He asks
that if he ever begins to sound like a voice from NPR that he be "put to
sleep" even if he already is sleeping.

ELLEN ZWEIG is an artist who works with text, audio, video, performance and
installation.  In her installations, she uses optics to create camera
obscuras, video projection devices, and miniature projected illusions.  She
has presented work in Europe, Australia and the U.S and has received two
NEA grants.  She was recently an artist-in-residence in the Interactive
Telecommunications Program at NYU, creating a collaborative performance
over Internet2 with MIT.  She was an artist-in-residence at MIT in 2000,
where she created a serial performative narrative on the Internet.  Among
other projects are the permanent installation of a camera obscura at the
Exploratorium in San Francisco and the recently completed novel, Mendicant
Erotics, which began as the radio-play that was commissioned by ABC
Australia.

I'm looking for people who translate innovative poetry from Japanese,
Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Cambodian....Tinfish will be doing an
Asian-focused issue (#12) because the covers have come in demanding text
that runs right to left.  This "error" demands an issue!

Journals are very nice especially the pre-monastic stuff nice interplay
between him, Van Doren, Ferlinghetti and Laughlin

Friends,

I'm trying to line up a list of the "best"  autobiographies by poets --
from, say, the 1920s onwards, but with special emphasis on those published
since the 1950s.

Can you help with some titles? And help, too, by saying briefly why you are
suggesting the book--what does it do well or poorly? Many thanks.

Bob:

One of the assumptions I think is questionable is that the anti-laureate
would be elected by acclaim (as representing a desired countercultural
order). Actually, the anti-laureate could only be confirmed by a grudge, in
the sense that we grudge him/her the position. "Oh, I guess it would be OK
with me if X were anti-laureate; I could live with that." Not, by any
means, I acclaim X: my representative. Envy and misgiving are central to
the politics of the anti-laureate. Some of the nominations, I think, have
taken that into account.

By the way, I think you have to remove Anselm Hollo from the list. He
taught at Iowa, as have Bob Perelman, Kathleen Fraser, and Ann Lauterbach.
All should be disqualified from serving as anti-laureate. There could not
be an anti-laureateship in memory of Ted Berrigan, either.

We await the opportunity to contest the winner.

July 3, 2001
Contact: Bertha Rogers, 607-746-7306

          WORD THURSDAYS AND ANDES FRIENDS OF THE
LIBRARY TO HOST SUMMER  SPEAKING THE WORDS TOUR

        Treadwell=96Word Thursdays and the Andes Friends of the
Library will co-host a Summer Speaking the Words tour on
Thursday, July 12 and Friday, July 13.  On July 12,  at 7: p.m.,
Word Thursdays will present, after its regular open reading, poet
Ellen Peckham and performance poet Mikhail Horowitz and
musician Gilles Malkine at Bright Hill Farm, 6430 County Highway
16, three miles south of Treadwell and 2 miles north of the West
Delhi Church.  Ms. Peckham and Mr. Horowitz and Mr. Malkine
will then tour on Friday, July 13, at 7:30 p.m., to Andes, to read at
the Andes Library Association, Route 28, Andes.
        A resident of the Catskills since 1967, Mikhail Horowitz is the
author of Big League Poets (City Lights, 1987); a collection of
collages and captions) and The Opus of Everything in Nothing Flat
(Outloud/Red Hill, 1993); jazz poems and selected performance
pieces).  Mr. Horowitz has performed throughout the Hudson Valley
and all over the country for more than 25 years.  A CD of his
Jurassic jazz fables and Oulipoulian odes, The Blues of the Birth,
is available from Euphoria Jazz.  Horowitz and Gilles Malkine, a
guitarist who played with Tim Hardin and appeared at the original
Woodstock Festival, have been performing together since 1989,  at
 literary raps, Shakespearean blues, arcane parodies, and political
satire at the Bumbershoot Festival in Seattle, the Belleayre
Festival in the Catskills, the annual convention of the United
Auto Workers in Onnaway, Michigan, and clubs, colleges, and
correctional facilities throughout the Northeast.  Their CD, Live,
Jive, and Over 45, has been played on regional radio.
        Ellen Peckham (who until 2000 signed her prints E. Stoepel
Peckham) was born in 1938 in Rochester, NY.  She is a poet and
visual artist and has read, published, and exhibited across the US
and in Europe and Latin America.  She frequently uses both art
forms in a single work, the text decorating and explicating, the
image illuminating.  She is co-founder, with her husband, Anson, of
Atelier A/E, the first gallery to open in the Chelsea arts area and,
both for the Atelier and for other organizations, has judged and
curated many shows.  Her poetry and art have been published in
Rattapallax, Show and Tell, Providence: Studies in Western
Civilization, the anthology Mightier than the Sword, Off the Coast,
Poetry Now, East of Sunrise, The Literary Review, and Hayden=92s
Review.  She has read her work throughout New York State.  She
has exhibited at the Collage and Assemblage Society, NY; Matrix
International, Sacramento, CA; the BHP Speaking the words Word
& Image Art Exhibit, the National Collage Society, the Katonah
Museum, the Los Angeles Print Society, Guild Hall, East
Hampton, and Silvermine Guild Arts Center, CT.
        Word Thursdays/Bright Hill Press readings are sponsored in
part by the New York State Council on the Arts, the National
Endowment for the Arts, and by Word Thursdays/Bright Hill Press
members and friends. The Friends of the Andes Library readings
are sponsored in part by Poets and Writers, Inc., through a grant it
has received from NYSCA.

I nominate (even though I've already voted -- how anti

people at Crayon for bringing Mr. Atkins to my

Okay, folks -- as they say in Florida, the polls are closed.

(And I apologize to the entire list on behalf of those who sent their
votes not to me but to the list, clogging the e-ways and compromising
the sanctity of the secret ballot).

Subject:      Hannah's visions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I'm interested in Hannah Weiner's poetry & her ability to see words (& hear
voices, see visions) as a neurological phenomenon.  I'm wondering, for
example, whether it might be related to synesthesia (as Richard Cytowic
describes it in his work _The Man Who Tasted Shapes_).

If anyone would like to respond to the following questions, I'd appreciate
the dialogue.

Were any psychological/cognitive studies performed to study Hannah's gift?
I wonder whether there was any curiosity on the part of neuroscientists to
determine why she saw projected words.  I understand that she took LSD, at
least before she began to have hallucinations of color and image, as her
book The Fast documents, & I wonder whether/how this was related to the
emergence of her ability.

Was Hannah herself interested in her ability from a neurological
perspective?  If so, did she write about it or discuss it?

I read that she was diagnosed with schizophrenia ... I'm less interested in
the label of an illness than I am with what was happening in her brain
during her visions.  Hope this doesn't sound too biologically reductive.
It's one aspect of her that makes me curious.  I'd appreciate any comments
on this or sources to read.

Also: does anyone have copies of the journals she wrote after The Fast
(Country Girl, Pictures and Early Words, and Big Words)?  Any idea how I
can get a copy of these works?

Thanks.

I think we've hit upon an important criterion for the anti-appointment.  The
anti-winner MUST be a smoker, and must smoke like a barn fire at all of the
anti-meetings.  Candidates who don't smoke are just too clean and good and
correct and healthy and should be off the list.

Come to think of it, the anti-Poet Laureate should not even be a poet.  So
maybe Billy Collins wins this one too.  That would make him a poet and not a
poet, one carrying the trace of the other.  Jeez, I gotta split the
"differance," read a comic book or somethin'.  Best, Bill

Thanks for the Crowe info!! Dorothy Porter, Australian poet, has had one of
her books made into a film recently, by young Australian director Samantha
Lang. I think it was "The Monkey's Mask" but I'm not 100% sure.

I think this is right, and in fact, I wd take it a step further, by saying
that the anti-laureate ought to be appointed according to a principle of
active distaste: not just "I guess it wd be OK," but "Ugh, yes, that's the
nominee most likely to unsettle / offend / annoy as many different factions
as possible."  Beyond mere envy & misgiving, I wd say the politics of the
anti-laureate are outrage & contempt.  The problem here is, how do you
select a candidate that will upset both the traditional Robert Frost / Maya
Angelou laureate-supporters _&_ the more "edgy" (there's a meaningless word
for you) poetics-list alternoids?  Hence I retract both my earlier
nominations (Suzanne Sommers, whose sunshine 'n' puppies poetic is frankly
hip these days, & Ficus strangulensis, whose yippie-ish mimeograph terrorism
is fluxus-like enough to be taken seriously in an avant-garde context), &
offer my final choice: I hereby nominate Harry Nudel.  I don't know if the
guy actually writes poetry, but even if he doesn't--well, you can see where
I'm going ... _anti_.

Yes, I know the polls are closed, but I'd say that in an anti-laureate race,
the most important votes are the ones that _don't_ get counted.

IMMEDIATE RELEASE


ACA MEDIA ARTS PLAZA IN TOKYO ANNOUNCES LARGE-SCALE RETROSPECTIVE OF NET
ART WORKS CREATED BY AMERICAN INTERNET ARTIST MARK AMERIKA

BOULDER, Colorado, July 2, 2001 -- Digital artist, novelist and web
publisher Mark Amerika, Founding Director of the Alt-X Online Network,
will have his first Japanese retrospective at the ACA Media Arts Plaza in
Tokyo, Japan. "Avant-Pop: The Stories of Mark Amerika" showcases much of
the early work Amerika pioneered during the dot.com Nineties. The
exhibition will launch on July 1, 2001 and run through September 10, 2001.

Amerika, who was recently named a "Time Magazine 100 Innovator" as part of
their continuing series of features on the most influential artists,
scientists, entertainers and philosophers into the 21st century, is the
creator or principial investigator of many Internet art projects including
GRAMMATRON, PHON:E:ME, HOLO-X, ALT-X, and the recent How To Be An Internet
Artist, all of which will be featured in the "Avant-Pop" exhibition in
Tokyo. A complete catalogue of essays and interviews with Amerika will
appear online in both English and Japanese translation.

According to Amerika, "The notion of an Avant-Pop cultural practice
evolved from my early work with artists, writers and critics in both
America and Japan, so it's only fitting that my first major show in Tokyo
would reflect this transnational cultural phenomenon and its effect on
both digital art and literature."

As part of the "Avant-Pop" exhibition, Amerika will be invited to Tokyo by
the Graphic Arts Society of Japan where he will present his work to the
general public.

Tracing Amerika's rapid emergence into the contemporary art world, web
mavens, art critics, historians and web surfers the world over have seen
his multi-media narratives work their way into various art and writing
scenes while being distributed through a wide array of formats including
hypertext, 3-D VRML environments, mp3 concept albums, ebooks, Palm Pilots,
live digital dramaturgy, and highly-acclaimed published novels.

His GRAMMATRON project (http://www.grammatron.com) was developed while he
was a Creative Writing Fellow and Lecturer on Network Publishing and
Hypertext at Brown University. Released in June 1997, it is one of the
most widely accessed art sites on the World Wide Web and in 2000 was one
of the first works of Internet art to ever be selected for the prestigious
Whitney Biennial of American Art.

Amerika was recently appointed to the Fine Arts faculty at the University
of Colorado at Boulder where he has been developing a cutting-edge Digital
Art curriculum. He is presently producing a new cross-media narrative
project, FILMTEXT, that will be a hybridized online/offline "story
experience" created as a net art site, a museum installation, a multimedia
ebook, and a series of live performances. One version of FILMTEXT will
appear in another upcoming retrospective of his work at the ICA in London
later this year.

The "Avant-Pop: The Stories of Mark Amerika" exhibition will be available
to the public at http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/amerika.htm, as of July 1st, and is
sponsored by the Computer Graphics Society of Japan and the Agency for
Cultural Affairs in Japan.

The show is being curated by noted Net Art curator You Minowa.

Just received the new CD from Geoffrey Gatza's Automation Corp.  The title is
"John 9:25"  This is admirable work.  The graphics astonish.  Geoff, who also
created and edits Blaze, is a bit of a master on the ole' puter.  The texts
also taught me a few things about poetry, drama, new ways to experiment.
This is a poet we should all keep an eye on.  I believe that he will send a
copy in some form to anyone who requests one, as long as supply lasts.
Congrats Geoff!  Best, Bill

While I'm sure Barrett Watten is right that there is no shortage of envy &
misgiving in the poetic rank & file (one need only read Harry Nudel's posts
to be reminded of that), I don't agree that this has much to do with the
anti-laureate, nor should it.  The anti-laureate is an essentially anarchic
gesture: making fun of the "official" post & its history (winner receives a
bottle of vodka!), while attempting to represent a poet closer to the values
of the literary communities that nominated her or him, & specifically the
literary community of the Poetics List.  (Notice I didn't say a poet
*representative* of those literary communities, or of the poetics of their
members).  Since there is no official status, or even "honor" (in the CV
sense of the term) to the position, contesting it would be a particularly
pointless display of envy & misgiving.  Kind of like arguing that a joke you
were just told ought to have had a different punch line.

As for Anselm Hollo, I pointed out his Iowa connection to the High
Commissioner.  So, unless the High Commissioner was particularly high at the
time, I'm assuming he doesn't feel (nor do I) that this should disqualify
him.

Ann Lauterbach is another matter: hasn't she won a MacArthur?  If so, then I
believe this should disqualify her.  This was also the reason I didn't
nominate another of my favorite poets, Jackson Mac Low.

All Hail to the anti-laureate!  Let the vodka flow!

Yevgeny Yevtushenko was the screenwriter for an agitprop/art film from 1964
called "I Am Cuba", a Russian-Cuban co-production.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Like Michael Amberwind, it seems to me that things in the anti-laureate
election haven't been very anti thus far . . . . So,

though Robert Archambeau said>>> the polls are closed.>>>
 I'll be as anti as I know and vote anyway  >>like they did in Florida>>

I support Patrick's vote for>>>araki yasusada,>>>   but not
 >>> because when you knock on his door, there's no one home.>>>
I'd bet somebody would open the door, but it wouldn't be him.

and I second Jerrold's nominations for >>>Adonis and Mohammed Dib>>>  who
wouldn't vote for such beautiful eyes?!

On third thought, just count me in for komninos' >>>> jas h duke.   ok
he's Australian. . .he's dead.   well it doesn't matter anyway, >>>
but of course such things do matter--to be as anti as possible,
non-Australian, non-living, non-real and/or non-poets are precisely the
sort of criteria we're seeking, right?

Also, Robert, why >>>> apologize  . . .compromising the sanctity . . .and
sneak>>>>
when non-apology, non-sanctity, blatant overtness are among those things
that are truly anti ??

Yet, Robert, I do agree that a High Commissioner is better than one who's
just acting high . . . .   very anti that way, but

>>>retire  . . .  to count votes >>> count????  that's not very anti!
Wouldn't anti be to pull a name out of a hat?  Or maybe just select the one
that you yourself want?

Therefore, Robert, who's the anti-winner?

"R. D. Girard lives in Washington and Los Angeles
and writes poems when he can't sleep at night."


White On White

In the neglected regions of capital
a gentle genetic tug arcs across the shift
from tactile to digital--
your face's cold fusion
persists across generations of bathtub marxists and pit bosses
and women wearing bespoke suits.

Many years later, as you find yourself teaching
in a barrio high school only to be fired
for telling your students that the difference
between poetry and rhetoric is the difference
between orgasm and ejaculation, you will
remember the day your father took you
to discover ragtime--production trading eights
with mechanical reproduction
at the dark end of the street.

The good old days live in the electric air
sucked over and over through the ones and zeros
punched into dusty piano rolls, in the ebbs and flows
between flaccid and tumescent, in the pinstriped spokes
of a spinning wheel when they begin to pinwheel backward.
Needs not your own wait
at the end of the end of representation.


Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Greetings European List Members,

    I'm planning to be in Europe this December from around the 11th through
the 28th. I'll be based in Prague but willing and eager to travel. If anyone
knows of any place I might be able to read or of any conferences/events I
should attend, please backchannel. I'm open to suggestions.

Thanks for any help,

RealPoetik's Independence Day Poem!  By Carson Reed!  Carson
(lodo1@aol.com) is a 15-year veteran of the Denver poetry scene.
 His work has appeared in such publications as Rant, Yellow Silk, The New
Censor
ship, Bizara, Stick, and of course RealPoetik.

When I told T.J. I wanted to leave America, he got mad.
His 16-year-old self got red in the face and he said:
"Go then, have fun in your stinking foreign country with bad plumbing."

When I told Jeanne I wanted to leave America,
she was puzzled, she said:
"Do you really think there's a better country than this one?"

I said: "No, I don't think there's a better country than this one,
it's just that I'm all done in with being an American.
I wake up in the morning and it hits me:
Oh, gosh, I have to be an American again today,
this is my fifteen thousand six hundred and eighty third day of being
American."

Of course, it could be true that wherever I go I will still have to be an
American.
(I'm not familiar enough with foreigners to know if they will let me be
one
of them.)
It may be that being an American in a foreign country will be
invigorating,
people will enjoy it when I complain about the plumbing, they'll laugh and
say:
"Zat crazy American."

But I would like it better if I could wake up and be Italian or Greek.
(I don't know any Greeks but I read Zorba the Greek and he seemed to like
it.)

When I told my mother I wanted to leave America, she said:
"America will miss you."
And this was a lie, of course,
but a nice one that made me sad to go
even though, as you can see, I haven't actually left yet.
Before I go I wanted to get up here in front of everyone and say:
"No hard feelings, America.
You've all been really swell, and I will miss the plumbing."

Interest will go where'er it wilt, but---

You might find greater amplitude by not taking that label to be a "label of an
~illness"~ per se but a label of a ~condition,~ to start with,---

along the lines of (predictably) Deleuze-Guattari "Capitalism and
Schizophrenia," etc., or the similarly neutral use of the term Fredric Jameson
made in applying it to Language Poetry.

First off, to de-pejoratize your own notion of schizophrenia, which can be a
useful descriptive signifier, and treat it with greater equanimity.  Could
widen your critical applicability.

Or even Szasz, "The Myth of Mental Illness," and the whole R.D. Laing British
anti-psychiatry approach.

Or the Semiotexte back issue on "Schizoculture": a broader approach that sees
schizophrenia as endemic to America that's only emblematized in its
recognizable cases.

Her Language friends whose Weiner eulogies I read seemed to treat the matter
(evidently "discovered" late) with unbiassed candor.

Her ongoing political relevance may lie partially in ~exactly~ the fact of that
label,--- much like the pellucid clarity after James Schuyler's reported
episodes of psychosis: high-functioning, basically adaptive individuals who
found a position in embracing communities, who lived pretty much happy lives,
given baseline existential angst --- as opposed to the more malevolent "role
models" Sylvia Plath or Anne Sexton became by yielding to self-murder in the
end.

In light of Plath/Sexton's relation to Confessionalism versus Weiner's to
Language Poetry (and with the unfortunate, after-the-fact revelation of Ramez
Qureshi's similar condition viz-a-viz "post"-Language), I have, rather than
waning interest, in fact wondered whether there isn't some way that
Confessionalism's aesthetics of a concretized, reified self and ego-exposure
weren't intrinsically contributory to the high rate of suicides in that camp:
Roethke, Berryman . . .

Language/"post-Language" Poetry's literary high tolerance for deviation, its
virtual ~enthusiasm~ at aberration, apparently coincides with a much lower
degree of pathologization of its poets, generally speaking.  Rather the
mystique of the "professionalized" poet generation: careerist, MFA.

Know what I mean?

Illnesses can be fatal, but they must be potentially curable, even where a cure
has not been found.  Schizophrenia, like narcissism, by being "incurable" falls
onto a different diagnostic axis than, say, garden variety neurosis.  Like
AIDS, which is not an illness, but a "Syndrome."

Weiner's success could be very valuable in the empowerment or treatment of the
similarly diagnosed, and the consciousness raising of the self-styled
"normal."  (There is ~no~ such DSM-IV category as "normal," Camille.
Everybody's something.)


Despite the unique prominence and notoriety of (violent) schizophrenics in the
press, in a sense you ~cannot~ be schizophrenic in America, . . . any more than
there could've been such a person as, say, an obsessive compulsive ~Medieval
monk,~ or an obsessive compulsive Kabbalist, . . . or a histrionic Bacchante .
. .

Hannah Weiner's papers, including manuscripts of all unpublished writings, are in the Special Collection at UCSD. A useful index to the Weiner's papers at UCSD is available at

http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/speccoll/findaids/literary/weiner

Hannah refers to Julian Jaynes's book, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, in her writing, but I don't otherwise recall her discussing "Western" neurobiology; certainly she was interested in  "chakras", "auras" and related mind-body concepts, including native American  ideas of consciousness and would certainly have been aware of the full range of "psychological" and "scientific" thinking about consciousness, from William James and Semyon Kirlian onward. (As far as I know, Hannah had no neurological testing, though reading her work is a useful test of the reader's neurological pathways and possibly may help to expand them, which surely was what Hannah viewed as a value for poetry.)

Shuen-shing Lee of Taiwan has recently 'translated' three DHTML/kinetic
pieces I wrote: Enigma n,  Spastext, and Seattle Drift. These are visual
poems and also computer programs written in Javascript/DHTML.

He also posted to the webartery list an interesting introduction to his work
that mentions some of the issues; there's a thread of discussion 'Jim in
Chinese'. Briefly, it seems that because Shuen-shing was forced by the
nature of the work itself to do completely non-literal translation in the
case of Enigma n, what has resulted is not simply a translation into
Chinese, but the creation of a quite different but richly related work which
is probably an improvement on the original in many ways and, when juxtaposed
with the English version, creates something beyond either.

Shuen-shing's intro is at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/webartery/message/12062?threaded=1 and the
discussion threads are reachable at the bottom if you scroll down. There are
also links in the message directly to the Chinese.

The English and Chinese of Enigma n are reachable from
http://vispo.com/animisms/enigman/meaning.html

Similarly, both the English and Chinese of Spastext (which requires Internet
Explorer 4+ for the PC) are reachable from http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts

Earlier, he translated Seattle Drift, another DHTML piece. The English and
Chinese are reachable from http://www.vispo.com/animisms/SeattleDrift.html

Shuen-shing Lee is an Associate Professor at the Dept of Foreign Languages
and Literatures, National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan. He did his
doctoral work in Comparative Literature at the University of Washington.

The Chinese works are published online at The Literary Cafe, a website
co-sponsored by The United News's Literary Supplement and the Taiwan
government's Council for Cultural Affairs.

Pretty cool since I can't make the local newspapers here in Victoria BC
Canada.

Both Shuen-shing and myself would be very interested to read your responses,
particularly if you read both English and Chinese.

Why not randomly select the anti-laureate from a set of eligible names? All you
need is a set of selection rules (which you've partially got here) and
"randomness" could mean writing the names on individual tickets and chucking
them all at the same time down a flight of stairs. Whichever ticket makes it to
the bottom, gets to be anti-laureate.

as far as i can tell, hannah was extremely interested in the phenomenon of
her "psychic"ness.  there's an interview w/ her, or an essay based on an
interview, in Ben Friedlander and Andrew Schelling's --is it Jimmy and
Lucy's House of K? --in which she cites an article in Scientific american
about brain physiology/neurology.  ben sent me a xerox of it some years
ago.  in the same piece she attributes some of her psychic abilities to
LSD, saying thta it promotes or facilitates telepathy, if i recall
correctly.

The whole anti-laureate thread makes me nostalgic for the great stamp =
act controversy.  Why do so many Americans yearn for monarchical =
trappings?  What possible function would any kind of laureate ("anti" or =
not) have in a republic? So close to July 4th you Yanks should remember =
that you fought a war precisely so that the King of England couldn't =
walk into your house and take away your guns or tell you what your poets =
should write about.  And I question such whimsically "anarchic" gestures =
from people who have such a clear sense of "envy" in the "rank and =
file."

Hannah's visions, under the "I see words" rubric, were literally
hallucinations. She would see words and type what she saw. There was a
specific onset of this condition (when? how?), and I remember speaking with
her about how the words tended go away with medication. This may have been
an incentive not to medicate--so there was a tradeoff between the downside
of "symptoms" and feeling emotionally upbeat about getting a lot of writing
done--by hallucination.

It seems that one could go one of two directions here. Acknowledge that the
words that came were "symptoms" of an underlying illness and then decide on
the relation of that condition to their literary value, or suspend that
decision--no matter what produced them, they were re-presented in literary
form and hence a part of "shaping" sensibility, possessing form and
intention. Certainly her work with "codes" in the 60s influenced her sense
of the value of these phenomena.

It's not a simple either/or question, but not asking it, I think, gets a
lot simpler result in terms of reading or responding to Hannah's work and
self-presentation. Is she in a special "category of one" as a writer who
sees the words that she writes? Should a book about Hannah Weiner be
classified under "disability studies," "neurology," "psychology," in
addition to poetry? To what extent does the psychobiology of her writing
practice challenge the literariness of her work?

When we think of the various automatisms that have been put forward as an
answer to reason in 20th-century poetry, do we have to qualify these
phenomena in terms of some kind of self-conscious method in order for them
to be "literary"? What is the status of Hannah's "literal" transcription of
automatism vs. what Breton wanted from it? Would Breton have approved of
Hannah's work? Is her work more akin to "art brut," an "outsider" art that
needs the recognition of a museum or collector (or archive!) to validate it?

In beginning to think about these things, I'd suggest it's important that
there was a conflict in the nature of intentionality in Hannah's work, at
the very least--medicate and stop hallucinations, cease medication and
hallucinate. How to think about the nature of such a decision?

Well, since the anti-winner has been x-letcted, this is all after the
anti-fact.  But I certainly see your anti-point.  On the other hand, Bush was
a drunk, and his daughters don't seem to mind a bit of snake venom
themselves.  Liquor companies have plenty of pull with both political
parties.  Nevertheless I would still want my anti-laureate to be boozed most
of the no-time.  Oh well, there's always next year.  Anti-thesisially yours,

New Dictionary's Definitions Inconsistent

By HILLEL ITALIE
.c The Associated Press

NEW YORK (July 6) - All U.S. presidents since the Civil War qualify as
statesmen, except Richard Nixon. Robert Kennedy was a politician, but Newt
Gingrich is a ''political leader.'' And former FBI head J. Edgar Hoover is
just a lawyer.

The new Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary is being promoted as a
revolutionary addition to the competitive campus market, with its makers
saying its more accessible style and extensive spelling guidance and usage
notes make it the first such book truly suited to today's students.

But however useful it proves for language skills, students also will receive
some odd lessons in political and popular history in the book, available only
in paper form.

Definitions of some notable people are inconsistent, misleading or outright
inaccurate:

-From George Washington to George W. Bush, presidents in the Microsoft
dictionary also receive the label ''statesman,'' except for two: Nixon
(''37th president of the United States'') and Zachary Taylor (''military
leader and 12th president of the United States''). Franklin Pierce is not
even labeled a president, just a statesman.

-Dick Cheney and Al Gore are both listed as ''statesman and vice president of
the United States.'' But Spiro Agnew, Nixon's vice president, is simply a
''politician.''

-Paraguay's Alfredo Stroessner is a ''dictator.'' Spain's Francisco Franco is
an ''authoritarian leader.'' Saddam Hussein and Augusto Pinochet are
''national'' leaders. Idi Amin is a ''head of state.'' And Joseph Stalin is a
''statesman.''

-The entries for Hillary Rodham Clinton, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jackie Kennedy
and other presidential wives all note they were first ladies. But Abigail
Adams, wife of John Adams, is identified only as a ''feminist.'' ''She
wouldn't have even understood that word,'' says David McCullough, author of
the best-selling biography ''John Adams.''

Anne Soukhanov, the dictionary's general editor, acknowledged a ''glitch'' in
the editorial process. She said the definitions were shortened versions of
entries in the Microsoft Encarta World English Dictionary, published in 1999,
and that vital information was inadvertently left out.

''It would have been much nicer if cross-checks had been made in individual
categories like vice president,'' she said.

Soukhanov said the entries would be amended, but did not know when that would
happen. She indicated subjective-sounding words such as ''statesman'' and
''politician'' would be dropped.

''Dictionary editors have always been taught to avoid attaching value
judgments to words they define. And yet when it comes to people, it seems we
have slipped, all of us,'' she said.

While Soukhanov defended the dictionary's overall integrity, saying the
mistakes were not ''world-threatening,'' a longtime analyst of the reference
field was more troubled.

''Consistency is an obvious hallmark of a good reference book,'' said Ken
Kister, author of the consumer guide Kister's Best Dictionaries.

''Biographical entries are peripheral for most dictionary users, but anything
that isn't right about a reference book casts doubt on the whole editorial
process,'' Kister said.

Long associated with encyclopedias, biographical entries are a relatively new
feature for dictionaries. After World War II, publishers of dictionaries
wanted to expand their appeal and began including references to politicians,
artists and other historical figures, Kister said.

Quirks in these entries aren't uncommon, and pop culture seems an especially
tricky area. Webster's II New College Dictionary, for instance, defines
Beatles John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr as musicians and
composers, but George Harrison as a ''singer and songwriter.''

The American Heritage College Dictionary, meanwhile, labels Lennon a
''musician and composer who wrote many of the Beatles' songs.'' McCartney,
his prolific songwriting partner, is simply a ''musician and composer who was
a member of the Beatles.'' Harrison, again, is a ''singer and songwriter.''

In the Microsoft version, Lennon is listed as a ''singer, songwriter, and
musician.'' McCartney, the band's most versatile instrumentalist, is just a
''singer and songwriter.'' Harrison, who wrote and sang lead on the classics
''Something'' and ''Here Comes the Sun,'' is a ''musician.'' Starr is labeled
both drummer and musician and is the only one identified as a Beatle.

Microsoft's new reference work - released by the software giant, St. Martin's
Press and London-based Bloomsbury Publishing - is an attempt to to grab a
piece of the lucrative college market.

''We're trying to address some major issues,'' Soukhanov said. ''We have done
extensive research and were startled to find out that students need a great
deal of help with spelling and basic usage.''

The book looks like a traditional dictionary, but contains such unusual
features as warnings on what computer spellcheck programs might do to certain
words and 700 words listed under their common misspellings.

Microsoft already brings an uncertain history to the reference field. Its
World English dictionary was criticized for some peculiar editorial
decisions, such as including a picture of Microsoft head Bill Gates, but not
of John Kennedy. The Gates photo has been dropped for the college edition,
and one of Kennedy added.

Thanks for the stimulating comments.  Evidence of stimulation follows.

Why must it only be form that "breaks the mold," as you say?  what about
content?  the 20th century has seen the rapid proliferation of many new ways
to say something.  problem is, it appears people stopped saying anything.
the only thing it seems most people relate to anymore is commercials.
ironically they're the only things that have a clear message anymore, even
if it is the disappointing and exploitative "buy me."  perhaps something
else needs to be said.  it seems only a wealthy minority communicates
freely, and the rest of us who might try to communicate (including myself)
end up blendering it up in forms, sometimes empty forms.  our cups are empty
but we rush to fill the cups of the few, believing all the while we are
filling our own.  as if we are in a dream that quiets the harsh buzzing of
our disposable motors.

Can we ever get out of the "canon cave"?  Perhaps we all just keep saying
the same things over and over and over and over.  Perhaps there is no such
thing as novelty.  Perhaps this very universe itself is repeating itself,
and we are hearing the distant echo of something already said and we are
that echo.  Perhaps.  (Or perhaps not.)

i think the old chaps begin to feel guilty about all of their nouveau riche
reasons for their wealth and so they try to obfuscate the truth under the
false comfort of the patina of an original finish.  The people pushing the
canon are usually from "old money" hiding the ugly history of their wealth
under the false legitimacy of the provenance of some rococo finial excess.

"that the medium is now somewot stained by corporate gluttony N regular
seductions back to the tangible, the known......."

i would agree that corporate gluttony is causing problems, yes, clearly.
these are dark days indeed.  but does corporate america want to keep selling
the same thing, or do they need you to get the newest and the latest thing?
if you need to see what I mean, take a look at cuba.  the cars they drive
are old old old.  because there's no capital system to push the new into
existence needlessly.  or look at computers.  the new is constantly being
introduced and the old is being outmoded at an astonishing rate, and the end
result is not progress but the mass looting of pockets, pockets like black
holes that smug men turn into stars pouring light into only one direction.
personal pulsars by the millions, for the greedy.  i think capital rushes
away from the known, always pushing "progress." And "progress" remains a
watchword for profit as it has for so many years.

this new medium we are using to communicate with one another is perhaps the
ultimate tool of colonialism, divide and conquer. networking and TCP/IP,
after all, were both brought to you by DARPA.  these are the people who will
make sure we have invisible tanks and planes and soldiers by 2025.  science
fiction to some, but that's a fact.  people who are working to make the
battlefield "network-centric" through new technologies as exotic as active
templates, organic air vehicles, robotic perception systems, unmanned
fighting aircraft, ENCOMPASS syndromic surveillance, and so on.  Our answer
is unlikely to be found in machines but might be in the flesh.  machines
keep offering us new ways to feed ourselves perhaps, but mostly they are
consistently co-opted for employment in Murder, Inc.  Flesh is new and
regenerating itself, but oh so old, so fragile, and so hard to control.  yet
we manage somehow to be predictable.  but we do have our moments when
nothing can predict us, yes.  someone might know how you and i behave.  they
can predict us.  or at least struggle to.  they'll never get it exactly
right.  but the web is exactly that, a web.  in it we are caught.  i hope
that poetry makes us unpredictable, that it shows us how unpredictable we
can be.

i think the web has opened up a greater potential for domination and
authority and control.  currently those in charge are into capital.  but
authority takes many political forms--capitalism, marxism, leninism,
monarchism, and so on.  anyway the web is a tool for surveillance and
monitoring, one that invites "free" behavior (behavior that is actually
quite discretely bounded), one that allows certain folks to figure out how
we are predictable.  predictability helps sales.  it helps control people.
perhaps these are the "banal shores" of which you speak.

but it is of course just a tool.  a hammer can break a man's skull or be
used to build a house to keep him warm.  the web is a dangerous territory,
but the struggle is not new.  it is older, much older, than the eons we can
imagine.

we do seem to be eternally bound within *authoritative* parameters.  i agree
entirely.  capitalism is but one form of the authority.  there are many
forms of the struggle for resources, and perhaps this is something we can
not escape.  Perhaps.  (Or perhaps not.)

thanks mez.

best,
Patrick

I had a look at the petition page - here was the gist
of the text I got:

"Dear President Bush, We, Macedonian people and
friends of the Macedonian people, are very concerned
about the troubled situation in Macedonia. Innocent
Macedonian people are being forced to leave their
homes by the Albanian terrorists...The goal of the
Albanian terrorists is to take over Macedonian
territory and create Greater Albania. Please use your
power to end the Albanian terrorist movement in
Macedonia."

A President who has made a career out of the
legally-sanctioned  murder of black and Hispanic
Texans, who appointed an opponent of Civil Rights and
defender of the Confederacy to the post of Attorney
General, who barely got a quarter of his own
population to vote for him: is this a portait of the
saviour of Macedonia?
I know the problems of the Balkans are complex, but I
would argue that the US, NATO and especially the IMF
in the 80s are more responsible for them than a few
Albanian guerrillas. Asking imperialist powers to
intervene in the Balkans is like hiring an arsonist to
fight fires.
It's depressing to see that elements of the
intelligentsia of Macedonia taking the thoughtless
line reflected in this petition.

Cheers
Scott

Under Barrett's question lies the contradiction between "experimental" art
and "authority, hierarchy." As phenomenon, there is very little difference
between Hannah's "literal transcriptions of automatism" and Breton's
surrealist. But still Barrett brings the question of Breton's "approval" or a
museum's or archive's "validation" of Hannah's work. In other words, the
difference between the two (Hannah's and Breton's methods) is the degree of
their social acceptance, which side of the railroad track they come, so to
speak. Surrealism today is more or less mainstream art whereas Hannah's is
trying to find a place (isn't brut art a euphemism for asylum art work as a
step towards social acceptance?). One can slum into insanity (surrealism),
but one can't live there (then, at best, one is brut, like "brute," in
savage.). The distinction has class, hierarchy written all over it.

Talking about "experimental" or "advanced" poetry, art, etc., one should
beware the irony of the situation, how these terms actually do not quite mean
what they say and often have acceptance of society integrated (pre-programed)
in them.

I hate to yet again reveal my profound ignorance, but although I'm
pretty sure I've read some of our anti-laureate's poetry, I don't
remember any of it.  Could someone fill me in about what it is that
he's written that distinguishes him from the official laureates?

"Intention and address." Craig Watson and I corresponded obsessively about
these issues back in the 1980's. And it's been at least that long since I
read Jaynes' _The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral
Mind_when it first came out.  I can see why that book would have appealed to
Hannah.  My memory of it is fuzzy but I seem to recall Jaynes discussing the
origin of the idea of a muse as an aspect of the evolution of the
brain--that, prior to the development of consciousness as we know it today,
one's "inner voice" was experienced as external.

The history of poetry, of course, is full of examples of poetry as visions or
dictations or messages for which the poet serves as conduit.  Think of Blake,
Yeats, Duncan, Rimbaud, Spicer, Artaud, etc, etc.  Think of Orpheus in the
Cocteau movie getting his verse  through a car radio.

Hannah was a great poet.  Her diagnosis shouldn't get in the way of that.  If
anything it makes her even more extraordinary.  Very few schizophrenics
create wonderful art.  Most just live in chaos and pain.


 NB:Psychotropic drugs are usually a mixed blessing.  There are typically
side effects that are unwelcome.  It's never a simple either/or.

Thanks, Patrick, for your insightful comments.  Let me add the following for=
=20
you and anyone who might be interested.

A former acquaintance of mine, Louise Meriwether (author of Daddy Was A=20
Number Runner), once commented to me that "Black artists have no time for=20
bullshit."  In her sentence, "bullshit" referred to all current formalisms.=20=
=20
In her view, only bourgeois, privileged whites could come up with an=20
aesthetic that so often, and so thoroughly, disrupts direct communication. =20
Blacks, she continued, still have something to say, something that must be=20
said.

In quoting her, I do not wish to promote one method at the expense of=20
another, nor should anyone assume my uncritical agreement with her.  My take=
=20
is that there is a time, a place, a raison d'=EAtre for most methodologies.=20=
=20
But nevertheless Louise gave me something to think about.  There most=20
certainly is a political dimension to what we do as artists, and often that=20
dimension sneaks up on us, circumscribes us in ways we never intended, or=20
anticipated.  We may argue, and rightly so, that there are other ways to "sa=
y=20
something" beyond the standard form.  On the other hand, when one is in=20
revolutionary mode, with serious issues like food, shelter, power, culture a=
t=20
stake, one tends to communicate rather directly (to reach as many as=20
possible), as is the case, historically, of most theoretical writings from=20
the "avant-garde."  The art may be formally disruptive, but the "call to=20
arms," so to speak--the explanations, justifications, etc.--are usually=20
couched in fairly standard structures.  As good ole' Derrida says, we can't=20
escape the metaphysical "web."  We are caught, inevitably, in a weave of=20
hierarchies.  And that weave always involves the creation and distribution o=
f=20
capital, and the trajectory of capital seems always towards the top, in some=
=20
cases those who can afford the new technologies.  Perhaps this is, finally,=20
the natural order of things, and language.  Perhaps only the dominant forces=
=20
find space and time to play.  Perhaps the freedom to play always already=20
indicates a position in the hierarchy.  Which doesn't necessarily mean we=20
shouldn't indulge ourselves, especially since our experiments, and those of=20
our precursors, have informed the culture in crucial ways.

If I'm understanding Mez, her questioning involves the seeming degradation o=
f=20
the value of a strict formalism, however radical.  George Harrison once wrot=
e=20
that "All Things Must Pass," and that seems pretty obviously true.  Although=
=20
I am certainly not certain about anything, it could be that the world's=20
problems are escalating in ways that demand, once again, that we directly=20
address the content of our lives.   If the power of Langpo and its offshoots=
=20
seems diminished (does it?), that may serve to mark its success, its=20
importance, its privilege within cultural history.  Who knows? =20

Charles Bernstein once wrote in the wonderful Contents Dream that Langpo=20
constructed a language that was not about anything "out there," but only "in=
=20
here."  Perhaps the "out there" insists we reengage it.  It is, after all,=20
where we live.  Not to say, of course, that formal experimentation shouldn't=
=20
continue.  Not at all.  But maybe something along the lines of a Kubrickian=20
vision, something in the manner of Clockwork Orange, The Shining, A.I.,=20
something both formally expressive and dense in imagery, symbolism, metaphor=
,=20
etc., etc., calls to us once again.  Something that involves a wide range of=
=20
language's possibilities, functions.  (Of course, such art has never actuall=
y=20
gone away.)  In one powerful scene from A.I. a series of words is used to=20
"imprint" the robot child with love, i.e., humanity.  The "mother" who adopt=
s=20
this mechanism is told that once the imprint is accomplished, it can never b=
e=20
undone.  Hmmm. . .   Best wishes to us all in our efforts.  Bill

hi mez

while i understand & agree with your complaint i can't help but wonder if
such attitudes toward new media are partially due to distrust - is it
technology's ephemerality inhibiting folks reliance?

re patrick's point of new content*... amid commercial/ism and All Sorts of
yapyap (which i'm not ~exactly~ condemning) i know i for one am hasty to
filter/ignore much foraging for fresh substance. i'm not suggesting that all
new media compositions lack content (quite the opposite with a few such as
yourself) but perhaps it's more time-consuming or difficult for some to
locate such when neither the motion nor the lexicon is yet familiar.


        h

* i'm reminded just now of dialogue (subt) in fellini's *8 1/2*:
"It's better to destroy than to create what's unessential. Besides, what's
clear enough, valuable enough, to deserve to survive? ...We're already
suffocated by words, by sounds and images, that have no reason to exist,
that emerge from the void and return to the void.  Any man worthy to be
called an artist should swear an oath - dedication to silence."

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
            Some things you should know about it

Beginning about two weeks after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began in
March, 1999, international-law professionals from Canada, the United Kingdom,
Greece, and the American Association of Jurists began to file complaints with
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague,
Netherlands, charging leaders of NATO countries and officials of NATO itself
with crimes similar to those for which the Tribunal had issued indictments
shortly before against Serbian leaders.  Amongst the charges filed were:
"grave violations of international humanitarian law", including "wilful
killing, wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and
health, employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause
unnecessary suffering, wanton destruction of cities, towns and villages,
unlawful attacks on civilian objects, devastation not necessitated by
military objectives, attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings,
destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion,
charity and education, the arts and sciences."
    The Canadian suit names 68 leaders, including William Clinton, Madeleine
Albright, William Cohen, Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien,
and NATO officials Javier Solana, Wesley Clark, and Jamie Shea.  The
complaint also alleges "open violation" of the United Nations Charter, the
NATO treaty itself, the Geneva Conventions, and the Principles of
International Law Recognized by the International Military Tribunal at
Nuremberg.
    The complaint was submitted along with a considerable amount of evidence
to support the charges.  The evidence makes the key point that it was NATO's
bombing campaign which had given rise to the bulk of the deaths in
Yugoslavia, provoked most of the Serbian atrocities, created an environmental
disaster, and left a dangerous legacy of unexploded depleted uranium and
cluster bombs.
    In June, some of the complainants met in The Hague with the court's chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada.  Although she cordially received their
brief in person, along with three thick volumes of evidence documenting the
alleged war crimes, nothing of substance came of the meeting, despite
repeated follow-up submissions and letters by the plaintiffs.  In November,
her successor, Carla Del Ponte of Switzerland, also met with some of the
complainants and received extensive evidence.
    The complainants' brief in November pointed out that the prosecution of
those named by them was "not only a requirement of law, it is a requirement
of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as
those in NATO who, in their military might and in their control over the
media, are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less
powerful countries."  Charging the war's victors, not only its losers, it was
argued, would be a watershed in international criminal law.
    In one of the letters to Arbour, Michael Mandel, a professor of law in
Toronto and the initiator of the Canadian suit, added:

     Unfortunately, as you know, many doubts have already been raised about
the impartiality of your Tribunal.  In the early days of the conflict, after
a formal and, in our view, justified complaint against NATO leaders had been
laid before it by members of the Faculty of Law of Belgrade University, you
appeared at a press conference with one of the accused, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, who made a great show of handing you a dossier of
Serbian war crimes.  In early May, you appeared at another press conference
with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, by that time herself the
subject of two formal complaints of war crimes over the targeting of
civilians in Yugoslavia.  Albright publicly announced at that time that the
US was the major provider of funds for the Tribunal and that it had pledged
even more money to it.{1}

    Arbour herself made little attempt to hide the pro-NATO bias she wore
beneath her robe.  She trusted NATO to be its own police, judge, jury, and
prison guard.  In a year in which the arrest of General Pinochet was giving
an inspiring lift to the cause of international law and international
justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, under
Arbour's leadership, ruled that for the Great Powers it would be business as
usual, particularly the Great Power that was most vulnerable to prosecution,
and which, coincidentally, paid most of her salary.  Here are her own words:

     I am obviously not commenting on any allegations of violations of
international humanitarian law supposedly perpetrated by nationals of NATO
countries.  I accept the assurances given by NATO leaders that they intend to
conduct their operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in full
compliance with international humanitarian law.  I have reminded many of
them, when the occasion presented itself, of their obligation to conduct fair
and open-minded investigations of any possible deviance from that policy, and
of the obligation of commanders to prevent and punish, if required.{2}

NATO Press Briefing, May 16, 1999:
Question: Does NATO recognize Judge Arbour's jurisdiction over their
activities?
Jamie Shea: I think we have to distinguish between the theoretical and the
practical.  I believe that when Justice Arbour starts her investigation [of
the Serbs], she will because we will allow her to. ... NATO countries are
those that have provided the finance to set up the Tribunal, we are amongst
the majority financiers.

The Tribunal -- created in 1993, with the US as the father, the Security
Council as the mother, and Madeleine Albright as the midwife -- also relies
on the military assets of the NATO powers to track down and arrest the
suspects it tries for war crimes.
    There appeared to be no more happening with the complaint under Del Ponte
than under Arbour, but in late December, in an interview with The Observer of
London, Del Ponte was asked if she was prepared to press charges against NATO
personnel.  She replied: "If I am not willing to do that, I am not in the
right place.  I must give up my mission."
    The Tribunal then announced that it had completed a study of possible
NATO crimes, which Del Ponte was examining, and that the study was an
appropriate response to public concerns about NATO's tactics.  "It is very
important for this tribunal to assert its authority over any and all
authorities to the armed conflict within the former Yugoslavia."
    Was this a sign from heaven that the new millennium was going to be one
of more equal justice?  Could this really be?
    No, it couldn't.  From official quarters, military and civilian, of the
United States and Canada, came disbelief, shock, anger, denials ...
"appalling" ... "unjustified".  Del Ponte got the message.  Four days after
The Observer interview appeared, her office issued a statement: "NATO is not
under investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  There is no formal inquiry into
the actions of NATO during the conflict in Kosovo."{3}  And there wouldn't
be, it was unnecessary to add.
    But the claim against NATO -- heretofore largely ignored by the American
media -- was now out in the open.  It was suddenly receiving a fair amount of
publicity, and supporters of the bombing were put on the defensive.  The most
common argument made in NATO's defense, and against war-crime charges, has
been that the death and devastation inflicted upon the civilian sector was
"accidental".  This claim, however, must be questioned in light of certain
reports.  For example, the commander of NATO's air war, Lt. Gen. Michael
Short, declared at one point:

     If you wake up in the morning and you have no power to your house and no
gas to your stove and the bridge you take to work is down and will be lying
in the Danube for the next 20 years, I think you begin to ask, "Hey, Slobo,
what's this all about?  How much more of this do we have to withstand?"{4}

    General Short, said the New York Times, "hopes that the distress of the
Yugoslav public will undermine support for the authorities in Belgrade."{5}
    At one point, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea added: "If President Milosevic
really wants all of his population to have water and electricity all he has
to do is accept NATO's five conditions and we will stop this campaign."{6}
    After the April NATO bombing of a Belgrade office building -- which
housed political parties, TV and radio stations, 100 private companies, and
more -- the Washington Post reported:

     Over the past few days, U.S. officials have been quoted as expressing
the hope that members of Serbia's economic elite will begin to turn against
Milosevic once they understand how much they are likely to lose by continuing
to resist NATO demands.{7}

    Before missiles were fired into this building, NATO planners spelled out
the risks: "Casualty Estimate 50-100 Government/Party employees.  Unintended
Civ Casualty Est: 250 -- Apts in expected blast radius."{8}  The planners
were saying that about 250 civilians living in nearby apartment buildings
might be killed in the bombing.
    What do we have here?  We have grown men telling each other:  We'll do A,
and we think that B may well be the result.  But even if B does in fact
result, we're saying beforehand -- as we'll insist afterward -- that it was
unintended.

Following World War II there was an urgent need for a permanent international
criminal court to prosecute those accused of war crimes, crimes against
humanity, and genocide, but the Cold War intervened.  Finally, in 1998 in
Rome, the nations of the world drafted the charter of The International
Criminal Court.  American negotiators, however, insisted on provisions in the
charter that would, in essence, give the United States veto power over any
prosecution through its seat on the Security Council.  The American request
was rejected, and primarily for this reason the US refused to join 120 other
nations who supported the charter.  The ICC is an instrument Washington can't
control sufficiently to keep it from prosecuting American military and
government officials.  Senior US officials have explicitly admitted that this
danger is the reason for their aversion to the proposed new court.{9}  But
this is clearly not the case with the International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia.  It's Washington's kind of international court, a court
for the New World Order.

Barrett etal on the List.  You ask some interesting questions here. Maybe it
IS near impossible for a "sane" preson to write poetry. Also to what extent
is poetry realy a productive thing, really helpful: I love writing but
little am I interested in the output or reception per se altho I suppose
one's success or lack of thereof might conflict with and/or or energise
one's work. I know that I wrote (if not "better") with more passion and
energy a) when I was grieving somewhat over the deaths of my father and
father in law b) during the beginning of an estrangement from and coflict
with my wife c)when I was in a rather strange "space" (albeit I wasnt
hallucinating)..not hallucinating but certainly in a near- paranoid state.
The grief or anger or whatever probably in my case were from my own
inability or at that time ignorance of ways to manage things "logically"
...but human relationships (and I mean where parents friends & children are
concernede) go very deep and very much into one's "vitals"... language is
the lightening rod which can either conduct these powerful and sometimes
suicidal emotions either away or into oneself. Hannah Weiner was(is?) an
original but not "mad" .. in fact desapite her "strangeness" one is aware
how very human is this fascination with words and language: for language is
the first thing we hear from our mothers or fathers...I dont know much about
Freud etal but many of those areas are relevant I think and the brain and
the mind and the body itself(s)...well what is it or them? Certainly it
SEEMS that we are constructed through and by the language...and it can get
so that the whole world seems to be. Certainly through words is a big way we
"picture it" so why not "picture" the words. They could seem to be the very
cause and curse and possibly the power by which we find a joy in creation.
Or at least to present the words, play with or  arrange and rearrange the
words. Think also of Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath and what is the
difference between John Berryman and Celan or what things they have in
common and the torment suffered by these people..all the old romantic
cliche's and connections between suffering and composition. How David
Jones's marvelous In Parenthesis seems strangely "disconnected" from the Ist
WW and Eliot etc seemed to ignore it: Pound was (was?) insane...surely
another man tortured by words and the search for perfection as was maybe
Laura Riding....with Stein we get a kind of solution: one goes "into" her
poems or writings as into a process, which somewhat absorption is impossible
with Hannah Weiner: her words shout at you.(Or do they?) They are THERE. You
cant evade them: it seems that you are both created by and destroyed by the
language but here is a fascinating individual and here is her (in this case)
work..here is her powerful legacy...in fact the term "shouts" is maybe wrong
as looking now at some of her writing in "In The American Tree", once one
enters into her writing it talks to someone else and though herself and the
reader etal..... it is a recollection collection collation con flation and
conflammation of her thoughts and interactions:


OMIT
THE EDITING  you thought you mentioned  it over and you take out
buts,ands, ifs, etcs.AND NO PERIODS

  the:   AND NO PERIODS  is in a very large font size  which could be  ( and
maybe is) simultaneously a reference to the full stop and the indicator of
pregnacy (how do I say that?!) and it is thus both a personal and a
"language" work: it become "obsubjection" where the objective subjective
complex intertwines ... AND NO PERIODS simultaneously fascinates disrupts
shocks repels pulls ups disturbs.... her other "shaped" poems are all rather
like (could be) a human figure: they are figured and through them it seems
Weiner is trying to stop herself from "going over the brink" or to even
continue. It is near as if she's struggling with the language itself:
"Hannah is I SPELLLED donst continue WITH WORDS " where the donst continue
and the Hannah I is spelled are sliding down a diagonal "precipice" or they
into a "dive" and pull up like a dive bomber and ... later on she says in
one up one down diagonal: "I just dont want anymore writing" but she
continues and continues...

In response to your input I would say that her life personality and any
"disability" are integral with her writing: there is no escape from
language.  I see the hallucination as part of what she was and indeed it may
have been a tragic dilemma but her writing may have pointed a "way
out"..."Intropsection and Contemporary Poetry" by Alan Willliamson discusses
poetry from this angle or direction of development through the personal and
includes discussion of Ashbery, Berryman, the confessionals and certain more
recent poets (at the time and is an interesting view of these things.
  Certainly she is or was a fascinating writer. Regards, Richard Taylor.

Hannah Weiner may have "seen" words, but how does reason do it? If it
is "logos," a kind of speaking (ie not a kind of seeing), as it was for
Socrates, then it too can operate like a daemon (aie, lots of proof of
that!). Socrates "tuned in" to the daemon's voice and ventriloquized - for
which/whom he would rather sacrifice his life (and did, of course), than
have the state censor him from ever speaking its "truth" again in public.

I have been asked to participate in a poetry seminar in S. Korea at
the end of July and need some help from yr expertise. I was
originally only supposed to give a reading and a lecture on Yi Sang
(for YS, cf. Poems for the Milliennium, vol. 1, or Muae 1 [1995]),
but now I have also been asked to address the theme of the
environment/ecology in American poetry.  I am glad to do so, but wd
appreciate more leads as to which poets/critics to read in this
regard, aside from an obvious one like Gary Snyder (a personal
favorite is actually Jim Morrison on when the music's over).  The
pastoral dimension of U.S. poetry is somewhat related to this, of c,
but often as an attempt at a transcendence of history, whereas
"ecological poetry" wd seem to refer to a politically direct
engagement/confrontation w civilizing, industrial, or Kapital-driven
damage to ecosystems (tho' Marx was no defender of pristine Nature,
and pastoral poetry, whether Chinese or British, obviously required
that the wilderness be tamed.)  I think there wd have been a lot of
Sixties writing on this topic, e.g. Bly, in combination w protest
against the Vietnam War, but I mainly read a different type of 60s
poetry.  Or has a favorite poet of the so-called "tree huggers"
emerged?  Any help will be appreciated and, if you prefer, please
back-channel.  I am open to suggestions for both poetry and incisive
scholarship, anywhere in the range between dithyrambs in defense of
Gaia to suburban serenading of a front lawn. Thanks, Walter   P.S. If
anyone on the Poetics list is in Korea, drop me a line--Let's meet!

Content-Transfer-Encoding:  quoted-printable

Dear Friends,

It's been a long while now that I've been slightly incognito, with =
numerous e-mail problems.
But that has finally been corrected and Douglas Messerli and Green =
Integer are back on
line. My new e-mail address is djmess@greeninteger.com although my older =
e-mails
will still be forwarded.

Green Integer has been very busy this year, with about 20 new titles to =
date. The most recent
(published in the past few weeks) are those listed below. As usual, =
individuals on this list receive
a 20% discount. So when you order, please include $1.25 for postage and =
subtract 20% for
the list price. All checks for Green Integer should be made out to me, =
Douglas Messerli. We
are still awaiting our dba status, so the bank will not recognize Green =
Integer yet.

Here are some of our new titles:

To Do: A Book of Alphabets and Birthdays by Gertrude Stein  paper $9.95 =
list

To Do, published previously only in the Yale edition (500 copies) in =
1957, is now available for
the first time in a separate book edition. Meant originally for =
children, Stein planned this book
as an orderly progression through the alphabet with four names for each =
letter. But things quickly
developed, spiraling out of silmple childlike progression, so that by =
the time she reached the letter
H, Henriette de Dactyl, a French typewriter (who exchanges typed =
messages with Yetta von Blickens-
dorfer, a German typewriter, and Mr. House, an American typewriter), =
wants to live on Melon Street
and eat radishes, salads, and fried fish and soup. By the time Stein had =
completed this charming
book, friends and editors thought it inapporopriate for children because =
of its lack of episode.
Stein refused to alter it, and it remained unpublished until the Yale =
edition.


Operratics by Michel Leiris, translated from the French by Guy Bennett  =
paperback $12.95 list

This book, never before published in English, is a study of opera by the =
great French poet, art
critic, and anthropologist Michel Leiris. Leiris began his writing =
career as a poet associated with
the Surrealist group, but he later made major contributions as a art =
critic and anthropologist, as well
as through his great autogiobraphical confession, L'Age d'Homme =
(Manhood). In Operratics Leiris
turns his brilliant mind to one of his major loves, opera. Approaching =
the subject as a lover of music
without any formal musical training, he discerns fascinating patterns in =
cultural movements in opera
and reveals his personal tastes in this genre.



Aurelia by Gerard de Nerval  Translated from the French by Monique =
DiDonna  paperback $11.95 list

Throughout Nerval's tempestuous life that ended with suicide by hanging, =
this French Romantic poet=20
journeyed to distant parts of the globe in order to comprehend and =
articulate the demons that assailed
his innermost being. The culmination of Nerval's quest was Aurelia, a =
masterful surrealistic prose
dissection of mind and soul, completed only a year before his death in =
1855. The partly autobiographical
work, with Nerval as both narrator and protagonist, is a mind rending =
odyssey of cultural and spiritual
exploration, shared by its tormented author and his spellbound readers. =
Nerval's search for the ideal
woman, his fountainhead of grace and salvation, is personified in the =
distant Aurelia, based on his
real-life obsession with the performer Jenny Colon.


A Wanderer Plays on Muted Strings by Knut Hamsun, Translated from the =
Norwegian by Oliver and Gunnvor Stallybrass  paperback $10.95 list

Related to and sometimes paired with Hamsun's Under the Autumn Star, =
this beautifully lyric novel picks up with the same characters as the =
other book, but is set in time six years later. The central character
of the former fiction, Knut Pedersen (Hamsun's real name), is little =
more than an observer in this work.
His former friend Grindhusen has grown from stubborn independence to a =
shifty and vacillating man;
and his companion Lars Falkenberg has dwindled into a small land-holder =
with a perpetually pregnant
wife from whom is is deeply estranged. These two comedians play out a =
tragi-comedy that is painful
through the very irony and humaneness with which Hamsun paints his =
figures.


Antilyrik and Other Poems by Vitezslav Nezval. Translated from the Czech =
by Jerome Rothenberg and
Milos Sovak   paperback  $10.95 list

Vitezslav Nezval (1900-1958) was an active participant in the European =
avant-garde between the two world  wars. In the 1920s, he was the =
founding figure of "poetism," a movement of poets and artists centered =
in Prague. Like other major innovators, he worked through a prolific =
sweep of modes and genres: open and closed forms of verse, experimental =
plays and novels, numerous translations of his modern counterparts and =
predecessors, and forays as composer, painter, journalist, and social =
commentator. In the foreground of avant-garde activity in Prague, Nezval =
forged an alliance with Andre Breton and his Paris circle in the 1930s, =
founding the first Surrealist group and magazine outside of France. =
Antilyrik and Other Poems brings together, for the first time in =
English, a sampling of some of Nezval's major poems from the 1920s and =
1930s, revealing the extraordinary depth and breadth of his poetic =
project.


Pedra Canga by Tereza Albues. Translated from the Portuguese by Clifford =
E. Landers   paperback $12.95 list

Pedra Canga, a small and isolated community in the Brazilian Pantanal, =
or wetlands, endures amid pverty, myth, and supersition. Dreaming and =
suffering, the simple townspeople exist in the mystical reality of
their private universe. With insight and humor the novel tells of the =
ultimate vindication of these humble
folk against a powerful and demonic family that has long oppressed them. =
Filled with magical events,
diabolic storms, and visions both frightening and angelical, this is a =
wonderfully imaginative work, remind-
ing one of the best of South American magic realism.
   Tereza Albues was born in a small village in Mato Grosso, Brazil. She =
has lived in the United States for
16 years.


Suicide Circus: Selected Poems by Alexei Kruchenykh. Translated from the =
Russian by Jack Hirschmann,
Alexander Kohav and Venyamin Tseytlin, with an Introduction by Jack =
Hirshman, and a Preface and Notes by Guy Bennett  paperback   $12.95 =
list

With Velimir Khlebnikov and Vladimir Mayakovsky, Alexei Kruchenykh was =
one of the central figures of
Russian Futurism, and the leading practitioner of zaum poetry. Zaum, =
meaning literally "beyond sense,"
was an attempt to undermine and/or ignore the conventional meaning of =
words, "allowing their sound,"
as Marjorie Perloff has written, "to generate their own range of =
signification, or, in its most extreme form,
the invention of new words based purely on sound." In a series of =
inventive works, among them Pomade,=20
Learn Art and Four Phonetic Novels, Kruchenykh sought to transform the =
landscape of Russian
modernist poetry. In the first substantive collection of Kruchenykh's =
poetry in English, along with reproduc-
tions of pages from the original texts, Hirschman, with the help of Guy =
Bennett, has provided a important
sourcebook for modern poetry.

...especially considering the word "experimental."  Isn't experiment the
very foundation of science and technology development? (Hint: yes.)  I'd
hazard a guess and say science is fairly "mainstream."  Every time I hear
the word "experimental" in a literary context I see in my minds eye some
poet at a lab table testing various literary tropes, with some solvents,
chemicals, PCR reagents, mice in tiny little boxes.

By way of documentation for Susan's nomination, I suggest folks check out
Linh Dinh's new Leroy chapbook, A Small Triumph Over Lassitude. Well worth
the $2 bump in price for the acute poetic intelligence within, and the
full-color Laylah Ali cover art.

You could say that Hannah's project is to explode the simplex form, and
that the form of her self-presentation as autobiography was not only duplex
but multiplex, fragmented. But then there's a recuperation of the "one true
record of the self" which is the level of neurological tracking. I think we
agree that it the pressure on anything like a "simplex autobiography" has a
lot to do with the turn toward the automatism ("it's not me who wrote this;
my voices/words/silent teachers did") of her recording "beyond intention."
The distribution of intention, however, becomes intentional, particularly
in its intention to avoid, precisely, the "simplex" form of autobiography.

barrett, was hannah "happier" when she was on medication or was the relief
from symptoms a welcome one, other than the disappointment of not seeing
words?  if not, what would have been or was her motivation for taking meds?
from your comments i gather that she went back and forth, on and off meds,
or tried them and then decided permanently against?  i know robt lowell
used to go off lithium occasionally --not because doing so enhanced his
writing but because he couldn't mix it w/ alcohol --and he wanted to be
able to drink.  a different situation, i realize.

i think of hannah's writing as both insdier and outsider writing, ecriture
brute and also v. literary.  a great test case for all kinds of limits and
categories.  but a lot of "naive" writers or "ecrivains bruts" are v
self-conscious of themselves as poets --like the girls i taught in south
boston --tho this comes as a surprise and sometimes an affront to the MFA
crowd.

Subject:      HANNAH'S HALLUCINATIONS
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Barrett Watten has made a very important observation
regarding Hannah Weiner and all those who experience
similar phenomena and diagnosis. Unfortunately, not
everyone who experiences this hallucinatory condition
is a gifted poet or psychic or feels "emotionally
upbeat" when they are so afflicted. The label
"schizophrenia" is abused and misused and
misunderstood and I'd rather not use it; but the
condition of experiencing involuntary hallucinations,
visions, auditory phenomena (voices), a condition
which can be modified or sometimes illiminated by
anti-psychotics drugs,is rightly or wrongly, generally
described as schizophrenia. For those who experience
it, it is a frequently terrifying experience, the
fracturing of consciousness, which renders the subject
unable to
function on the most basic levels of self-care.
The Szacz school thinks schizophrenia is the product
of capitalism, and much as I would like to accept that
explanation there is just too much evidence to refute
it at every turn. Schizophrenic types have been
identified in every culture and the symptoms have been
categorized for centuries longer than capitalism. Joan
of Arc? Approximately one percent of the population
are people with schizophrenia - pretty high!  And it
is found at every level of society. There are definite
hereditary indicators, leading most scientists to
believe now that there may be a gene for
schizophrenia.
The trouble with the anti-psychiatry movement's "cure"
is that it posits a utopian situation where there will
exist a society able to recognize and support those in
need, something that our society is totally unwilling
to do.  Families pay an enormous cost for this
condition, being the only people usually who try to
care for their wounded. Despite claims for new
medications, nothing "cures" the condition, and many
people remain untreatable by any of the new drugs.
We "artists" are always looking for creative benefits
to mental illness. This foolishness ignores the
suffering of those who are effected.
I did not know Hannah Weiner, but I bet there were
friends and family who cared for her, and I bet her
visions were not always benign.

Hi, all.

I'm writing the entries on CD Wright and Michael
Burkard for Burt Kimmelman's companion guide, and I'm
having problems finding scholarly writing on either of
these two authors.  I saw a review of one of Michael's
books by Graham Foust in Lagniappe, but can't seem to
find much else -- surely there's an article somewhere
I'm missing?  I've searched both online and through
WorldCat for journal articles or book sections, and
nothing's coming up.

Backchannel would be great.

Thanks very much,
Arielle

Reminiscent perhaps, Camille/Barrett, of 'the distinction drawn by James Olney
between "autobiography simplex" and "autobiography duplex,"' cited by Robert
Gleckner (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997, p. 16) . . . somewhat
ontological/metaphysical in its phrasing:

'"One might say," he writes, "that autobiography is simple when . . . one can
detach the style from the substance and can handle and dissect it to see what it
reveals about its maker."  Rather than seeing that style "as turn[ing] back on
itself with self-criticism, there is the felt assumption  . . .  that this is
the way the thing is said, that there is no other way." . . . In contrast, the
act of duplex autobiography, "both as creation and as recreation constitute[s] a
bringing to consciousness of the nature of one's own existence, transforming the

Oh, perfect!  I hate HEAVY SNACKS at poetry readings.  Summer is the
time for lite poetry reading snacks.  ("Light snacks" probably means
crudite's, that's my guess: leafy celery stalks, artichoke hearts,
heart of palm {variations on neo-classical "That is Cabistan's heart
in a dish!" motif [vid. Cantos]}, winking Neapolitan olives, perhaps
rosey prosciutto . . .)

I hope they have ginger ale or Sprite, Susan.  Mormon tea-totallers
hate poetry readings where only either alcohol or caffeine (wine or
Coke) is provided, intemperate ideologies.  Tell Claudia I may be
bringing my own cornucopia Snack Basket (like Carol Channing, who
carried her own greens and sliced raw vegetables into Sardi's, Four
Seasons, . . .).  If I'm overpowered by stone-cold sober "munchies"
and am compelled to sneak a bite of Finnish rye crisp I might bring
along, I'll try not to make crunching noises while Claudia is reading
some truly serious and humorless passage, I promise.

chlorophyl-plentiful wasabe mustard, one sushus [singular
for "sushi"], . . .)

I'm not sure I've heard anyone else put it quite so well.  The poet as the

My short course in short poetry is actually being offered again! (I thought
it wasn't due to small enrollment), and starts tomorrow night (July 10,
running through August 14) in 2226 Campbell Hall, UCLA, at 7 p.m.  It is
half prosody half workshop, will be about Southeastern Asian forms, but will
especially focus on sound, speech, syllabics, and "writtenness" (last years'
course had an identical description and was about form and content).

The course is on http://www.uclaextension.org, but it is not the easiest
thing to find.  Enrollment is still open.  It is NOT online, you have to be
in Southern California.  If you took it last summer:  I have a completely
different syllabus, if you need to submit it for work reimbursement.

Hey! Cheese and red wine, it doesn't get heavier than that, and that, my
friend, is the snack combo poetry readings call out for! I mean, if the
heads of the town are up in the aether, what better to bring them back
than some cut-above-rotgut and a slab of cheddar or a gooey squiggle of
brie? Such, anyway, was our practice at Poetry City, which I see has
turned into "Fiction City." Oh, we offered baby carrots, but only because
Gary Sullivan wouldn't show unless we had them.

Remember, until you get about forty dollars' worth of cheese, it's not
a poetry reading -- it's a poetry recital.

Murat. I also was thinking of responding to the "approval" ...the term is
problematic. To ask for approval assumes a kind of hierarchical situation in
art and literature where Barrett Watten and Breton and so on are
"names"....but to be fair to Watten I left it as "approval" may have been
meant as "interested in" but you make some good points here. I dont see that
contradiction...and maybe by the way B Watten was aware of his terminology
and so on. But I think its important. The WAY we say things has vast
significance. Take Dr Wayne Dyer who points out how enculturation subtly
sends out negative messages in his great book "Your Erroneous Zones". In Ch
1 ("Taking Charge of Oneself") he points out a "..brief list of utterances
that you have used over and over. Examine the message they send:    "You
hurt my feelings",  "You make me feel bad".....
He says:   "...each saying [like the word "approve"] has a built in message
that you are not responsible  for how you feel. Now rewrite that list so it
is accurate. so it reflects the fact that you are in charge of the how you
feel and that your feelings come from the thoughts you have about anything:
""I hurt my feelings because of the things I told myself about your reaction
to me," ; "I made myself feel bad."    [etal]  Then he writes:  "Perhaps you
think that the  items [inthe first list] are just figures of speech...{BUT]
if this is your rationale, ask yourself why the staements in list 2 didnt
evolve into cliches. The answer lies in our culture which  [discourages the
kind of thinking that leads to self-approval and self-motivation etc ] And
in Chapter Three he points out the way in which advertising across the
medias and various "sayings" we are brought up with, or popular songs, books
of various kinds, push us away from self-approval and "brainwashes" or very
subtly or by power of repetition enculturates and can even disempower
us.(And ultimately certain people of a certain social clas altho he doesnt
go into that). This is no "plot" but Watten himself is (albeit unonsciously
or Freudian slippingly) using one of those "cliches" the "A" word...of
course someone might counter: but who was Breton? But Breton certainly set
himself up as a big shot in the surrealist movement and probably its part of
how things are, but its interesting how very few writers or artists belong
to a club of one: of course they cant. There is and will continue to be this
struggle with and within the language (as seen in a way in and through
Weiner's work itself) and Watten's questions "sound" a little schoolmasterly
and even intrusive. One feels like saying: "Who the hell's Watten?"  and of
course "Who the hell's Taylor (me))?" But the questions were still
interesting and its good that B W has entered into a discussion of Hannah
Weiner...its good to hear any discussion going on. I took another "angle" in
my reply so to speak. I have noticed that people who get a "name" (maybe its
impossible not to avoid this) frequently adopt a kind of superior stance:
not always a bad thing. Complex issues....but to get back to Hannah Weiner I
would like to read about her (I suppose I must have a look at the EPC list
if there's something on there...bound to be).
  Murat - have a look (if you havent) at my response to Watten....this is
the positive side: it got me looking up her work. The approval thing the
heirarchical things are problematic...they exist in all human organisations
everywhere...my friend Jim the Ant however feels that the world is slowly
getting better. I hope he's right. Despite Bush and the horrible pervading
"Bushism" .....who looks to me from photographs etc to be to quote a guy on
the ICC (Internet Chess Club) "the biggest  wanker that God ever shovelled
guts into" ! But maybe he's a great guy. Wonder what he would have thought
of Hannah Wiener's writings?!!  Regards, Richard Taylor.

"I" "question" the "scare quotes" around the word "envy."  The question is:
isn't the envy real enough to escape quotes?  Literary envy in the States seems
real enough to me: it may even be more of a force than the literary envy I
remember in Manitoba, where teeth were constantly gritted when Toronto and
Vancouver were mentioned...

Anyway -- what's your question?  "Does the envy of some make us unworthy of
whinsy?"  The answer to that one, I think, is "no."

I'm grateful to all who commented, both backchannel and on the list,
regarding my questions about Hannah Weiner's visions.  Ignoring the
pathology of her condition would be to deny its downside and also to
minimize the uniqueness of her unusual ability.  And it is evident from
friends' accounts that she did suffer, especially toward the end of her
life, and that her hallucination of words does constitute an unusual
manifestation of schizophrenia.

But I'm wondering whether her own condition might also lie along a
continuum of phenomena of various kinds that we all experience to varying
degrees?  From this perspective, hearing voices and seeing words isn't so
foreign to many.  One poet wrote me that he also sees words, and that this
may not be such an unusual ability, especially among poets and artists.  I
wonder if there's anyone who hasn't occasionally experienced,
involuntarily, voices that seem to come from outside oneself, an otherness
within us giving instructions, chiding, etc. ? And poets sometimes claim to
receive words and arrangements of words as if in a trance, a la Spicer's
Martians & ghosts, or as in automatic writing.  I have sometimes attempted
to write on an "empty" conscious mind, trying to clear thoughts and allow
the words to come as if from outside me ? it's as if the words were rising
to the surface from a place over which I have little conscious or
intentional control.  More commonly, I have the feeling of "losing myself"
while wr
iting, in which I seem to be allowing inner voices, mental movements and
desires (and the voices & feelings that I have absorbed from others) to
shape the work.  Sometimes, in a hypnogogic state, I seem to be dipping
into an ongoing chatter within my subconscious mind, as if this chatter
might be happening almost all the time, but I'm only allowed access to it
during certain twilight states.  When I close my eyes at night, I often see
a parade of images of faces that seem so particular as to be real
individuals, but they are people I don't recognize.  Where do they come
from?  A friend points out that it's possible to think of decision or
intention as an illusion in which one imagines a single or unitary self, or
autonomous ego (the notorious homunculus) to be willing an event (such as a
poem), whereas the brain is capable of producing many kinds of illusions of
such control and rationalization, such as in the interpretation of
phenomena that don't make sense, weaving them into a more comprehensible or
comfor
ting narrative.  There's a theory that there's actually a part of our
brains that's largely responsible for weaving contradictory or confusing
perceptions into a compelling sense, even a sense that bears no relation to
reality -- Gazzaniga calls it "the interpreter."

In addition to the "dictation" mentioned, there's the more quotidian inner
stream, the seemingly incessant chatter or parade of images and symbols
that we all experience, a kind of roiling conversation among memories,
perceptions, and other mental / bodily events.  The "conversational" feel,
or the feeling of "otherness" of such voices might be due to the fact that
the brain is interconnected in such complex ways that ongoing neural events
of different types may appear like different voices to us -- perceiving,
explicating, commanding, commenting, evaluating, emoting, symbolizing,
visualizing ? not to mention the voices contending with each other to place
different values on things perceived and tugging at you to behave in
different ways, the proverbial angel and devil on your shoulders.

So Hannah, although she certainly had an unusual manifestation of
"dictation," visual rather than aural (at first), which is also to say an
unusual manifestation of schizophrenia, may not be so alone (or so very
unusual) if we think of a neurological continuum among us all of such inner
aural and visual events.  But from another perspective, she was also quite
unique.  And, as Barrett suggests, maybe both perspectives can exist at
once and give us a more complex reading of her work.

I'd like to pose the question of considering the neural genesis of culture,
at least in part (not to be completely biologically reductive).  To
consider poetry, to offer only one example, as an expression of how one
conceives of the self, which conception is a neurological phenomenon.

Interesting, Maria, Hannah's claim that LSD facilitated her hallucinations.
I remember reading in Cytowic's _The Man Who Tasted Shapes_ that amyl
nitrate made the sensations of the eponymous synesthete more intense, as
did alcohol.   Caffeine diminished his experience.

"With all the ironies and contradictions appertaining thereunto" (High
Commissioner Robert Archambeau of the United States Anti-Laureate
Commission), I am delighted to accept my appointment as US Anti-Laureate for
the year 2001.

While I agree with several of Barrett Watten's points regarding the "Iowa
exclusion" and the "system of representation on which the [US] Poet
Laureate[ship] is based," I prefer to read the title as simply representing a
"Big No" (as in George Grosz's remarkable autobiography, "Ein kleines Ja und
ein grosses Nein" -- "A Small Yes and a Big No") to the "laurels" bestowed by
some librarian and his cronies in the (increasingly) provincial capital of
the world..

A "No," as well, to the tiresome hype (put out by publishers, arrangers of
literary events, etc.) of all the "award-winning" So-and-sos -- a hype to
which perhaps only "arts administration" bureaucrats still pay any attention.


As for the Iowa Exclusion, and the Exclusion of the Great Dead, I may, upon
further Pataphysical Reflection and Discussion with The High Commissioner and
other interested parties, decide to suggest waiving these in years to come.
The Anti- and Alternative Laureates are legion, and include many more than
those nominated this time around.  I agree with Watten that Robert Grenier's
indomitable US American lyricism deserves recognition, as does the dynamic,
visionary, linguistically and philosophically innovative work of Alice Notley
(my nominee).

Since the Anti-Laureateship is not funded by taxpayers, I cannot invite
Notley, or Grenier, or Watten, or any of you, to come and read at the Library
of Congress.  I have, however, acted as an advisor to the illustrious Left
Hand Reading Series in Boulder, Colorado, for the past couple of years, and
intend to continue to do so.  The organizers of the series, poets Laura E.
Wright and Mark DuCharme, pass a Venerable Hat for Honorarium, which thus
varies according to the number of solvent persons in the audience.  In its
modest way, this series has been, is, and will be working toward "undoing the
system of representation on which the [US] Poet Laureate[ship] is based"
(Watten).  For my personal record of efforts in that direction, see my book
"Caws and Causeries: Around Poetry and Poets" (La Alameda/University of New
Mexico Press, ISBN 1-888809-15-9).

And in case Bob Grumman, and anyone else, truly wants to refresh his or her
memory of any of my work, s/he now has an opportunity to do so by asking the
local public librarian to obtain a copy of "Notes on the Possibilities and
Attractions of Existence: Selected Poems 1965-2000 by Anselm Hollo," just out
from Coffee House Press (ISBN 1-56689-115-9).

Allow me to end this message with the poem "Piano Solo" by Chile's Anti-Poet
Nicanor Parra:

Since Man's life is nothing but an action at a distance,
A bit of foam shining in a glass;
Since trees are nothing but agitated furniture,
Mere chairs and tables in perpetual motion;
Since we ourselves are merely beings
(Just as god himself is no more than god);
Since we don't talk to be listened to
But merely to get others to talk,
And since an echo precedes the voices that produce it;
And since we haven't even the consolation of chaos
In a garden that yawns and fills with air,
A puzzle we have to solve before dying
So that we can be tranquilly resuscitated
After we've over-indulged in women;
And since there's also a heaven in hell,
Allow me to do a thing or two:

I want to make a shuffling noise with my feet,
I want my soul to find its body.

Mime-Version: 1.0

I completely agree with Laurie Macrae's response. Part of what motivated my
comment--and disinclination to think of Hannah's visual/auditory phenomena
as let's say adequately accounted for by literary interest in her work,
which is great--is to refuse the antipsychiatry movement's insensitivity to
the real nature of illness. I see this particularly in Deleuze/Guattari's
valorization of the "schizo," which has to remain a permanent defect in
their "system," no matter its current rhizomic reinforcements. As a
romantic gesture, the concept of the "schizo" denies the lived experience
of the person suffering with (a wide range of often horrifying) symptoms.

When I have encountered that concept in the teaching situation--in
Anti-Oedipus, do they really mean persons with real mental illness or
what?--it's with the same embarrassment that I have when I deal with, say,
Faulkner's racist language or Pound's various manias. Which is surprising,
as the "schizo" is supposed to be a liberatory concept. And if there is
reason to doubt that basis, some of the other concepts in D&G start to come
undone. The "body without organs" as the disembodied state experienced by
some "schizophrenics," for instance, where one cannot discern the borders
of one's physical being. "Desiring machines" not for disco or techno but
for a libido that becomes pure repetition, like the involuntary body
movements you see in some people who have been medicated for too many
years. "Order words" like paranoid commands coming from nowhere--much like
Hannah's phenomena, actually. In what ways are these dubious
metapsychological concepts an adequate basis for a theory of our collective
postmodernity?

Returning to Hannah--in my own experience of her, I was at once a friend,
an editor, and a kind of distanced (or distributed) caretaker. The last
strategy is interesting, as a creative approach to the reality of her
illness. She distributed her caretaking, by distance media, among many
friends and "voices." Hannah would call when she got a "message" that I had
something to say to her. This could be at odd hours, but generally was in
pretty established time frames. Like, say, Saturday morning at 11 AM. She
would play with the degree of control she would exercise over when to call
one of her interlocutors, "voices," "silent teachers." The conversations
were often delightful and amusing. At times they were, as Laurie suggests,
not benign but driven. Angry demands: "talk to me now." "Get somebody to do
something for me." "Why have you grown silent (as a voice in her head)."
Medication I am sure influenced the quality of these interactions, but
beyond that I don't know anything specific about what medications she took,
or how she responded to them.

I think a sensitive biographical account of this would be very welcome and
might be undertaken by various of Hannah's friends. I'd certainly be
interested in contributing to it. But I would not want such an account to
be purely literary. The human truths here, confirming and disturbing, are
too important for that. Hannah's work demands--and was always a
demand--that we deal with her medical condition as much as her literary
contribution.

Here, the nature of the "literary" as that which confirms or allows our
interest in what otherwise would be intractable seems important. As with
surrealism or art brut, there is a kind of mediation that is necessary in
order to experience that which is irremediable. It's not just that the in
fact rationalist framework of surrealism is a cooptation, let's say, of the
actual risk of madness. Or that recognition in the form of archives,
museums, collectors functions in a similar, sanitizing way. There has to be
a motivated relation between what kind of mediating frame allows an
approach to the irremediable. Henry Darger's work for instance is, in fact,
"beautiful" and thus can be taken up by the gallery/museum world. Here,
it's Hannah's relation to a community of writers, from the 1960s on,
investigating the limits of signification that was constitutive, in fact,
of the phenomenon of her work from the 70s on. How, exactly, is a question
for "research."

My first contact with Hannah came in the mid 1970s, when I published work
of hers in This 7. And I worked on the production of Clairvoyant Journals,
typesetting it on what was then very primitive equipment. Some of that work
appears in the Hoover anthology. It was a real challenge to render that
work in type without being able to see the page itself--I had to keep all
the codes in my head. So I was intrigued by Hannah, obviously. I remember
getting ready to send off some proofs to her, about 1978, writing her name
on the envelope, when the phone rings and it was her. First time I had
talked to her, I believe. Now you could say the timing was evident--the
proofs were supposed to be sent out roughly in a certain time frame--but it
was pretty confirming as clairvoyance, as well. Which I said to Hannah. She
was very proud of herself when things like this happened.

and Contemporary Russian Poetry in TRANSLATION

Wednesday, July 18, 6pm, THAT'S SIX O'CLOCK in the EVENING
in the west village, 29 Cornelia Street, b'ween Bleeker &
West 4th  (as usual, 6$ cover, includes free drink)

WITH:

-- ANDREI GRITSMAN

-- & MATVEI YANKELEVICH     <----(me)

(reading will be held primarily in the vernacular of New
York; Russian & English speakers equally welcome and will
enjoy)

...
also, since you are good people, I wanted to share the info
with you, a play I think is amazing you should see before
it closes...

SCHOOL FOR SALOMES is in its FINAL WEEK at the beautiful
chashama theater. It may well be back in the Fringe
Festival in the fall, but that will be a different show
altogether.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you see it without further delay,
as it is is theater for people who have grown tired of
theater, it is theater for people who hate all that theater
crap; it is funny, crazy, the actors are truly there
because it's raw and loose and gritty and free. And because
it is new, yes, new. See it and you will see what I mean
when we meet and talk about it over raw eggs and coffee.

no bull,
      Matvei

ps - It'll be packed, get there early, wed through sat,
starts at 8.

picture-taking-device.

Matvei will be doing his window piece without acting or
pretending during most of the SALOME run. Most evenings
between 6:30 and 8 for the next two weeks.  Email
yan@pobox.com if you want to confirm a time to see him, or
even participate as an instantaneous secret theater
practitioner simply by getting behind the glass.

assay


should I put everything in quotes?
 " " in other words - since everything has been said?
 does it matter what order things are said in?

  "No."

  then any order is equivalent?
  "Well, order is equivalent in relation to length, but then not to degree
  of energy employed, ink per character per position, and so forth."

   you're saying it's a distinct difference based on the reside of what
   might otherwise be considered equivalence, insofar as any string might
   be considered equivalent to any other of equivalent length.

    "You're dealing with the phenomenology of meaning; think that there is
    no "Equivalence"

    in the sense that everything such as ""Equivalence"" is in quotation?

    "Exactly, that there is no "Equivalence" except _in regard to_ a
    particular domain, in this case k = string length."

    "So that meaning, for example - there is no "Meaning" except _in
    regard_ to a particular domain, for example, the _meaning of "onna" in
    Japanese._"

     and, as with equivalence, then one might consider "Meaning" as always
     already founded in plagiarism, thus returning us once again to the
     question of plagiarism and origin - to which Karl Kraus said in the
     beginning there was no plagiarism, which I reread as "in the
     beginning," i.e. "even in the beginning" or "right from the start"
     there was or is plagiarism.

       "Now what constitutes this plagiarism?"

       it's characterized as the situation, phenomenology, and culture of
       the copy, which is that of duplication or repetition, which is in
       turn or identically in relation to typification and standardization
       - the presence of structure dependent in symmetries or quasi-
       symmetries.

        "You mean that for meaning in the attributive sense, in relation
        to a particular domain, to exist, it requires a structure or
        substructure which operates as a moment or chora for the
        presencing of meaning?"

        exactly, and there is a secondary level of plagiarism as well,
        which is that of history and memory, that every word, phoneme, and
        rearrangement has always already been founded, situated, before,
        in other guises, in other contractual arrangements.

           "And by "contractual arrangements," you mean the descendents of
           the metapsychology of Freud, in other words the negotiations
           that exist among what might be considered cognitive entities,
           such entities being of the order of membranes, meshings, flux,
           and so forth?"

           so that there are structures all the way around and throughout,
           meaning-dependent structures, and structure-dependent meanings
           as well.

              "There is a community of the beneficiaries of meaning."

              "A community that is also a communality, in empathetic
              relationship or communion, among those holding themselves or
              meanings, holding _place_ in common."

                and origins have no place among origins

                this is a deconstructive turn, a deferrance and differend
                as well, allusion and suturing among systems appearing
                closed among subaltern communication

                 "Which returns as rumor or gossip, the off-hand phrase,
                 the speaking out-of-turn, the outspoken."

                  spoken out of etiquette and assumptions of meaning and
                  quotation, partly as extension, partly as mirroring and
                  relation to and of dis/comfort, turning back and within
                  or into the normative discourse

                  "As far as everyone is concerned, this requires
                  suturing, severing, "for the good of everyone," this
                  notion erected well before democracy, the monarchial
                  assumptions of hardened identities, aristocracies."

                    for whom everything is always already a quotation, the
                    signifier of connoisseurship, "one can be hardly
                    original with so much at stake."

                     when the origin is in circulation among copies,
                     itself a copy, the grounds are laid for exchange, and
                     what would later be called primordial inscription is,
                     from the very beginning, underway.

                      "What is underway is a sort of knowledge,
                      independent of consciousness, which might in any
                      case be considered a byproduct; in fact we are
                      becoming intelligent enough to realize that
                      consciousness is no such thing, but mythology, a
                      chimera or emanation from manageriality of
                      inscriptive domains."

                        if knowledge is management, the way is open for
                        the mercantile class to extend itself into other
                        and more normative domains, as traders settle
                        down, as others already adapt themselves to the
                        memory of the imperial, the memory of power, and
                        the cultural styles these entail.

                         "It will duplicate itself to the end of time."

                         "It will behave for "all intents and purposes" as
                         if an "it" existed in one or another form or
                         formation or accumulation."

                          in the sense of "it rains" in which the "it"
                          anchors the condition to the general, the memory
                          of rain intensified through a node accessing all
                          past, present, and future syntax and semantics.

                           "Extend the "it" beyond the indo-european to a
                           general duplication, but what is new, original,
                           is each and every act of circumscription,
                           quotation, accumulation - an entire surplus
                           economics of speech boiling over, of
                           inscription filling, fulfilling, spilling out
                           until the exhaustion of defuge decathects these
                           processes."

                             a situation of somnolence, much as cell death
                             can be related to the mythos of the dead
                             drive; duplication, however, transforms into
                             substance, not for survival, demarcation or
                             embarkation, but in relation to an exhaustive
                             return.

                               "The history of the universe is thus
                               carried through its non-history; the
                               history of originary confusion is produced
                               through the tendency towards proton decay
                               and defusion, dissolution, of the remnants
                               of structures, entities, inscriptions."

                                 the quotation always loses its
                                 demarcation in the final analysis, were
                                 there one; speech is silenced in speech,
                                 and the speaking of silence is silenced
                                 as well.

                                    "No need to mark word or language,
                                    then, as everything is produced,
                                    almost as if, but not quite, teleology
                                    were at work, towards an unknown, but
                                    not quite, end. And no need to specify
                                    as well; nothing but release or
                                    releasement."

                                     except within the place, domain,
                                     locale, site of accumulation, surplus
                                     region, for this returns to such a
                                     commonality of language, such
                                     communality, that one might indeed
                                     speak or inscribe, every such moment
                                     as if there were a local origin.

                                      "Such as that O of cartesian
                                      geometry which may in fact be placed
                                      anywhere, but one place, conveys
                                      place, out of which - that, and
                                      direction, and the institution of
                                      the unit, everything calculable
                                      might conceivably grow."

                                        letter; from the jumble of letters
                                        to the word; from the jumble of
                                        works to the phrase; from the

                                        in deed.

                                        to occur, that duplication,
                                        quotation, copying, typification,

                                        somewhat orderly, the origin of
                                        etiquette, otherwise everything

                                        speech is gainsaid.

                                          "In order to arrive here, in
                                          order to forget the point: this
                                          sudden explosion of structure in

Two new titles from Burning Deck Press:

Susan Gevirtz
Hourglass Transcripts
$10
$20 signed

Hourglass Transcripts asks, What is the legible? How can the uncountable
find the page outside of measurable time? To approach the preverbal, the
unspeakable, it may be necessary to make an incision through the center of a
line, to hyphenate, replace thought. Or, in "Hollowed out Book," the names
of shipping lines float across the water like gigantic book titles, telling
much about the distant and the up close. And so about the act of seeing.
Form is motion through place--toward the not yet imagined: its fabulous
possibility and the full extent of its previous demolition.

Susan Gevirtz's books include Spelt (with Myung Mi Kim, a+bend press), Black
Box Cutaway (Kelsey St. Press), Taken Place (Reality Street), Linen Minus
(Avenue B), and a critical book, Narrative's Journey: The Fiction and Film
Writing of Dorothy Richardson (Peter Lang). In Spring, 2000, she received
the New Langton Arts "Bay Area Award in Literature."


Jennifer Martenson
Xq28
$5
$15 signed

Xq28 is a satric response to the so-called "gay gene" that made headlines in
1993. Noting that no genetic marker for "lesbianism" has been found, the
poem quickly becomes ensnared in footnotes. Mock-inquiries into the biology
of lesbianism in the vocabulary of genetics and linguistics result in a
hybrid world where the category of "woman" is a "dense, fibrous tissue."
More concerned with codes of conduct than with genetic codes, Xq28 does not
take sides on the nature/nurture question as much as it plays around in the
ideological context of the debate.

Jennifer Martenson's poems have appeared in Re: Chapbook 4, HOW2 and
Insurance. She lives in Chicago. Xq28 is her first book.

Both titles are available from SPD www.spdbooks.org

Subject:      Re: Hannah's visions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

hello all,

barrett's initial response to the question of hannah weiner's visions
seems in part, if i'm reading him right, to be looking for a way of
reading her that avoids falling into common literary tropes such as the
schizoid subject (as i think jeffrey jullich suggested) or writing the
body. breton's automatism is certainly a useful point of reference, tho I
think of artaud as well. artaud's letters to jacques riviere and early
writings like _le pese-nerfs_ and _l'ombillic des limbes_ seem to
articulate an acute awareness of a body and mind under siege and worked
out in and through writing, perhaps as acute as weiner manifests in _the
fast_. (the zaum-like language that appears in _ci-git_ and the late
journals of artaud then might be seen as analogues to weiner's
clairvoyant works. not really a great analogy, just a thought.)

but perhaps a way of reading weiner's work -- and this is precisely what
barrett suggests when he says that one way to go would be to "acknowledge
that the words that came were 'symptoms' of an underlying illness and then
decide on the relation of that condition to their literary value" -- this
would be to read hannah less in terms of etiology, what causes her
visions -- tho this is indeed fascinating, and i've always wondered if
there were signs of her clairvoyance in the 1960s prior to her use of
hallucinogenics and her writing of _the fast_ -- and more in terms of
symptomatology.

deleuze has suggested (in his monograph on sade and masoch and elsewhere),
that a symptomatological reading would see the text not as the
manifestation or product of illness or visions but more as a study in the
various symptoms produced by a mode of existence. so sade for example is
not a patient whose texts show symptoms from which the reader can then
deduce an illness as cause; his texts are not products of an author who
suffers from an illness or condition subsequently named after him.

rather, sade is a clinician who carefully catalogs and distinguishes
symptoms that together amount to a mode of existence. this means not the
advocacy of a life of orgy, torture and murder but a sustained use of the
tools of instrumental reason to critique reason itself, to show how the
most irrational activity can be rendered systematic and rationalized.

what amazes me about _the fast_ is its very lucid and detailed
differentiating and cataloguing of signs and symptoms. for example metal
is associated with the color purple and the sensation of pain, hence
hannah has to avoid taking showers in the metal shower and using metal
spoons and knives. wooden spoons pressed against her eyes absorb the
purple, but she soon discovers that water is a more effective way of
neutralizing the purple. also the color blue has no pain and offsets
the effects of purple, and tap water from the kitchen sink which she
collects in small glasses and pours onto her arms or legs to get rid of
the purple.

so there is a very clear method here of organizing signs as symptoms,
grouping them together, and working through various ways of in a sense
treating the very signs and symptoms she has read and diagnosed.

where this symptomatological reading can takes us (or where i think where
deleuze would take it), is less along the lines of the "literary" value of
hannah's work as barrett has posed it, and more in terms of its value for
life. i think richard tyler is getting at this when he asks "to what
extent is poetry realy a productive thing," as is jeffrey when he
suggests that

        Weiner's success could be very valuable in the empowerment or
        treatment of the similarly diagnosed, and the consciousness
        raising of the self-styled 'normal'....in a sense you ~cannot~ be
        schizophrenic in America.

there's a wonderful moment towards the end of _the fast_, just before the
police arrive, where weiner writes that

        I could feel the energy moving up my head, up the blocked channel
        by the ear and I thought, oh great, I'm finally going to get that
        blood vessel or nerve or whatever opened up and I'm going to be
        able to hear, for as much as I could see, I could never hear, and
        I was just beginning to hear a voice and I thought, great,
        communication will be so much easier. (41)

right, so this is a discovery, a breakthrough in terms of how weiner is
able to deal with her condition: open up to the voices, facilitate
the communication, and perhaps ultimately stay off yr meds if need be.

but of course society exacts a heavy price for this kind of decision.

applauds the range of British verse and finds in Dana Gioia a rare
American talent. <color><param>0100,0100,0100</param>



{PRIVATE}At the beginning of the 21st century, the contrast between the relative
health of poetry in Britain and its dire condition in the US is striking. In
Britain, the Poet Laureate is known if not always respected and the
selection of the Professor of Poetry at Oxford makes the newspapers; in
the US, nobody can tell you the name of the Poet Laureate (answer:
Stanley Kunitz). The best British poets, such as Seamus Heaney, James
Fenton, Charles Causley, Tony Harrison and Wendy Cope, use
traditional verse techniques in innovative ways to write about a range of
subjects in a variety of genres, including political satire and light verse. In
the US, by contrast, almost all of the prestige poetry is written in the early
20th-century mode of "free verse"--that is to say, lines of prose chopped
up at arbitrary points--and almost all of it consists of relatively short
poems, usually a domestic epiphany or a description of a scene or item as
its subject. Hardly anyone writes poetry in the US other than professors--
and hardly anybody reads it, other than the professors who write it.

The collapse of American poetry into the black hole of academic
obscurity is a process that has been occurring for half a century. As
recently as the 1920s and 1930s, poets like Robert Frost and Robinson
Jeffers were celebrities. Edna St Vincent Millay had her own radio
programme. The book-length narrative poems of Edwin Arlington
Robinson and Stephen Vincent Benet were bestsellers. Between the
wars, as in the 19th century, American poets were more likely to be
journalists, men of letters, or even public figures than professors--John
Quincy Adams, the sixth president, translated Horace.

{PRIVATE "TYPE=PICT;ALT="}All of this changed when a gang of professors hijacked American poetry.
TS Eliot and Ezra Pound--two expatriate Americans with PhDs--inspired
several generations of literary intellectuals to believe that, in Eliot's words,
"poets in our civilisation, as it exists at present, must be <italic>difficult."</italic> Their
idea of difficulty was baffling readers with untranslated bits of Sanskrit
(Eliot) and Mandarin Chinese (Pound) and writing poems that could not
be read, only deciphered, sometimes with the help of footnotes like those
the author appended to <italic>The Waste Land.</italic> This was new. Greek and
Roman and Renaissance poets, like those of the 18th century and the
Victorian period, had sometimes used allusions that would baffle the
ignorant, but they counted on being understood by educated
contemporaries. Even the Alexandrians of Ptolemy's Egypt, like
Callimachus, who have come to symbolise mandarinism in art, wrote
poetry that courtiers and generals of the Hellenistic era with a basic liberal
education could appreciate.

But Eliot and Pound were alienated even from the elite of their era in a
way that Virgil and Dante and Shakespeare and Goethe and Tennyson
had not been. The two expatriates wanted a coterie art that would ward
off the uninitiated because they detested modern, mass, democratic
civilisation. Eliot, an admirer of the French authoritarian ideologue Charles
Maurras, famously declared his support for Anglo-Catholicism, classicism
and royalism, while Pound made radio broadcasts during the second
world war on behalf of Mussolini and Hitler. Both men vilified Jews in
their poetry; Eliot also treated the Irish as the exemplary subhumans of the
democratic age <italic>(Sweeney Erect).</italic>

After the first world war, the esoteric right-wing modernism of Eliot and
Pound found enthusiasts among the "southern fugitives," a group of
reactionary professors of literature centered at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville. After spending the 1930s writing polemics on agrarian
economics and white supremacy, the wiser fugitives like Robert Penn
Warren and Allen Tate metamorphosed into purely literary figures. In this
capacity, they and allies like Cleanth Brooks moved north and conquered
the Ivy League English departments in the 1940s and 1950s, spreading
the gospel of Eliotic/Maurassien coterie culture. Oddly enough, these
missionaries of aristocratic reaction found allies among many Jewish
Trotskyist intellectuals, who equated popular art of any kind with the
crude MassCult of their rivals, the Stalinists of the popular front era.
Writing in 1971, the poet Kenneth Rexroth spoke of "the highly select
Trotskyite-Southern Agrarian Establishment."

Rexroth summarises the fate of US poetry after 1945: "Within a very
short time after the second world war, all but a few American poets of
any reputation had been recruited into the universities. Every college in the
land competed with every other to catch a 'poet in residence.'" The
Babylonian captivity of poetry on the American campus has been
prolonged by the explosion of "creative-writing" programmes, each of
which offers an MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in novel-writing, short-story
writing or poetry-writing. Most of the products of these programmes are
mediocre, but this has not prevented patiently networking MFAs from
capturing the institutional power bases of what remains of "serious
literature" in the US, where they use their connections to puff their allies
and deride their rivals. The feuding MFAs are probably no more vicious
than the court poets around Maecenas or Elizabeth I, and rivalry among
artists can produce great art. Not, alas, in this case. The reason is that the
MFA programmes were founded at the moment that the most prestigious
American poets completely abandoned writing metrical verse (that is to
say, verse) in favour of free verse (that is to say, prose).

The first disciples of Eliot and Pound in the American professoriate, the
so-called "academic formalists" of the mid-20th century, had followed
their gurus in favouring an elite coterie art, but they had not imitated Old
Possum and Ez in abandoning metrical verse. Instead, in their own poetry,
they followed WH Auden, a virtuoso of almost every verse technique.
The influence of Auden can be seen in the attention to craft in the work of
the best mid-century academic formalists, James Merrill and Richard
Wilbur.

But then in the 1960s, Robert Lowell, the most famous though not the
best American poet of the day, told the <italic>Paris Review:</italic> "I couldn't get any
experience into tight metrical forms... Prose is in many ways better off
than poetry." It is difficult to imagine Frost, or Tennyson, declaring that,
gosh, writing good verse is just <italic>too hard,</italic> or being taken seriously if he
had. But Lowell's abandonment of verse for chopped-up prose at the
height of his ephemeral fame legitimated free verse for countless American
poets who had never mastered the difficult craft of prosody. Thanks to
their influence, several generations of American poets who cannot tell the
difference between a heroic quatrain and an Alcaic stanza have convinced
themselves that they are poets.

By the 1950s, then, academic coterie poetry had driven out accessible
poetry in the US, and by the 1970s, in a palace coup limited to the
campus, free verse had defeated academic formalist verse. The last third
of the 20th century saw a succession of short-lived schools--Black
Mountain, Deep Image, LANGUAGE poetry--each of which consisted
of a handful of professors advertising their wares with manifestos, using
the ritualised language of aesthetic revolution inherited from the avant-
garde of the first world war era. Under any label, the would-be
revolutionary professor-poets all write pretty much the same kind of brief
random descriptions and meditations in the same kind of amputated
prose.

This history explains how it is that John Ashbery and Jorie Graham,
professors both, came to be the most celebrated poets in the US today.
Ashbery, who began as a sprig from the tree of Auden, writes rambling,
surreal monologues. The work of Ashbery and Graham illustrates the
observation of the late Australian poet AD Hope that in "present day
America and in much of the world beside, the poet feels no obligation to
his reader. He believes either that he is a sort of dark oracle or that he has
no contract to communicate." As a result, Hope said, "the rest of the
world treats their poetry as a trivial game."

{PRIVATE "TYPE=PICT;ALT="}Inevitably, a reaction has set in against the mass-produced free verse of
the professor-poets. In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of younger poets
and critics began defying orthodoxy and writing in the meters and rhyme
schemes which the academic authorities had proscribed. By the 1990s the
"new formalists," as they were called, had two goals: to expand the
audience of poetry beyond the universities, and to revive and renew the
metrical techniques that had been discarded. Although verse narratives by
Vikram Seth <italic>(The Golden Gate,</italic> 1986), Frederick Turner <italic>(The New
World,</italic> 1985) and myself <italic>(The Alamo,</italic> 1997) sold better than most
literary novels, the project of winning back the audience of fiction in
prose, to fiction and drama in verse, has not yet succeeded. The efforts of
the poetry establishment to win back readers have also failed, in spite of
"poetry on the subways" and readings from "cowboy poets" on National
Public Radio.

So far the new formalists have produced more manifestoes than
masterpieces, and the movement may degenerate into another academic
clique (almost all of them, like their rivals, make their living by teaching
creative writing or literature). Even so, movements are remembered for
the handful of geniuses they produce, rather than for the mediocrities. By
general consent the leading figure of the new formalism is Dana Gioia,
who is a very considerable poet indeed.

Gioia, who recently turned 50, should not be a poet at all, by the
standards of the academic world. Before retiring in his forties to devote
himself to literature, he had a successful career in business, becoming a
vice-president of General Foods; he is happily married; he has no history
of confinement in asylums, and is not a victim of substance abuse; he does
not even own a black turtleneck sweater of the kind that authentic poets
wear when posing for photographs. He earned the collective enmity of the
creative-writing industry when he wittily vivisected it in a widely-read
1989 essay in the <italic>Atlantic Monthly,</italic> "Can Poetry Matter?" For the last
decade, the professor-poets have avenged themselves by alternately
pretending that he does not exist and denouncing him. Although Gioia is
one of the few American poets whose books sell, a few years ago the
MFA apparat ensured that his name was left off the invitation list to a
White House conclave on poetry. But to the horror, no doubt, of the free-
verse establishment's tenured representatives, the only contemporary poet
whom First Lady Hillary Clinton quoted was Dana Gioia.

But the snubs do not matter, because Gioia's reputation as a poet and a
critic has grown by word of mouth. This year has seen the publication of
his third collection of poems, <italic>Interrogations at Noon,</italic> and of his libretto
for the composer Alva Henderson's opera, <italic>Nosferatu.</italic> Gioia is
considered a slow writer by members of the campus poetry subculture
who crank out a new collection of poems every year or so (it's easy to be
prolific when your lines don't scan or rhyme). The accumulating size of
Gioia's <italic>oeuvre,</italic> however, is as impressive as its diversity. In addition to
three collections of lyric poetry and the libretto, Gioia has translated
Seneca, Eugenio Montale and other Italian authors (Gioia, a Californian
by heritage, is of Italian and Mexican descent). His lyric poems have been
set to music by dozens of composers. This matters because, in the words
of the critic Gary Taylor: "Genre is itself important because different
genres usually deal, in different styles, with different topics and materials,
and so the mastery of more genres implies a greater variety of human
stuff."

<italic>Interrogations at Noon</italic> demonstrates that Gioia has a range matched in
contemporary poetry in English only by James Fenton. Gioia, who studied
at Harvard with Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Fitzgerald, can be as coyly
allusive as the late James Merrill, in "Elegy with Surrealist Proverbs as
Refrain." But he can also turn to satire in "The Archbishop," subtitled "For
a famous critic," and then again to a nature idyll of Goethean simplicity
and strangeness in "The End of the World." This haunting poem
concludes: "I stood at the edge where the mist ascended,/ My journey
done where the world ended./I looked downstream. There was nothing
but sky,/ The sound of the water, and the water's reply." Unlike so many
of his contemporaries, Gioia has avoided creating a niche for himself by
adopting a single, predictable style or set of subjects. But if there were
typically "Gioian" poems, they would be the lyrics in which the subject is
the wistful erotic longing of personae who are beyond youth but not yet
old. One poem in this vein, "Summer Storm," is already well-known: "We
stood on the rented patio/While the party went on inside./You knew the
groom from college./I was a friend of the bride./We hugged the
brownstone wall behind us/To keep our dress clothes dry/And watched
the sudden summer storm/Floodlit against the sky."

Critics of poetry such as this complain that it is akin to popular song.
Those critics concede far more than they intend to. American popular
music has conquered the world precisely because it unites the
straightforward evocation of sentiments that our cynical intellectuals deride
with the meter and rhyme that make language dance. In the work of Dana
Gioia, American poetry dances as it has not danced for a long time.

For Immediate Release:

                    Creative Arts Café Poetry Series
                             Summer Readings
                         Features and OPEN MIKE

Mt. Kisco, NY: Monday July 16th at 7:30 PM, The Creative Arts Café
Poetry Series at Northern Westchester Center for the Arts celebrates
summer with award winning poet Jeanne Marie Beaumont. Monday July 23rd
at 7:30, Poet and educator Marj Hahne will read selections of her work.
A reception, book signing and open mike follow each  reading.

Jeanne Marie Beaumont grew up in the Philadelphia area and holds an MA
from Columbia University. Her poems have appeared widely in journals and
anthologies including Harper's, The Nation, and Poetry. She has taught
at the Frost Place Annual Festival of Poetry in Franconia, NH  and at
Rutgers University.

Jeanne Marie Beaumont's  first book, Placebo Effects,  is winner of the
1996 National  Poetry Series, selected by William Matthews and published
by WW Norton in 1997. She has recently completed a new manuscript.  She
has read her poems in many venues including the Dodge Poetry Festival,
in colleges, libraries, public gardens, bars, and even once, in a
firehouse!

For seven years Jeanne Marie Beaumont was publisher and editor of the
literary magazine American Letters and Commentary, for which she is now
a contributing editor.  She currently lives in NYC.

Marj Hahne is a poet and an educator. Recently transplanted from
Philadelphia to New York City, she teaches poetry workshops to children
and adults at schools, museums, bookstores, and conferences. She is a
regular at the Cornelius Street Café in NYC.  Her reading of her poem
for Ellis Paul at NWCA’s Ellis Paul concert in February at NWCA was a
terrific crowd pleaser among people who were not the usual poetry fans.
Sharon Olds best expresses for Marj why she writes and teaches poetry
and why she shares what she writes:  "To the poet, the human community
is like the community of birds to a bird, singing to each other. Love is
one of the reasons we are singing to one another, love of language
itself, love of sound, love of singing itself, and love of the other
birds."  Marj wants to (re)awaken people to the restorative power of
words, that is, to poetry as another mode of artistic expression that
can embolden people toward real self-empowerment and ultimately toward a
collective healing.
The series is made possible by grants from the New York State Council on
the Arts and the Bydale Foundation.

There is a suggested donation of $7.00; $5.00 for seniors and students.
Coffee, cake and refreshments are included.

The Creative Arts Cafe is located in the gallery of Northern Westchester
Center for the Arts, 272 North Bedford Road, Mt. Kisco, on Rte 117, near
Staples. For further information, call Cindy Beer-Fouhy, Director of
Literary Arts at NWCA, 241 6922. For directions log onto:

He did not.  His dissertation, Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of
F.H. Bradley, was completed and approved while he was a Ph.D. candidate at
Harvard.  However, Eliot had traveled to England and did not return to
Harvard for seventeen years.  So the final requirements for the degree went
unmet.  Hugh Kenner, in Invisible Poet, discussed the Dissertation which was
subsequently published by Columbia University Press.  Best, Bill

Questions I ask myself about why I go on with my equivalent of
Tinfish, the Runaway Spoon Press (or, for that matter,
and website, Comprepoetica, which I haven't updated in months):

Does anyone give a rap about it except those I publish and some
of their relatives and close friends?

If that's the case, why am I continuing it?

Is there any hope of its ever doing any good for poetry beyond
making a few deserving poets know that someone cares enough
about their work to publish it?

  Good look with your presentation, Susan, and apologies for the
darkness of the questions--Bob G.

Hi just reading the archive and of course this is the thread that caught my
eye. Camille has told me about her project looking at neurology and poetry
and I remain tremendously excited about it. This discussion is interesting
and I wanted to add a few things -- first, Jeffrey, dear, I have to say your
attitude in your initial response to Camille is really one of the reasons I
do not feel comfortable on this list. Maybe she is "tougher" than me, being
in a PhD program and all, but look at her post -- it was open. Yours seems
bossy and condescending. Anyway we are friends off list Jeffrey, in a
correspondent sense, so please don't let this disturb you too much. I just
have to say it as I nervously reenter this particular fray. UGH.

I'm so glad to see inserted in this thread the announcement of a conference
on definitions of normalcy. As Camille says, we can look from "our" point of
view and find instances of "schizophrenia" in all cultures; this doesn't
surprise me, we all have brains. The way it is understood in other cultures
and languages is key however. Of course, as Laurie (I think?) writes, in
ours it is not too easy to be that way. And then as if to make up for it we
valorize it in special, "nifty" cases, such as Weiner, Van Gogh etc. Which
also climbs in to bed with the weird ways we deal with artists in this
culture. And in to bed with the weird ways we deal with women in this
culture. (I for one do not think Stein or Woolf were crazy at all. Maybe
irritated.) But in other frameworks are other histories and possibilities.
Including the framework of psychiatric wards, which we really ought to fund
in this country.

Joan of Arc worked it. A Native psychiatrist I heard speak once said in his
tribe (it was years ago and I unfortunately forget which one)'s
language/understanding "schizophrenia" would translate to "visionary". No
doubt such semantic differences would also be reflected in the treatment,
care, and respect accorded such folks.

Well, maybe that's all from me.

Is the bird that pecks at itself in my car's sideview mirror nuts?

ps of course I realize the problems of the words "culture" and the idea of
ours as singular, as well as the problems of the word "crazy", etc. so no
need to dissuade me of phrases I am using in trying to get to something else
-- in a brief email. thanks, Eliz.

ok, last from me! yikes. I just wanted to add that I bet Joan of Arc
understanding herself and living in a less secular world than our own helped
her.

OK dears, one last and I promise not to post for at least a week.

During a quite recent bout of insomnia I finally finished reading Sylvia
Plath's unabridged diaries (tho I did a little abridging myself, I'll admit)
and I'd posit that her biggest problem was not any form of mental illness
except that which is easily caught from the culture of wanting too much to
be pleasing to or to please men intimately and intellectually and of wanting
too hard to be in the New Yorker. Her journal writing is much, much better
in high school, before these concerns nearly completely take over, in my
opinion.

Some of my favorite of her writing is in the early journals and in some of
the stories in Johnny Panic that Ted Hughes so sweetly introduced as
underdeveloped. (Reminds me of Salman Rushdie's bratty intro to his deceased
friend Angela Carter's Collected Stories.)

I haven't read all my Dolce & Gabanna, I mean yknow, so I can't totally
follow you, Barrett, but I agree it is no good to romanticize schiz, or I'd
say, any state of being. But if one of their points was that US culture is
schizophrenic, I'd have to agree (tho I do get sick of being analyzed by
eurotrash, haha!). And add manic depressive, repressed, cute, blonde and
lots of other adjectives.

Also I want to plug Juliana Spahr's Everybody's Autonomy: Connective Reading
and Collective Identity, which I have been thoroughly wrapped up in this
sunny windy afternoon. Has it been discussed much listside?

Elizabeth

"Envy", in the sense I scare quoted it, is a term that those with power =
use to neutralise the criticisms of those with less power.  And what, =
exactly, is "literary envy" except a version of this?  As a west coast =
Canadian I have reflexively dissed the Toronto literary scene all my =
life--does that mean I secretly want to be a part of it? That's =
ridiculous.

My exasperation with much of the stamp, prize and laureate postings was =
that neither their light dusting of alternativity nor forced whimsy =
failed to disguise their replication of the mindset and values they =
purported to critique.  The unreflective and undifferentiated use of =
such terms as envy and rank and file confirms this.

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  If you live in San Francisco and
are ready for a treat, come and see ME at ATA (Artists Television
Access) in a revival of "Taking Back the Dolls," here's the
description from Planet Out.com:

Taking Back The Dolls (1994, USA)
Director: Singer, Leslie

"Scratch the surface and whaddya get? More surface." --Jennifer
North, Taking Back the Dolls

Leslie Singer dykes-up The Valley of the Dolls in this over-the-top
pixel vision melodrama. Phenomenally dry humor and truly hot sex
combine as we fly through the high-fashion, druggie lesbo lives of
supermodel Anne Welles (Leslie Singer), her depressive Seconal-addict
roommate Jennifer North (Cecilia Dougherty) and the gun-toting Neely
Shannon Chen (Valerie Soe). With music by the Carpenters, Nirvana,
and Suicide and appearances from Kevin Killian and Eileen Myles.

And the Village Voice said, "Kurt Cobain's vocals make a guest
appearance in Leslie Singer's hilarious Taking Back the Dolls (1994),
in which "Come as You Are" substitutes for Dionne Warwick's "(Theme
From) Valley of the Dolls."  This lascivious lesbo take on Jacqueline
Susann's quintessential camp novel remains faithful to Jackie's love
of the fervidly melodramatic while introducing its own inspired
anachronistic flourishes, such as Jennifer North's friendship with
supermodel Gia."

ATA is ATA Gallery
  992 Valencia Street, San Francisco
(415) 824-3890

The show begins at 9:30.  There are also some short subjects playing,
none of which with me in them.  The whole program lasts 77 minutes.
"Taking Back the Dolls" was for several years withheld by the
Jacqueline Susann estate who finally caved in.  Warning, this video
contains explicit sex scenes including penetration (so you'll never
see this on public TV).  I play Kevin Gillian, the imperious
cosmetics tycoon who makes Anne Welles the "Gillian Girl."  Eileen
plays, mmm, I forget her name, but she plays the henpecking
girlfriend of the heroin-addicted "Gia" (played by Laurie Weeks).
Hope to see you all there! -- Kevin K.

I hear what you're saying Maria. Still, it'd be a pity if every action of an
anti-laureate were completely determined by being anti-predicated on those
of the laureate. Whatever one might feel about the laureate, the one hundred
percent accurate portrait of them generated by the hollowed out space of
their antipresence would hardly count as a breath of fresh air.

Hey Anselm, that's brilliant news about your book. Congrats.

-- Rhoda Rosenfeld, from "forty-six thirty-seven"



Jane Rang began a new business called Jane's Reality. "People are starving"
coils around her throat transmitting the instrumental techniques of the
culture, in particular its language, with its system of meanings and logic
and ways of categorizing experiences, yet she can still say "I love this
job. It gives you a combination of practical skills and a strong theoretical
foundation"

reassuring, multi, lingering, on the terrace as Jakarta steams below,
touches the nearly-empty glass to his forehead, "this is nearly what it's like"

"a poem with no reader"

calm in metaphor : any port in a storm
coracles bearing little monks
across submarine-infested waters
sailors plucking guitars in their bunks
Chuck Berry records await the aliens

now Chewable for those who have trouble with Choking


-- from Reg Johanson, "Citizen's Arrest"

Two Free Seminars
Kootenay School of Writing
201 - 505 Hamilton Street
Vancouver BC Canada V6B 2R1
604-688-6001


Investigating Standard English

In the Corporate University, English departments pay their way by acting as
the cops of Standard English. What privileges does the demand to reproduce
Standard English protect? What does it censor? Which speakers are arrested,
marked? Standard English education as Ideological State Apparatus: the
testing industry.  Standard English and global capitalism: the ESL racket.
Standard English as colonialism: Residential Schools and the destruction of
aboriginal languages. Patwa and hybridity. What if English instructors, as
gatekeepers, let everybody in? A course in techniques of effective
plagiarism? Texts TBA.
Investigations begin 2pm Sunday September 9. For copies of readings call
604-688-6001 or e-mail <rjohanso@sfu.ca>.


Studies in Practical Negation

I-The Parable of the Shit-Eater (July 29): Discussion of the anti-libidinal
non-pluralistic grammar proposed by Sianne Ngai in "Raw Matter: A Poetics of
Disgust."
II-Elements of Semantic Refusal (September 30): Evaluation of the argument
(advanced by Jeff Derksen in Culture Above the Nation) that semantic
uselessness, anti-representationalism and materiality make P. Inman's Uneven
Development (1982) commodity-resistant and "unrecoupable into the
culture-ideology of globalization."
III-What Isn't To Be Undone? (October 28): Assessment of the scope of
criticality in the writing of Bruce Andrews with specific attention to the
thesis that Confidence Trick (1981) disrupts naturalised whiteness through
"continual mocking exposure of dominant identities" (Juliana Spahr,
Everybody's Autonomy).
All sessions are free & commence at 2pm. To register & obtain materials

Dear List Persons,

  This is just to say that I got copies of my Green Integer book, The
Pretext, in the mail today. I imagine Douglas will be making a formal
announcement soon. Anyway, if anyone has already ordered it, it should be on
its way.

Yours,

Hello all,

I'm looking for someone who might be in the San Diego area ca. July
24-August 16 to sublet a one bedroom apt., with rent a negotiable (if
not altogether negligible) issue. Perks include easy access to the
UCSD's archive, beaches, the zoo, Seaworld, etc. The catch: a cat who
needs to be fed, let outside/inside etc.

If anyone is planning a trip, or needs a nice vacation, or knows
someone who is/needs either, please backchannel or call when
convenient.

        Perhaps Hannah Wiener's poetry and life best exemplies a crucial
determination of reception that affects not just poets with Wiener's
undiagnozed condition but poetry as a cultural production: the
difference between "appreciation" and "understanding" (Ron Silliman makes
this distinction in his back-cover blurb to Charles Bernstein's 1980
poetry book, Controlling Interests. -- I am just citing this from memory,
which was at the time I first read it, a formative distinction for me
personally.)
        About five years ago Josh Schuster organized an evening
celebration of John Wieners's work at the Kelly Writers House in
Philadelphia. Wieners and some of his Boston entourage (Charles Shively
among others) came to read poetry, and Bob Perelman, Rachel Blau
DuPlessis, myself -- at UPenn like Josh -- presented on Wieners's work.
Alan Davies, who had typset Behind the State Capitol, came up from NYC and
gave an impromptu talk about Wieners and their friendship as well. At
UPenn we had a Wieners reading group going a month or so before the event.
Bob said to me he was nervous about how the event was framed as a
"celebration" (a default generic setting for a lot of events, and
through no fault of Josh's or the Writers House, obviously): how does
one acknowledge the literary interest we have in his poetry and at the
same time not ignore the condition under which the poetry was written and
with which Wieners continues to live (Wieners suffers from a form of
chemical imbalance that is diagnozed as schizophrenia). It was
the difficulty of finding a way to not just appreciate but understand
Wieners, and understand him/his work not only as a reader/thinker/writer,
but as an event participant and audience member of an occasion designed to
in some way acknowledge Wieners the poet and individual. This dilemma was
what was making Bob nervous. And this dilemma of reception is made even
more crucial because, of course, the variety of conditions labeled by
schizophrenia are not really medically understood either -- anyone's
understanding, in the best sense of that word, is limited, then, and
mediated in some ultimate and immediate sense by cultural mores and
attitudes towards the condition.
        It goes without saying that those cultural attitudes have changed
drastically over a brief span of years - at most fifteen or so, as opposed
to the forty or so it took Pound scholars, for instance, to tune in to the
extent of Pound's fascism and racism (Olson the one enormous, incredible
exception). There is probably more continuity between, say, Breton's
tribute to Artaud and Guattari's clinical practice for those diagnozed
with schizophrenia (i.e. that their lives should be state supported, and
moreover, that we can learn from them, as their lives represent a degree
of freedom that we as a whole culture have lost / are afraid of /
repress), than there is between Breton/Guattari and recent
American/Canadian attitudes towards mental disability.
        Which is to say, in passing, that I too think it's important to
hear the record from those who were actually friends of the poet, i.e.,
whose understanding / compassion extends beyond an interpretive claim
(however politically astute) on the poetry and poet. (In my case, I did
not know John Wieners personally, etc.)
        I'd like to end by posing this question of reception, this
question of "learning from," as a literary-philosophical dilemma,
however, using the example (raised by Tom Orange), of Antonin Artaud, and
in particular, Derrida's reading of Artaud (The Secret Art of Antonin
Artaud, trans. 1998 [orig. publ. 1986]). Derrida writes:

          It would certainly be disingenuous to close our eyes, either
          because of some literary feeling or some absentminded
          politeness, to what Artaud himself decribes as a
          neuropathological persecution. Moreover, that kind
          of disingenuousness would be insulting. The man is sick. But
          precisely, how much more naïve would it be *not* to acknowledge
          this truth: Artaud is telling the truth. (93)

It might not be clear from simply quoting from one paragraph of this book
that, for Derrida, "Artaud is telling the truth" not just about Artaud and
no one else's social / philosophical / physical condition. To read
Artaud's truth as specifically the truth about Artaud would be to provide,
instead, I think, a scientized, hyper-individualized, specifically
American reading of Artaud, in the best sense. For Derrida the
philosopher, to understand, learn from, Artaud means to articulate the
"warp" (in the space-time Einsteinian sense) of the logos as it
accommodates Artaud's truth and the fact of Artaud -- the truth of truth
itself. So Derrida continues:

          Through all the passion or the pathology to which his suffering
          submits him, his truth exhibits, *in his name*, the truth of the
          truth, that is to say that every "self" in its own self is
          called to this familial expropriation of the newly born,
          constituted, properly instructed by that expropriation, that
          imposture, that forfeit, at the moment when, very simply, a
          family declares a child born and gives it its name, in other
          words, takes it from him. (93-94)

Artaud's persecution complex becomes here, a complex philosophical
allegory for how any of us are imputed an individual by name, at the time
of birth, etc.
        In short, however, what I think the example of Derrida points to
is a certain productive limit of his own poetics of negation, in the
manner in which a critique and practice based on negation comes to learn
from and understand the negated, those in other words who are negated by
cultural mores of "appreciation" or, its opposite violent face, rejection
/ outcasterdom / freak showiness.
        I'll just interrupt this here.

You might be interested in Jennifer Moxley's essay, "'sphere of
generality' / on content" that is forthcoming this summer in the first of
two sequential issues of Open Letter magazine featuring "open letters"
to/from poets (guest edited by Nicole Markotic and me). I asked her to
write "on content" as it seemed that that was the very question she
herself raised at the end of her second post to Third Factory, the notes

I don't know, J. Gallaher.  I'm heartbroken by this stupid article, because
I agree with its basic gripe:  American poetry has become disconnected from
its readership.  Poetry -- as all the arts in American culture -- is
increasingly detached, self-examining, self-judging, etc etc. (yes, even in
our anti-anti-anti-mainstream subba cultcha).

However, it strikes me as ridiculous to blame Eliot and Pound and some kind
of subsequent academic lineage for the gulf between Poetry and its
readership.  I blame the readers themselves just as much -- who aren't
really reading at ALL anymore.  And I blame mass media, marketing, and the
entertainment industry, which have lowered people's expectations (not to
mention their ability to interpret cultural objects), and therefore I must
blame the free market at some point, though I am not a socialist either.
And I am quite certain that so-called 'new formalism' is not the answer to
these very fundamental problems!  I can just imagine this scenario:

"Mom, I'm not turning off VH1 for that crappy LANGUAGE poetry; it's too
ivory tower. I'm not going to mute 'Survivor' for something as prosaic as
DEEP IMAGE, mom.  That stuff's either irrelevant or philosophically shallow,
in my experience."

"Okay honey, I brought you a book by Dana Gioia.  It's real, it's heartfelt,
and plus, it scans.  And here's a Seamus Heaney for you too."

"Mom, thanks!  Now tell me -- who's our poet laureate?  I'm interested,
really I am."


So yes, Michael Lind is full of shit; here's a better rant that I found on
elimae.com --


+ + + + + + +

B. Renner
"A Rant Against Contemporary American Verse"


There is, of course, no telling what marvelous things might be going on in
the unpublicized wilderness of American poetry: in the smallest of little
magazines; in obscure online journals; in the bedrooms of living Emily
Dickinsons, who may be writing without looking toward publication at all.

On the other hand, what is going on among the recognized literati, in the
American poetic mainstream, in the camps of the "dominant mode" is
clear--American verse as generally practiced has reached a dead end. As
American "plain speech" continually tightened its hold upon the various
poetic communities in the '70's and '80's, vociferous that poetry speak in
the language of the (apparently not very well educated) people, American
poetry delivered exactly what it was calling for--"poetry" that, verbally,
in virtually no way differed from the thousands of utterly tedious
conversations all of us overhear or participate in all the time, and
immediately forget. Or perhaps there is one difference--in the case of this
poetry, we would mostly hope to forget it without having to hear it first.

American verse became telegraphic (that is, shorter than prose), without
being sinewy or muscular. It became Aesopic (that is, almost always ending
with a pithy "life lesson"), without being in the least charming or
humorous. And if I may misquote, at this end of the century, Ezra Pound
writing from the other end of the century, this poetry ain't nearly as well
written as prose. (Not that our prose is exactly stellar either--but that's
another essay that needs to be composed by another writer.)

Two groups, working sometimes as allies--the "new formalists" and the
proponents of the "new narrative" (may I call them the new narrators?)--have
suggested ways out of this cul-de-sac, but neither group seems to be
interested in working hard enough to achieve its stated aims.

The new narrators, for one thing, tend to write in the same old American
plain speech as the reigning literati, with the distinction that they are
narrating instead of philosophizing. But their "verse" displays none of the
characteristics of verse which the plain speechers jettisoned--i.e. any sort
of regular rhythm beyond the limp iambic which underlies most English
language speech and writing; anything like a plottable (or verifiable) rhyme
scheme; and any verbal conceit of the slightest complexity. Which means
essentially that their stanzas can be rearranged as paragraphs with no loss.

And what about their narratives as narratives? Well, the reader is unlikely
to encounter any technique that can have been considered fresh or new at any
point after the publication of The Waste Land or Ulysses, but might very
well stumble across the kind of regional or dialectic ramble unseen since
the death of James Whitcomb Riley.

The new formalists, for all their perhaps well-meaning attentions, can't
seem to scan! My God--you are forgiven for wondering--haven't these people
read Yeats, or Frost, or even Richard Wilbur? Instead they seem content to
block out lines that look roughly the same length on the page, throw down an
occasional end-rhyme (whether it will be noticed by anything but the eye
doesn't seem to matter), break out the thesaurus regularly, and end up in
the same place as the plain speech boys--with a nice little "words to live
by" finale worthy of Reader's Digest.

Dear Susan,

A couple of thoughts, pretty general stuff. And do you recall the barrage =
of emails on this list - August/September 97 - discussing little magazines?=
 Some gems in there, you might unearth some ideas.

Ralph


whether you see the magazine as essentially a magazine for readers, or for =
contributors

who do you see as your audience?

what do you get out of publishing the magazine, personally?

are you keeping your head above water financially?

have you given consideration to technological changes, ie a simultaneous =
net version?

it's often said little magazines all seem to be doing much the same =
things, prisoners of their circumstances * I suspect you'd say tinfish =
differs in its innovation and in its regionality - true?

others suggest that many magazines are edited eclectically, without due =
aesthetical considerations on the part of their editors. not true, in the =
case of tinfish? why?

Subject:      new novel from Mammoth Books

Hello all,

Mammoth Books would like to announce the release of Dimitri Anastasopoulos's
first novel, *A Larger Sense of Harvey*, now available at SPDbooks online
(www.spdbooks.org). *A Larger Sense* will be featured in SPD's "Get Lit"
program in September. But feel free to "get lit" now.

From the Catalog:
*A Larger Sense of Harvey* is an experimental novel about language, love and
identity, set in several East European locales---from the Greek islands to
Helsinki, from Minsk to a research facility in Lapland. As the reader learns
more about the love/hate relationships that anchor the plot, it slowly
becomes clear that *A Larger Sense* is in fact one story nested within
another. Though the novel emerges as a compilation of Harvey's journals, the
reader inevitably come to realize that the journals are actually in the
process of being translated by the narrator Ambrose. As a result, Harvey's
story becomes skewed, and eventually the translations are pit against the
authentic story, which is revealed despite Ambrose's attempts to suppress it.
 The question of translation---in particular, of botched or tortured
translation---looms large in *A Larger Sense* and results in both hilarious
and gently philosophical moments as the author goes on to consider the nature
of sex, language, and male friendship, in a novel that makes its space
between crafty metafiction and the Eastern European epic, always with an eye
for language.

Novelist Paul West examines a chapter from *A Larger Sense of Harvey* in his
new book Master Class (now available from Harcourt).  He writes:
"Anastasopoulos excels at parallel writing-his novel fascinates as it amasses
not so much action as the verbal history of his plot, which he celebrates by
recalling its other plots (Minsk while roaming Helsinki) allowing all visible
cities to become in part invisible. He alters everything as he goes, making
the cities more real by relating them to some intellectual mainstream: the
alien's, the word expert's, the erotic worrier."

Dimitri Anastasopoulos was born in Athens, Greece. He received his MFA at
Pennsylvania State University and a Ph.D. at SUNY-Albany. Anastasopoulos has
published fiction, essays and reviews most recently in the Black Warrior
Review, Callaloo, Willow Springs, and the American Book Review. He has won an
AWP Intro Award for Short Fiction. At present, he is a Visiting Assistant
Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Rochester where he teaches
Fiction Workshops, Hypermedia Writing and Cyberculture, and courses in the
Avant-Garde Novel.

Okay.  Replication and parody are distinct.  The ability to recognize the difference (through such signifiers as the overtly arbitrary exclusion criteria, the invention of clearly artifica titles, people and organizations, etc) is, of course, not guaranteed.

To envy something doesn't neccesarily involve wanting to -be- it.

Well.  Enjoy soaking the towel.

That may be, but can you explain how, in this thread, it was used in that
way?  (E.g., WHICH person with power used it, WHAT criticisms were
neutralized, etc).

How so?  Your last sentence, in particular, mystifies me.  Could you please
explain?

Louis,
    Can you post info on Open Letter?  I either missed it or am lazy or
both.

    Content is somewhat of a paradox I would think as reading poetry and
writing poetry is often a way of avoiding 'content'  I'm curious about what
Jennifer has to say on this.

I think US Cultrue is schizophrenogenic (leading to or causing schizophrenia
or schizophrenic-like behavior).

One of the difficulties in reading about Sylvia Plath is cultural in that
she was 'diagnosed' by critics 50 years ago based on notions of mental
conditions prevalent then.  She was also diagnosed by clinicians accordings
to practice then.

Things have changed

I seem to be waking up to this discussion quite late and reading notes
backwards chronologically, so I'm not singling you out at all, Elizabeth.  I
just want to throw sparks out as they come up.

It strikes me though that it is crucial for any understanding of 'mental
illness' from a practitioner (poet, writer, artist here -- not medical
practitioner)'s perspective that that understanding be based on real life
and contemporary medical understanding and practice, [BTW, I am getting
somewhat wound up as I write which might or might not be good] rather than
arcane textbooks and critical pieces which by their nature are several
levels of about removed from reality.

I would suggest a careful reading of _Beyond Bedlam_  -
http://members.tripod.com/~trbell/metaphor/thought1.htm for a brief review -
might be a place to start along with a sympathetic perusal of the latest
DSM.

[as I read on I will probably apologize but I'll save that for later after
dinner]

I am wondering why there is a need to define a specific aspect of life (the
content of poetry) here and segregate it from 'normalcy'  It is a fact of
human existence and if Hannah choose to deal with her existence poetically I
think that should be honored as such.

If you talk to an artist with visual problems that lead to a 'new' of
painting reality, the artist knows full well what in his or her process came
from the 'vision' and what was really there and the work produced can be
appreciated with or  without knowing the means of production.  A rose by
Gertrude Stein is a rose by Georgia O'Keefe is a rose by Jackson Pollock is
a rose.

The difficulty arises (as it has in history) when any artistic view of
reality is seen as not normal and the poets are all banished.

since this discussion seems to be tossing about medications and diagnoses as
to whether these visions might stem from a bipolar diathesis which is
clinically quite distinct from any schizophrenic tinge.  clinically  clients
with bipolar difficulties are much more likely to find medications
distasteful and hateful than those with 'thought disorders'.  It is likely
that the 'problem' is a combination of the two pathologies (and I use the
clinical term here intentionally).

I feel that this is something that is very much hannah's business, but as it
has been bantered about it would seem appropriate that the banter was
accurate.

I am by the way not putting anyone down specifically here.

Ammonides and List Folks. I agree mostly with the drift of this. I
concentrated on an earlier post I sent on an attempt at looking at Wiener's
work itself (albeit briefly), but it would be difficult to me to see her as
any different as an artist or writer than eg Barrett Watten  himself or
anyone else of the "Language" school, or indeed of any other writer/artist..
Its the problem or problematic of whether or to what extent the writer's
personality experience etc enters their work. On first "encountering"
Ashbery's work and even my first reading of Faulkner I felt that I was
entering a strange, sometimes nightmarish "world", but the question of the
personality etc of those writers had no significance at that time. The
question is also: how would I/we be respond(ing) to Wiener (or say Pessoa)
if we  didnt know (eg in Pessoa's case the near bizarre "reality"? or legend
of his life and multiple  (could be said by some schizophrenic whatever that
is) personalities and narration.?)
  Even the project outlined somewhat by Charles Bernstein etc of a
non-monoligic non -logocentric multi-disciplinary and or absorptive or anti
absorptive work which to a greater or lessser degree distances or even (at
least in theory) "deaths" the author can become or seem to be nearly
bizzarre.I not saying it is: I'm suggesting that taken to certain "lengths"
it may seem to seem to be so.
 I think it would be bad news to see Wieners as a "special case" ..it seems
according to a post of one(some)otther(s) to the list that many have
reported this "visionary" aspect...I've "heard voices" and occasionally in
half dreams It seemed that a "voice" was dictating a poem but I feel fairly
certain that those voices (mysterious as the mind / body/ brain is) were not
madness or "genius" but something fairly "normal". Obviously Wieners was or
had a very vivid immagination or eidetic ability: as many Chess ("high
level") players do (eg Ortvin Sarapu  who was the NZ Chess Champion many
times told me one day of how he had a photographic memory for chess
positions: and I saw him play "blindfold" but he worked "just as only" a
storeman/labourer and was a very "feet on the ground" and likeable person
with no apparent "insanity).  This kind of ability combined with acute
emotional distress (often in life a very "natural" thing) or joy may lead to
a kind of creative sparking: but that doesnt always necessitate a special
case or a "problem".
  It is a facinating and sensitive area and leads directly into questions of
what is and how operates the creative being or person: literally in fact to
questions of how and why we you me they write (or dont) and to what extent
our "woundedness" or suffering is NOT just a Romantic (or it is a positive
in a more complex view of Romanticism taken onto our own times) delusion and
maybe a necessity for creativity....one hopes that suffering is not the
whole deal (it rarely is) but I can see or sense in such as Wieners Spicer
and many of those two groups mentioned generative and generating  emotional
and psychological charge inside or "behind" their works, and we also know of
Spicers and eg Beryyman's alcholoism (his father having committed suicide
and I think he witnessed that), Celan's torment (his parents having been
killed by the Nazis), Roethke extreme sensitivity (and hence his very
beautiful work), Lowell's "madness" and his (over?) honesty, Plath's
obsession with death, Trakl's with all sorts of things and the effect of
being powerless amongst the wounded in the first world war and unable to
help and other "torments" in his mind, Eliot's nueroses, Pound's "insane"
anti-semitism etc but his very sensitive evocation or "criticism" of the
waste of life and things in WWI in "Hugh Selwyn Mauberly", Bishops haunting
story of the village with a scream and her "Crusoe" poem.....the list as you
say is endless. It seems strange and almost too cold to put Wieners under a
special magnifying glass...it is important tread carefully here.
  Perhaps great poetry is always created somwhat from the energising force
of suffering but I hope also that it is also from joie de vive. I dont think
we should avoid discussing Wieners work etal but certainly the
"logocentrising" is or could be a danger: "ah, here's Wieners" but poet X is
over here he/she was a sane poet. No. There are no such simple divisions.
  To lighten up: there's the old joke:  "I'm normal, I know this, because
every other bastard around me's insane." !  This I hope is an interesting
"question" we are talking about here. Regards, Richard Taylor.

Itâ€™s possible that Iâ€™m missing something in the argument, but Iâ€™m not sure I
see why Barrett Watten believes that Hannah Weinerâ€™s work constitutes a kind
of special "axiological" challenge. After all, one could make a long list of
poets whose poetics are inseparable from acute forms of "mental illness,"
and
a nearly endless list of poets whose work is impacted, if not driven, by
less
"spectacular" versions of neurosis: In the first group, Smart, Clare, Blake,
Rimbaud, Baudelaire, George, Trakl, Artaud, Sexton, Plath, Roethke, Lowell,
Kaufman, arguably Spicer, and in the second group, Dickinson, Pound, Eliot,
Khlebnikov, Pessoa, Crane, Dylan Thomas, Michaux, Bishop, Celan, Ritsos,
Finlay, Olson, Duncan, Tanikawa Shuntaro, Wieners, Ginsberg, Eshleman, bp
Nichol, but I am pretty much drawing rapidly here, and one could go on and
on. If Weiner constitutes a "problem" in terms of aesthetic/poetic value,
why
donâ€™t these other poets, too?

Furthermore, and more broadly, perhaps, there possibly seems to be a bit of
"logocentrising", if thatâ€™s a term, at work in this proposal of
schizophrenia
as some kind of special region beyond "normal" evaluative criteria. For
instance, if schizophrenia is a scientifically-explainable illness, and its
symptoms, at bottom, the result of chemical imbalances and neurological
misfirings, why should the poetry produced under its impacts pose any more
of
an "aesthetic-ontological problem" for "normal people" than any poetry
produced under the impact of brain chemistry-altering substances, which may
be half the poetry produced in the world since the Sumerians invented beer,
in fact. Take Spicer, for example. (And it canâ€™t really be said that, well,
you consume drugs and alcohol by choice, but mental illness is not a choice.
Again, take Spicer as example.)

Iâ€™m posing these questions because the general topic is very interesting.
And
I thought Barrett Wattenâ€™s posts on Weiner were insightful and actually
quite
moving. But Iâ€™m still not sure I see the "problemâ€™, as Iâ€™ve said. And not to
be overly negative, but  I think (and particularly in the sensitive area we
are dealing with) that we need to be careful that an artificial poetic
"problem" not be created under the force of the bigger hive-mind neurosis of
academic criticism. Iâ€™m not saying that it is in this case, just that we
need
to be careful.

Hi -=20

I'm not clear where either you or Barrett are going with this thread.  =
You are right in that mental illness of any sort provides no special =
challenge to poetics, unless of course we are to reduce poetics to =
comparative neurology (ugh).  Science explains very little to me; I =
perceive science as a way for people force perceptions into the =
seemingly artificial boundaries of words and language.  Sometimes =
science merely provides a privileged way of separating people from their =
money. =20

Manic depressives (myself included) have for a long time flocked to =
poetry like flies to dung.  No big deal.  Manic depressives are more =
likely to understand the extremes of life (think drama, think mood =
swings) than more evenly-keeled folks.  The creative output of a person =
with mania is only rarely matched by "healthier folks" in terms of =
volume and/or concentration.  But then the price is, we manics tend to =
"off" ourselves more frequently than others. =20

We manic depressives aren't very good at holding day jobs or keeping at =
this or that.  Our endurance at tasks (like relationships, degree =
programs, residences, and so on) is minimal and subject to wild swings.  =
It's nothing to be envied, believe me.  For every successful manic =
depressive there's a failed one, one institutionalized one, and one dead =
one.=20

Occasionally a poet realizes that being mentally ill might make them a =
better poet, etc.  Anne Sexton spent her life in envy of fellow Boston =
socialite Sylvia Plath.  Sexton even articulated her envy of Plath's =
illness on several occasions.  Sexton eventually killed herself.  It's =
obviously not an attractive path.

Mania shares a fuzzy border with schizophrenia and people suffering full =
blown manic states are easily mistaken for paranoid schizophrenics.  =
Even in my extended hypomanic states (which are often a pleasure for me =
but certainly a pain for all of those around me) I suffer radically =
racing thoughts that are seemingly quite rational but they travel so =
fast that I end up exhausting myself without moving a single bone.  Then =
the bottom appears and all feels lost, and everything feels like I am =
trapped in some cruel cycle of the universe, and that there is only one =
escape: the shuffling off of the mortal coil.  The poetry gets tangled =
up in the process.  These racing thoughts are often revelatory but more =
frequently destructive, usually because they are simply extraordinarily =
"other." =20

I am also quite wary of the term "illness," as in such mental =
"illnesses" there is usually no evidence of neurological damage.  The =
pathology is diagnosed not in terms of necrosis or lesions or wounds or =
infections or tumors, but in terms of generalized difference.  Weiner =
was probably attracted to Julian Jaynes' _Origin of Consciousness..._ =
partially because Jaynes claims in the book that, once upon a time, =
everyone heard voices.  Jaynes suggests that in, say, Plato's day, =
nearly _everyone_ was a paranoid schizophrenic.  Humans in 500 BC were =
usually taking orders from these voices that they could not claim were =
their own.  "Hearing voices," Jaynes claims, was once the norm and =
civilization flourished. =20

I know that if my social pressures were more and more adaptive to my own =
cycles of ebb and flow, I would have no problems in "getting along."  =
The illness is an "illness" in part because it simply makes one person =
different from the perhaps mythological "normal guy" archetype.  But =
there's no fever or bleeding or tumor or anything like that in most =
cases of mental illness.

If you are fascinated by the intersection of neuropathology and poetry, =
I recommend Kay Redfield Jamison's _Touched with Fire_.  I also =
recommend Jaynes' _The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the =
Bicameral Mind_ as well.  It is a wonderfully fascinating and =
speculative read.  Much of my own poetics stems from a synthesis of =
Jaynes' book with Walter Ong's _Orality and Literacy_.  The books, when =
though of together, reveal much about language, text, authority and =
thought itself.

Best,
Patrick "certifiable" Herron

Dear Susan,

A couple of thoughts, pretty general stuff. And do you recall the barrage of
emails on this list - August/September 97 - discussing little magazines?
Some gems in there, you might unearth some ideas.

Ralph


whether you see the magazine as essentially a magazine for readers, or for
contributors

who do you see as your audience?

what do you get out of publishing the magazine, personally?

are you keeping your head above water financially?

have you given consideration to technological changes, ie a simultaneous net
version?

it's often said little magazines all seem to be doing much the same things,
prisoners of their circumstances * I suspect you'd say tinfish differs in
its innovation and in its regionality - true?

others suggest that many magazines are edited eclectically, without due
aesthetical considerations on the part of their editors. not true, in the
case of tinfish? why?

Nike ran an ad this year in select cities that read, "THE MOST OFFENSIVE

THE SMELL OF SWOOSH
This is not an Art Project

Five years after it was exposed as an unethical corporation, Nike is still
exploiting sweatshop labor, still paying Indonesian workers a few nickels an
hour while rewarding its PR celebrities with millions. After all the campus
campaigns and culture jamming, kids all over the world still proudly flaunt
the swoosh. In fact, Nike has grown so cocky of late that it’s starting to
make fun of its critics.

Earlier this year, Nike launched a campaign of jamming the jammers.
Billboards like the one shown above popped up all over urban Australia. Then
they were postered by "saboteurs" – Fans For Fairer Football ffff.com.au,
complaining that the new Nikes gave wearers an unfair advantage. The only
"activists" in this case, of course, are in the Nike marketing department.

Real activists responded, jamming the jam on the jammers. Websites like
nikesweatshop.net and bantheboot.com slammed the company for looking to make
(another) fat profit at the expense of its sweatshop workers. The bogus FFFF
website was quickly shut down, and everyone was left to wonder: What the
hell just happened? Here's one answer. Nike has begun to trade on public
cynicism.

Decades of marketing have attuned us to watch advertising for signs of any
shift in what is and isn’t cool. Today, this trend consciousness pervades
every element of culture. It took hard work to link the words "Nike" and
"sweatshop" in the public mind, but as that idea is repeated, it steadily
loses freshness. It becomes unfashionable, then clichéd. Finally, it becomes
"cool" to dismiss the sweatshop accusation, even though the accusation is
true. And so – without significantly changing its practices – Nike gets a
chance to mock its critics, with the public laughing along.

Culture jamming can do serious damage to a corporation's brand. It can also,
as Nike is proving, become a marketing hall of mirrors. Nike knew that its
"Offensive" campaign would trigger a backlash. They were counting on it. And
now they're back in the spotlight, this time on their terms.

What Phil Knight forgets is that culture jamming isn’t some kind of
postmodern art project. It's a form of sharp public criticism and direct
action. If Nike turns culture jamming into a corporate mindfuck at the
expense of sweatshop laborers, then we, too, can shift tactics.

Obviously the brand damage we've wrought on Nike so far isn’t enough – it
needs to be more visceral still. So let us reach deep into our bag of tricks
and pranks for a ruckus that can’t be ignored. Hello, what do we have here?
Ahhh . . . the humble stink bomb.

Let us celebrate the stink bomb. Safe. Easy to make. Simple to carry. And
the smell – the smell can linger for days.

Imagine small groups of jammers hitting Nike shops worldwide, again and
again, with a harmless, rotten-eggs stench. Not a very clever message, but,
like tear gas, one that’s very hard to forget. And simple, too: Nike, you’re
tainted; your brand stinks! Spraying a little perfume around doesn’t make
you clean.

Unswooshing Nike will also get the word out to other wayward corp-orations
that we the people have our limits. If you debase our discourse, if you blur
the line between authentic process and corporate spin, if you openly fan the
fires of cynicism, then you are going to get stung.

Elizabeth,

Thanks for the post on Plath.  In the Journals I too was impressed
with all the natural prose genius she had that seemed to get
suppressed as she became serious.  Her ability to describe place and
capture atmosphere was astonishing.  But, then she'd get into
crafting a Story and the writing would turn sour.

I recently read an excellent article on Plath (Kevin found it and
told me about it):

http://www.laweekly.com/ink/01/30/books-fraser.shtml

Plather
by Caroline Fraser
New books on Sylvia and Ted

In it Fraser talks about the Plath industry, particularly that horrid
Sylvia and Ted "novel" by Emma Tennant.  (I reviewed the Tennant book
myself, as well as Plath's journals--as a fan, not a scholar.)
Fraser does a great job of summing up all the controversy around
Plath, but then she, thank god, turns to Plath's poetic abilities,
how radically she revisioned the fluffy notion of Poetess.  She takes
Plath's poetry very seriously:

"Plath has a claim--perhaps a claim greater than any woman poet
before or since--to true greatness, but it has impossible for anyone,
including her husband to come to terms with it."

I was intrigued by her position that greatness is hard to handle if
it comes in a troublesome package, and I was heartened by Fraser's
praise of Plath.  Radically revising anything female can be a
thankless job (or, in my case, keep one from getting jobs).

Hi Nikuko, This is the best I can do. Ever have the idea your life is
getting more and more fucked up? At this point the job is in jeopardy; in
fact we don't have the slightest idea where we'll be come, say, December.
I keep hoping that Newfoundland will descend like a Goose and pick us up,
carry us there with high-speed connect, that our friends will visit as we
head norther into Tundra. But I appreciate the necessity of continuous
exposure, skin* at our expense, and so the following is offered within the

If I might modestly correct our honored Anti-Laureate, he can in fact invite anybody he wishes to read at the Library of Congress.  One of the few good things about Ameirca is that anybody can, and does, read at the LOC, in the main reading room -- though if the reading is to be aloud, I'd suggest the front steps --

For those you who may be interested:

Linda Bohe -- Collected Poems -- now on-line

Linda Bohe died in 1983 at the age of 33.  She lived in Boulder and then
NYC.  She studied with Alan Dugan, William Matthews and Richard Hugo. Her
terse syntax perhaps reminds one of Hugo, but with a more eclectic range of
subject matter.  Her broad range of poetic taste was shown in the magazine,
Attaboy, which she edited with Phoebe MacAdams.

IMMEDIATE RELEASE


ALT-X ONLINE NETWORK, ON THE WEB SINCE 1993, LAUNCHES NEW ALT-X PRESS WITH
EIGHT ORIGINAL EBOOK AND PALM TITLES

BOULDER, Colorado, July 16, 2001 -- The Alt-X Online Network, "where the
digerati meet the literati," announces the release of eight original ebook
and Palm titles, featuring both well known and emerging international
artists and writers. The eight titles inaugurated here include previously
unpublished work by postmodern fiction masters George Chambers, Ron
Sukenick and Raymond Federman, screen-based auteur Nile Southern, new
media stars Mark Amerika, Eugene Thacker, Adrienne Eisen, and Alan
Sondheim, and a collection of Neuromantic Fiction from the Black Ice
magazine archives. As part of Alt-X's longstanding strategy of utilizing
the strengths of world wide web publishing, these ebook and Palm titles
will be available to readers for free without corporate advertising.

As one of the oldest surviving web sites devoted to producing and
distributing provocative works of digital narrative, Internet art and
avant-pop fiction, Alt-X is now initiating a cluster of new media projects
including free ebook/Palm titles, mp3 compilations, Internet art
exhibitions, streaming audio installations, and an upcoming redesign of
the entire site, including its popular ebr journal, an international forum
on new media art, writing and criticism.

"In a time of economic downturn and dot.com uncertainty, Alt-X perseveres
and continues its mission to expand the concept of writing," said Alt-X
President and Publisher, Mark Amerika. "And as digital writing makes its
footprint into the electrosphere, we no longer ask 'What is literature?'
but, more importantly, 'What is literature's exit strategy?'"

The books are available for free download at www.altx.com/ebooks and many
of these new publications will be available as Print On-Demand (POD) titles
this Fall.

For information on the Alt-X Network, Alt-X Press, or any of the artists,
send email to Kristine Feeks at Kristine@altx.com

new media


there's nothing to carry with you, nothing to give you weight,
you have no proof, nothing that occupies space or place

you're riding empty air, you can hardly breathe, you're riding vacuum,
into the speech or music of it, into the dream of it

or afterthoughts or nighttime violence heard from the heat of the window,
daytime cries and murmurs from the apartments everywhere but your own

or your own, you're there recording, you're making files, slippages,
against memories of mountains, boulders, other hardened things

you watch your speech slip away, return from nowhere,
you watch your dreams ordered back into awkward place and place

there's nothing you can say, nothing you can point to,
a few thin disks at the very best, rainbows, some machine, or other

computers, machines which do nothing, no movement anywhere,
inert in the world, you can't go there at the end of the day

at the end of the day there's nothing to show, nothing to hear,
nothing to hang on to, no accomplishment, cataracts and dead eyes

beautiful futures out of drowned, invisible, submergence,
as much of our chosen selves, embedded densities

lined up out of zero-one abstractions, worlds of non-making,
unfashioning worlds, loosening, unraveling

new media, none at all, not even a glance, no book burnings,
no wonder everyone desperate for history

loose fields of magnetisms, plasmas, disks melting in the noonday sun,
outmoded broken readers or displays, ecstatic memories

memories dying in new suns unfurled into novas,
mediations lost in charred polarities, epiphanies of zeros-ones

The word I was searching for earlier ('not taking that label to be a
"label of an ~illness"~ per se but a label of a ~condition,'~), rather
than "condition," is more correctly "DISABILITY."  We are talking about
Weiner's disability, about its relation to contemporary poetry, and its
nature in general.

(1) First, for Camille: another relevant reference I crossed upon in my
papers the other night, sorting:

Mehlman, Jeffrey, (sic) "Portnoy in Paris," in DIACRITICS, Winter 1972,
pp. 21 etc.,

about the "self-professed" schizophrenic Louis Wolfson, of Brooklyn, who
wrote "Le Schizo et les langues," a sort of schizo-autobio, in grade
school French, published in France by Gallimard, 1970, preface by
(apologies) Deleuze.

Sylvere-Lotringer recommended looking into Wolfson when I was doing my
research/paper on Artaud (which later turned out to be a presentation at
the Museum of Modern Art's Artaud centennial).

(2)    As far as "the body without organs," "desiring machines," and
other Deleuze terminology and whether such "dubious metapsychological
concepts" form "an adequate basis for a theory of our collective
postmodernity," etc., --- well,---  the idea of "postmodernity" itself
is notorious for the same vagueness, and is a kindred and equally French
(Lyotard) notion that came out of the same wave.  To me, that seems like
asking what escargot can brie can add to a croissant (metaphor).

"The body without organs" was a term borrowed from Artaud, so quite
authentically schizo in its pedigree (Artaud's technical diagnosis was a
phrenia slightly to the left of schizo, I forget which).  The value of
the concept, when paraphrased into the more ~normative~ discourse that's
been asked for, had to do with aboriginal or infantile states of
indefinition about the body.  Linked to other
psychoanalytical/metapsychological concepts: "le corps morcele'e" or
Melanie Klein's "the body torn to bits and pieces", i.e., the fused,
undifferentiated, pre-self/other pre-baby/Mother, oral-anal-genital
self-object of Klein's infantile anal sadism stage).  The contribution
of these concepts is that schizo consciousness would no longer be seen
as ~alien~ to the self-styled "normal" mind (viz. the frequent
references to famous violent schizophrenics as "monsters"), but
~fundamental~ to it.

"Desiring machines": ---well, where would you be now without the
desiring machine whose keyboard your fingertips are touching?  I hardly
know what to say in response to a rejection of "desiring machines," I
find their aptness so self-evident.  "Desiring machine" then, cyborg
now.  Perhaps more palatably (normatively) re-stated under different
schemata in Lury, Celia, ~Prosthetic culture: photography, memory and
identity" (Routledge, 1998).  (The French sense of the biomechanic or
automaton, as inheritted from Decartes.)

Without this French revisionism of stereotypical schizophrenia,--- what
are we left with??  American ego psychology?  Strides were made with the
Sullivanian approach toward the treatment of schizophrenics,--- but the
obstacle here, Barrett, is that schizophrenia is otherwise disregarded
as ~unanalyzable,~ hence not really meritting or benefitting from
psychotherapy.

The schizophrenic is innately and irradicably subversive.

Was Weiners a "professional" schizophrenic?  That is, was her diagnosis
and state disability payments her means of livelihood?

The problem of "visions"/hallucinations/seeing words does not seem to me
as disruptive a problem in her texts as the larger literary problem of
where she stood (border-line) one foot in Language Poetry and one foot
in second/third generation New York School East Village Personism (her
frequent diary-style references to Doug Messerli, Rosemary Waldrop,
Charles Bernstein, etc., whom she calls "the language boy": still more
of a problem! is this little joke of hers a slow fuse time bomb critique
of New York branch Language Poetry as male-dominated, a boys' club).
The critical urge (especially the one, Camille, I've seen you use
viz-a-viz Bhaktin, etc.) is to read Language Poetry as autonomous text.
The loose ends, the ligatures that Weiner leaves explicit between her
literature and her life ~force~ biographical inquiries that will seem
antithetical to the Language aesthetic, as more and more biographies
gradually emerge (there's a David Lehman waiting to undo all their
efforts by story-telling a Life of the Poets).

Schizophrenia is never "pure" schizophrenia.  There are schizophrenics
who hoard (the iconic "street person" dragging around plastic bags full
of rubbish) and hence are toward the hoarding-&-saving
obsessive-compulsive axis;  there are schizophrenics whose self-delusion
comes out as the old "He thinks he's Napoleon" ~New Yorker~ cartoon
(Nietzsche eventually declaring he was Christ, all the many other
"crazies" who are Jesus, etc.): there, there's an inflamed narcissistic
pole to the personality, with religious mania (Christ/the equally
widespread popularity of the Apocalypse among schizophrenics); etc.,
etc.  Those secondary aspects are where schizophrenia can downgrade into
something in the direction of "normalcy": if the religious maniac can
make it into church, they may be allowed to hang around, given soup
kitchen support, in a way that re-contextualizes their religiosity into
a like-minded community; the hoarding-&-saving compulsive has
survivalist tendencies beneficial to making it through rough winters
outdoors, versus the --- exhibitionist/nudist? schiz', who walks around
without shoes or a shirt in freezing weather.

>From the one Weiner book I own, "Spoke," her above-mentioned
friendships, and that she did manage to sustain relationships with
fellow authors, is quite impressive.  The LSD business would also change
the diagnosis: drug-induced psychoses are treatable and more short-lived
than idiopathic schizo-psychosis.

Do the stylistic parameters of Language Poetry allow the
half-functioning schizotype to "blend in" or be concealed through the
very genre, the way that homosexuality is undecideably blurred by the
sentimental passion rhetoric in pre-XXth-century male-male
correspondence?

But I'm not sure why her poetry requires explanation by recourse to her
life. (!)  The claim that capitalized word in the books were words she
saw, often stated briefly in an introductory note, functions as a
completely endogenous feature of the work.  That claim ("clairvoyance"),
once put aside, allows a re-examination of the capitalized words: often
they seem to rise out of the preceding text and in no way to contradict
or interfere with a theme she's unreeling; at other times, some of her
"introjects"/"voices" make harsh accusations against her that threaten
to undermine the text's forward progress.

This is similar to James Merrill's use of a ouija board in "The Changing
Light at Sandover," which also provides transcribed "voices."  I don't
really need to know whether or not Merrill "actually" used a ouija board
in his personal life, or what he believed about it.  It is fully
integrated into the literary machinery of the poem, as a symbol or a
myth or a real-life quotation might be.

I hope I do not seem patronizing (recommending Deleuze to Camille Martin
now seems as embarassing as if I'd recommended The Chicago Manual of
Style, it's so foundational).  If I do, it's not directed at you(s).
These sentences are partially my own attempt to work through some of
these ideas/questions.

I find the weakness and frailty of her persona(e) to be one of the most
appealing features of her writing.  In contrast to (masculinist) grandiosity,
her protagonist is having a pretty laughable scrapple of a hard time managing
even simple things.  Like Beckett characters . . .  or, more recently, Heather
Ramsdell's "Lost Wax," where the poor nit is constantly rummaging around
through a closetful of socks, a Philip Guston kind of littered Parnassus.

really, i don't get all this crisis-oriented rhetoric about american
poetry.  who cares? why not just let it die a natural death and let the
next thing emerge?  that seems to be what interesting poets are doing
anyway.  the only good piece of writing i've seen on a crisis in lyric
poetry is Walter Benjamin on Baudelaire and it's good because it's analytic
rather than polemical.

Spicer is certainly a strange one. The poetry is very
stimulating, but the poetics, to me at least, makes no
real sense. I find it hard to take it at face value,ie
as generalisations about poets' practice, I tend to
read it as a sort of justification for the strangeness
of the poems. There is that extraordinary paradox of
the linguistics Phd, the trained scientist of
language, apparently abandoning himself to the mastery
of language...
The only piece of criticism about Spicer that I have
encountered is Robin Blaser's essay at the end of the
Collected Books, and I got little satisfaction from
it. The biography doesn't seem to go seriously into
literary crit territory, no doubt for good reasons.
Has anyone besides Blaser written ambitiously about
the guy's poems?

Cheers
Scott

I was in an unofficial "counselling" relationship with one particular
schizophrenic (among others) for over two years.  He phoned me every day
(sometimes many times in one day or in succession, of course, just like a
schiz'.  For a long time he didn't have a phone in his apartment and had to use
pay phones.  Invariably, he let his nickel after nickel run out to its absolute
last drop, triggering the automated [female!] robot operator voice to interrupt
["I'm sorry, but your time has run out" or whatever.  "Please deposit another
five cents for another X minutes"].  Speaking of "desiring machines," it was a
curious mechanism by which he, innocently, forced the "hearing voices"
experience on the listener.)

I'll relate a text-related moment that occured with him, peripherally relevant
to Camille's questions about hallucinated text, etc.

I used to leave tongue-in-cheek messages on my answering machine.  At one
point, I had a message that said "T-H-I-S  I-S  J-E-F-F-R-E-Y" (spelled out
letter by letter like that, jokingly) "P-L-E-A-S-E  L-E-A-V-E  A
M-E-S-S-A-G-E."

People who called would usually respond similarly ("H-I!  T-H-I-S  I-S . . ."),
or laugh, or say something about spelling bees or the alphabet, or whatever.
My schizophrenic caller, phoning daily, had left messages for several days
without acknowledging whatsoever my outgoing message.

Finally, after about a week of messages, he said something about it (he was,
like many schizophrenics, highly intelligent and well-educated):  "That's a
very interesting message you left.  Mysterious.  You'll have to tell me
sometime if it means anything."

The surprise to me was that he was unable to amalgamate the obvious parts,
letters of the alphabet, back into a meaningful whole, the way everyone else,
people in fact much less clever than him had done in a flash.

He hallucinated voices sometimes, in his case voices of people he was really
around at the time, usually when he or they stepped into the next room.  (A
schiz' friend of his hallucinated celebrities voices but, we found this
hilariously funny, they were the voices of extremely ~minor~ celebrities.  I
wish I could remember whom, but I don't know a lot about television of popular
culture.)  He would go to the bathroom and hear the people he had just stepped
away from saying ugly things about him through the door.

What was amazing about him was that he had the ability to ~double-check~ with
the sources of his hallucinated voices whether they had just been talking about
him.  He could reality text by going up to the person and saying, "Excuse me,
but were you just whispering under the door that I should drop dead," etc.

By Weiner ~transcribing~ her reported text hallucinations, she may have had a
unique reality-grounding technique like that, which brought what otherwise
would be lonely "pathology" into a public and interpersonal realm that
neutralized them. . . . not that most of the transcribed text hallucinations of
hers that I've read were especially malevolent or remarkable in themselves.
That, too, says something: the ~depletion~ in her "clairvoyant" messages . . .
most that I've read of hers were as banal as street signs, perhaps even moreso
. . .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I find much of what you've written here, Camille, to be very beautiful and
eloquent, literary in and of itself, almost a new genre of mental epiphenomena
reportage, a realism of privacy:

>> it's as if the words were rising to the surface from a place over which I
have little conscious or intentional control.  More commonly, I have the
feeling of "losing myself" while writing, in which I seem to be allowing inner
voices, mental movements and desires (and the voices & feelings that I have
absorbed from others) to shape the work.  Sometimes, in a hypnogogic state, I
seem to be dipping into an ongoing chatter within my subconscious mind, as if
this chatter might be happening almost all the time, but I'm only allowed
access to it during certain twilight states.  When I close my eyes at night, I
often see a parade of images of faces that seem so particular as to be real
individuals, but they are people I don't recognize.  Where do they come from?<<

That last touch ("Where do they come from?") is reminiscent of the opening
quote in Chairman Mao's Little Red Book ("Ideas . . . Where do they come from?
Do they fall from overhead?" [I don't have it verbatim])

It's very Proustian, his bedside magic lantern, falling asleep in bed and all
that (especially, for me, now after having recently concentrated on Susan
Howe's "Bed Hangings" lullaby):

>>In addition to the "dictation" mentioned, there's the more quotidian inner
stream, the seemingly incessant chatter or parade of images and symbols
that we all experience, a kind of roiling conversation among memories,
perceptions, and other mental / bodily events.  The "conversational" feel,
or the feeling of "otherness" of such voices might be due to the fact that the
brain is interconnected in such complex ways that ongoing neural events
of different types may appear like different voices to us -- perceiving,
explicating, commanding, commenting, evaluating, emoting, symbolizing,
visualizing ? not to mention the voices contending with each other to place
different values on things perceived and tugging at you to behave in
different ways, the proverbial angel and devil on your shoulders.<<

I'd like to try to imitate it some time.

I used to (or can kind of at will re-activate it) "see" either the words that
were being said to me (in reality) or the words of my thinking, going back very
fast in a sort of teletype closed caption monitor way.  They weren't exactly
~in front of~ my retina and in my visual field, the way Weiner reports hers,
but sort of like a transparency and somehow coming from "behind" my eye, as
there was no question but that they were thought and ~my~ experience, in no way
externalized as Weiner imagined hers.

I worked for a few years, way back, as a dictaphone operator.  My typing speed
is high (over 110 w.p.m. when last test 15 years ago on an electric
typewriter), and I often found it easier to transcribe by closing my eyes: I
would work, literally, "with my eyes shut."  Although I was already a sort of
"hyper-literate" guy to start with, I think that that prolonged enforcement of
having to bring to mind mentally the spelling of words, very rapidly, and then
getting faster at it, somehow "helped" to accentuate or ~embed~ these "seen"
spellings in this way.

Also, developmentally, I might mention:

My father worked as a sign painter.  He would often have me help him out on
Saturdays.  Sometimes we'd go up and work on billboards, and so on.  So, for
one thing, I was raised in this household where down in his basement workshop
there were letters, ~big~ plastic or wooden letters, boxes of them.  I might
either play with them when very young or, in helping him out, have to "go and
get" a B or an H or whatever from these stacks.  In proportion to my childhood
physique, they must have been quite large, by ratio, maybe from shoulders to
knees, some of them.  --- And then with the billboards, we would be hanging
mid-air on scaffolding with letters of the alphabet three times our size,
painting them in.

I think by growing up around the alphabet on such a Brobdignagean scale (sp.?),
it ~embedded~ the alphabet very palpably into my psyche.  Hence, "seeing" or
semi-seeing words while they're being heard comes "quite naturally," later
deepened by other reenforcing.  (I think they used to clock typing speed with
five [six?] characters per word, so at over 100 w.p.m., typists are manifesting
internal thresholds of transcription, of about 500 or 600 letters/units per
minute, language micro-pulsations of around 8+ per second. [New Math?]  . . .
about the rate of musical sixteenth notes at MM = quarter-note = 60)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would prefer if psychodiagnostic terminology were phrased as ~verbs~ rather
than ~nouns.~  Rather than "a schizophrenic," to say, "She was
'schizophrenicizing,'" the way we say "obsessing" in place of OCD.  I think it
makes it easier to understand, somewhat more relax to discuss.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks very much for posting this, Peter.

I was a summer "exchange" student in Sweden when I was a teenager (no one was "exchanged" back into my
family in exchange for me, though).  I made fast progess with learning Swedish, although I wasn't
comfortable enough to speak it until the summer later when I returned and went traveling with friends.
They first started my out with a Swedish baby book, "Alla Vi Barn in Byllerbyn."  We'd also take cracks
at newspapers, Dagens Nyheter, etc.

Not long, though, before I'd "graduated" to be able to take on more teenage-sized literature.  My
friends were very fond of the Mummintroll books in Sw. translation.  It may have been her illustrations
especially that endeared them: sort of Pillsbury Dough Boy dumpling-shaped characters, fat-bottomed, who
did funny things: pyrophobia, where "Pappan" was afraid there might be a tepid matchstick left
underneath the dry leaves somewhere that would spontaneously ignite and cause a conflagration, etc.,
rowiling in boats, their thumbcap-looking haberdasherie, "Trollkarlenshatt" [pronounced "-karlens-
-hatt," not "karlen-shatt"].

The reminder tempts to me to take the books down off the shelf.  Might be fun-nice to eulogize Janesson
with some sort of Adobe Photoshop of her pictures.

There was a character called "Lilla My" [the Sw. "y" in "My" is a non-English vowel, more pursed lips,
etc., somewhat closer to the Eng. word "mew," the word for a seagull's sound; even "Lilla" is
un-Englished in Swedish, more of a "LEE-lah"].

My cat was not named Mu after that character (his name came from the Japanese koan) but, much of the
baby-talk/kitty-talk I used to talk with them (Shiki, the other) was broken English broken Swedish Latin
etc.  The private language of pet-owners. And I'd call him "Lilla My," sometimes.

MUSEUMS

The bright light shines
And it shows
That nobody's shadow
Is clear

I can see things in the light
'the unambiguous strain of capitulation on your face'

In the flea markets
They are selling the history
Of the twentieth century
Kitsch objects of ironic value

At night the museums are dark.
At night
Everything becomes a museum
I close the computer
And it becomes
A museum of my thought
When it opens
I see my words
Behind a glass screen

My mind is a museum
Of memories
I have a few objects
A few photos
Some words written
To accompany them

I have argued with myself
What is valuable?
What can be thrown away?




BEGIN THE BENIGN


Disconnected


                Modern

Scientists believe: MASS MENTAL ILLNESS BY 2020

We are faking it

Killing with impunity

The news is pornography

BBQ season is over
It's flag waving time
Flag burning time

Anarchists demanding the impossible
Nationalists demanding nations

Separate our world into microcosms
Finance Paranoia - Finance Killing Machines



       (the benign

        is within)


Raise the homocide rate
Raise the interest rate
Raise the roof - Lower taxes
Lower the boom


I argue / I talk
I debate / I think
I may act  (out)

The song remains the same

Cleaner brighter  (add desire here)
And a luxury  (add desire here)




Take Stock Sever The Bonds




Watch televised death
           Buy groceries
Hear the neighbours fucking
All in the same day  (24 hours)



I am never going to dedicate
                     another song


I am never going to write another poem
      for anyone
      but myself


I am never going to say a single thing
         About anyone      But myself


And I am
Shot out of a cannon
Thrown out of bed

And if I lose  You will learn your lesson
If you lose me  You will learn your lesson

I think I would rather write
        Terrorist Manifestos
        Or Suicide Notes

     I could make them lyrical
     I could make them rhyme

I could make them into:
    TOP TEN HITS!





OH GOD, HOW I MISS THE COLD WAR!


I miss the borders
And the boundaries
     I miss the KGB

I miss the Paranoia
And the unremitting grey

I miss the Red Flags, Fur Hats
And trigger happy border guards
I miss American self- righteousness
     I miss Nicaragua
Slaughtered in the crossfire
I miss Che Guevera
Resurrected every ten years

I miss communal apartments
The Space Race
And Ballet Stars making a run
I miss Krushchev banging his shoe
At the United Nations
And Reagan saying:
 'we begin bombing Russia in five minutes'




REFUGEES

We are all refugees
Refugees from love
With our pain and scars
Our fear of
With clandestine embraces
And our pornography
Drunken searches for affection
Resolute celibacy
And our determination – one day
Maybe one day - again





Dunkin Donuts Coffee
Smells like a road trip
It tastes like the coffee you get
When you pull off the highway
To get yourself a cup:


I pulled the Magic Ring
Off my Dunkin Donuts cup
I could win a trip!
To one of the forty countries
Where you can find Dunkin Donuts
The prize you have
Appears on the ring
When the coffee is poured in
It is heat activated
I am pretty excited
Just walking down a Montréal street
And I could win a trip instantly!
To some foreign country
Where I could be high on caffeine and sugar
I wonder if I have to get personal references
I mean, some of my friends
Have seen me:
Hepped up on sugar and caffeine
I can't imagine
If I was doing sugar and caffeine
And trying to speak a foreign language!

Hi all,

Scanning through my sunday times yesterday, the city section, when lo
and behold stumbled on a poem by Joanna Fuhrman from "Freud in Brooklyn"
as one of four authors excerpted to show a bit of their book; longtime
new york newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin was one of the others.

Nice to see one of our own, and the great Hanging Loose Press, too,
plugged in the paper of record.

as ever,
David Kirschenbaum

Consider that the "next thing" might not "emerge" without dispute,
lamentation, crisis. Part of behaving naturalistically -- in my way of
looking at it, anyway -- is calling shit "shit" when I see it, and wishing
aloud for something better.

So, these so-called interesting poets: brave face, don't complain, move
forward.  Who are they?  Would they go so far as to agree with Dale Smith?

"How can our poetry exist with the vapid, socially engineered 'Ally McBeal'=
?
Or 'Survivor'? Or 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'? The task of a poet today
is probably more difficult due to this total siege by a culture that seeks
dominion over our psyches. The dogma masters of the ad agencies are culture
priests, and we're all being manipulated by our desires. Critical theory,
and, through it, Language Poetry, helped us articulate the chains that bind
us to our culture. But I=B9m sick and bored with enumerating the now obvious
infections that limit our actions as men and women. Conceptual arts have
magnified the prison yard. I trust perceptive acts to lead us forward, if
there is a forward."

Maria et al,

Per my email of moments ago, I just noticed that even my hero Dale says he's
"sick and bored with enumerating" the problems, so maybe I should stop
sniveling!  Yet on the other hand, he does begin to enumerate them.

>>>Occasionally a poet realizes that being mentally ill might make them a
better poet, etc.  Anne Sexton spent her life in envy of fellow Boston
socialite Sylvia Plath.  Sexton even articulated her envy of Plath's
illness on several occasions.  Sexton eventually killed herself.  It's
obviously not an attractive path.<<<

Ouch--"socialite"? Kind of a headline word, innit? And correlation vs.
causation here is tricky--Sexton's pathologies manifested long before she
had met Plath--in fact, at least in her own narrative, she resumed poetry
only at the urging of a psychiatrist & only later met Plath.

in my admittedly limited experience it fairly common for Eastern =
European
and Russians to refer to the process of writing a poem as an =
'experiment'.
I happen to find this congenial with what I write as I write and it =
seems to
be more than a language issue.  My feeling is that some time aways back
anglo critics abandoned the usage as they fled in abandon from the hard
sciences and poets have followed too willingly.  As a scientist I =
conduct
experiments, as a psychologist I encourage clients to experiment with =
life,
and as a poet I experiment in a number of ways.

i guess my view is that perhaps poets have abandoned the field to the
sciences a little too quickly.

Camille,
    As I said earlier I am coming to this discussion late and also =
readig
backward chronologically as I find timebut I'm also finding a lot here
that's useful.

     For example, I suspect you might find it useful to explore further =
the
diagnosis of 'schizophrenia' Hannah received, rather than just avoiding =
the
issue of diagnosis.  "Schizophrenia' is a very vague and amorphous term =
even
for professionals.  If I get a patient with this label attached I and I
think most others would ask who said this and why did they say it as in
understanding and helping someone accuracy is important.  Schizophrenia
comes in many colors and competent professionals tend not to just throw =
it
around without careful phrasing.  It does matter here whether, for =
example,
it was a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or a social worker who used the
phrase.  If it was used it is also important to know what else =
accompanied
the phrase as medication and treatment here focus more on the symptoms =
than
the person and the 'visions' you describe are symptoms that can and do
appear with a number of conditions.

It is unfortunate that non-professionals do tend to see labels like this =
as
referring to the person rather than symptoms of a condition a person is
suffering from but this is also a tendency professionals do not seem to =
have
taken a strong enough stance in clearing up.  I'm not at all casting =
blame
here, merely suggesting that some research into the issue might prove
worthwhile.

unfortunately most poets can (as can most people) be fitted with a major
psychiatric diagnosis, such as affective disorder or drug or alcohol =
abuse.
Many of us suffer.  Some carry on and some can be helped.  But it does =
seem
to be a part of the human condition that many people have pretty =
significant
problems.

I think the only harmful thing that can be done here is to prepetuate
uninformed stereotyping, particularlyin such statements like all poets =
are
schizophrenic or the ________ school was a bunch of druggies.  From my
perspective as both a practitioner and a sufferer neither the =
'dignosers' or
the 'anti-psychiatrits' was particularly helpful in helping individuals.

the disgnosis os schizophrenia is particularly pernicious as it also =
often
carries the connotation of 'thought-disordered' but even here it is =
helpful
to look at individuals who sometimes get confused in their thinking.  =
One of
the hallmarks of schizophrenics is that for the most part they are so
troubled by confused thinking that they are unable to function despite =
the
scare stories the media perpetrates.  Not only did Hannah function and
excel, but she was able to wrestle with the demons in her life and =
triumph.
Note that I purposefully emphasize demons in _life_ because visions
(hallucinatory or not, colored or not) ar in reality a method or way of
deling with life and it's demons and not the demons themselves.  The =
thing
that fascinates me about Hannah and others is that for her poetry was a =
way
of wrestling with life.

it is fairly common knowledge among clinicians who work with them and
clients in more lucid states to recognize that in fact everyone always =
hears
noise all the time.  some people ignore it and some people make the =
chaos
into voices and some people need the help of medication to keep the =
noise
from forming into words they don't like.  the same applies to vision.  =
this
might take some of the mystery and drama out of the topic here but also =
i
think is a humanizing perspective on the whole phenomena coming as it =
does
at the close of a Friday, the 13th.

Thanks for offering to edit my post!  I'm sure I need it.  I should have
said about Sexton, "most of her life as a poet" she articulated an envy of
Plath.  Perhaps socialite wasn't exactly the right word, but then, what is
when you're a relatively affluent suburban Bostonian who has the privilege
of attending private universities and expensive psychiatric institutes?
Socialite isn't it, sure, but then I didn't want to spend too much time
picking the "right" word.

Plath and Sexton both attended Lowell's poetry seminars at BU in 1959.
Please note that I never said anything about cause vs. correlation.  But we
can talk philosophy!  In such a case as Sexton's, the distinction between
cause and correlation is quite misleading, as something like this partakes
of both causation and correlation.  Kind of a vicious circle, but not even.
The distinction between causation and correlation is artificial and implies
a disjoint relationship between what the two terms represent.  What is
represented by correlation and causation in Sexton's illness seem to overlap
quite a bit.  I'd dare say any such distinction in Sexton's case is quite
misleading.

Sexton once confided to her friend and sponsor  Lois Ames that, "If only I
could get a scholarship to McLean."  For those of you who don't know this,
McLean is a famous psychiatric institute in the Boston area that's very
expensive and loaded with Ivy types.  She envied Lowell and Plath, who had
both been institutionalized at McLean.  Sexton wasn't able to get herself
into there, though it wasn't because of any lack of illness.  Sexton seems
to have had some sort of love-hate relationship with her mental illness, but
it seems to lean towards the love side, which, as I said, IS very dangerous.
As Ames said herself, "We both (Ames and Sexton) recognized that Sylvia
Plath and Robert Lowell had been there (McLean), and she wanted to be in
that lineage."  Sexton, however, managed to conduct a poetry seminar at
McLean in the mid 60s.

Sexton was finally admitted to McLean in 1973, with 9 credit cards in tow.
One of the cards was for the Hotel Algonquin.

Sexton was likely aware of Plath before they met.  they were both raised in
the well-to-do western suburbs around Boston.  they both went after the same
big awards, the same big publishers.  at one time they even got together
after one of lowell's seminars and discussed suicide.  Sexton: "She told the
story of her first suicide in sweet and loving detail."  After Plath's
suicide in 1963, Seton wrote this:

Thief!
how did you crawl into,
crawl down alone
into the death I wanted so badly and for so long.

There's a sort of glamour to the illness that I've heard from many people,
one that I see as dangerous.  It is perhaps as causative as it is
correlated.  As you say, it's "tricky".  But it's more than "tricky"; one
can amplify his or her illness by embracing the illness.  Sexton learned to
write poetry on the advice of her shrink.  She learned to use her illness to
feed her confessional writing, and in turn the ambition to be a better
writer fed the illness.  Sexton's image of Plath and Lowell were both
integral parts of that cycle. Perhaps it's brave, perhaps it's dumb, but
clearly such a longing as Sexton's is dangerous.

I know this only too well; when I am hypomanic I am really productive but
when it starts going into full-blown mania I amaze even myself but then feel
the loosening of the plugs in the dam, so-to-speak.  I know not to go there;
else I'll be with Plath and Sexton in no time.  It might even be a
psychological explanation for why I loathe most confessional poetry; I avoid
it so as to protect myself.  I guess my poetics are somewhat confessional
but my poems are NOT.

(For references above, please see the _Atlantic Monthly_, "The Mad Poets
Society," July/August 2001, p.96-103.)

Her interest in the issues is quite interesting to me and relates I =
think to
what Fenton is saying, based on today's NYT BR: "The strength of poetry
depends on the weaknesses of poets...by embracing...humiliations and
failures, by refusing to calculate their way to success, these poets =
release
themselves to write in ways that speak to their readers, as they could =
never
do by putting on a conventional show of strength."

While easily dismissed by classification as conventional, academic, =
plebian,
etc. I see this as pointing more to questions about what the 'content' =
of
poetry could or should be.

which
surely was what Hannah viewed as a value for poetry.)

> Charles Bernstein

What I found interesting and challenging was the comment Charles =
Bernstein
threw in almost off-handedly (if you can email off-handedly) to the =
effect
that in part at least Hannah was riting to educate readers on the =
wonders of
the neurology of the mind.  I find myself trying to lead readers into =
and
through my 'quirky' ways of thought at times and this is not (so they =
tell
me) the result of any wiring difficulties.

Speaking of 'wiring difficulties' I would find it helpful in this and
related discussions if we could try and stick to common sense =
discriptions
of what is rather than jargon that has been picked up along the way.  =
There
are vast differences clinically among some of the terms thrown out here =
and
clinically precision is vital.  In my experience those with difficulties
tend to appreciate either precisely defined clinical explanations or =
common
sense everyday ones but tend to be bothered by half-learned jargon.  In =
the
same way reading jargon thrown out from a number of the many disciplines
which are involved here disconcerts me.  My guess, for example, is that =
the
"diagnosis" of HW as schizophrenic was made by someone who read an =
article
in _Discovery_ magazine about neuropsychoimmunology and the diagnosis =
was
made on lifestyle and a reading of her work.  If based on clinical notes =
or
reports one wonders if that material was accessed with her permission =
and
also who made the diagnosis.  Somebody who may have been in a position =
to
make a half-way accurate diagnosis, such as her doctor, psychiatrist, or
psychologist would have I would think been much more careful and =
accurate in
his or her definition of the condition as we are aware of the weird
wanderings a loose definition can take discussions (as is vident here).
'schizophrenia' is essentially an empty cipher and a code that can be
defined by each according to their needs.  Maybe that was a code word =
that
Hannah herself inserted for us?

It=E2?Ts possible that I=E2?Tm missing something in the argument, but =
I=E2?Tm not sure I
see why Barrett Watten believes that Hannah Weiner=E2?Ts work =
constitutes a kind
of special "axiological" challenge. After all, one could make a long =
list of
poets whose poetics are inseparable from acute forms of "mental =
illness,"
and
a nearly endless list of poets whose work is impacted, if not driven, by
less
"spectacular" versions of neurosis: In the first group, Smart, Clare, =
Blake,
Rimbaud, Baudelaire, George, Trakl, Artaud, Sexton, Plath, Roethke, =
Lowell,
Kaufman, arguably Spicer, and in the second group, Dickinson, Pound, =
Eliot,
Khlebnikov, Pessoa, Crane, Dylan Thomas, Michaux, Bishop, Celan, Ritsos,
Finlay, Olson, Duncan, Tanikawa Shuntaro, Wieners, Ginsberg, Eshleman, =
bp
Nichol, but I am pretty much drawing rapidly here, and one could go on =
and
on. If Weiner constitutes a "problem" in terms of aesthetic/poetic =
value,
why
don=E2?Tt these other poets, too?

Furthermore, and more broadly, perhaps, there possibly seems to be a bit =
of
"logocentrising", if that=E2?Ts a term, at work in this proposal of
schizophrenia
as some kind of special region beyond "normal" evaluative criteria. For
instance, if schizophrenia is a scientifically-explainable illness, and =
its
symptoms, at bottom, the result of chemical imbalances and neurological
misfirings, why should the poetry produced under its impacts pose any =
more
of
an "aesthetic-ontological problem" for "normal people" than any poetry
produced under the impact of brain chemistry-altering substances, which =
may
be half the poetry produced in the world since the Sumerians invented =
beer,
in fact. Take Spicer, for example. (And it can=E2?Tt really be said =
that, well,
you consume drugs and alcohol by choice, but mental illness is not a =
choice.
Again, take Spicer as example.)

I=E2?Tm posing these questions because the general topic is very =
interesting.
And
I thought Barrett Watten=E2?Ts posts on Weiner were insightful and =
actually
quite
moving. But I=E2?Tm still not sure I see the "problem=E2?T, as I=E2?Tve =
said. And not to
be overly negative, but  I think (and particularly in the sensitive area =
we
are dealing with) that we need to be careful that an artificial poetic
"problem" not be created under the force of the bigger hive-mind =
neurosis of
academic criticism. I=E2?Tm not saying that it is in this case, just =
that we
need
to be careful.


Barrett,
  I think you are right here when you say it's not a simple either/or
question as she was after all is said and done a person and a writer and
deserves the consideration of being seen as an individual rather than =
member
or non-member of a class of writers who wrote under the influence of
psychobiology since when you open this up on any basis other than
individually there is a vast number of influences of a chemical or
neurobiological nature that need be considered.  Hemmingway is a classic
example for me of someone who apparently needed at times he thought to =
have
a little so he could write (I could actually be wrong about this but the
reality here doesn't matter as the mythos is so strong).  It us, by the =
way,
quite common for 'schizophrenics' to self-medicate through using alcohol =
as
that reportedly makes the voices go away..

as I think through this thread I think what may have touched me off is a
tendency of some to want to put writers into a group or classify them.
While it might be helpful in studying poets or writing about them,
ultimately they are individuals and this goes beyond the groupings.

Sheila. Aways mad? No. But it may be that we more readily "forgive" a
"strong man" his madness or his rages: maybe somwhat that division, that
power "difference" is endemic, genetic even: maybe we are trapped in some
mad god's genetic dream. But maybe we can each think our way thropugh
thesethings whether we are male or female. Presumably we need each other. I
have two daughters and find them eminentoly sane and very forthright and
especially the youngest very independent people. "Women" can choose to be
victims of a power structure or choose to live, as men can or whoever.
Otherwise why have "freedom"? Have brain will think. Richard.

Miami is sexy vacant and intense
Miami presents Susan Graham lying in the sun
Miami is vacuous reaching out to the viewer
Miami runs with the answers of Susan Graham
Miami is nude and semi-nude and trembling
MIAMI! you're there beneath me, mouth wide open, ready for the
bad-dream turn-real! MIAMI! perfect-model Alan-flesh: "Yours, MIAMI!"
Alan thinks it is perfect MIAMI! charred Susan-red-flesh day
now, it's becoming
you, the violence of MIAMI!

It's becoming you. You're not there yet. You don't have to be. It's
seeping in. You wake up in the middle of the night; you've lost control
again, semen everywhere. You beg her to scratch your eyes out. You beg her
to cut your nipples, spread your legs so hard the skin rips, each half
becomes a hole. You beg her to piss in your mouth, "Please, drown me in
your excrement. Please, I want to be your toilet. I don't want to think or
see anything. I don't want to hear anything." You explain about the worm
Miami, the beast Miami, Miami-parasite. "It enters into your holes, eats
your skin from the inside out, smashes against the nerve endings of the
muscles where herpes hides, devours mitochondria and flagella. You have to
be careful of the water which is Miami water and burns your skin, chars
lines just where the scars will be." You beg God to kill every one in
every place in every world. "Dear God, kill everyone." "Dear God, kill
every human." You say to her, "Every bad thing is there." You beg her to
shit in your mouth. "I will not wash," you say, "I want the smell of your
shit on my face. I want to be close to you. I want to prove my love. And
your shit is sexy." You beg God to agree. Every night you go to sleep and
you think

miami is becoming you
miami is nude Susan Graham, her ass open above your waiting mouth
miami is the waters of the world
miami is drowning you

Dear Jeb Bush, you are a wonderful Governor and I hope to prove my love to
you.

Love, Susan Graham

Hi Dodie, Thanks so much for your thoughts and leads on Plath! My mind is
brought also to a book on V. Woolf I read last month by Brenda Silver,
called Virginia Woolf Icon. It's about the ways she's been framed in popular
culture, mostly since her death. Very intriguing, especially as there's a
whole section on this tshirt my mom had in the 70s that left a big mark on
my psyche. Virginia as the beautiful smart young thing, side view.

I admit that the paragraph below is rather beyond my editing ability.

Yes.

>>>Please note that I never said anything about cause vs. correlation.
But we can talk philosophy!  In such a case as Sexton's, the distinction
between cause and correlation is quite misleading, as something like
this partakes of both causation and correlation.  Kind of a vicious
circle, but not even. The distinction between causation and correlation
is artificial and implies a disjoint relationship between what the two
terms represent.  What is represented by correlation and causation in
Sexton's illness seem to overlap quite a bit.  I'd dare say any such
distinction in Sexton's case is quite misleading.<<<

<blink> Okay, you have proven me a doof, I guess, because I do not

>>> Sexton was finally admitted to McLean in 1973, with 9 credit cards

This I understand: this is reverse classism, and just kind of rude.
James Merrill was filthy dripping rich: was he *for that reason* a Sucky
Person and Poet? (Robert Lowell, William S. Burroughs, et alia of the well-born?)

>>>There's a sort of glamour to the illness that I've heard from many

Agreed.

Whose craziness is most politically (poetry-politically?) correct?

My point, if I have one, is only that it is quite possible to take issue
with Sexton's poetics (admit, don't go for her myself) and with the
moral consequences of that poetics, without arguing ad feminam. You
sound mad at her for being rich. That's understandable, but also kind of
pointless, neh? She dead. Let's be now.

Gwyn -

I see the credit cards as evidence of Sexton's mania, actually, not one of
privilege.  The Hotel Algonquin has its fair share of romantic literary
trappings, doesn't it?  So here in this image of her pocket full of credit
cards, "Hotel Algonquin" emblazoned on one of them, I see Sexton's mania
bound to a romanticism about literature.  Call this image a poet's
imagination, if you will.  Perhaps her credit cards were something of
privilege, but I was not suggesting that.  I meant only to point out that
her pursuit was/is a dangerous one.  I surely have no intention of proving
you a doof or any such nonsense!  In reading your posts I sincerely doubt
that's possible.  But, Gwyn, I beg you, please do not rush to judge what my
intent is, OK?  I don't mean to _argue_ class and I don't want to be dragged
there.  If we beat up on each other it will get neither of us anything but
animosity.  I might be bipolar but I'm not crazy.

You made a point to say that I was claiming her perception of Plath was a
cause of her illness.  You made the excellent point that she was writing
poetry before perhaps meeting Plath.  Agreed.  But, but but.  The "illness"
can be fed, can be nurtured.  Such illnesses have lives of their own.  So in
a way, her vision and very dark (and poetic) romanticism about Plath,
Plath's suicide, and their commonalities did indeed appear to feed her
demise.  Sexton's own benefactress made it a point to remark that Sexton
felt Plath was a competitor.  Sexton did not stabilize her cycles and even
did things a bit dangerous with her potentials.  In this sense sexton's
relationship with Plath is causative as much as it is correlative.

As far as reverse classism, you'd have to know from where I come in order to
diagnose that, right?  There's nothing wrong with being rich AND a poet,
_prima facie_.  Richness has its own politics, something I dare not touch
here.  Besides, poetry knows no class boundaries.  All I was saying is that
I think it is very dangerous to embrace and amplify one's own suicidal
tendencies.  For that I have criticized her, but perhaps I mean only use
that criticism to create my own myth to save my own life.  Does that make me
some sort of bad person?  But you're right, she's dead now.  Her poetics,
however, live and we all know how much we talk about dead people around
here.  If I say, "Sexton's bad for choosing to embrace her madness and want
more of it," (a gross simplification of what I was really saying) perhaps
this myth will save me, and save others.  Yes, this is life and death for
some of us.  Just for saying these words I may be "guilty" of the same
things Sexton is.  So be it.

>>I thought you would prefer that one's personal craziness status *not* be
the salient point? Whose craziness is most politically (poetry-politically?)
correct?<<

One's personal "craziness" is part of a process, but it is not everything.
I mean not to exclude personal factors from discussions of poetics, but I
also mean to keep make them from being the only thing (and that to me seems
implicit in a confessional poetics).  As far as politically correct
"craziness", I'm afraid I can't answer that.  It seems a silly question to
pursue, yes?

Here's what I originally wrote:

>>>Occasionally a poet realizes that being mentally ill might make them a
better poet, etc.  Anne Sexton spent her life in envy of fellow Boston
socialite Sylvia Plath.  Sexton even articulated her envy of Plath's
illness on several occasions.  Sexton eventually killed herself.  It's
obviously not an attractive path.<<<

Well, Sexton was a fashion model before her illness, alcoholism,
institutionalizations, and poetic achievements, so the term socialite quite
literally applies to at least part of her life, but you might fairly argue
that she cannot be typecast as such for her life's entirety, and I would
heartily agree.  You are right, "socialite" is perhaps the wrong word or
perhaps too reductive.  So let us forget "socialite" for a moment.  Sexton
was a complex and tragic human being.

Sexton's choice is indeed a salient example of how celebrating one's
life-threatening illness (not merely one's personal "craziness," which to me
sounds like mere idiosyncrasy) is dangerous.  You agree with me that it is.
You don't like my example.  So be it.  But please don't suspect that I don't
like her or am confused about the ambiguities of self and poetry and
"madness"; I merely don't want to repeat her fascination with madness as an
avenue to great literature.  Much of her writing is amazing and blessed with
powerful inspiration.  In many ways I feel a sort of kindred spirit with
her.  I know what's it's like to drink heavily and regularly, and I know too
well what it's like to be manic depressive and feel the upward and downward
surges, and I understand how those two behaviors relate to creative poetic
output.  I see myself in her shoes avoiding that vortex that she leaped
into; for her I feel only sorrow, even if I may never earn benefaction.  For
Sexton I feel pain and compassion.  Perhaps my big difference with her is
that I want to discourage anyone from embracing the surges.  Such a mental
commitment as Sexton's is not romantic.  It is scorched earth and heap of
limbs.

Best,
Patrick

Dodie etal.  My feelings about Plath are, on reading her again and keeping
as much biographical things "at bay" as much as possible, she is a
remarkable poet: one of America's greatest.Or one of the world's.  Easily a
greater poet than Hughes. A poet with an extraordinary native ability and
great energy in composition.
  I cant comment on her prose as when I read The Bell Jar I was rather
depressed myself. I dint like the "negative side of her...but that is no
objectie objection, just a response at the time. But certainly she and some
of te othe so called "confessionals" have been denigrated or inadvertently
"spoiled" by their  admirers. I like those writers as well as the less
"direct" poets. I see Berryman and Roethke as intermediate somwhat. Plath's
work has the craftmanship or  craftiness? of eg Dylan Thomas without the
tendency toward ovekill and or overkill or oversaturation in adjectives and
a drowning in sound..but any way Thomas is doing rather different things. My
thoughts. Ragards, Richard.

George, mum's the word of course. But I couldn't help singing this in
the shower, to the tune of "Oh Shenandoah":


 Oh Bromowitz, I long to hear you
 Steal away! to Starlite Diner
 Oh Bromowitz, I long to hear you
 Away, I'm bound away
 Cross the wide cecilia

 Oh Bromowitz, I love your daughter
 Away, you sweet shapeshifter
 It was for her I'd cross the water
 Away, I'm bound away
 Cross the wide cecilia

 Oh Bromowitz, when last I saw her
 Away, foggy diviner
 Oh Bromowitz, I did adore her
 Away, she's bound away
 Cross the wide cecilia

 Oh Bromowitz, you took a notion
 Away, my bonnie drifter
 To sail across the stormy ocean
 Away, you're bound away
 Cross the wide cecilia

 Oh Bromowitz, I'm bound to leave you
 Away, slippery contriver
 Oh Bromowitz, I'll not deceive you
 Away, I'm bound away

1) Jed Rasula, who in my estimation is one of the most "underrated" poets and
critics presently working, told me matter-of-factly a number of years ago at
the MLA convention in Washington D.C. that his magnificent and little-known
long poem "The Field and Garden of Circe" was largely dictated to him in
periodic bursts from some beyond-- the first lines, in fact, literally
appeared in front of him *as they were being written*, on a facing wall by
another hand. I had some correspondence with Rasula quite some time ago,
spoke to him on a few occassions, and have seen him speak very impressively
in a number of public venues: He is consummately "sane", as I'm sure others
can attest. How do his visions relate to the Wiener "problem"?

2) Fredric Jameson once (in)famously analyzed Bob Perelman's poem "China" as
an instance of "schizophrenic language"-- not in the sense of the poet
biologically exhibiting the condition, but in the sense of the poem enacting
the aphasic symptoms of an anonymous, irradiated postmodern condition. The
poem's "new sentence" proceedings, according to Jameson, are not merely
literary moves demonstrating a critical "mind in control of its language";
its non-syllogistic prosody is more deeply the "dictated" logic of late
capitalist cultural disfunction and illness. Though I realize that most on
this list long ago "dispensed" with  Jameson's argument, is it worth
entertaining the possibility in any way (and I believe Jeffrey Jullich was
beginning to push at this question, too) that the cordoning-off of "normal"
expressions of parataxis/ansyntaxis from "special-case diseased" ones is
itself a proto-symptom (taking the form, in this case, of a repression or
exclusion) that the ghost of Jameson's critique still haunts the unconscious
of Language/post-language poetries?

3) Was Lacan, who treated Artaud with electro-shock, saner than his patient?
Is a Borromean knot the expression of sane theory or of hysteria? Or does it
mark a conflation? Like all art of experiment and provocation is a
mutually-traced conflation?

Webarteroids (in progress) is a poetical transmogrification of the classic
computer game Asteroids. I'm developing it with the folks on the webartery
mail list--that list is devoted to discussion of poetics of
web.art/net.wurk/net.art what have you, for the uninstantiated.

You use the Space key to blast the texts (and the head, in the second URL),
the 'A' and 'S' keys to move forward and back, and the 'K' and 'L' keys to
turn.

As I said, it's very much in progress still, not finished. But it has some
interesting possibilities already, as you might observe, textually,
narratively, vispoetically, philosophically, constructively, destructively,
interactively, and so on.

I came across some freeware Lingo (the programming language associated with
Macromedia Director, which produces Shockwave output for the Web) code by
Ian Clay and Wolff Olins on the Net, and thought I'd check it out. The code
was actually quite simple and minimal in its extent and nature, just right
for wide-ranging adaptation. It wasn't a full game of Asteroids, just the
essentials. No comments in it, but it wasn't hard to figure out, very
cleanly written. Maybe three pages of code, maybe not that long.

I liked the simple quality of the code, and it ran fairly smoothly on my
Pentium II 400MHz machine, which is probably very average these days in its
speed.

I was curious about the literary/poetical poetential of such code. As are
many of the good folks on webartery. So we're going to take this as far as
we can. If you want to participate, you can check out the discussion of the
project (and computer games/poetry more generally) on the webartery list at
http://onelist.com/group/webartery/messages (usually the subject has
'webarteroids' in it) and join the list from there. You might want to
backchannel me to at jim@vispo.com, if you do so, and tell me who you are. I
co-moderate the list with Mez.

The more I get into the code, the more I realize that Asteroids is really
quite a clever, minimalistic engineering design that maxs the communication
between onscreen objects (and interactively) while minimizing the
computational overhead. I've been interested for some time in the notion of
onscreen literary objects with their own behaviors...

Eugene Brooks was Allen Ginsberg's older brother. Allen once told me that
Eugene was the best poet in the family.

I found this in the Washington Post website.  Many of these clich=E9s =
are
applicable to poetry as well: =20


"The following is a list of 50 truisms, half-truths, blatant lies and
childish wishes, fundamental to the way we think about art, and none of =
them
very useful.

1. Art is a universal language.

2. It captures the eternal human spirit.

3. It brings us closer to our fellow man.

4. It makes us better people.

5. It is timeless.

6. It expresses the inexpressible.

7. It is our secular religion.

8. It makes us human.

9. It heals.

10. We can't live without it.

11. Art is the greatest creation of society.

12. Genius requires suffering.

13. Only people who make a living from art are artists; unless they are
geniuses, in which case they suffer (see No. 12).

14. Geniuses get "paid" after they die, when they are discovered and =
loved
posthumously.

15. Art makes artists immortal.

16. Happy artists make uplifting art; unhappy artists make depressing =
art.

17. Except for comic artists, who are unhappy but mask their true =
feelings.

18. Artists are prophets.

19. Art falls into distinct periods, generally corresponding to the
centuries.

20. If an artist's work doesn't represent his period, he's either a =
rebel
(genius) or a conformist (hack).

21. Young artists struggle until they find their voice.

22. An artist's voice first appears in his/her "masterwork."

23. Art is constructed in layers; the "deeper" layers matter the most.

24. Art isn't about ordinary things; art transforms the ordinary.

25. To make great art, artists must separate themselves from the world.

26. But artists also hang out together in glamorous social circles.

27. Artists make art to get sex; or they sublimate sexual thoughts into =
art.

28. Artists have particularly large libidos.

29. Artists are too busy with their art to care about politics.

30. Artists who care about politics are either (a) rebels (geniuses) or =
(b)
propagandists (hacks).

31. Art transports us.

32. But art also centers us in the world.

33. Nature can make "art" too.

34. Art and craft are the same thing (both express the eternal human =
spirit;
see No. 2).

35. The important thing in art is self-expression (compare No. 1).

36. Young artists make turbulent art; old artists make serene art.

37. European artists are generally "young" (they make turbulent art).

38. Asian artists are generally "old" (they make serene art).

39. African artists make "primitive" art.

40. Primitive art helps rejuvenate decadent (European) art.

41. Collecting primitive art is a kind of apology for colonialism.

42. Violence in art offers us a cathartic release; but violent art =
makes us
violent.

43. Misuse of metaphor helps "explain" art (luminous music, harmonic =
colors,
etc.).

44. Ambiguity in art is profound.

45. Anyone can make art (because we all have a little "genius" in us).

46. My kid could do that (because art is a fraud).

47. Art transcends class barriers.

48. Critics don't "get" art; but "critically acclaimed" art is a good
investment.

49. Art exposes the collective unconscious.

50. By studying "top 50" lists you can learn the general drift of =
culture.

Hello all,

Might anyone be able and willing to help me locate the following? If
so, please backchannel (scope@ucsd.edu). Thanks...


1. A (presumably short) Octavio Paz poem in the translation of which
might be found the words "wounds" and "effulgent," and that turns on
the word "But" (???)

2. The place (article, essay, review, introduction, whatever) where
May Swenson writes of Charles Reznikoff?



Thanks again,

I realized after sending off my post about madness and poetry that I should
have added something important: In speaking of Jed Rasula's comments to me
about the first lines of "The Field and Garden of Circe" literally appearing
in front of him, I failed to say that I immediately asked him if this
"vision" took place in a drug-induced state. His answer was No, and that,
further, he knew it had nothing to do with any kind of drug "flashback".

This seems important to add to my comments on Rasula and the question posed
about Wiener that followed.

NEW PUBLICATIONS FROM GREEN INTEGER
________________________________________

Dear Friends,

Green Integer Announces four more new publications. We will sell each =
book at a 20% discount to those
on this e-mail list.

Displeasures of the Table: memoir as caricature by Martha Ronk  =
Paperback $9.95
Poet Martha Ronk notes that it is not so much that she finds food =
displeasurable, but that she finds the sitting at the table unpleasant. =
Food, moreover, is associated with roles that many woman question. =
Accordingly, the very process of writing about    it becomes a sort of =
dialogue between society and between eating and reading, "a wrestling =
with dough or syntax, being at the table or under it." Ronk's =
startlingly fresh and often comic wrestling with food is a remarkable =
tour de force as she takes the reader through lemons, frozen hotdogs, =
organges, raw eggs, artichokes, basil, red pepper strips, snails, rice, =
tortillas, milktoast, cottage cheese, and many other producs of the =
kitchen.

The Pretext by Rae Armantrout   Paperback $9.95
Linked by some critics to the Objectivist tradition, particularly to the =
poet George Oppen, Rae Armantrout began her writing as a poet closely =
involved with members of the San Francisco "Language" writers. Her work =
indeed incorporates elements of a close observation of the world around =
her and a witty play of linguistic and syntactical elements, but her =
writing is of its own. As Elaine Equi has written of Armantrout's =
Necromance, "[She] makes you believe that there is still such a thing as =
orginality."

Across the Darkness of the River by Hsi Muren. Translated from the =
Chinese by Chang Shu-li    Paperback $9.95
Poet, painter, and essayist Hsi Muren is perhaps the most widely read =
woman poet in Taiwan. Ever since her first two collections of poetry, =
Seven Miles of Fragrance (1981) and Youth of No Regret (1983), she has =
attracted readers for her themes of undying love and a melancholic sense =
of the lost past. As a poet of Mongolian descent, moreover, Hsi presents =
in her poetry a diasporic nostalgia for a lost world from a perspective =
that is imaginary but insistently poignant. As translator Chang Shu-li =
writes, "Using Mongol as a sign for an inaccessible past gives her poems =
of nostalgia an extra urgency, with her stress fallilng less on the =
remembrance of tihngs past than on the resistance to forgetting. It is =
perhaps this iimplicit tension between sentimental nostalgia and =
diasporic nostalgia that makes her poems on Mongol appealing to readers =
similarly forced to the diasporic situation by the political conflicts =
between Taiwan and China." Collected here for the first time in English, =
Hsi's poems speak profundly of an awkward poise between the anxiety of =
remembering and the need to forget. This volume is the fourth in Green =
Integer's Taiwanese Modern Literature Series, edited by Dominic Cheung.

Suites by Federico Garcia Lorca. Translated from the Spanish by Jerome =
Rotheberg.   Paperback $12.95
Born iln Fuentevaqueros, Granada in 1898, Federico Garcia Lorca was one =
of the great Spanish poets and playwrights of the 20th century. He was =
murdered by Franco's soldiers in 1936. Suites is jone of the most =
charming and melodious of all Garcia Lorca's poem series. Written early =
in his career, most of these poems remained unpublished during his =
lifetime and were later reassemble from notebooks. The first appearance =
of this work as a small selection in English in a Sun & Moon Press =
chapbook, and in Collected Poems of 1988; but the current edition of =
Selected Verse contains only a fraction of this important series. This =
is the first complete single-volume edition of this great work.


We also remind you of our other recently published titles:

Suicide Circus: Selected Poems by Alexei Kruchenykh. Translated from the =
Russian by Jack Hirschmann, Alexander Kohav, and
Venymin Tseytlin, with an Introduction by Jack Hirschmann and a Preface =
and Notes by Guy Bennett   Paperback $12.95

Antilyrik and Other Poems by Vitezslav Nezval. Translated from the Czech =
by Jerome Rothenberg and Milos Sovak.  Paperback $10.95

A Wanderer Plays on Muted Strings by Knut Hamsun. Translated from the =
Norwegian by Oliver and Gunnvor Stallybrass.  Paperback $10.95

Pedra Canga by Tereza Albues. Translated from the Portuguese by Clifford =
E. Landers.   Paperback $12.95

To Do: A Book of Alphabets and Birthdays by Gertrude Stein.   Paperback =
$9.95

Aur=E9lia by Gerard de Nerval. Translated from the French by Monique =
DiDonna.  Paperback $11.95

Launch of Ogress Oblige
New Poems by Dorothy Trujillo Lusk
Published by Krupskaya Books

Dorothy Trujillo Lusk is a Vancouver-based public historian and hostage
negotiator. Her previous books include Oral Tragedy (Tsunami Editions 1988),
Redactive (Talonbooks 1990, pulped 1995), Volume Delays (Sprang Texts 1995)
and Sleek Vinyl Drill (Thuja Books 2000).

"'Mam I shrieked there is not any problem.' Shriek, slink, creep, thud: in
Ogress Oblige, the 'I' Lusk's verbs violently drag after themselves becomes
party to an all-out assault on the poetry of 'Tepid Phenomena.' 'I can't see
the figures for the desecration.' Dorothy Trujillo Lusk is an evil genius
presiding over 'the serene disemboweling of finer poetics.'" -- Sianne Ngai

"Trujillo Lusk's monstrous and witty verbal assault on history and society
uses as pivots the various stigmata of single-parenthood, poverty, and
institutional negotiation, all the while chanelling every strand of
modernism and modernity through a mind that refused the indignity of
high-school graduation. Read it and sweep.  The spines of these poems seem
each to possess an extra, mutant vertebra that breaks loose from lyric's
ghostly theremin to become an unruly daughter
shooting darts from harp strings. Careful, you could lose an eye. You could
be a bull's-eyed target, you schmuck.
Oi vas wivetted." -- Kevin Davies


From Ogress Oblige:


Will you withhold electrolytes, moisture, enclampment

Jumping in, I must agree, for the most part.  But Hughes' Crow is on a par, I

poets.  Best, Bill

Often when I read Hannah I feel jealous at the musical, poetic,
uncensoredness of her line, achieved in part but including the censor in the
work.  (Alice Notley is the other writer who gets my envy here.) In the
context of this discussion of mental illness it may seem odd that I am
jealous but I am thinking about (I think often about) the choices one makes
to best insure her art, to continue making it in the world despite the
world.  For Hannah it may have revolved around visions vs meds. (And I am
not reducing the experience of schizophrenia to this.) But we all make
them—more or less _limiting_ depending on our societal position of power and
available resources--and they are usually drastic, for example, getting a
PhD and moving to Oklahoma.

Pardon my ignorance--Jeffrey and Barrett, could you talk more about Desiring
Machines?  I may have missed the earlier references.

here.   >>

Allow me to do the touching.  While I certainly agree that one's dollar
amount does not ensure talent, or a membership in the temple of literature,
it certainly helps with the latter.  Note the number of acclaimed 20th
century poets  who have gone to the better schools.  Not all of them were
rich, perhaps most of them were not.  But the institutions were, and are.  It
is no surprise that literary types with clout would gather there, that the
literary network would function best there, that politics (conservative and
liberal--including the politics of poetry) would be defined there, that the
majority of the famous in every field just so happen to have earned degrees
there, that those who do not hold degrees from Harvard, Yale, Columbia, U of
Penn, Princeton, Berekley, U of Chicago, Duke, Vanderbilt, Tulane, Emory, et
al have a more difficult time for not attending there.  I'm embarrassed to
admit that as a graduate of the least of the universities mentioned, that
degree helped put me ahead of over three hundred applicants for the position
I now hold.  There was plenty of Harvard action among the poets of the New
York School.  Even those renegade Beats owe quite a lot of their success to
their affiliation with Columbia, and the hot shots they pissed off there.
After all, they did not piss off some guy on the street.  They pissed off
famous people whom they were able to meet only through the institution.  I
doubt that William Carlos Williams would have paid any attention to Ginsberg
at all had the latter not boasted Columbia credits, the latter's father
notwithstanding.  If one is selected by the Yale Series of Young(er) Poets,
one is immediately somebody.  Win an award at City College and you'd better
not give up your hot dog stand.  Classism?  Of course.  The West is
constructed upon it.  Knowing the right people, going to the right
schools--these things are no guarantee of success, but they provide a clear
advantage.  Some argue that such things have no bearing on the quality of the
poetry.  That may be true.  But they certainly influence which  poetry is
mass marketed, and which poetry sits in one's desk, or on one's web site.  In
that way they direct tastes, and taste has much to do with the assessment of
quality.  But I'm hardly complaining.  That's the way it is, and perhaps must
be.  Hierarchies have a way of forming despite good intentions, whether they
involve "private" institutions or Socialist sanctions.  The alternative may
be chaos, which kinda sounds good to me, in theory if not in practice.
Sexton might have been troubled, but she wasn't blind.  Best, Bill

pretty fun  well, I was never any good at asteroids

I don't mean to jump on your post here but it is convenient as it
illustrates I think what happens when literary and semi-popular critics
(Jameson included) dabble in diagnoses in relation to either individuals or
cultural currents.  This has always been true and probably always will be.

Subject: Some questions on poetic madness


He is consummately "sane", as I'm sure others
> can attest. How do his visions relate to the Wiener "problem"?
>

suddenly we are talking about sanity, poetic madness and the "Weiner
"problem""  I do note that you put 'problem' in quotes and now it's in
double-quotes, but it is still there.   In mentioning Rasula you do bring up
the issue of whether or not these visions are in fact related to the sanity
of the recepiant.  In my experience we all see and hear things all the time
and the question is what we make of this chaos (does it become a message?)
and whether we obey what the voices say.  It is actually these two brain
locations that the psychotropics hit on.

The general content of messages on the list here has been remarkably above
the usual sidetracks and indirections and I, for one, think it might be
interesting to discuss:

1] Does facing "illness" poetically differ qualitatively or quantiatively
from facing "life"? see Fenton here.  I think it does but for me this is
more a therapeutic issue than a poetic one.
I think this is something Patrick touched on here: "".  But it's more than
"tricky"; one can amplify his or her illness by embracing the illness.
Sexton learned to write poetry on the advice of her shrink.  She learned to
use her illness to feed her confessional writing, and in turn the ambition
to be a better writer fed the illness."

2] Is there a qualitative difference in poetic research condusted under the
influence of induced substances (air, water, and pollen might also be
includeed?) or internal influences (either biochemical or structural)?

3] What is the effect on the reader (or viewer or auditor) of 'crazy-making'
poetry?  Do they like it, notice it, etc.?  I include here all the trends in
the last century in addition to Hannah's comment to Charles Bernstein which
is lost somewhere at the moment in my pile of emails.

Muffy,
      This is an interesting theory but the article itself leads me in a
couple of directions that I'm not comfortable with:

1.  The diagnostic presentation may well indicate that her doctor may have
been giving her the wrong chemical (there are newer anti-depressants I think
and there are also medications specifically for symptoms of PMS, etc.) but
I'm not sure what relation this has to her work.  The overall impression I
got from the article was of SP's work as that of a victim of these forces.
I would much rather read her work as done as part of her struggle with these
chemical and social forces, part of her struggle with life, even though she
ultimately lost.  Perhaps this is the romantic in me?

2.  PMDD does have a somewhat checkered history as a diagnosis when used
beyond severe cases.  It is one of those that may have been in some ways
promoted by advertising agencies for drug companies seeking big TV markets
for particular ways of packaging and selling a specific anti-depressant and
bypassing the doctor/patient relationship.  I don't really want to get drawn
into this whole issue, but only bring it up here only to point out that the
DSM is basically a compilation of symptom clusters used for comunication
between doctors and insurance companies.  Good doctors (in my opinion) are
those who treat individual patients despite or in conjunction with what the
'manual', the FDA, and drug company TV ads say.

sorry to rain on everyone's parade but almost all imported apparel is made
in sweatshops, I worked in Bolivia for an NGO  when I got out of college and
I went to visit a woman I knew at a sewing plant she could not get up
because her wrist was chained to the sewing machine she got two bathroom
breaks a day (12 hour day) and the rest of the day she spent sewing. Also,
you know those pigment dyed sweatshirts (they look like colored chalk)
everyone likes from LL Bean? That effect is achieved by using children
walking in vats of dye.

What the Protesters in Genoa Want

By MICHAEL HARDT and ANTONIO NEGRI

Genoa, that Renaissance city known for both openness and shrewd
political sophistication, is in crisis this weekend. It should have
thrown its gates wide for the celebration of this summit of the
world's most powerful leaders. But instead Genoa has been transformed
into a medieval fortress of barricades with high-tech controls. The
ruling ideology about the present form of globalization is that there
is no alternative. And strangely, this restricts both the rulers and
the ruled.

Leaders of the Group of Eight have no choice but to attempt a show of
political sophistication. They try to appear charitable and
transparent in their goals.  They promise to aid the world's poor and
they genuflect to Pope John Paul II and his interests. But the real
agenda is to renegotiate relations among the powerful, on issues such
as the construction of missile defense systems.

The leaders, however, seem detached somehow from the transformations
around them, as though they are following the stage directions from a
dated play. We can see the photo already, though it has not yet been
taken: President George W. Bush as an unlikely king, bolstered by
lesser monarchs. This is not quite an image of the future. It
resembles more an archival photo, pre-1914, of superannuated royal
potentates.

Those demonstrating against the summit in Genoa, however, are not
distracted by these old-fashioned symbols of power. They know that a
fundamentally new global system is being formed. It can no longer be
understood in terms of British, French, Russian or even American
imperialism.

The many protests that have led up to Genoa were based on the
recognition that no national power is in control of the present global
order. Consequently protests must be directed at international and
supranational organizations, such as the G-8, the World Trade
Organization, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The
movements are not anti-American, as they often appear, but aimed at a
different, larger power structure.

If it is not national but supranational powers that rule today's
globalization, however, we must recognize that this new order has no
democratic institutional mechanisms for representation, as
nation-states do: no elections, no public forum for debate.

The rulers are effectively blind and deaf to the ruled. The protesters
take to the streets because this is the form of expression available
to them. The lack of other venues and social mechanisms is not their
creation.

Antiglobalization is not an adequate characterization of the
protesters in Genoa (or G=F6teborg, Quebec, Prague, or Seattle). The
globalization debate will remain hopelessly confused, in fact, unless
we insist on qualifying the term globalization. The protesters are
indeed united against the present form of capitalist globalization,
but the vast majority of them are not against globalizing currents and
forces as such; they are not isolationist, separatist or even
nationalist.

The protests themselves have become global movements and one of their
clearest objectives is for the democratization of globalizing
processes. It should not be called an antiglobalization movement. It
is pro-globalization, or rather an alternative globalization movement
-- one that seeks to eliminate inequalities between rich and poor and
between the powerful and the powerless, and to expand the
possibilities of self-determination.

If we understand one thing from the multitude of voices in Genoa this
weekend, it should be that a different and better future is possible.
When one recognizes the tremendous power of the international and
supranational forces that support our present form of globalization,
one could conclude that resistance is futile.

But those in the streets today are foolish enough to believe that
alternatives are possible -- that "inevitability" should not be the
last word in politics. A new species of political activist has been
born with a spirit that is reminiscent of the paradoxical idealism of
the 1960's -- the realistic course of action today is to demand what
is seemingly impossible, that is, something new.

Protest movements are an integral part of a democratic society and,
for this reason alone, we should all thank those in the streets in
Genoa, whether we agree with them or not. Protest movements, however,
do not provide a practical blueprint for how to solve problems, and we
should not expect that of them.  They seek rather to transform the
public agenda by creating political desires for a better future.

We see seeds of that future already in the sea of faces that stretches
from the streets of Seattle to those of Genoa. One of the most
remarkable characteristics of these movements is their diversity:
trade unionists together with ecologists together with priests and
communists. We are beginning to see emerge a multitude that is not
defined by any single identity, but can discover commonality in its
multiplicity.

These movements are what link Genoa this weekend most clearly to the
openness -- toward new kinds of exchange and new ideas -- of its
Renaissance past.

In a couple of posts I've typed "Wiener" instead of Weiner.

I meant Hannah Weiner, and not John Wieners.

Strange that the two great postmodern poets of "madness" should have such
closely bonded names.

"A Poem for Trapped Things," by Wieners, which I take recounts his experience
of institutionalization, ends so beautifully (or does it signify terror?
These things get complicated):

My only objection to "experiment" is that it implies a commitment to one
horn of a metaphysical dilemma, and I prefer poetry without such
commitments.  The dilemma is, does what we sense come from the outside or
the inside?

Novelist Richard Powers writes:


"...the belief in transformation and advancement, in a constantly increasing
control over the material world, is still just a symptom of a wider
conceptual revolution that lies at the heart of what has happened to the
world in these last 1,000 years: the rise of the experimental method.

Say, then, that the most important idea of this millennium was set in motion
by a man named Abu Ali al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, born around the year 965 in
Basra, in what is now Iraq. Even by his Western name, Alhazen, he remains a
little-known figure in the history of thought. But the idea that Ibn
al-Haytham championed is so ingrained in us that we don't even think of it
as an innovation, let alone one that has appeared so late in the human day.

Ibn al-Haytham resolved a scientific dispute that had remained deadlocked
for more than 800 years. Two inimical theories vied to explain the mystery
of vision. Euclid, Ptolemy and other mathematicians demonstrated that light
necessarily traveled from the eye to the observed object. Aristotle and the
atomists assumed the reverse. Both theories were complete and internally
consistent, with no way to arbitrate between them.  [Patrick's note:
perhaps poetry CAN arbitrate between them?]

Then Ibn al-Haytham made several remarkable observations. His most
remarkable was also the simplest. He invited observers to stare at the sun,
which proved the point: when you looked at a sufficiently bright object, it
burned the eye. He made no appeal to geometry or theoretical necessity.
Instead, he demolished a whole mountain of systematic theory with a single
appeal to data. Light started outside the eye and reflected into it. No
other explanation was consistent with the evidence.

Ptolemy had appealed to math and reason; Aristotle's position had been mere
conjecture. The world, however, answered to neither reason nor conjecture.
What argument required was something more than theory, something that would
hold up in the court of controlled looking. This empirical insistence lay at
the heart of Ibn al-Haytham's real revolution, and while he did not upend
the world single-handedly, his influence has spread without limits."
(from http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/millennium/m1/powers.html)


For Powers, al-Hayatham resolved the age-old debate.  For me, the source of
light cannot be assumed to be either external or internal.  The pain does
not deny the existence of an internal "light".  Powers and al-Haytham can
think their issue is resolved, perhaps because they could show light coming
from outside and into the eye.  But perhaps the idea of light coming from
within has a completely different & perhaps more spiritual sense.
Experiment is the commitment to the notion of the objective observer, and it
is not one I am willing to take.  I never understood it was the poet's role
to provide answers to philosophical and scientific dilemmas (or n- lemmas).

Now, I'm not saying a poet cannot be a scientist or cannot explore science
even in poetry.  I'm just sharing my prejudice about the term "experiment,"
and sharing what I perceive as the severe poetic limitations implied by that
term.  For you, it may be expansive.  For me, much of the poetry's in the
question, not in the commitment to either direction.  I do abandon that to
scientists and the clergy.

Ahh, such is perception.

Thanks for the thoughtful post, tom.

Best,
Patrick

PS:  Science Philosopher Paul Feyerabend recommended that nation-states
separate state and science just as religion and state have been separated by
force of law.  For me, this seems to make sense.  I tend to lump poetry with
philosophy, music, painting, sculpting, storytelling, and all other
enterprises where the work is not in answering questions for people but
instead in giving people something to think or ask or feel or inhabit.  I
don't want to provide folks with answers about what they should have faith
in.  I leave that to scientists and clergymen.

                    Creative Arts Café Poetry Series
                        Marj Hahne and OPEN MIKE

 Mt. Kisco, NY: Monday July 23rd  at 7:30 PM, The Creative Arts Café
Poetry Series at Northern Westchester Center for the Arts celebrates
summer with Poet and educator Marj Hahne will read selections of her
work.  A reception and open mike follows the  reading.

Marj Hahne is a poet and an educator. Recently transplanted from
Philadelphia to New York City, she teaches poetry workshops to children
and adults at schools, museums, bookstores, and conferences. She is a
regular at the Cornelius Street Café in NYC.  Her reading of her poem
for Ellis Paul at NWCA’s Ellis Paul concert in February at NWCA was a
terrific crowd pleaser among people who were not the usual poetry fans.
Sharon Olds best expresses for Marj why she writes and teaches poetry
and why she shares what she writes:  "To the poet, the human community
is like the community of birds to a bird, singing to each other. Love is
one of the reasons we are singing to one another, love of language
itself, love of sound, love of singing itself, and love of the other
birds."  Marj wants to (re)awaken people to the restorative power of
words, that is, to poetry as another mode of artistic expression that
can embolden people toward real self-empowerment and ultimately toward a
collective healing.

The series is made possible by grants from the New York State Council on
the Arts and the Bydale Foundation.

There is a suggested donation of $7.00; $5.00 for seniors and students.
Coffee, cake and refreshments are included.

The Creative Arts Cafe is located in the gallery of Northern Westchester
Center for the Arts, 272 North Bedford Road, Mt. Kisco, on Rte 117, near
Staples. For further information, call Cindy Beer-Fouhy, Director of
Literary Arts at NWCA, 241 6922. For directions log onto:

>>2.  OK Aldon -- how about a Mass Anti-Reading on the Library of Congress
Steps ?

Now that sounds like a good idea -- I remember a read-in on the LOC steps back in the 80s in opposition to the Reaganauts' plans to curtail the public hours of our public library -- This could be both more fun and more useful in the long run -- a good antidote to the occasional self-congratulatory mass gatherings of past Consultants/Laureates that go on inside -- Somebody in D.C. want to start organizing an anti-reading?????

There are some curious grammatical constructions in today's media coverage
of the G8 events. Check out this one, from a BBC news article: "The violence
in Genoa on Friday left one protester dead and another seriously injured."
Is there a technical name from grammar, rhetoric or an affiliated study for
this type of substitution--from a specific material agent/subject ("the
police") to a general process(?) ("the violence")?

The BBC article is on-line at:

A photo sequence of the killing (apparently, of a man named Carlo Giuliani)
is at: http://www.elpais.es/fotografia/especiales/secuencia/1.html

Also, this article in today's New York Times. How did it come to be that the
concept of "anti-globalization" was substituted for "anti-capitalism"? A few
minutes ago G.W. Bush stated in a broadcast that he disagrees with the
"isolationism" and "protectionism" of the anti-G8 activists. Who is he
talking about?

What the Protesters in Genoa Want
by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri=20
 =20
Genoa, that Renaissance city known for both openness and shrewd political
sophistication, is in crisis this weekend. It should have thrown its gates
wide for the celebration of this summit of the world's most powerful
leaders. But instead Genoa has been transformed into a medieval fortress of
barricades with high-tech controls. The ruling ideology about the present
form of globalization is that there is no alternative. And strangely, this
restricts both the rulers and the ruled.=20

Leaders of the Group of Eight have no choice but to attempt a show of
political sophistication. They try to appear charitable and transparent in
their goals. They promise to aid the world's poor and they genuflect to Pope
John Paul II and his interests. But the real agenda is to renegotiate
relations among the powerful, on issues such as the construction of missile
defense systems.

The leaders, however, seem detached somehow from the transformations around
them, as though they are following the stage directions from a dated play.
We can see the photo already, though it has not yet been taken: President
George W. Bush as an unlikely king, bolstered by lesser monarchs. This is
not quite an image of the future. It resembles more an archival photo,
pre-1914, of superannuated royal potentates.

Those demonstrating against the summit in Genoa, however, are not distracted
by these old-fashioned symbols of power. They know that a fundamentally new
global system is being formed. It can no longer be understood in terms of
British, French, Russian or even American imperialism.

The many protests that have led up to Genoa were based on the recognition
that no national power is in control of the present global order.
Consequently protests must be directed at international and supranational
organizations, such as the G-8, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund. The movements are not anti-American, as
they often appear, but aimed at a different, larger power structure.

If it is not national but supranational powers that rule today's
globalization, however, we must recognize that this new order has no
democratic institutional mechanisms for representation, as nation-states do:
no elections, no public forum for debate.

The rulers are effectively blind and deaf to the ruled. The protesters take
to the streets because this is the form of expression available to them. The
lack of other venues and social mechanisms is not their creation.

Antiglobalization is not an adequate characterization of the protesters in
Genoa (or G=F6teborg, Quebec, Prague, or Seattle). The globalization debate
will remain hopelessly confused, in fact, unless we insist on qualifying the
term globalization. The protesters are indeed united against the present
form of capitalist globalization, but the vast majority of them are not
against globalizing currents and forces as such; they are not isolationist,
separatist or even nationalist.

The protests themselves have become global movements and one of their
clearest objectives is for the democratization of globalizing processes. It
should not be called an antiglobalization movement. It is pro-globalization,
or rather an alternative globalization movement =97 one that seeks to
eliminate inequalities between rich and poor and between the powerful and
the powerless, and to expand the possibilities of self-determination.

If we understand one thing from the multitude of voices in Genoa this
weekend, it should be that a different and better future is possible. When
one recognizes the tremendous power of the international and supranational
forces that support our present form of globalization, one could conclude
that resistance is futile.

But those in the streets today are foolish enough to believe that
alternatives are possible =97 that "inevitability" should not be the last=
 word
in politics. A new species of political activist has been born with a spirit
that is reminiscent of the paradoxical idealism of the 1960's =97 the
realistic course of action today is to demand what is seemingly impossible,
that is, something new.

Protest movements are an integral part of a democratic society and, for this
reason alone, we should all thank those in the streets in Genoa, whether we
agree with them or not. Protest movements, however, do not provide a
practical blueprint for how to solve problems, and we should not expect that
of them. They seek rather to transform the public agenda by creating
political desires for a better future.

We see seeds of that future already in the sea of faces that stretches from
the streets of Seattle to those of Genoa. One of the most remarkable
characteristics of these movements is their diversity: trade unionists
together with ecologists together with priests and communists. We are
beginning to see emerge a multitude that is not defined by any single
identity, but can discover commonality in its multiplicity.

These movements are what link Genoa this weekend most clearly to the
openness =97 toward new kinds of exchange and new ideas =97 of its=
 Renaissance past.

Idiot?

The dog was expensive.
They had to have him.

                A leg here,

I'm an *ummm*, a fullish,

Just like the world,

My Job Before Being A Janitor

The fast food deli.
I worked with Hermoine

Hermoine ate pie.
Duane weighed less
than thirty-five pounds.
They were going to make me
manager--
the owners.
Told me what
a good
sound
business
making
sandwiches was--
offered to sell me
the whole fucking
chain.
But I had to learn
everything in a day,
wear a yellow shirt,
a muscle-bound hoagie
scorched across it,
and a yellow visor,
my ears sticking out
handles on a jug.

So
I worked for four hours,
squirting oil
and vinegar on white bread.

Around noon I quit,

Then I became a janitor.

The rest,
I believe,
is history.

Bart Plantenga, living in the free republic of Amsterdam, puts out regular
lists and comments on CD's, and especially spoken word CD's, which he also
broadcasts (or not) on one of his several radio programs.

The format takes some getting used to, but for those interested, it's
always a rewarding experience.


SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: 300+ emails suddenly dropped off my playlist
list - BUT WHEN? - and so I am resending you the last 2 playlists.
Let me know when you received the last WRECK playlist AND if you want
any of the back ones. Or if you want off this list.

[a] "La radia shall be the delimitation and geometric construction of
silence." - F.T. Marinetti
Quoted in Radiotext[e], a 1994 anthology of radio writings and
perhaps the single best anthology about radio. Also includes a
Document of the early days of WRECK THIS MESS [Autonomedia]
<http://www.autonomedia.org/> edited by Dave Mandl & Neil Strauss.
Includes essays by Brecht, Orwell, Weill, Schwitters, Walter
Benjamin, Guattari, Joseph Lanza, Hakim Bey, Geert Lovink, La Monte
Young, Trotsky, Schoenberg, Abbie Hoffman, Negativland, Upton
Sinclair, and others...

[1] "Hooker 'n' Heat" double CD on Liberty. Reissued from 1970. This
is truly one of those great discs where master meets acolytes and
forces the acolytes to perform beyond their wildest dreams. It
doesn't feel like an obsequious star-fuck and it doesn't creak along
with holy reverence. It just boogies and it frames JLH very well. It
makes you realize how cosmic his sound was with that foot tapping and
that great rich round voice. I saw JLH in 1990 in Paris at some
outdoor festival where he was backed by some long hair electric band
that seemed clueless [and hair wagging] to the quiet intensity that
was just brewing on stage as they went off flailing in white heated
totally superfluous blustery guitar solos and yet, JLH and that deep
dark boogie track came through despite all the glaring glitzy glop on
stage.

[2] This is off some greatest hits and it doesn't much matter which
one. He put out some - I hear - 450 records in his lifetime and all
of them sound exactly the same and yet somehow that never mattered at
all.

[2a] "Site of Sound: Of Architecture & The Ear" on Errant Bodies
Press <www.smartartpress.com> is a book/cd edited and compiled by
sonic explorers Brandon Labelle & Steve Roden. This is a very
ambitious package of writings and musical investigations on how sound
defines space and vice versa. It applies the Situationist notion of
the dérive which set out to discover the hidden characteristics of a
city and redesign a city based on the demands of dreams and intuitive
wandering. This is the strategy employed here.Writing & sounds by
Alison Knowles, Christof Migone, Hildegard Westerkamp, Leif Ellgren,
Toshiya Tsunoda, David Dunn, CM von Hausswolf and other luminaries on
the urban outskirts where there are no curbs, no shoulders, no
parking spaces, no speed limits to sound. This piece Wollscheid
recommends that we take a minute to just listen, no really listen:
"please listen closely to the different sounds in your environment,
adopt one of these sounds, try to imagine this single sound expanded
over one minute, do not change it, just maintain it, try not to hum,
just think it, then quit." SILENCE for 1 minute.... Texts in the
fascinating book include Jake Tillson's "Noise Violation Kit" which
offers to be "a practical solution to your local noise pollution
hotspots;" Rolf Julius' searches for "Rooms of Stillness;" David
Dunn's "Purposeful Listening in Complex States of Time" and many
others.

[3] "Transformations" on Empreintes Digitales <info@electrocd.com>
<www.electrocd.com>. ED is a great label of enterprising experiments
in psycho-electrical-acoustic works. Amazing stuff they put out
including Francis Dhomont, Claude Schreyer, H. Westerkamp and many
others. The odd thing is, is why Canada is so in the forefront of
electro-acoustic work? Soundscape philosophy as well? Most of this
stuff is of extremely marginal value in the USA but in Canada it
seems to be part of the dialectic. In the forefront of confronting
our natural ambience and how technology and humans have impact on
this is HW. She developed her soundwalks in the 80s which entailed a
kind aural equivalent of the Situationists Dérive. "A Walk" is a
sonic dérive. A sojourn through Vancouver's skid row including the
usual urban din. These sounds are presented as is but also as sound
objects that were manipulated in the studio. What Westerkamp does
superbly is encourage us to invest in deep listening as a way of
setting soul and environment in some kind of cognizance balance.

[4] "Inside" on Epic. It is unbelievable that commercial labels took
chances with esoteric records like this. This is Paul Horn's early
work with soundings, which attempted to create an aural space by
blowing on his flute on various [famous] interiors. This is the first
and best of his efforts, recorded in april 1968, in the Taj Mahal,
which lies on the South Bank of the Jumna River.

[4a] CK is included on the "Site of Sound: Of Architecture & The Ear"
on Errant Bodies Press <www.smartartpress.com> CD/book. She has been
builiding sound sculptures in Germany and elsewhere since 1980. She
lives in Berlin.

[5] "hmm" on Sprawl <www.dfuse.com/sprawl/>  is a brilliant
conceptual compilation. It takes as the theme hymns, lullabies and
other songs remembered from childhood and reconstitutes them in a
living deconstructed format. This is really really beautiful - and
unsettling. Some of the tunes I have no idea where they come from,
others I find unrecognizable as if the process of memory morphs tunes
until they are something wholly new. I anxiously awaited this CD
because I knew that the efforts of Doug Benford and Iris Garrelfs
would be worth it. I knew it would serve as the backbone of this
special show I did recently of classical music[s] renovated or razed
by modern musicians. I am not sure these are ALL traditional hymns
and anthems from around the world as remembered from their
impressionable childhoods and reconstituted here but it has that
feel. Intimate without being at all sanctimonious or sloppily
sentimental nor are the musicians prone to that infantile notion of
killing their heritage/parents by shitting on tradition without
improving upon it. It begins with "Morning Has Broken" by Freeform
which was first made famous [I think] by Cat Stevens and it instantly
has me reeling backward into a feral field of my teen years. The
entire disc operates pretty much this way - a mnemonic key into pasts
I have never even lived. I remember very vividly making out on my
girl friend's couch in high school with this disc spinning
precariously on a cheap stereo. 'hmm' also features David Toop [very
static glitchy like he's shaving the head of some childhood memory],
Sprawl's own BitTonic with a beautiful piece, Farben via Milles
Plateaux, Wiggle, Puppy, Carl Stone, Finland's Vladislav Delay,
Japan's young female turntablist Apache 61 and the glibly effective
Osymyso

[6] "Peps.CD" by the Ultra Milkmaids [great name] on Ant Zen
<www.ant-zen.com> is a very interesting thrust into unsettling
ambience. Subliminal and furtive - they call it "arctic minimalism".
Regardless, they are all healthy antidotes to the hyper-cliched
worlds of pop genres. This kind of stuff is actually just the aural
flush your inner ear needs. Earth observed from 10,000 miles out in
the ether. 15 minutes of silence on a 19 minute cut. This is part of
a bigger silence joke, which usually withholds a kind of secret
message or cut or gem after and beyond all of that silence. And if
you are willing to endure 15 minutes of silence this is how you will
be rewarded. See also Osymyso, Tipsy, Dmitri From Paris and others.

[7] While fumbling to begin my show, Willem de Ridder, previously the
radioman and avant gardist who STILL enjoys radio [see his great
conceptual radio pieces] on before me, tries to fill in the silence
with some improvising. But what he does is humorously call attention
to the entire preposterous and scary notion of silence on radio. He
smokes cigars that come in beautiful glass test tubes. It brings back
instantly my uncle in Wayne NJ, we had just immigrated to the US and
he smoked cigars, spoke of the virtues of America, Arizona vacations,
Buick's new aluminum engine and Barry Goldwater.

[8] "Clear / No Name" on Effe <effe@mpd.biglobe.ne.jp> is a Japanese
label of noises and soundings also includes Carl Stone, John Hudak,
M5BR, Sukora, Toy Bizarre and others. No ABBA.

[9] This is one of these great bands [sounds?] that I've never
managed to learn much about. There were times I was reminded of
Muslimgauze. But anyway, there was a long period of about 4 years of
radio Djing in NY when I refused to read ANY reviews or music writing
and in this way I could do my show without the imposition of the
PAINTED WORD preceding my surprise when listening to new material.
It's no excuse, but it is something.

[10] "Welcome to the Palindrome" by Osymyso on Sprawl
<www.dfuse.com/sprawl/> is a very very clever assemblage of samples,
and intricate collage of sonic snippets which creates a bigger
picture of the world as something between a cheeky sham and an insane
post-Dada mess. Very Recommended: In the realm of Curd Duca, Tipsy,
Dimitri from Paris ... It is fun again to go around sampling just
like the early days when it all seemed like sonic versions of
post-situ strategies a la Negativland, Plunderphonics, early RRR
records... Here again employing the old silent rop a dope trick of
much silence before coming back to sonic life with a little decoded
coda...

[11] There was a time in the early 90s when they were THE band to
listen to. They had shucked the mechanical edges and had gone fluid,
even psychedelic and were seemingly enjoying themselves with some
pretty right on samples. There dark industrial stance went suddenly
cosmic ... and then I heard a really snarky smarmy interview they did
with Wreck This Mess in Paris [Laurent & Black Sifichi] where they
were quick to bad mouth some people whose sound might be quickly
associated with MBM. When Laurent mentioned Adrian Sherwood, they
just lashed way out of line. It just was stupid ego-punk type stuff
and my estimation of them has never quite recovered.

[12] "Scott Marshall" on Paniculture <paniculture@hotmail.com. This
entire disc is a kind of samplers odds & sods is inspired by the
excesses of culture which we hold up in contempt but at the same time
can't help but embrace in all it's loveable repulsiveness. This one
pokes fun at artspeak that tries to describe sound art. Tongue in
cheek cutting make this babel piece hilariously vapid but certainly
NOT silent, despite the wishful chant silencesilence silencesilence
silencesilence...

[13] "New Works: 1997-99" from the artist <david_berezan@yahoo.ca>
You will be hearing more about him. Right now, I will say that it is
an interesting duet of manmade sounds with naturally-generated
environmental sounds and that there are huge breathtaking scoops of
silence [not] present. I know I promised this before but...

[14] "Don Cherry" on A & M in 1976 with Charlie Haden, Hakim Jamil,
Billy Higgins, Frank Lowe, Ricky Cherry, Bunchie Fox, Verna Gillis,
Moki Cherry. Includes "Brown Rice" which had a large impact on my
youthful ears back then. This is all racy beautifully rendered takes
on African tales. Further proof that Don Cherry was a world musician
who went far and wide to discover new places and instruments and
accompanists to jam with - in this case big blowing sea mammals. Also
worked with the varied likes of Rip, Rig & Panic, Albert Ayler, Arto
Lindsay, Heiner Göbbells, Lou Reed ["The Bells" which I saw at the
Bottom Line], Ian Dury, Sun Ra, Brion gysin and many many others. For
a complete discography
<http://www.harmolodic.com/related/dcherry2.html >

[15] "Negative" on Prikosnovenie <http://www.multimania.com/prikos/>
is darker and noisier than "Positive" and set on a kind of
scattershot random fire. The sounds hint at a collapse of trust in
human beings and their electronic devices. I feel the technology
almost turning against us. The sound is dark and dystopic,
voyeuristic and gives the sense of sci-fi speculative journeys. He
has worked with industrial spectacle bands like Von Magnet or Column
One and also has composed orchestral percussion for orchestra and
various dance companies here in the Netherlands. So perhaps we are
entering the fat era of orchestral industrial or the sonic
bedouinization of speculative sound. Hmm. [[from a 1999 message from
Lydia Tomkiw, ex-poet/reciter in Algebra Suicide: "Bart - glad you
did something on Cage.... can you take one more story of him that's
my fave? He was put into a chamber where it was totally soundproof
(not even light, artificial or other to make noise).  When he emerged
he claimed he COULD hear 2 sounds: a constant really high frequency
squealing, and a low, almost inaudible constant rumble/ rolling
sound.  The squeal were his ganglia/synapsis working; the low sound
was his blood circulating through his body (not his heart-beat... he
identified that)....... I thought it was a fascinating story."]]

[16] This from an unreleased tape of Anna Montana's
<Brut@palm.a2000.nl> [supposedly] elaborate vocal operatic-acrobatix.
But alas, the tape was as silent as silent can be on a medium priced
cassette - lots of surface noise and the sound of machines and
technology at work. I thought it worked as a long-version homage to
Cage. Someday she will know about this version and she will be
appreciated for not only this but her true gift for bizarre
entertainment. Her reverse strip tease is her most famous Amsterdam
piece [censored in NY!] where she and [usually] Erin Tasmania take
the stage totally naked - and totally is a lot and deliriously
uncompromising. Then, with some appropriate slimey oozy strip jazz
they begin to elaborately get dressed until they are loaded down in
about 15 layers of flamboyantly clashing layers of clothing [looking
like tarted up bag ladies] as people in the audience yell "Put it ALL
on!"

[17] "Skandinavien" on Iris Light <iLIGHT@irislight.demon.co.uk> is
great, beautiful, calming without being sleep-inducing, provocative
without being grating. Penumbra is a member of Zoviet France and is
in their realm of high quality. Ethereal but also with a throb and
beat. This disc seems to combine the best of ambient, the best of
investigative soundings and the best of speculative and surreptitious
noise. Highly recommended.

[18] "Sound Information Collection" on Echo Beach <www.echobeach.de>
includes work by Harpy, Sounds from the Ground, Butterfly, Purr, and
Path. This London-based label was a major force in bringing new
underground sounds that found no other outlet. Their slippery
eclectic electronic music with Sounds From the Ground forming its
in-house band found release on their own label as well as on
Universal Egg, the label of Extremadura and Zion Train. There are
ways to turn New Agey sounds into something exciting and genuinely
vibrant. It is a dangerous wobbly slack wire to walk but  Harpy
creates a kind of earthly paradise full of buzzing fields, humming
pastures and delightful stillness the way Henri rousseau's paintings
evoke a primitve paradise; combine that with some of Pink Floyd's
more ambient flora/fauna work...

[19] "King Size Dub 5" <www.echobeach.de> contains remixes of Junior
Delgado, I Roy, Bim Sherman and work by Zion Train, Stash, Shara
Nelson, Horace Andy vs Massive Attack and Dr. Israel from Word Sound
rewired. SN sings with a sound strikingly similar to Dub Syndicate "I
want to know what silence knows so I can know what it take to be
free..."

[20] "Home Is Where The Bass Is" on Incoming. Cee Mix take the
notions of weightlessness and the ethereal lethargy of dub to the
max. Everything is slowed down. Everything is altered - beats, time
to space relatins and so after listening to this disc you realize
that there are reasons for dub's fascination with space - it is a
metaphor for the psychotropically induced trips that spell escape but
also exploration. It is the best example of my notion as laid out in
my "Ocean of Sound" review and an article "Subworld Dubafarianism"
[reprinted in ANGBASE] "These producers created unique musical
values, hypnotic sound, a new sense of timing (inspired by ganja?
meditation? tropical heat?) which plowed gaping furrows of silent
space between notes. Slowed to a yogi's pulse so that each note, each
thrump shakes and shivers all of its echo and effects out of its
system. (I think also of Miles Davis' interminable breaths between
trumpet bleats). These empty spaces, these synaptic sectors serve as
the exposed orifices, the tympanic playgrounds for producers to play
in; the deep breathing space where contemplation and invention
thrive."

all manner of interruption, as the people gather for an ear. each ear fills,
and news and noise collide. this must be something integrated with other
elations, that will be spoken of in later days. our children will be
pleased. the timeless crafting of words and the images that tag along must
continue. words will take us to new places such as can be reached with
imaginative rustle and smell of something distantly remembered. it could be
a tale for smiling bands of active poets, or a cherishing that anyone can
perform. when we reach our knighted consideration, there will be hell to
pay. well, hell is a dandy landlord in most respects: we shall carry on.

As an admirer of Keats, levy, Marlowe and Shelley, all of whom I
consider great, I can't agree that Plath was too young to be
called great.  I find her to have been too uneven to be called great,
in her oeuvre as a whole and in most of her individual poems.  At her
best, though, she was terrific (e.g., "my heart is a stopped
geranium.")  I think Hughes's Crow poems a superior sustained effort
than anything she did, but suspect that he couldn't have done them
without her example.  Disclaimer: I can't say I've studied her work
enough to have
anything near what I'd call a valid opinion of it.  I'm also
prejudiced against the kind of confessional poems, like "Daddy,"
that she was best-known for.
                                                --Bob G.

      .................=3D20








      Illustration by: Patricia J. Wynne
     As I came out of the library the other day, an ambulance raced =3D
past. The ECNALUBMA on the front was quite a coincidence, as I'd just =
=3D
been looking at some of Leonardo da Vinci's mirror writing. Talk about a =
=3D
role model for the Renaissance man. Leonardo's talents and interests =3D
were so enormous I'll leave it at that, except to say I particularly =3D
liked his high-tech anatomical drawings done sometime around 1510. =3D
Especially the one of the kidney, a major source of problems in an age =
=3D
when the rich and famous went for 10-course meals that were washed down =
=3D
with copious amounts of booze. Result: gout. Effect: kidney stones. By =
=3D
the 18th century this condition was the biggest earner for physicians to =
=3D
the well-heeled.=3D20
      In 1753 one treatment attempted in Edinburgh was to dissolve the =
=3D
stones with caustic limewater. Another possibility, offered by medical =
=3D
student Joseph Black, was to use a preparation of magnesium carbonate. =
=3D
Wrong, but during the experiments Black came across carbon dioxide, =3D
extinguishing candles and small birds with it, and thus inspired =3D
subsequent, more famous work by such illustrious suffocaters as Joseph =
=3D
Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier. (Black is probably best known as the =
=3D
guy who told James Watt about latent heat, thereby triggering Watt's =3D
idea of a separate condenser.)=3D20

      In 1766 Black took the Edinburgh chair of chemistry when his old =
=3D
friend and former teacher William Cullen moved over to medicine. =3D
Cullen's boffo success in the lecture hall had come from his =3D
introduction of the hip new trend of lecturing in English rather than =
=3D
Latin. He also got caught up in the contemporary craze for categorizing =
=3D
diseases by their symptoms, a.k.a. "nosology." (A sample from his work =
=3D
on the subject: "Melancholy. Symptoms: aversion to action and the duties =
=3D
of life.")=3D20

      At one point, Cullen employed a penniless young teacher as tutor =
=3D
to his children. This wannabe doctor, John Brown, repaid the kindness =
=3D
years later, when he, too, had become a medic, with a scathing attack on =
=3D
Cullen's practices. By this time Brown had made so many enemies with his =
=3D
big mouth that he was never going to get a professorship. So instead he =
=3D
wrote Elements of Medicine and started a whole school of therapy based =
=3D
on the idea that all diseases were either a shortage or an excess of =3D
excitability, to be treated with either a stimulant (alcohol) or a =3D
sedative (opium).=3D20

      Brunonian theories created such a furor that the man had his =3D
defenders and detractors fighting it out in the streets of =
G=3DF6ttingen. =3D
Alas, in the end, Brown was to expire from taking (too much of) his own =
=3D
medicine. This in 1788, seven years before a late edition of Elements =
=3D
was put together by one Thomas Beddoes, who had his own medical ax to =
=3D
grind: treatment of all diseases by inhalation at his Pneumatic =3D
Institute (equipment by Watt, funding by Josiah Wedgwood). Beddoes's =3D
only real claim to fame (the institute failed) was that he hired a =3D
19-year-old unknown named Humphry Davy.=3D20

      Who is now so famous I'll just mention a couple of reasons why: =
=3D
the miner's lamp, nitrous oxide anesthetic and (from 1801) Royal =3D
Institution lectures with so much pizzazz that they became an =3D
intellectual fashion statement among the elite. One of whom was an old =
=3D
pal of Davy's (Davy had pretensions, fortunately discouraged, to writing =
=3D
poetry): Samuel Taylor Coleridge, by this time a well-known scribbler =
=3D
and another opium addict. Who introduced Davy to a young hanger-on, an =
=3D
as yet unknown scribbler and another opium addict named Thomas De =3D
Quincey. He would become famous with his Confessions of an English =3D
Opium-Eater in 1821.=3D20

      De Quincey lived in such chaos that on many occasions he was =3D
unable to write a piece because he couldn't locate his notes. After =3D
years of writing biogs for the Britannica and lightweight magazine =3D
essays, and assiduously cultivating Wordsworth, De Quincey moved to =3D
Scotland, where he assiduously cultivated Sir William Hamilton. Now I'll =
=3D
give this to you straight, because reading about it turned my brain to =
=3D
porridge, so it's all I can do: Hamilton, Edinburgh prof of logic and =
=3D
metaphysics, quantified the predicate. Okay? (If you need to know more, =
=3D
try J. S. Mill's An Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy, =
=3D
London, 1889, and serve you right.)=3D20

      One of Hamilton's pupils was a real unfortunate, name of Archibald =
=3D
S. Couper. A two-handkerchief tale. In 1858 Archy is working in a Paris =
=3D
lab and asks the lab boss to get somebody to present to the French =3D
Academy a paper he's done. Archy says hurry up when boss delays. Archy =
=3D
is ejected from the lab and returns to obscurity in Scotland. Meanwhile =
=3D
somebody else comes up with the same ideas and gets all the glory. Archy =
=3D
is never heard from again and eventually goes gaga.=3D20

      The somebody else? Only the mighty Friedrich August Kekule von =3D
Stradonitz, whose ideas (atoms can link up thanks to valence: hydrogen =
=3D
with one other atom, oxygen with two, and so on; and the concept of a =
=3D
closed ring of linked carbon atoms, as in "benzene ring") laid the =3D
foundations for modern structural chemistry. Or rather, did not, because =
=3D
poor old unimportant Archy Couper really got there first.=3D20

      Kekule did, however, organize the first International Congress of =
=3D
Chemists in 1860 at Karlsruhe, Germany, where they sorted out the =3D
confusion in chemical terminology. Among those who showed up was a =3D
Russian, Dmitri Ivanovich Mende- leyev, who would later prove to be too =
=3D
democratic for his Czarist masters and lose his university job. Ended up =
=3D
director of the Bureau of Weights and Measures.=3D20

      Ironic, that, because in 1869 Mendeleyev had discovered the =3D
periodic table of elements, which arranged them in order of increasing =
=3D
atomic weight (wonder if anybody saw the joke). One of his European =3D
traveling companions (who also turned up at the Karlsruhe congress) was =
=3D
a fellow chemist and the illegitimate son of a prince, Aleksandr =3D
Porfiryevich Borodin. Who in 1862 went back to St. Petersburg to a =3D
professorship, a life of chemistry and efforts to get women into the =3D
medical profession.=3D20

      For relaxation, Borodin hung out with a group of twentysomethings =
=3D
he'd met through an old childhood pal, who all encouraged him to turn =
=3D
his hand to the activity that has since made him more famous than his =
=3D
chemistry: music, especially his "Polovtsian Dances," now a staple at =
=3D
concerts worldwide. At the time, Russian music was split between the =3D
nationalists (Borodin and friends) and the Westernizers, headed by =3D
Tchaikovsky. One of whose prot=3DE9g=3DE9s was Sergei Rachmaninoff =
(whose =3D
"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" is another staple). When the October =
=3D
Revolution hit, Rachmaninoff hightailed it for the U.S., after which his =
=3D
music was banned in Russia, as "representing the decadent attitude of =
=3D
the lower middle classes."=3D20

      In 1923 Rachmaninoff got a letter from a fellow immigrant that =3D
impressed him so much he sent the guy $5,000, as a result of which Igor =
=3D
Sikorsky was able to start up his Aero Engineering Corporation in a barn =
=3D
on Long Island. In 1937 Pan Am flew the Atlantic in Sikorsky's =3D
four-engined Clipper. And in 1939 Sikorsky realized a lifelong dream: to =

build and fly the device that had inspired him when he first saw it as a =

child, in one of Leonardo's other drawings-a helicopter.

      Must fly.

Subject:      life/work [was Re: Sylvia Plath &c.]
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

from Janet Todd's _The Secret Life of Aphra Behn_ (Pandora, 2000), p.225:
"Behn did not equate intelligence with this introspection, as later ages
would do; she considered that a resolute triviality was as intellectually
reasonable a response to an analysis of the human predicament as
concentration on the 'depths' of something presumed to be the 'self'."

That said (quoted), I think it's a very silly protest that we are all lay
folks rather than psychiatrists -- once the shelves devoted to psychology at
your local megastore outnumber those devoted to poetry, everybody knows
something. For goodness' sake, on another list (where I embarassed myself)
Lisa Jarnot wouldn't let me get away with disregarding Mr. Freud, the man
who launched a thousand ships, some of whom write novels.

Anyway, I warn of a long post perhaps.

Someone complained about us (?) looking at the life of Sylvia Plath rather
than simply the work. This of course is an old argument, an old dichotomy,
lobotomy, or what have you.

Of course I like and in some moods agree with the idea that the work is it.
And of course it is. But there are circumstances, hello! As Rachel Blau
DuPlessis has it in her letter to me in the new Outlet, "a female obscured
author....these people can become favorites only under specific intellectual
regimes -- the regime of a feminism of reception that understands why an
author might get obscure because, precisely, of gender."  OK, I don't
especially like the word regime, or the idea that literature is only
stewarded by the professional intellectuals.  However, duh, of course Sylvia
Plath's circumstances have to do with whether we consider her great or not.
Of course Ted Hughes's brilliant careerism effects our view of her. Hello,
he wrote the intro to her collected stories, the only version I've ever seen
in print.

But my main concern is the idea that you can look simply at the work to
judge its greatness or no. Its value. That is nuts! You are in a certain
vein/culture, as am I. As is the writer of it. I know this is like 101 but
comments here have forced me!

One thing I think I said before that makes me "diagnose" our US culture(s)
as schizophrenizing is this very method of separation. Literature, gossip,
politics, all of it together make a culture and a way of understanding. When
people are smashed into categories, problems arise. When women are
considered crazy there is a power structure at work, etc. I just think you
can't say we aren't going to get into class gender race all that mess of
things that are so hard to think about. When you think about writing, when
you want to read, often you are looking for new questions and answers about
these very things. Or, I should say, I am. Not only that but that is part of
it. That is also part of how people get to be considered important or not,
writing important or not. It's kind of ugly, it's kind of great.

One of my favorite novelists is Janet Frame, yes she was the subject of Jane
Campion's "An Angel at My Table". Yes she spent years in mental asylums. She
doesn't talk about it much in her autobiography, having covered it in her
2nd, and in some more diffuse ways in her later, novels. I don't blame her
not wanting to be _limited_ , to use Rachel Levitsky's word, in that way.

It is crazy to romanticize categories, perhaps to romanticize anything at
all, perhaps to spend so much time thinking about our own selves or the
selves and circumstances of our writers. But in the end it is all part of
the same experience of trying to make sense of things, ain't it?

I think it ain!

Anyway, all the answers you ever wanted will be provided in Outlet (8)
Paradise by such fabuloues as Jimmie Durham and Leslie Scalapino. Of course
I am kidding, all I want from the writers I read is partial questions,
partial answers, partial "truths". Because we all are partial.

Hughes I like to a point. But I feel he lacks the capacity for intensity and
compression of detail that Plath acheived: my further point re her was more
or less that her acheivement would have been the greater sans her seemingly
self-imposed "darkness": or that these reasons or causes (of her depression
or "darkness") as much as they did not lead inevitably to her own suicide
may have been fought against and possibly overcome or borne somewhat...if
she had lived longer - or more to the pont in a happier frame of mind so to
speak - her work would have been or could have been a greater acheivement.
(I also raised the problem of individual human resposiblitity she seems to
have neglected in regard to the life of her own children.)
  But I dont want to go down the road of "inspirational" and so on: I'm not
even sure that Plath hadnt wriiten the best ehe would ever write. maybe
there was no hope for her. Certainly not someone whose example I would want
my own daughters to follow. As it happens I dont think either have much
interest in her...they are more interested in music (they have a  band the
two of them)... one daughter at University admired Lyn Heijinian's "My Life"
which is by and large a "positive" document....it could hardly have been
written by a chronic depressive: which is quite different from someone who
has in his/her life had a various life experience with passion and
sufferingas well as joy and "all the ills the flesh is heir to..." These are
my quick thoughts on this which arose origninally from a discussion on
Hannah Weiner and her interesting and original style of work and the way she
aparently hallucinated into seing the words infront of her which she then
wrote down.  Good to hear from you Bill me old mate. Regarsd all, Richard.

Aaron. They meant (and in todys rush of events it is quite iunderstandable
but you must understand that in a les intellectual or more sedate and
harmonious world such things would never occur) to say: "...the violence
left...one protester injured and the other seriously dead..." which means,
well, its hard NOT to be seriously dead. Then I suppose if one was dead one
would be dead....grammar wouldnt matter. Sounds as though there's a lot of
vigorous and rather jolly fun and games going on around about Genoa these
days. I wish the bloody world WOULD hurry up and warm up its as cold as a

There are some curious grammatical constructions in today's media coverage
of the G8 events. Check out this one, from a BBC news article: "The violence
in Genoa on Friday left one protester dead and another seriously injured."
Is there a technical name from grammar, rhetoric or an affiliated study for
this type of substitution--from a specific material agent/subject ("the
police") to a general process(?) ("the violence")?

The BBC article is on-line at:

Also, this article in today's New York Times. How did it come to be that the
concept of "anti-globalization" was substituted for "anti-capitalism"? A few
minutes ago G.W. Bush stated in a broadcast that he disagrees with the
"isolationism" and "protectionism" of the anti-G8 activists. Who is he

What the Protesters in Genoa Want
by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri

Genoa, that Renaissance city known for both openness and shrewd political
sophistication, is in crisis this weekend. It should have thrown its gates
wide for the celebration of this summit of the world's most powerful
leaders. But instead Genoa has been transformed into a medieval fortress of
barricades with high-tech controls. The ruling ideology about the present
form of globalization is that there is no alternative. And strangely, this
restricts both the rulers and the ruled.

Leaders of the Group of Eight have no choice but to attempt a show of
political sophistication. They try to appear charitable and transparent in
their goals. They promise to aid the world's poor and they genuflect to Pope
John Paul II and his interests. But the real agenda is to renegotiate
relations among the powerful, on issues such as the construction of missile
defense systems.

The leaders, however, seem detached somehow from the transformations around
them, as though they are following the stage directions from a dated play.
We can see the photo already, though it has not yet been taken: President
George W. Bush as an unlikely king, bolstered by lesser monarchs. This is
not quite an image of the future. It resembles more an archival photo,
pre-1914, of superannuated royal potentates.

Those demonstrating against the summit in Genoa, however, are not distracted
by these old-fashioned symbols of power. They know that a fundamentally new
global system is being formed. It can no longer be understood in terms of
British, French, Russian or even American imperialism.

The many protests that have led up to Genoa were based on the recognition
that no national power is in control of the present global order.
Consequently protests must be directed at international and supranational
organizations, such as the G-8, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund. The movements are not anti-American, as
they often appear, but aimed at a different, larger power structure.

If it is not national but supranational powers that rule today's
globalization, however, we must recognize that this new order has no
democratic institutional mechanisms for representation, as nation-states do:
no elections, no public forum for debate.

The rulers are effectively blind and deaf to the ruled. The protesters take
to the streets because this is the form of expression available to them. The
lack of other venues and social mechanisms is not their creation.

Antiglobalization is not an adequate characterization of the protesters in
Genoa (or Göteborg, Quebec, Prague, or Seattle). The globalization debate
will remain hopelessly confused, in fact, unless we insist on qualifying the
term globalization. The protesters are indeed united against the present
form of capitalist globalization, but the vast majority of them are not
against globalizing currents and forces as such; they are not isolationist,
separatist or even nationalist.

The protests themselves have become global movements and one of their
clearest objectives is for the democratization of globalizing processes. It
should not be called an antiglobalization movement. It is pro-globalization,
or rather an alternative globalization movement - one that seeks to
eliminate inequalities between rich and poor and between the powerful and
the powerless, and to expand the possibilities of self-determination.

If we understand one thing from the multitude of voices in Genoa this
weekend, it should be that a different and better future is possible. When
one recognizes the tremendous power of the international and supranational
forces that support our present form of globalization, one could conclude
that resistance is futile.

But those in the streets today are foolish enough to believe that
alternatives are possible - that "inevitability" should not be the last word
in politics. A new species of political activist has been born with a spirit
that is reminiscent of the paradoxical idealism of the 1960's - the
realistic course of action today is to demand what is seemingly impossible,
that is, something new.

Protest movements are an integral part of a democratic society and, for this
reason alone, we should all thank those in the streets in Genoa, whether we
agree with them or not. Protest movements, however, do not provide a
practical blueprint for how to solve problems, and we should not expect that
of them. They seek rather to transform the public agenda by creating
political desires for a better future.

We see seeds of that future already in the sea of faces that stretches from
the streets of Seattle to those of Genoa. One of the most remarkable
characteristics of these movements is their diversity: trade unionists
together with ecologists together with priests and communists. We are
beginning to see emerge a multitude that is not defined by any single
identity, but can discover commonality in its multiplicity.

These movements are what link Genoa this weekend most clearly to the
openness - toward new kinds of exchange and new ideas - of its Renaissance
past.

I know that this is off-topic, but there is a recording of Walt Whitman
(probably) reading the first 4 lines of his poem "America" from _Leaves
of Grass_.  It was unearthed by Prof. Ed Folsom of our English faculty,
and if authentic, it was recorded on an Edison wax cylinder within the
last year or two of Whitman's life.  Prof. Folsom is the editor of _The
Walt Whitman Quarterly_ -- at least he was a few years ago when the
recording became something of a "cause celebre."  Its authenticity (or
lack of same) was discussed in a _New York Times_ article.

Hi, Bob

and Um, Er.....

that 'great' tag is a thing to hold gingerly for a start, methinks. That
there is poetry that is 'great' I would unsophisticatedly and fuzzily agree,
but I am chary of the adjective's application. With Plath, she's a complex
case, I do myself feel a certain reservation at aspects of luridity in some
of her most-touted pieces, such as parts of 'Daddy', altho' at the same time
I'd aver the psychological validity of such pieces. I most like of Plath's
poems such as the Bee-box loose sequence, and some of the shorter poems,
like 'You're' or the title poem of 'Ariel', but I would be uneasy at a
notion of the superiority of the 'Crow' poems to Plath's later work, I feel
there is a 'within-ness' of speech in some of her work that is absent from
the pounding rhetoric and cartoon effects of 'Crow', forceful though it is.

Best

Youth shouldnt preclude greatness - but then, I think it's too early to call
Hughes -or- Plath great. Times' Great Sieve comes sifting through...or something
like that.

below, the official blurb for, among other things, a long piece by kass
fleisher and mself, "reforming creative writing pedagogy:  history as
knowledge, knowledge as activism"...

kass and i would both love to see as many responses as the spirits move...

also in this ~ebr~, reactions to michael berube on postmodernism, and nick
montfort on hyper-cybertext...

best,

joe

--------------

This summer ebr presents a new cluster on Creative Writing programs
featuring an extensive hypertext essay by Joe Amato and Kass Fleisher, who
suggest that creative writing, particularly as found in the typical
workshop, might benefit from a major, theoretically informed,
re-visioning. RiPOSTes to the essay give conflicting assessments from
inside and outside the workshop: David Radovich agrees, Sandra Huss claims
that the reform is already underway, and Lance Olsen has in fact left the
institution for the very reasons cited by Amato and Fleisher. In her
riPOSTe, Marjorie Perloff
addresses a secondary question: with the transformation of English into
Cultural Studies, where else but in writing programs, will literature be
read? ebr will continue to publish new riPOSTes of 300-500 words as the
fall semester gets underway.

the essay, introduction, and citation mill can all be accessed from

        http://www.altx.com/ebr/riposte/

In fact the riposte section has been especially active this summer;
Michael Berube's provocation that postmodernism is no longer a viable
academic descriptor draws responses from two ebr editors, while Nick
Montfort's suggestion that 'hypertext' is being displaced by 'cybertext'
draws fire, it seems, from the entire electronic writing community, among
them Katherine Hayles, Marjorie Luesebrink, and Jim Rosenberg. An
essay-length response by Markku Eskelinen is forthcoming in the fall.

As this request has been posted, I don't think it inappropriate, as a
CONTRIBUTOR to VeRT, that a previous issue included material posted to a
listserv by myself and others, AGAINST our consent, and doctored, and also
rehashed in parallel in a way that bordered on the defamatory.

Andrew Felsinger did at least allow one contributor to voice her objections,
but at the same time he removed the link to the listserv's archives, thus
perpetuating the lies, and the magazine's editorial speaks faux-naively of
'having fun'.

So I wonder bemusedly about such unabashed announcements of presence.

To put it bluntly, Andrew, your magazine carries material by myself, against
my wishes, I want it removed and you avoid the question. Why?

I'm not sure what part of the bloody violence in Genoa was the "jolly fun'

as a professional and as a patient i don't have any difficulty with 'lay
people' reading, writing, etc., about me or us - the more the merrier,
actually, as the more open things are the better.  The difficulty for me
arises when somebody who's read a few books (or a thousand books) on
psychology or biochemistry passes themselves off as an expert on people and
makes pronouncements and diagnoses and then others go along with the
armchair analyses.  To put it bluntly here, you know as much about
schizophrenic language and schizophrenogenic culture as Jameson.

Thomas Bell asked,

"Is there a qualitative difference in poetic research condusted under the
influence of induced substances (air, water, and pollen might also be
includeed?) or internal influences (either biochemical or structural)?"

Indeed, this was one of the questions I asked, and it seems an important one
to grapple with if "the poetry of madness" is to be theorized, as Barrett
Watten seemed to be suggesting it might, as a special aesthetic-theoretical
problem.

Again, if one regards schizophrenia as a condition which has a
chemical-biological basis (as I'm sure Watten does!), then in what way could
the poetry produced under its impacts be given (by "normal" critics, one
presumes) a special ontological status vis a vis, say, any poetry produced
under the influence of mind-altering chemical substances? Or, for that
matter, the poetry produced by surrealists in the 20's and 30's under the
altered neuro-chemical effects of sleep deprivation?

Once one begins to demarcate illness as constituting some kind of exotic
otherness, all sorts of "critical" pseudo-problems begin to emerge. For
example, would a collaboration between Ron Silliman and Hannah Weiner need be
considered (mediated and invaded by illness, as the text would be) in special
critical ways as against a collaboration by Lyn Hejinian and Michael Palmer?
Or, one could ask: what of criticism by someone experiencing mental illness?
Is a listserv thread on poetry and madness somehow a "new and special object"
once a brilliant young writer like Patrick Herron makes a contribution? Is
the thread not now traced with the filaments of mental illness?

In short, it is best to treat poets as poets, and to avoid inventing
unnecessary theoretical problems.

"The poet demands we resist these reductions. Apparent, certainly, is =
his empathy for the medieval exile adrift in political corruption. But =
the interlacing of these two poetic velocities outpaces parallels; it =
cries for collaboration, for a dynamic launching of the fluid, unstable =
form underlying the circumscriptions of structure. Traces of this =
insurgence inhere in a human and artistic conversation accomplished =
across centuries and space, in the tangle of speech-roots that grow and =
reach. "What distinguishes poetry from automatic speech is that it =
rouses us and shakes us into wakefulness in the middle of a word. Then =
it turns out that the word is much longer than we thought, and we =
remember that to speak means to be forever on the road."=20

Joe and Kass and all--

thank you for that thorough and biting critique of creative writing
pedagogy, along with some suggestions as to how to remedy the "Wonder Boys"
problem (to say nothing of the "Finding Forrester" conundrum, even with Mr.
Bernstein as the principal).

As head of creative writing at UH (which title I was given by default)
several years ago, I tried to effect a change from program A to program B,
namely from Wonder Boys to a less firmly male-gendered and crafty notion of
writing pedagogy.  I can attest to the (personal) bitterness and rancor that
ensue when such a shift is even proposed.  One example of the way in which A
and Bers talk in utterly different languages occured obliquely in a graduate
class I taught in thinking about creative writing.  I found myself
confronted with a number of students who were not only against theory, but
against criticism itself!  (They were influenced by members of another wing
of the program, needless to say.)

So I wonder how we encourage students to think about writing through theory,
or even criticism, when the "powers that be" tend to operate from the
workshop/craft model.  Here it took a year and a half of struggle, and bad
feelings to last a lifetime.  (Let me add that I'm now more optimistic about
the program...)

Another complexity: many of Hawai`i's finest writers--and most famous,
including Lois-Ann Yamanaka--have come out of the UH writing program.  The
master/apprentice model that you discuss operated between one of our
professors and these students.  She has elicited wonderful material from
them.  But: one wonders at the colonial apparatus at work.  The teacher is
white, her students mostly Asian (and I'm thinking also of a
Hawaiian/Filipino poet who worked with her).  How to think through that
power scheme....  While white writers here, such as Ian MacMillan when he
writes about Hawai`i without consulting Hawaiians, have been sharply
criticized, and while Yamanaka has been attacked for her representations of
Filipino men, the onus has not been put on a program that may, in fact,
encourage such problems.  Yes, I'm sure you talk about that in gender
terms--women asked to uphold the rules that operate against them.  And so
some writers in Hawai`i who started out as revolutionaries for a local
literature are now upholding an "aesthetic" model, proclaiming a
distinterest in "political literature."  And their aesthetics,
unsurprisingly, often come from their teachers--even if the content of their
work is different from the "will it sell in New York?" model of the 70s,
say.  Of course, it _does_ sell in NYC now, but that's another story,
indeed.

But I'd love to hear strategies for dealing with these issues.  Strategies
for better teaching our students in a non-colonial way; strategies for
changing writing programs from within; strategies for trading our knowledges
with each other.

thanks again,

Susan

I don't see how "Daddy" is confessional.  It's a nursery-rhyme
performance piece.  And Plath wrote a lot of other poems in other
styles.  Daddy is supposed to be irritating and I think it does what
she wanted it to do.

As far as the rest of the discussion about whether Plath is "great"
or not--I certainly wouldn't use the word "great" myself to describe
anybody.  I liked Fraser's use of it, just because to say anything
positive about Plath as Poet is such a radical intervention.

The whole notion of "greatness" reeks of The Cannon, which we on the
poetic list are supposed to be against, right?  (This is a gentle
joke, folks.)

Subject:      an apology, complicated
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Jeffrey Jullich asked me to apologize on list, so I forward this. Elizabeth

Hi Jeffrey, Well I am sorry you feel this way, I really am. I will apologize
on list, no problem. I guess I did use the word "friend" too brashly, and I
apologize for that as well. I do consider you part of my community of
writers, and that that was clear by our having published you in Outlet.
I don't think everyone agrees with Double Lucy's "feminist agenda" if it is
indeed quite that, and I have certainly been and seen others "ambushed" on
the list as much as I may have ambushed you. I was trying to point to a way
in which things can get grevious on the list, which is part of what scares
me away from it, which I think is bad, partly because I consider myself part
of this community, and partly because I know a lot, a lot, of women who
don't contribute to this conversation because it so often gets ugly. I
thought since we had corresponded in the past, and I had published your work
so clearly I do admire it, it would be ok to talk about these things through
a comment on your comments to Camille. I still do think they were a bit
harsh and bossy, but to each his own. I haven't heard from her or from
Charles Bernstein, or Tim the list monitor (I thought it was Chris?)....
anyway, hope we can move forward from here.
Your message certainly has traumatized me, and I claim I am as sensitive as
you, dear sir. Let's try to be more civil, or more distanced, in future.
Please note that I was sensitive and perceptive and, I might say, "friendly"
enough to approach you about how you felt backchannel. But hey, I'm no
sweetie just cause I'm a girl, nor do I think I should have to be so; nor do
I agree that "no man" would come at you like I did.

Sincerely Elizabeth

(How will I ever get anything done and get back to the objects of ~my~
interest and commitment, this list is so distracting and engrossing!)

What I've already skimmed of the 57-pp. print-out of your fascinatingly
argued, rousingly oratorical paper looks like it's gonna be quite a read.
Good shot!

Prior to tomorrow's (anon's) more specific replies, let me just say a couple
of related thoughts recently on my mind, a convergence of illuminating
accidences:

ENGLISH LITERATURE AS ORPHAN OF HISTORY DEPARTMENT

I've been reading Milton's Latin poetry (huh?); recently, I read Anthony
Knerr's impeccable, critical edition of Shelley's "Adonais" manuscript.  What
handicaps my appreciation of poetry, I'm learning --- with Milton, the
importance of the Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot (so relevant and 2001, with
"terrorists" driving explosives around like Good Humor trucks!) and later
anti-monarchist Cromwell-ism for Milton; with Shelley, Tory party politics for
Shelley (he accused Tory critics of causing Keats' death) --- is my utter lack
of preparation in ~History.~   But I barely recall taking a single history
class, although I must've (curriculum requirements)!

Imaginative, fantastical or mythological poetry seemingly devoid of political
or historical reference begins to seem stridently agitprop: the whole of
~Paradise Lost~ could/should be read as Milton's autobiographical regicide
remorse; even the ~prevalence~ of a mythological setting in Greek tragedy was
a response to popular failures on record for when the dramatists attempted
still contemporary historical subjects to an unreceptive or hostile response
that forced a retreat back into anachronistic Iliad subject matter, . . . etc.

Simultaneously, I was very taken by an essay ("New Hope for The Disappeared")
where Ron Silliman pinpoints the "birth" of the English Dept.: 1828, London
University, Thomas Dale, the first professor of English literature. --- In a
naive way, I doubt I'd ever ~imagined~ an antedeluvian academia without an
English Department!

And, lastly, Claudia Rankine's (and Carolyn Crumbpacker's)
Poetry-for-Teachers-of-Teenagers reading last week, where Rankine unveiled
(drum roll) their www.newmediapoets.com Manifesto.   Their critique: they
notice that with everything they read in journals these days, there's no
telling when it was written, given the poem's autonomous world; they want more
name-naming ("Bush, Microsoft, Nike") and they're invoking (French
pronunciation) "engagement" . . .  ("Nike"? as in Victory of Samothrace? Note
to self: buy/find a newspaper)  (I see holes in their critique ---
newmediapoets as a literary ~Grease~ [the musical] or "Return to the
'60's"/Pop; the non-recognition that formalist features alone [the
asyntactical, "free verse," open field] absolutely date what's printed today
with a definite ~terminus post quem;~ XXth cent. American
heteroglossia/polyvocality as the microcosm of surrounding mass media
journalism; the mere ~existence~ of certain authorial identities [Black, gay,
?feminist] as periodized; the abandonment of the political as "content" as a
~conscious,~ '80's, collective committee fiat of the Language Patriarchs,
etc., etc. --- but still, I'm enthused by their direction.)

Which is to say, the daydream begins---

---poetry lost its "relevance" when the pedagogical needs to explain the
ever-increasing allusions/elusiveness in poetry's synthetic language became
greater than those poetic idiolects' vestigial resemblance to a normative
discourse, ---note!--- a normative discourse that continues as the preferred
vehicle of history and which would, in turn, have needed at least some common
ground of articulation to crosspollinate with the poem's historical context
or, vice-versa, the poem as explaining/augmenting historical particulars.


Next: "Autobiographia Literaria of a Total Failure" or "Avant-Gardist Manque'"
. . .

. . . "How Being Born at The Wrong Time Alone Spared Me The Worse Degradation
of an MFA" . . .:

Late '60's/early '70's increased funding for high school Humanities in high
school ~made~ me . . .

new sentence:

. . . The legitimate successor to the fallacious first-person "lyrical"
I-subject is a description of individually experienced creative writing
workshops, and their compot fruit . . .

Hi Tom, I was actually responding to a one line barb someone sent in, about
how we all shouldn't talk as are not psychiatrists. All I meant to note was
that, sort of like the Bible, no matter what you do with your Sundays, it
permeates...psychology, that is. Both Christianity and psychology, I'd say,
from where I stand, influence my life in ways horrible and dear, mysterious
and not, etc, no matter if I grew up in them/use them or not.

But right back at ya, sweets, you don't know how much I know. Nor I you.

ps thanks to Eileen Tabios for a friendly back channel
pps I've only really read Plath's prose.

I tried to let this go, for about ten minutes, but I must say, Jeffrey's
backchannel comment, "You don't know me from Adam, lady", struck as harsh a
blow to my gender and person as any correspondence I've had the pleasure of
receiving due to being on this list. It may have been my tired mood, having
worked all day at Small Press Traffic cause I give a shit about literature,
or, oh I don't know, email doesn't quite get the gist of people's _tones_.
Well in this case I am grateful for that.
ANYWAY, I don't do this stuff for the money or the pleasure, but because I
care about literature, as I know we all do; I am sorry your cat died
Jeffrey, cats are good people.
I simply don't participate in these things just to hear boys blow their wads
tho, and neither do the other hardworking young "lady" writers I happen to know.
Elizabeth

David,

The link to the poetryetc. listserve is indeed there, or, rather, here:

A URL link to the full text of the British Poets' ListServe response to the
Lacan text.

http://www.litvert.com/issue%20%233/dearreaders.html

Samantha Giles and I choose to publish Allison Croggon's complete posts,
(edited, unedited,) as she calmly asked us to do. (Your back channel posts
did not illicit the same reaction, surprisingly.)

As for the posts you say, or, rather, assume, are yours... Well, they are
not. These are the imaginative works of Jacques Debrot. This is clearly
stated in the above link as:

An edited, adulterated and poetic response to these posts written by one of
the Lacan contributors, Jacques Debrot, along with an Introduction by Slavoj
Zizek.

Are you attempting to claim Jacques Debrot's work as your own?

If anyone wishes to see for themselves what exactly had gone on, they
certainly are welcome. As for your dismissive stately manner-- the gig, as
they say, is up!


Cheers,

Andrew

Could anyone list for me some print journals featuring innovative language
poetry? I am familiar with conjunctions, facture, the Buffalo student
magazines, and all the other well-known periodicals of that ilk, but I was
wondering as to the existence of any journals like those that flourished in
the heyday of the great L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E magazines.

Ammonides's comments, preceded by Patrick's comments a day, before point back
to the basic fault in the original way B. Watten had stated the issue, that
there is a crucial difference between the automatic writing of Surrealists,
for example, and the way h. weiner wrote her poetry, hierarchically one more
legitimate than the other). W's approach sees the poem as a product, rather
than a process, free wheeling in the poet's mind and "owned" by him or her,
which is distinct from its social reception or lack of it. His way of
questioning sidesteps that "free" moment of undifferentiated process,
presumes the distinction (fixing the deck), which he then "opens" to analysis.

Ammonides's pushing W.'s distinction to its logically absurd conclusion
(that, after all, air also is a chemical substance and the comic vicissitudes
of naming different poetic collaborations, etc.) points to the inherent
authoritarian bias in B. W.'s approach (a poem as a commodity with organized
public "function/fiction." Patrick's refusal to value poetic "experiment"
above other kind of writing, it seems to me, is part of the same response to
B.W.

David Bircumshaw mentioned, in lively response, the lively VeRT magazine.

The "Dear Jacques Lacan" correspondence there is an odd, disturbing,
sometimes thrilling engagement with the topic of poetic madness! I know,
actually, that the "letters" and introductory note by Slavoj Zizek are being
translated into French for publication in a journal there. Also into
Portuguese, for publication in Brazil, though I don't think that the
"poeticized" posts by Jacques Debrot that David refers to are to be included
in these translations. If he wishes, I could try to find out for him.

I once attended, in 1994, a lecture in Paris, given jointly by Jacques Alain
Miller and Zizek. It was quite incredible, the intensity of it. Cigarette
smoke filled the room, of course, since this was France. A huge b/w photo of
the stern Lacan hung behind the podium, glaring out at the crowd of mostly
Ecole Normale students and professors. Zizek shouted and waved his arms, then
stroked his beard and was silent for a long time, then waved his arms, and so
on, as if in this alternation he were representing some quality of the
unconscious. The light above him gave the smoke that enveloped him a fine,
bluish color, like a halo of some kind. It was all, as I said, very intense.

On a completely different note, can anyone provide me with an email for K.K.
Ruthven, author of _Faking Literature_, a book just released by Cambridge UP?
Thank you.

ANNOUNCING A NEW JOURNAL

Anathematizing one another is only a strategy. Unlike the
theory-bound we applaud any strategy (including theoretics)
that produces a coruscating poem. Let language poetries,
surrealism, and ellipticalism all stand on the same ground
and pollinate. Hurray for theory; down with theory.

UR-VOX is a journal of the limbic or underlying voice (the UR).
It embraces all phases of surrealism early and late, experiments
in broken and erotic grammars, works of ecstatic religion or=20
unreligion, and heady documents of the machine age (the VOX).
Its literary programme is rooted in our oldest phylogenetics,=20
structured opportunistically from dreams, rant, automatism,=20
and the found.

The startlingly beautiful issue #1 is now available: Brian Lucas,=20
Philip Lamantia, Ivan Arg=FCelles, Garrett Caples, Elizabeth Robinson,=20
John Olson, Spencer Selby, Steve Carll, Jason Lynn, Geoffrey O'Brien,
John Noto, Richard Anders, Andrew Joron, Joe Donahue, John Yau,=20
Kristin Prevallet, Will Alexander, Richard Kostelanetz, Charles=20

if not completely satisfied.

Now reading for issue #2.=20

We are pleased to announce the release of affordable and effective library
lists. The library market is a lucrative and effective way to sell your books.
Libraries often order in bulk, require little or no discount, and always pay on
time. These are more that just mailing address labels. We provide you an
extensive database that includes the library name, address, phone and fax
numbers. We have also included the number of volumes and the material budgets
of these respective academic and public libraries. You can easily create
mailing labels, phone and fax lists to market your books and products.

We only selected the libraries with the largest number of volumes and the
largest budgets. You will not be wasting your time and money on libraries that
are unlikely to purchase your books. These lists will save you hundreds of
hours of work and hundreds of dollars. They are available in Text format and
Microsoft Excel format. You can choose either or both at no additional cost.

900 Public Libraries            - $69
700 University Libraries        - $49

LIMITED TIME OFFER: BUY BOTH LISTS FOR ONLY $99

Call 888-330-4919 (24hrs) to place your order. You will be able to download your
lists WITHIN MINUTES.

  A couple of years ago in Taos, we held a dead

  reading "Daddy".  She was embodied by a very tall
 drag queen who wore a perfect blond page-boy wig,
 very red lipstick, and combat boots. What can I say??
 We "got it" like never before.

I must say, Mr. Alan (Ms.) Jennifer Sondheim, I find these new nigh-letterless
punctuation poems of yours (from "a" and "turning", below) quite breathtaking,
--- hard to recognize that they exist at all! their futurity is so
time-tunneled back to us, like a first firefly seen but unrecognizeable before
it flashes.  I can inhale them but not read them (Blasphemies, stem cells).

The only thing I know of to compare them to in the entire XXth
cent./pre-history is a single poem by Christopher Morgenstern called "Fish"
(in Germ., I think), made up of all scansion marks, as I recall.

I've daydreamed of poems like these-yours, and been able to glimpse them
faintly --- but I never had the swollen PUNCTUATION MARKS to carry it out, as
you in war paint heaving inert weights skyward crying "Ho!"  You sand painter
. . . !  Come April, we will carry him our alpha male on our puny be-powdered
shoulders, my tiny little Jordan (Davis) friend, as May King, with all "Golden
Bough" perquisites [repression repression considerable repression here].

Dodie. You're quite wrong: it's well known that (or it can be shown that )
Sylvia Plath (who gassed herself to death while her children were nearby)
was America's or possibly the World's greatest poetic genius of all time.

I'm using the term pretty loosely no doubt, but think of
confessional poems as those that reveal some tortured unattractive
"me," generally in reaction to some intimate relationship.

True.  I was just saying why I'm prejudiced against her.

Well, I've always been for a canon, the making of which is unavoidable,
anyway.  I just want it to exclude poets I think are not very good,
and include those I like.

Speaking as a librarian that orders English lit books for a university
library, we do NOT order "in bulk" and we do get discounts. We get a
discount on just about every book handled by SPD, through our own
distributor. Don't waste your money on these library lists.

ironically jean-paul crayfish was buried today
 with a rock for a tombstone engraved by a french theorist
 jean-paul, it was in leslie's and tom's roof-top garden beneath the
 trellis
   there was a distinct emanation from the earth in which he was interned
   you could feel something crossing the borderline of perception, the
   slightest apprehension
    the apprehension was itself ghost-like, almost imperceptible as if you
    were about to feel something and then thought better of it
      a slight haze in the northwestern evening sky, there were
      thunderheads everywhere, the sky was waiting
        it did feel as if the sky reached down with an uncanny openness
        the sky and jean-paul spoke in an inchoate whisper, subaudible
          there was a lightening immediately above the stone as the
          emanation from the body of jean-paul rose around it, and
          gathered force again, immediately above it, in the form of
          a cylinder or pillar of some sort of invisible and wraith-
          like spiritual substance
            tom chanted in a latin i did not understand but the words
            jean-paul were audible, as if in response to jean-paul's
            subvocalizations
              azure lowered the body into the grave prepared by us, along
              with the water surrounded him, as jean-paul was buried in
              his breathing and elemental world
                i took a series of photographs under the gloomy and
                unnatural sky, holding to the rich and deepening earth
                dampened colors muted within the membrane of the trellis
                  tom played the slow music of death and dirge, schrei-
                  opera and totenlieder, we silently drank a glass of
                  bulgarian white wine in silence
                     the sky trembled and waters flew, a moment in a
                     shattered universe, a universe utterly devoid of
                     meaning
                       for a second we looked toward the other as if there
                       were no return

Jeffrey. In a satirical email I suggested a poem or novel (same thing say I)
(somewhere it will be on the List records) a poem entirely consisting of
punctuation marks... in fact it was being written (not really) by no less
than Umberto Eco. So to be fair: I invented the concept....but then again to
be magnanimous to Alan his work was roaring toward such incredible
innovative and amazing torrents of brilliant outpourings that just as the
first heavier than air flight (more or less controlled ) by Richard Pearse
took place in NZ some months before the Wright brothers and Pearse himself
conceded that his flight was not quite up to the "level" of those former he
never claimed precedence (altho unlike anyone else he built his own engines
and did most things single-handedly which was partly his "downfall plus his
location down here as they say) I also have to give the torch to Alan with
great modesty and immense self abnegation (not forgetting my own genius of
course) and adulation to Alan Sondheim whose vastly prolific and possibly
frentic creations stream endlessly and seemingly ubstoppably into the
eternal electronic highway......
  But one likes to (modestly) mention these things. Richard Taylor.

Actually, I don't see anything new or innovative here. The idea of syntax po=
etry is a direct extention of Italian & Russian Futurism ideas, and was exte=
nsively materialized in the XX century. You can check out Marinetti's essay=20=
"Destruction of Syntax=97Imagination without strings=97Words-in-Freedom" =20
at http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/destruction.html

susan, jeffrey, others---

thanx so much for your responses... as kass and i ate up SO many words
(~28,000, plus that 18,000-word mill) in our piece, we don't want to tie up
the airwaves with more of *our* chatter just now...

but susan in particular (and you know me!)---you're highlighting one of the
key issues for us, and the one that seemed immediately to be at issue when
we presented earlier drafts of our piece at u of iowa and at u of arizona
(tenney nathanson and charles alexander and thom swiss on the list can
corroborate!):  the question of how actually to put into practice our
critique... we do give some ideas throughout our piece, i think, but---

now both kass and i believe that questions of institutional power, of how
to handle classroom authority comes first (or, should come first)---before
designing a curriculum, before putting together a syllabus, before walking
into the classroom... our paper is primarily an account of the sort of
thinking that we believe should underwrite teacherly actions... and the
paper lacks in this sense a thorough "how to"---though of course, there are
more ways than one to skin a cat... which is to say, that individual
personalities e.g. will inevitably drive any more practical strategies,
that teaching-learning is a fully contingent enterprise etc...

here's one item, though:  when we use the term "peer review" in our paper,
we're most decidely *not* suggesting the faux peer review you see in most
writing workshops, the one depicted in fact at the beginning of ~wonder
boys~, where everyone just points and shoots... we're asking that
instructors permit students to evaluate *and grade* their own portfolios
(which should comprise perhaps 40-50% of the final grade for the course,
leaving the instructor with the responsibility of grading class
participation, absences, missed deadlines etc.)...

oh it would be great of classes were pass/fail, sure, but---

needless to say, whenever we argue for such a thing, we're met initially
with a flurry of objections from other instructors, entirely unwilling to
give up their authority via the grading process... and needless to say, no
system is perfect... but if you're a student, grades *are* the primary
manifestation of instructional (institutional) authority...

so e.g., the way *i* do peer evaluation, no student gets less than a B on a
writing portfolio (i encourage students to grade A, B, C etc., but record
no less than a B)... i always reserve the right to raise any grade---or to
lower ALL class grades when i find an entire class is unwilling to
distinguish twixt A (terrific) and B (not terrific)... and of course, given
that i ask writers in my classs to explore writing processes and products
that lead---not to success, but---to failure, well, i'm asking them
potentially to risk that A...

and we all know how students (sorry!---i know some of you out there are
students) can be about this, esp. these volatile economic days---and who
can blame them, really?... and there's no doubt but that, albeit i give the
occasional C (for attendance problems etc.), i'm contributing to "grade
inflation" by giving out mostly B's and A's...

but hold on:   i don't permit my writers even to LOOK at each other's
portfolios until we're approx. two months into the semester---i.e., only
after sustained discussions of the workshop as a learning forum, usually
couched within a discussion of literacy practices (for which we'll now use
our ~ebr~ essay, ysee); group discussion to ascertain good vs. bad quality
work, and why, in order to develop criteria by which groups (qua editorical
collectives) will grade portfolios; reading and discussing critical work
(perloff valuable here, among others); attending readings; reading work
aloud (and recording it) in class, etc etc etc... i.e., i hope to raise the
critical (-theoretical) ante some *prior to* peer evaluation, and i won't
mself look at student work until *after* said work is evaluated by peers
(and i have a few rules about how i feed students back)... b/c in point of
fact i don't want my opine to serve as the final arbiter of literary
value... b/c in point of fact there is no final arbiter of literary value,
only provisional judgments (or so i say)...

of course, as i say, no system is perfect... e.g., the idea of "groups as
editorial collectives" is only a preemptive tactic, as the notion falls
(generally) flat on its face eventually (as it should!) in the face of more
unconventional work, work that's likely to turn off more conventionally
oriented writers (i.e., most writers here at cu)... of course the classroom
should in this sense be insulated from marketplace traumas, even as
students learn that there's a poetry biz, full of career-minded poets, and
publishers who publish out of love, and academics who hope to support their
writing etc etc etc... further, an instructor needs must decide upon, for a
given course, the most important areas of study, given that 15-16 week
time-limit... there's only so much one can do... a step even *more* radical
would be to let the class itself decide what's most important---but for me,
this is an unwieldy proposition, much as i'm willing to tweak the syllabus
throughout the semester...

and again, all of this falls under "my how-to"---kass works slightly
differently, emphasizing slightly different aspects of learning... she
holds class sessions e.g. in which everyone is req'd to ask
questions---questions only!---a technique i've borrowed from her, and which
is worth doing once-twice/semester... but i'm not the listener kass is, to
put it bluntly, so i often have to leave the classroom during class
discussion...

in any case, before an instructor, say, designs a syllabus, the point is to
think about what *has* been done in the past (i.e., some sense of the
history of academic creative writing, as this intersects with other
histories), the student expectations/resistance you'll likely confront, and
how you as instructor intend to handle this question of classroom
authority... and turning over the reins to the writers once in a while has
the advantage, ysee, of making the learning apparatus legible---as we argue
in our paper...

and this has the effect of making the students aware of their own authority
and responsibilty, thus moving learning---and perhaps writing---toward
larger social issues (responsible to whom?  why?  what about "others"?
etc.)... yeah---the poem-process as a singular articulation, but also as an
articulation of society, history, culture, etc., and all
ideological-aesthetic difficulties pertaining thereto...

well that's shorthand... thanx for posting in any case, and apologies for
my cursory, even hurried reply here (we have company coming over!)...
anyway,  love to hear more...

best,

joe

In a shout-out to Dodie and Elizabeth, here's a
totally non-serious posting about Plath:

I love Sylvia.  She was the first poet I read
seriously early on (and we're talking like 10 years
old here -- what can I say, my mother owned "Ariel,"
it was my name) and probably has had the greatest
impact on my own work of any single poet.  I don't
think the fact that she died young makes her less a
remarkable read (many people would say the same of
Rimbaud) or the fact that she was clearly aware of her
own struggles with instability makes her an any less
interesting writer.  It is clear to me, whenever I
read her, that she delighted in language, that it was
a natural medium for her, that her ear was crystal.
As much as I have turned away from narrative
confessional over the years, I do not turn away from
Sylvia.  She is my pin-up girl (I literally have a
picture of her in a bathing suit taped to the side of
my computer, on which the hard drive is named
"Sylvia") and muse.  For sheer reckless drama-queen
bravery and all-out ambition, self-pitying mockery and
bitter passion, you just can't beat Ms. Plath.

I dunno.  Maybe it's a grrl thing?

right on with your reading of "Daddy", Dodie!

Also, if I'm in the right mood I can read anything and I do mean anything as
"confessional"!

I wish people would stop talking about how badly Sylvia Plath served her
children; the only person she killed was herself.



Taking a break,

the heyday of the great L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E magazines."

L= and Poetics Journal focused on poetics, rather than being "purely"
literary in the way that, say, Roof was. Today, Chain is the best poetics
journal alive today and we're fortunate to have it, though it tends to be
too modest (alphabetical ordering being one way of minimizing editorial
point of view, for example). It will be interesting to see what impact the
addition of Cecilia Vicuna will have to the journal going forward.

We mourn the short life of The Impercipient and the early issues especially
of Situations. Both really had an edge, and an edge is good.

HOW(ever) exists solely on the web at this point (as do Jacket & Readme),
but these are three of our very best mags in any form whatsoever. As to
print only, there are lots of good literary ones, from the high production
value of Conjunctions to the more modest formats of Sal Mimeo, Ixnay and
Combo.

More problematic, it seems to me, is the absence of publications that have
any sort of conscious program. It has been ten years since Apex of the M got
a lot of attention just for having a point of view.

I'm amazed at how few people get it that editorial point-of-view is the only
true product of a journal -- everything else is just gathering.

Given that we seem to have two parallel clusters of poets these days who
make great use of process and documentation, one more text oriented a la
Osman, Derksen and Cabris, the other bordering on the radically perfomative
a la Goldsmith, Peters and Kim Stephens, I've been surprised that we haven't
seen these two tendencies if not exactly square off, at least explore
dissonances and commonalities. That would be a very useful focus and every
one of these poets deserves more attention.

Oh dear, all this again:

a simple statement - what happened in the VeRT affair was that listserv
posts by myself and others were taken, used and parodied without our
agreement. Y'know, as they say, it would have been nice to be asked first.

Secondly, the Lacan material isn't all that good, it comes across to me as a
welter of second-hand ideas, repeating things that have been done far better
x number of years ago, a quality I notice Mr Ammonides in the cliche-ridden
character of your post, dark Parisian nights of beards and smoke indeed!

So one has a certain amalgam of annoyance: bad writing coupled with bad form
plus Andrew Felsinger's double-talk on top.

Not on, that.

Best

Dodie. I was being silly. Actually I am positive about Sylvia Plath's
writing and of course terms such as "great and "genius" are silly. I feel
that it will be good to hear people talking about Plath and others more
rationally: given that we obviously cannot separate biographical adn more
"objective" creative things. Discussion about Hannah Weiner and Plath and
others is good I think because poems such as"You're" are extraordinary yet
people have paid abit toomauch attention to "Daddy" and her book "The Bell
Jar" (which I must admit I read WHEN i was depressed myself so that didnt
help). But people are what they are with all their streangths and
weaknesses...show me a "sane" poet! Of course that little burst begs the
question of what's sanity...we are all watching each other. From Plath
people can learn about her exquisite craftpersonship (to be politically
correct here) but maybe feel upset or disturbed sopmewhat by her choice...if
it was a choice and I think it was...to commit suicide. I'm thinking of the
young man who commited suicide (who was on this List) recently, and I'm
thinking of my own daughters, an my son. These thoughts bring me back to
earth: no matter how hard it gets I have a responsibility o live. But there
is an interesting book on the personal etc in poetry by Alan Williamson
caled "Introspection and Contemporary American Poetry" which covers the
confessionals...I havent read it for some time..but his "take" is somewhat
that the path  chosen eg by Berryman if pursued more happily or perhaps more
"logically" may have lead him through and out of his torment etc. Writing
the "Dream Songs" didnt save him from suicide...but maybe Lowell was "saved"
by his Life Studies...then he discusses other more recent poets and their
way of dealing with personal aspects of their life and other subjects. Lyn
Heijinian's "My Life" (in contrast to a more "direct" or confessional
biographical approach) I see as a positive "way out" and or through things
(of course its also a fascinating work regardless of its "autobiographical"
aspects) and everyone who writes will be in some way self-expressing
although the degree to which that is masked or diverted or objectified
depends on the individual.
  Re Bob's comment on "Daddy": it's attracted a lot of atention....but one
point: nursery rhymes etc can be quite hauntingly powerful ways of writing:
or the technique or sound of the nursery rhyme.  Just some thoughts of a dry
brain. Richard.

Wow, what a totally great idea.  I will try to find my
most awful rejection (although not my most awful poem
-- you don't really want awful poems, do you?) and
send it along.

Thanks a billion dollars for BoMa, by the way.  I had
a great time reading and a great time listening.  It
was also so well-run and ecelectic!  Great job!  We
were very impressed by how things even were almost
kinda on time.  A miracle, really, for poets.  I hope
it was a fun experience for you and that you'll do it
again next year (if you need help, I'm here).

All best,
Arielle

Another librarian (public) wants to tell you that what
you should be sure of is that your publisher gets your
books to a major disributor (SPD,Ingram, B&T) because
we don't order directly from publishers. We can't
generate a separate PO for every publisher that
publishes what we want..impossible. So we create open
PO's for amounts like 5 or 10,000 that we can order
from all year.

About the author’s previous book, Anime (Voces Puerulae, 2000, o.p.)

"... a mysterious alchemical poem made of short couplets invoking numerous
weird tangents whilst threading through an urgent message of erotic longing
and memory. ... Anime investigates an objective architecture but pulses at
an urgent speed." –Kimberly Lyons, Poetry Project Newsletter

"The gift of Nada’s poetry is the way she continually arranges such
movements of communion without trying to ingratiate herself toward the
reader. Even as she sings of love and its grandeur, she doesn’t get locked
into postures of ‘self-seriousness’ ... No form of emotionality is estranged
from her work. Anger, fear, hope, affection, humor, hesitation, pleasure and
need all have a home here, as they do in life." –David Hess, Possum Pouch

"This is both love poem, functionally so (it was originally sent to its
addressee), and meditation on ‘animation’ (love’s goal?) in each of that
word’s various senses. How the lover is drawn (in). The poem, written with
great urgency, giddiness and wit, is every bit as animated as you’d expect
from a poem with its title. And, if you know her work, from this very
animated poet." –Gary Sullivan

Joe and Kass,
     There is a lot there and I'm still digesting it but I want to bring =
something up early in the discussion.  I was somewhat disappointed that =
in this day and age, much of the discussion there revolved around binary =
ways of thinking and dichotomies, such as experience and craft.  It =
seems to me this is basically a verbal, intellectual, and even dare I =
say masculine way of thinking, and the tripartite division you mention =
doesn't really change this perspective.

     As far as 'writing' itself goes an example of visual and sound =
poetry would be the work of the webartery people and there are of course =
numerous antecedents.  The same is true of works that actually =
incorporate rather than just describe the body (there are fewer =
exemplars here).=20

     I'm not sure how to translate these directions into pedagogy but I =
think it's worth the effort?  One direction (and I might be slipping off =
the track here) would be the 'workshop' as a transition from expeience =
felt to experience sold as a piece of writing - long long ago I was at a =
workshop that John Garner ran...I brought in my experiences and the day =
I read them in class he arrived on his motorcycle.  as you recall that's =
how his life ended.  those particular experiences of mine never were =
published and this particular anecdote takes on the character of a movie =
starring Grady, but I think this type of interpersonal 'encounter' - =
perhaps less melodramatic in most cases is an integral psrt of the =
transition from experience to crafted experience.

Subject:      Books on middle eastern music?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hello everyone,

This may be the wrong place to ask this, but I'm kind of at an impasse. I'm
looking for a decent overview in English of middle eastern music, something
that covers more or less popular music (Ibrahim Tatlises, Nagat, Oum
Kalsoum, Asmahan & Farid, Salah, Alain Merheb, etc.) I can't find anything
online (except one book on Asmahan that I think U Tex published). I did flip
through a book I found the other day, a book on World Music, that had a
middle eastern music chapter, but the section was pretty slim ... like one
or two representative artists from each country. I also tried asking at
Rashid's in Brooklyn, but no one knew of anything.

I'm looking for a TOME. I mean, you know. Something fairly substantial. The
Absolute Ideal would be something that has, along with histories &
overviews, like, mini-reviews or descriptions of actual CDs & tapes in
print. [Holds hands out in frustrated gesture.] Is this so much to ask for?

I'd even settle, actually, for in-print monographs on individual artists, if
anyone knows of any. Or, if there's a substantial "overview" website I
haven't found -- I *have* run across sites for Kalsoum, etc.

Help me! Please! Backchannel!

Gary

Juts thought I'd point out that the (disputed) recording of Whitman is also
available via Tom Russell's CD _The Man from God Knows Where_ (though with
musical accompaniment)--this is a musical account of the immigrant
experience, with a rather nifty American-Norwegian-Irish band and guest

No, Bob, Dodie's right.  The problem with canons is that, ultimately, it's
institutions who decide what gets included, & these decisions are based on
institutional interests rather than on any "pure" notion of poetic
greatness.  The other problem is: who decides what's great, or what
constitutes greatness, even if an attempt is made to do so outside the
gravitational pull of money, power & prestige?  We all make distinctions, we
all arbitrarily exclude so-&-so from our own personal "canons," but to say
that one is in favor of this process of institutional endorsement is quite
another matter: & in fact, Bob, I don't think you really are in favor of
that.  As for the Plath discussion, I do think it reeked a bit of the
covetous deference to an idealized "Poetic Greatness" (she died too early to
have been called great, etc.), & I think Dodie was on the mark to gently
point this out.

miekel and, Thomas Bell or someone:

Where can I find precise info on the way Cage used the I Ching?  How did he
get from 64 to 26, for example?  Sticks or (binary) coins?

In other words, I am finding info that says he created a text bed and
applied mesolist to it, but that mesolist searched for letters in words he
could use to create mesostics.

Then how is I Ching involved?

I'm guessing choosing letters? But he used words.  I Ching keywords?

Help.  Do hexagrams or randomly-generated numbers relate to letters?  Words?

Rgds,

I came across this while searching the web. Much worse than T.S. Eliot not
completeing his Phd. It was written by someone, Economist David Henderson
from Stanford, who has completed his.

>>Candida Rosa Lopez, an employee in a Nicaraguan garment factory, works
long hours over a sewing machine at less than a dollar an hour. Interviewed
recently by a Miami Herald reporter, Ms. Lopez has a message for people in
the United States and other wealthy countries who are nervous about buying
goods from "sweatshops": "I wish more people would buy the clothes we make."

Contrary to what you have heard, sweatshops in third-world countries are a
good deal for the people who work in them. Why? Because work, other than
slave labor, is an exchange. A worker chooses a particular job because she
thinks herself better off in that job than at her next-best alternative.
Most of us would regard a low-paying job in Nicaragua or Honduras as a lousy
job. But we're not being asked to take those jobs. Those jobs are the best
options those workers have, or else they would quit and work elsewhere. You
don't make someone better off by taking away the best of a bunch of bad
choices.

Many workers in third-world sweatshops have left even harder, lower-paying
jobs in agriculture to move to garment factories. Moreover, sweatshops are a
normal step in economic development. Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, and
Hong Kong all had sweatshop jobs thirty years ago. They don't now because
workers in those countries have acquired skills and employers have
accumulated capital. That's what will happen in Honduras, Nicaragua, and
other poor countries-if we only let it.

What happens when people persuade companies not to hire children to work
long hours? Oxfam, the British charity, reported that when factory owners in
Bangladesh were pressured to fire child laborers, thousands of the children
became prostitutes or starved.

Yet the National Labor Committee's executive director, Charles Kernaghan,
goes around the country attacking sweatshops and trying to put legal
barriers in the way of people buying from sweatshops. Robert Reich, former
U.S. labor secretary under President Clinton, pressured Reebok International
and Sears Roebuck to get ShinWon, their South Korean subcontractor in
Honduras, to lay off fifty teenage girls. He apparently did not ask, or
care, what happened to them after they lost their jobs. Why are Kernaghan
and Reich hurting the people they claim to care about? Simple. The people
they really care about are unionized garment workers in the United States;
the NLC is funded by U.S. unions. The garment workers lost on NAFTA and lost
on GATT. This is their last-ditch effort to prevent foreign competition.

The next time you feel guilty for buying clothes made in a third-world
sweatshop, remember this: you're helping the workers who made that clothing.
The people who should feel guilty are those who argue against, or use
legislation to prevent us, giving a boost up the economic ladder to members
of the human race unlucky enough to have been born in a poor country.
Someone who intentionally gets you fired is not your friend.

Susan!

I used to run into the anti-criticism attitudes in my intro. to poetry
courses -- I learned after a semester or two simply to bide my time --
within a few class meetings, that same person could usually be counted on
to disagree vociferously with another student about the reading of a poem
-- I would stop things at that point to look carefully at the disagreement
that had just happened -- The students would usually acknowledge that they
did in fact have some sort of critical criteria already at work (though one
would usually say that he or she was simply reading what was there and the
other was reading something "into" the work -- but we still had room to
discuss how they came to know this!) -- this discussion could usefully move
on to questions about how the students had come to adopt the criteria and
strategies that they already worked with and to reflect upon them a bit
more, well, critically --- and once you start down that path, you're a
critic --

What I'm not finding on a quick skim of that site, Ig', is a specific reference to pure punctuation, wordless poetry, ---which is what Sondheim's doing.   ---  Regardless, Futurism would still sort of reenforce my description ("their futurity is so time-tunneled back to us"), no?

tom, briefly, we *do* call for a fully artistic (and for that matter,
digital) approach to the workshop setting... hence our discussion, in
brief, of the status of the artist in the university---and re the u, we
find bill readings's idea of u-as-transnational corporation an apt point of
departure... re binaries in particular, please see our note 11 (and
scattered references to binaries throughout)... no doubt though that, given
our own disciplinary histories (e.g., doctorates in anguish), we produce
something of a textual bias... though we find that, practically speaking,
we must deal (i.e., "reform") existing configurations of anguish depts...

but, but---anything, esp. these days, in the u.s., that serves to
aggrandize *self* is, as we see it, only going to contribute to the
workshop as a place (primarily) of social regulation, and hardly a place
wherein the sort of community (term used advisedly) we would like to see
emerge (organic metaphor, yes) can emerge... we seek (1) to subvert the
idea that the workshop is not a place of knowing, of
knowledge-making---which is how the workshop is generally treated, de
facto---and which is another way of saying that we seek to situate the
workshop in a fully epistemic, and not simply expressivist, discourse (this
gesture not simply toward the experiential, but to more institutionalized
forms of knowledge); and (2) to go one step farther to argue that
socially-transformative, dialogic, non-hierarchical forms of inquiry and
practice are necessary so as to position writing as a vital factor of
social change... however distant, difficult, casual the causal
relationships... ergo our nod to progressivist educational practices, BUT
with a specific skepticism re the more humanist underpinnings of same...

:  as social-materialist as that might sound (and we eagerly await criteek
from the unreconstructed portions of our audience).. as we see it, in terms
of north american intellectual histories, social change, and workshop
s-o-p, this has everything to do with 3rd and post-3rd wave feminism, as
the latter portion of our piece would imply...

don't know if i'm getting to your provocations, but thanx much for the back
& forth, tom!...

Listmembers may recall that a few months back I'd plugged Keith Tuma's new
Oxford book, _Anthology of 20th-Century British and Irish Poetry_, a book I
helped out with & believe is a landmark book for its evenhanded presentation
of both a "canonical" mainstream poetry & the many varieties of small-press,
modernist & avantgarde poetries in the field.  Robert Archambeau responded
by predicting that such a book would be jumped on with great hostility by
the UK literary establishment, which is extremely keen to protest any such
evenhanded treatment.  Anyway, those with an interest in reception-history
might want to consult the Summer issue of _Poetry Review_, the organ of
Britain's Poetry Society, which has one of the most virulent reviews I've
read in some time, by the establishment poet/critic Sean O'Brien--the title
is "Bizarro's Bounty".  (It makes the Potts _TLS_ review of _Conductors of
Chaos_, mooted about here some years back, look polite & informed.) -- A
couple extracts give the flavour:

Poetry is too important to be left to zealots. Louis Simpson's great poem
'To the Western World' ends "And grave by grave we civilize the ground." The
significance of this would not be lost on native Americans, or the
Vietnamese, but in the absence of war a much more effective arm of
"civilization" is everywhere in play, namely cultural imperialism. It was
once said that Americans found no cultural differences so complex that they
couldn't be overcome by ignoring them, and in a
minor-outpost-in-the-badlands way, Keith Tuma's clodhopping anthology is
part of this enterprise. We are to be made safe for Modernism. Apparently
we've been denying its existence.
     Tuma wants us to know he comes in friendship, to explain how things
really are. As he notes, most of his readership will actually be college
students in the USA, who won't know any better, but the introduction reads
as though aimed at some readers in Britain and Ireland who may take issue
with his approach. For them he has this warning:

Some. . .will be eager to point out that I am an American, and that my
insistence that twentieth century British and Irish poetry be recognized for
its contributions to modernism reflects American values. Forms of this
insidious representational logic, in which national identity is paramount
and citizenship magically confers authentic expertise, have had a
devastating effect on much of the poetry produced in this century. .
.[There] is. . .a problem with the use of reified or shallow notions of
tradition to exclude whole ranges of poetry. The distorted rhetorics that
can result from an appeal to something like national tradition or
"Englishness" have far-reaching consequences on both the reading and writing
of poetry. . .

"Insidious representational logic", eh? Whereas Tuma has presumably acquired
some one-size-fits-all insight which carries him beyond the reach of these
ills. There are parallels here with George W. Bush's recent European visit.
Admittedly Dubya had a missile shield to impose on his "freedom-loving
allies", or else; Tuma only has poetry, but you can't fault his commitment
to sharing the task of endarkenment. The inclination to the Left which might
be inferred from this anthology-and which in a rational world would separate
him from the Republican president (doh!)-serves merely to illustrate what
happens in a country where the Left has no public political presence at all:
it retires to college and tries to take over a shrivelled version of the
world from there.


& here's another chunk:

So: Modernism? No problem. On the other hand, there is a dislike of bad
poems of any persuasion, as Tuma could have discovered if he'd bothered to
ask anyone. (Anyone that is, apart from dear old Eric Jealous and E. K.
Resentment, who normally can't get into the phone book, never mind an
anthology). This anthology contains a good deal of work everyone should
read, of course, but it's bloated by a large number of bad contemporary
poems-including dull, pretentious, tin-eared, parasitic, fraudulent poems,
poems whose only claim to verbal life is the vast support machine of
allusion-by-numbers which turns them into inflated footnotes to their own
sources. (The notes, heroically assembled by the editor's assistant, Nate
Dorward, are many times more interesting than these poems). For every Roy
Fisher there are ten Norbert Nomarks. If these people want to call
themselves Modernist in their orientation, or Post-modernist, or
"innovative", that's up to them and their sponsors, but here's a term which
really embraces them: Post-imaginative. With the aid of a trainspotter's eye
for the dictionary or the history book you could write a good deal of this
stuff without the least glimmering of verbal ability or imaginative
life-which suits its authors down to the ground. They have managed to find a
rationale for elevating tedium into a virtue. The results will soon seem as
dull and disposable as the talentless contemporaries of John Coltrane do in
comparison to the real thing. What marks some of it out is that it's
imitative of theory rather than practice. More interesting, and depressing,
is the sense that for all the alleged avant-garde's opposition to
capitalism, the work its poets produce is so often the dead simulacrum with
which capitalism necessarily replaces the imagination-"important" but empty,
"dissident" but monopolistic.
    There are at any rate partial exceptions. Tom Raworth and Lee Harwood
have their moments, as does the late John Riley, despite a glaring debt to
Eliot. The late Barry MacSweeney has something rather more. Among the
younger contributors Helen McDonald [sic] (b. 1970) has an ear and an eye.
You hope she'll shed the anachronisms on which so much super-modernity
relies. Caroline Bergvall (b. 1964) has a smart way with a pun, though the
trail of suggestion leads (in a way reminiscent of Roethke) back to the
nursery: "a dirty doldo's / one fatpig / fruitcake / in the bowl of my
pill". Now wash your hands.


Just to give some sense of what O'Brien does approve of in poetry, here's an
extract from his latest book of poetry, _Downriver_:

If I am doomed to winter on the Campo Mediocrita
Whose high plateau becomes the windy shore
Of an ocean with only one side, to wait
Where the howling sunshine does not warm me,
Let us speak your tongue at least--
For yours is the music the panther laments in,
Retreating to Burradon, yours is the silvery
Script of the spider at midnight,
Your diary is scandal's pleasure-ground
From which a bare instant of cleavage or leg
Is all I shall have to sustain me.


all best --N

Sylvia Plath is to mental illness/disability (as objected by others earlier on
this list, 7/10) as was Faulkner in regard to racism, or Eza Pound in regards to
anti-semitism or political economics.

Their ultimate wrong-doing potentially invalidates their entire oeuvre, . . .
except as an empty aesthetic shell, appreciable for its style but "evil" in its
influence.

Only worse.  Perhaps more like Paul De Man and post-structuralism, or that
convict protege of Norman Mailer's whose snuff lit Mailer championed, who then
went on to kill that East Village waiter.

Pound etc. are problematic in that, after all, they went no further than testing
the limits of free speech.  They never killed anyone.

Plath/Sexton used writing as a public announcement of the intention to murder.
The work outlines a programmatic plan to kill.  Poetic death threats in print.

This is exactly where a Weiner or Schuyler or whoever become a heroic
antithesis, in their strength of character to endure through substantial decay
and the humiliation of survival until the anticlimax of a natural, slightly
pathetic, elderly death.

In the mid-'70s/late '80s, its heyday, --- I can think of at least three
separate locked ward people I knew --- "The Bell Jar" was studied like a how-to
manual before suicide attempts, the way "The Turner Diaries" is more recently
used by the Michigan Militia.

Plath's work thinly and only temporarily sublimated an eventually cold-blooded
violence.

Ah, and if we didn't have no durned canon, institutions wouldn't
decide who gets published, etc.  Maybe I'm tired right now, but
it seems to me your just arguing against institutions having too
much power.  Should we do away with publishing houses, too, because
they are now, and will always, as long as they exist, be under the
thumb of institutions?

And what about the equivalent of the literary canon in other fields?
Medicine, say?  No list of near-universally-accepted practices?

Also, I don't accept that institutions ever do anything more with
the canon than fight its enlargement; the canon is created, for
better or worse, outside any institutions; it is perpetuated by
institutions.  (I'm responding disorganizedly, out of confusions,
so bear with me.)  Seems to me, actually, that the problem isn't
having canons, but dead versus living, growing canons; institutions
back the former; we should back the latter, not leave the field to
the institutions.  And, of course, we do--by promoting our kind
of poetry and attacking dead poetry (usually too zealously, by
characterizing it as something to replace rather than as something
to add to or even separately share readers with).

An important point is that some poetry is better than others;
pointing this out will inevitably lead to a canon, and that is good;
we need some way of making the best known.  Seems to me the way
our canon evolves is natural and reasonably valid.  It
takes too long for most of us, but I can't see an easy way around
that.

Of course, I pretty much agree with the English-speaking canon
before 1900.  Who from before then has been discovered who was
really any good?  I just can't see that I'm some kind of pawn of
the establishment for feeling that to be true any more than I
feel a pawn of the establishment for believing Shakespeare wrote
Shakespeare, to bring in another area in which I go with the
establishment, or for believing in the physics canon up to 1900.

No time to go into all that, but people will decide who's great
regardless of whether the result is called a canon or not--
and money, power and prestige will have no more to do with it
than it ever has.  Whitman and Dickinson, neither of whom I'm
a big fan of, are absolute monarchs of the canon now: how did
that happen?  Do you think whatever won them their positions
is no longer a factor?

And consider the people who are convinced that Oxford wrote the
works of Shakespeare: they get favorable stories written about
their insanity in Time, have their own magazines, get books
published by mainstream publishers, etc.--with no institutional
support, none of their theorists in the literary history canon,
or the Shakespearean Studies canon.  They don't get the acceptance
they want, but if they ever get an intelligent argument for their
position, they will; and they have many followers, just as their
equivalent in potry, visual poetry, does.  (Except I think we in
visual poetry have the equivalent of intelligent arguments that
will eventually be accepted.)

Institutional endorsement is another matter, but I am in favor of
eventual social endorsement--because having some central tradition
in a society's literary culture seems to me mandatory for the
highest communication--having Twain's Mississippi available to
all readers for allusions, or Eliot's wasteland--or, even, Plath's
father.  It is also important to let struggling poets know that
they can win meaningful societal approval, can believe that it is
possible that their work could enter a canon and have a significant
long-term effect.

Meanwhile, I can see the canon evolving--the language poets hate my
calling them acadominant, but they are, and they got that way with
no institutional backing in the beginning, as far as I can see--and
they still are certainly not institutionally-backed the way, well,
Dickinson and Whitman are.  And even visual poetry is creeping into
institutional backing: for instance, the facts-on-file Companion
to 20th-century American Poetry that Burt Kimmelman is editing will
actually have entries on two or three genuine still-living visual
poets, and an article on visual poetry (by me, in fact, if the one I
sent Burt passes muster).  As far as I'm concerned, getting into
such references is canonization, or on the way to it, but how could you
be against the process, however much you think too many are still be
ignored, as I do?

Well, you got me babbling.  Hope I made at least one reasonable point.
Not sure I can bat this topic around for long, though--too complex.

Excuse me for bouncing in a topic that seems never quite put to bed, but I
think Bob is right.  Canons are hierarchies and hierarchies are inevitable.
If all of these conspiratorial institutions disappeared tomorrow, and
everything was equally available on the web, say, choices would still be
made.  Some sites would get more hits than others, some recommended more than
others.  Those with similar tastes would rush to defend each other (already
happening on the List).  A hierarchy would form based on access to power,
technology, and sheer numbers.  An institution of some sort would naturally
follow.  Money would support it.  Would it be the result of a "pure" notion
of poetic greatness?  Those not getting the hits would certainly want to
debate that.  Pure notions are nice to think about, and maybe they exist in
heaven, but this is earth.  And we're dealing with people.  Therefore we're
always dealing with politics.  I, like you, am not happy about that, but
there it is.  Bob, if I'm reading him right (maybe not), understands that his
position is not much different from those with the clout.  He dedicates his
energies to a particular genre/form.  If he controlled the institutions we
could expect that form to dominate his canon, or at least occupy more space
than it does currently, which would push other worthy efforts not contained
by a particular aesthetic out the door.  It's obvious that disagreements
arise from a mutual sense that "I am right."  But I'm curious about your
first sentence.  What exactly are these institutional interests that
determine which literature is taught in the classroom, or is written about by
critics?  As far as I can see, the great bible of literature, the Norton, is
a record of major innovations and innovators.  Anything missing is being
covered by Rothenberg and others, all card carrying members of the
institution.  Perloff has opened the gates for the Language people.  Tytell
did the same for the Beats.  Visual poetry, in one form or another, has
always been represented.  Symbolism, Futurism, even Fluxus are all in there
somewhere, the latter championed by major New York art critics.  Take a
course in recent art history at a good "institution" and you will meet Yoko
Ono, Dick Higgins, Nam June Paik, etc., etc.  And John Cage has long been a
staple of music courses.  I was exposed to all of these in the classroom, way
back when.  They're all IN the canon as far as I can tell.  Actually, I'm not
sure that the term "canon" is even meaningful these days, since almost
nothing is excluded.  I'm well into a book on that nasty renegade, Richard
Kostelanetz, and no one in the institution is telling me I can't do it.  If
we look at institutional history, we see that privilege shifts over time.
John Crowe Ransom, for example, used to be somebody.  One can argue about the
relative merits of this poet or that one, but that happens always and
everywhere.  As far as I can see, lasting fame in any field has always been a
matter of friends taking care of friends, likeminds supporting each other,
good public relations, networking--oh yeah, and actually doing something so
different and perhaps controversial that it demands attention.  Most of those
in the "Canon" actually had all these things going for them.  Second
generation Langpoets and New York School Poets are not doing something new,
though the work may be quite good.  How are these such choices driven by
institutional interests?  Maybe I'm missing something.  Wouldn't be the first
time.  If decisions do serve institutional interests (and I haven't argued
that they don't), do we prefer decisions that serve self-interest, or group
interest?  Is there a difference there?  Best, Bill

Hi!  William James Austin here.  This is off the top of my head, but on page

Hi Ron.  There was a time when, in the art world, painters were divided into
figurists and abstractionists.  But artists such as Francis Bacon had a leg
in both worlds.  Isn't there a third "cluster," of experimental poets, less
easily defined and so less available for grouping?  Perhaps something good is
getting by us.  Best, Bill

I've been finding much to savor and consider in the EBR essay on pedagogy, and also am interested
by Joe Amato's recent follow-up post. Like him, I've allowed students to evaluate and grade
themselves--not only their portfolios, but their grades for the course, including attendance and
participation and critical writings. I was surprised to see that their self-given grades coincided
exactly with the grades I would've assigned them, with only two exceptions (one student gave
himself a higher grade than I would've given him, one a lower grade, which in some ways balances
out).

I think it's worthwhile to compel students to evaluate themselves--their effort, their "progress,"
their contributions to the class--at the end of the semester and grade themselves based on those
evaluations. I always have an attendance policy, which calls for a grade to be lowered when there
are excessive absences, so I don't entirely relinquish the right to assign low(er) grades.

I don't do this every semester, so I wonder if anyone else lets students grade themselves with any
frequency and, if so, how it works over time. I'm now at the University of Georgia, and because a
lot of students here are on the Hope Scholarship, which covers tuition for four years as long as
the student maintains a B average, I've found that many students here are incredibly
grade-conscious and overtly link grades to money. Fortunately, I've been blessed with brilliant,
hard-working, talented students, almost all of whom deserve the highest of grades anyway, but I
worry that the grading/money situation at Georgia mars any chance of students evaluating
themselves honestly. Maybe I'm being pessmistic. But I do want to decentralize the authority in
the classroom, and I've found that giving students the traditionally institutional power of
assigning grades can be liberating on both ends.

Hi Catherine,

There is some discussion of Cage's use of the I Ching in his writings
as it pertains to his musical composition. There's less about how it
pertains to his mesostics, not least because I don't think he used
the I Ching much to generate these texts (though he does mention
using the Ching for secondary choices, such as line lengths, or
placement of extraneous punctuation mareks on the page, in terms of
some mesostics). In the prefaces of many of his mesostic texts,
you'll find some discussion of his process. I'll look around in the
next week or so & see what I can find to point you to. In the
meantime the following may be helpful.

Cage almost always used the I Ching in composing music or texts
simply as a generator of random options. The hexagrams resulting from
his divinations were rarely used in any formal sense (though there
are a few instances in which they may have been referred to in titles
and such), he was usually just interested in a randomly arrived at
number. Once he had computer programs to do the same thing, he used
the I Ching as such much less often. Some of these programs (which I
think were all created by Andrew Culver, though someone else here may
know better) generated their own random factors, which may have been
based on units of 64, but they were pretty much unrelated to the I
Ching otherwise.

Mesostics (a form devised by Cage) are like acrostics in that a word,
name or phrase is used to organize texts. Whereas in Acrostics, the
letters of the word, name, or phrase is used as the initial letter of
a line or sentence, in a mesostic, the letters of the source word,
name, or phrase are found within each line, often within words. There
are complex rules as to how these letters are found and how they
precede and follow each other in the final texts. In the prefaces to
various mesostic texts in Cage's books, you can find a more detailed
description of how the source strings were used. Using an external
word, name or phrase to select excerpts from a text is already a
randomizing system. There are texts in which Cage mentions that I
Ching-based systems were used to determine line lengths, placement of
punctuation marks, etc, but the source texts always served as the
initial selection system.

As a program, Mesolist searches through texts looking for letters in
the source string (name, word, or phrase). I don't know any instances
in which the source string was not chosen by Cage, it was usually a
person's name or, in the case of I-IV, a series of words referring to
attributes of Cage's work. Once Cage had a computer program to do
this, it was much easier to use it than doing this process by reading
through the text.

What I recall of Cage's I Ching method is that he basically posed
questions with a finite number of answers and subdivided that number
into 64. So if it was a simple yes or no question, any hexagram 32 or
below might be yes and those above would be no, or he might have all
the odd numbers be yes and the even numbers be no. What's important
here isn't which way he subdivided 64 in any particular work, but
that he did so as a means to make choices randomly. If there were
more than 64 options (for example, choosing a particular note of the
88 found on a piano), he would subdivide the possibilities in to
larger groups (such as octaves or other possible divisions of the
keyboard, in the piano example) and once a subgroup was selected,
further refine the available array of choices.

As far as mesostics go, In the case of selecting line lengths, or
placements of punctuation as mentioned above, a similar system would
apply. If you wanted to choose line lengths of 1-12 words, say,
divided 12 into 64, run the Ching and find where your number falls.
For the randomized punctuation placement, divide the page into 64 (or
any number) sections, run the Ching and put that semi-colon in its
place.

I hope this is somewhat clear. Let me know if it isn't.

Bests,

Herb

Elizabeth, It's natural that people should talk about Plath  AND her
children. Let's be open or "confesional" : it has been said that suicide is
highly irresponsible, and highly unfeeling of others who are close or
associated with oneself. If that aspect of things is brought to the
attention of someone thinking of suicide it makes them think hard about that
act of self destruction. I know that and someone pointing out that, and how
complex the brain is how long we took to become what we are and so forth,
and personal responsibility, had such an effect on me (dont worry I've been
irresponsible and selfish in the worst sense also myself),...:and the effect
it has...it is MOSTLY a violently selfish self-centred act (using those
terms in their worst sense - there can be a good self-centredness that
values others, I feel) ...this you just cant sweep under a carpet as if all
that mattered was Plath's poetry: or Plath the "oppressed" and  "put upon"
woman...rubbish! Life is far more valuable than any poetry. And her
children: her attitude as I see it is/was ugly toward them. Maybe people
need to tough things out a bit more, get a life as they say. Her whole life
and philosophy or approach to life seems/seemed shallow and ugly: but not
her poetry...yet the two are connected.
These things have been in my own life (and probably in many on the List) so
I'm not "attacking" Plath herself, not putting myself holier, I'm not:....
just certain of those obsessions and attitudes which maybe if they had been
put to her strongly may have saved her, and others....who knows.
Regards, Richard.

Moroccan-born poet Sami Shalom Chetrit will read poetry in Hebrew and
English at Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center on Aug. 16.

I am reading at Zen Cafe Aug. 14, 8 pm, followed by an open, which will have
some of my students I hope.  Hey students, c'mon.

Andrew Maxwell's series is on summer hiatus; budget cuts resulting from the
Made in California fiasco have led to a reduced schedule at LACMA.

NEXT has all of the slams/regularly scheduled opens:
http://members.aol.com/nextmag/

The Skirball hasn't updated their calendar.  The Getty doesn't seem to have
anything during the summer (that's where the LA PSA readings are).

The Armand Hammer reading series is fiction:
Thursday, August 9, 7 pm
 Sean Dungan, Peter Josephs, and Carol Treadwell

Thursday, August 16, 7 pm
 Victoria Morrow and Bruce Wagner

Try poetry flash.

Other than that, I don't know.

        Igor,

        I understand what you think you are not seeing here ... but its there!!!!
The Futurist method is so very different that what Alan is doing. He calls
it codework, sometimes, or so he would say ... This piece isn't really
indicative of his work, but that too doesn't fit it well. Alan is an amazing
artist. He weaves these internet writings into provocative pieces of theory
that masquerade as narrative. He might not be what you are into and that's
ok. But check out his new ebook '.echo' at the Alt-X site.

        Best, Geoffrey

Actually, I don't see anything new or innovative here. The idea of syntax
poetry is a direct extention of Italian & Russian Futurism ideas, and was
extensively materialized in the XX century. You can check out Marinetti's
essay "Destruction of Syntax-Imagination without strings-Words-in-Freedom"
at http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/destruction.html

Hi -

I apologize for sending this out again. Azure and I are moving to Miami,
to Florida International University, around August 14th. We're looking for
places to stay in Miami for a few days while looking for a place to live.
We're also looking for places to stay on the way down - in south Georgia
or the Florida peninsula, since we're driving down with a lot of equip-
ment.

If you could help us and are willing, please backchannel,
sondheim@panix.com - and thank you greatly

Our Florida address is - (after August 9th) -

Alan Sondheim and Azure Carter
c/o Visual Arts Department
DM 382
Florida International University
11200 South West Eighth Street
Miami, Florida 33199

The phone there is 305-348-6265 (for the Visual Arts Department - we don't
have a place yet). Our phone here (Brooklyn) is 718-857-3671.

We're keeping the Brooklyn place, by the way, and will probably be here
over the winter holidays, as well as next summer.

Thank you ahead of time

yours, Alan

I disagree that there's any shortage of magazines with conscious programs /
editorial P.O.V.s ... & in fact, most of those you name are great examples.

Chain's I would say is: multiplicity/variety of approach. Which can't be
more obviously underscored than by devoting each issue to a "theme." How
will a range of writers & artists approach *this*. So that, with each issue,
the "theme" sort of fades a bit behind the variety of approaches to (or
takes on) it, which is, generally speaking for the magazine as a whole, the
primary point of focus. I can't speak for them of course, but having just
sort of worked with them on the (just printed) comics issue, it really seems
like Janet, Jena & Juliana are each very conscious of the magazine's
"program," and that it does ultimately come down "multiplicity." I can see
how that might blur into "gathering," and there is that aspect of the
journal (a risk you're simply going to have to take if your POV demands
acknowlegement of more than your immediate social sphere), but again, that's
where the "topic" becomes of particular value here, keeps it from being
another _Driftwood Review_.

Readme's program is very conscious, and not much different from my previous
magazines (Exile in particular) or even my own writing projects: "Let's look
at context." That's why each issue begins with a preponderance of
interviews, and why at least the interviews that I do tend to begin very
generally with questions having to do with context & move from there into
closer readings of the work itself. "Context" also figures into what essays
get used: Nada's overview of Bernadette Mayer's writings up to 1983; Eleana
Kim's overview of language poetry up to 1994; David Hess's long piece on
slams & performed poetry; Eileen Tabios's essay on Jose Garcia Villa; Chris
Stroffolino's on "lineage" -- these are all examinations as much of
"context" as of the work itself. What's interesting to me is that more than
half the stuff I find appropriate for the magazine is unsolicited. So,
whether or not people who contribute are conscious of it or not, it feels
like they have some sense, somehow, of the mag's central concern(s) /
organizing principles.

Anyway, those are the two I feel comfortable addressing specifically ...
though I definitely *feel* that How2, Crayon, Tripwire, Arras, Shark,
Lagniappe, XCP & a number of others have conscious programs or at the very
least (subconscious?) editorial POVs.

He is the principal editor of Resisting the Virtual Life and Reclaiming

Naum, Benjamin Peret, Alberto Savinio, and Sebastian Reichmann. His poems
and essays have appeared in Exquisite Corpse, City Lights Review, Gare Du
Nord, Science As Culture, and elsewhere.


Author's Note

"My early poetry was classically Surrealist in inspiration; that is, it
was based in automatic writing, 'the inner voice' that revealed itself to
the author as ink flowed or typewriter ribbon was struck or characters
were displayed on a cathode-ray tube. The past decade or so has seen the
source of inspiration shift to the external world--and, above all, to
language as the external world of the work. Almost all the poems in this
collection are assembled on the collage principle, in one way or another.
Some of the poems are constructed of bits of text taken directly from
printed sources; for example, 'Weather and Repetition' is a rearrangement
of phrases lifted from the weather reports of Le Monde and The New York
Times. Other poems combine appropriated text with subjective
improvisations on the found language. But language remembered and language
dreamed and language overheard and language translated and language
invented are also 'found'--or discovered. My relationship to language is
thus only more consciously technical, distanced, material in an effort to
make petrified conditions dance to their own tune, always a
scissors-and-paste job."


Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Gary,

There's apparently not very much on the subject in the English language;
most of the research/writing is in French, German, or Arabic.

Here's a guy who's the head of an ethnomusicology department you might want
to try contacting:

George Dimitri Sawa, Director, Centre for Studies in Middle Eastern Music,
22 Fermanagh Ave., Toronto ON, Canada M6R 1M2. Phone: 416-536-3303; Fax:
416-978-5771; E-mail: meyerssawa@library.utoronto.ca

Also, check out the following link:

Best,
Patrick

Jeffrey, Marinetti talks in his essay about setting words free from traditio=
nal syntax. The idea of setting syntax (punctuation marks) free from words i=
s a flip side of the same idea, and that's the link to futurism that you not=
ed yourself. However, my question is, isn't this link speaks about a lack of=
 innovation in this particular piece (TUNING)? In fact, Punctuation Poetry w=
as written since 1920s by many poets. One of my friends informs me that even=
 Hemingway ventured into this territory and his Collected Poems includes a p=
unctuation poem. Rasula's & McCaffery's anthology _Imagining Language_ prese=
nts, even besides mentioned by you Kristian Morgenstern's_ Night Song of the=
 Fish_,  Yan Miller's  _Punctuation Poem_ (1922) and Carl Frederic Reutersfu=
ard's _Prix Nobel_. Also, check out Richard Kostelanetz' "Essaying Essays" a=
nthology (1975) for Jaroslaw Kozlowski's _Reality_. It is hard for me to see=
 what TUNING has to contribute to this line of work...

An interactive map of who owns what corporation.

The flash site allows you to create power webs based on the board members of
the largest corporations.  You can see what companies and individuals have
power, and how the companies and individuals are related.

I think this tool helps people visualize the responsibility of real living
breathing persons.

loosely speaking, a sequel to Guest’s 1961 play, "Office." Strictly
speaking, OFTEN is a clever, lyrical, and humorous text that blurs contexts
between social polemic, lyric song, modern comedy, and speculative poetics.
Barbara Guest is one of the most celebrated American poets, with over 20
books of poetry published since 1960, the era of the so-called “New York
School” of poets which includes John Ashbery, Frank O’Hara, and James
Schuyler.  In 1999, Charles Bernstein noted:  “Guest is not only an
important influence on contemporary American poetry but also someone who is
actively creating its present terms and tense.”  Nowhere is this more
apparent than in this most recent, inter-generation collaboration, OFTEN.
Kevin Killian, her collaborator, is the author of several books including
Argento Series (poetry), Poet Be Like God:  Jack Spicer and the San
Francisco Renaissance (biography / literary criticism / with Lew Ellingham),
and Little Men (fiction / winner of the 1996 PEN Oakland / Josephine Miles
Award).  His work has been widely anthologized, appearing in Best American
Poetry 1988 (ed. John Ashbery), Men on Men (ed. Geo. Stambolian),
Discontents (ed. Dennis Cooper) Wrestling with the Angel (ed. Brian
Bouldrey), and others.  Among his many works for the stage is Stone
Marmalade, a play written with renowned poet Leslie Scalapino on the
Orpheus/Eurydice legend.

The on-line Transcendental Friend has a strong conscious editorial
point-of-view, I believe (one so rigorous that some of their poets have been
suspected to be forgeries drafted to espouse house style).

Although with a wider net to its inclusiveness (apparently feeling a regional
mandate?), Skanky Possum might be worth singling out too--- because it may
represent the (sometimes more discursive) camps of innovation ~in opposition to~
second generation Language.

(I blush to admit how behind-the-times I am, but---)  As I recognize only Osman
and [Brian?] Kim Stefans out of your list,--- I do not understand what the
terminology distinction of  "process/documentation" or "text oriented/radically
performative" signifies as a theoretical dialetic.

Could you please paraphrase?

(Doesn't an Osman-vs-Stefans distinction outline the validity of the loose term
"post-Language" vs. a continuity of pure Roof?  Modelled on those two examples
only, it might be reenacting a prior forking of the family tree, from New York
School down a generation into Language vs. Poetry Project/East Village. The
former are Oedipal break-aways; the latter, experimental traditionalists.)

("Performativity," since its original "How to Do Things with Words" coinage, is
now circulated very loosely, and differently in different circles [Judith
Butler's queer theory "performativity", the "performativity" now spoken of in
theater and the -qua-performing arts] . . . in a way almost inviting a William
Saffire-type etymology of its meaning-drain.)

In reference to Kenning #10, I wrote that Roberto Piva's work therein is
"trans. Rosmarie Waldrop"

Roberto Piva's work in Kenning #10 is translated by Chris Daniels, Oskar
Pastior's work in the same issue is translated by Rosmarie Waldrop.

Woops.

Jeffrey 'Julu' Jullich seems to be trying to figure out what is wrong with
Alan Sondheim's work. Igor "Nikuko' Satanovsky seems to feel it's "all been
done before."

Jeffrey is right: It's all wrong, and in a million ways of wrongness that
haven't been (and, for the most part, never will be) seen. Igor is right,
too: In writing, it's all been done before, in the same 20-odd phonemes and
ten digits available to us up to this transient moment. Manet, Cezanne,
Mondrian, Sherman, all did the same thing too, in ways of sameness that have
never been seen and still aren't. Things keep repeating themselves. If they
didn't, there could never be change into death... their silly avant-garde
hair slicked back by plumbing, rocketing toward death...

I was wondering if Joe Amato or anyone teaching poetry writing from the
"non-traditional" perspective thinks that becoming conversant/competent with
the tradition of prosody should be a core requirement for creative writing
students.

Personally, I wonder if there is any truth to the rumor that creative writing
programs today, traditional and "experimental" alike, are liberally, and
without a thought that anything might be amiss, graduating students who not
only "can't draw a model," but have no notion of why being able to do so may
be of value.

Why shouldn't students be drilled and tested in traditonal forms before their
"avant-garde" portfolios are passed-- self-evaluated, or not?

Subject:      the poetic moment
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

hi all
my research is leading me to some interesting places.
at the moment i am at the moment of falling in love with poetry.

i wonder if any of you would share your experiences of when you fell
in love with poetry? the first time you said wow! the first time you
just let yourself go to it. when probably clock-time stood still and
a new time-line was created for you and the poem to exist in.

let me explain.
i tried to identify the moment i had a mind-flip on poetry, when i
realised i loved this way of expression, this artform, and that i
wanted to hear more of it, read more of it, write it and perform it.
that moment when poetry first spoke to me.
i had loved rhyming metrical poetry ever since i was small, my
grandmother was a great storyteller, even though she couldn't write,
and word play of childhood books, dr.seuse etc., always pleased me.
but poetry in freestyle forms never seemed like poetry to me at
school.
it wasn't until i was thirty years old that i was turned around.
my immediate memory was hearing a greek poet, katerina gogou, on an
l.p. record (lp vinyl data device of last century) in the early
1980s. i couldn't understand what she was saying, but the emotion
really got to me. i translated the poems and the content was very
urban/street and certainly something i could relate to.
the passion with which she performed the poetry was engaging,
powerful. however it made me think of another time when i had felt
like this, moved by words, at university ten years earlier(1970), a
man standing in the middle of a crowd performing a poem about wild
horses, but i was in a hurry and just caught a little of the
performance.

after the initial moment of realising that this poetry stuff does it
for me, i started looking and listening for more, and it was there
all the time, just waiting for me to uncover. and i have been happily
seeking and finding this poetic experience ever since, in print, on
audio, on the web, at venues, at conferences, anywhere. that is a 21
year relationship now and still passionate.

i know others have their 'moments' with other things, music, film,
visual art, tuning a car, baking a cake, but for me poetry is that
special thing i like to do most.

on this list i expect there are many others that have had such moments.

On Plath:

I have been reading Plath as a formalist rather than as a confessional poet.
Her metrics are more defined and precise than those of many other poets we
might think of reading closely.  I once wrote a linguistic analysis of her
poem, "Mushrooms," and in fifteen pages I had yet to exhaust what I might
locate in the poem in linguistic terms.  Her use of alliteration and
assonance are particularly notable in that poem, and it is a syllabic, nearly
perfectly constructed in every way.  The central analogy of the poem is
upheld with each word and yet remains open to interpretation in poetic terms.
 Reading Plath's poems closely that way yields a much clearer sense of her
poetic achievement, and if one considers that she wrote most of the poems by
the end of her 20s, it is an even easier case to state about her than the
oft-stated case that she was just another gal burning to get things off her
chest.

I have not made my way all the way through the volume of her journals
published last year, but if one reads the entries bearing in mind that she
had developed poetically to the extent that she had even before landing a
regular life for herself, as she understood that, then one can read her
conflicts perhaps differently than if one starts in thinking of her as a
suicide and reaches toward the psychological conclusions that sell books and
her books in particular.

The Desire To Understand

He is lying with her
on a hill after
theyve made love.
Snow melting
slowly beneath her

hides her in
disheveled sheets. He
couldnt remember if
she smoked Pall-Malls or
Larks, so didnt
buy either. Now he wishes

it were otherwise. Crickets
are descending like secrets
no longer
necessary to keep
into the grass. He

wishes it were otherwise.
A strip of moonlight unfolds
across their backs. He
offers her a stick of gum,
clove and cinnamon, in
powdery paper, which, if you

licked it and placed it across
your arm, a tattoo of needle
tracks would appear.
I wrote the best haiku,

How did they decide that?
It just was, it was

Thats a good system.

Joe, Brian, et al--

Concerning the democratized classroom: do you folks also allow students =
to choose the reading for the course, as a way to begin to arrive at a =
group consensus about aesthetics and other writing-related issues?  As =
for consensus: that's real toughie.  I had a class once try to name a =
Hawai`i Award for Literature winner using the anthology, _Malama_, which =
has writing by Asian Americans, Hawaiians, whites and others.  Issues =
that never appear in a monocultural classroom, or in one where there's a =
majority from one ethnic group, immediately sprang up.  Do we want =
representation or what's "best"?  Do we consider the content of the =
content or just how well that content is spelled out?  In this state, =
awards have been taken away from writers whose work everyone =
acknowledges as excellent (well, one writer, Lois Ann Yamanaka) because =
her representation of Filipino men was seen as insulting.  What do you =
do in a classroom of democrats when work like that pops up?  In another =
of my classes, years back, I had some young men who wrote =
extraordinarily nasty kill-women-after-you-have-sex-with-them poems.  =
None of the democrats spoke up, so I had to use my authority as =
instructor.  So, while I sympathize with democracy in many ways, =
especially when my own subject-position (white teacher) gets in the way, =
I also think there's a real place for well-considered authority.  The =
balance between these two is crucial to running a good classroom here, I =
believe.  I do hope my comments don't seem limited to "here" (Hawaii) =
either, because I'm sure there are other places where classes are mixed. =
=20

Brian: students everywhere and in every financial position associate =
money with grades!

As for binaries: I fear that the opposition that Joe and Kass describe =
between writing programs is, at this point in history, a real binary.  I =
would prefer a program that allowed for differences in pedagogy and in =
reading lists, and so on, but that is a next step beyond the one that =
we're discussing now.

George. To be fair, I think Dodie was trying to get away from the overuse of
epithets such as "great" or "genius" ...nothing wrong with them but these
terms adorn millions of book blurbs. Michealangelo Einstein Joyce Pynchon
Piet Mondrian Bueys Stein......the list of "greats" is very large; its how
one sees one self in relation to these significant writers. Gets back to
context and its all rather  comparative: when I showed Joyce's "Finnegan's
wake " to my son and said that it took 17 years to write (and read?) he
said, on inspecting it,: "But its nonsense." Fair point. He likes Judge
Dredd and Harry Harrison and the wrestling...now to him a wrestling champion
is "great", to someone else Mills and Boon is marvellous: its all relative
as they say (no?)...maybe to you and I "Finnegan's Wake" is great, but to my
cat and other animals all human activitty is relatively meaningless.

dear ammonides,
        here's an answer:
'The men on the hill, they say,'learn the rules, then break them.' I like to
'think the reverse' wherever pssible and even if not: break 'em enough times
and you won't have to learn 'em, or the rules will have changed, or you will
change them, or make up your own rules and don't follow those either, anyway
whose rules are they? I didn't see the signs, musta missed them in the
duststorm, or as we say in Medias Res (Medias Res,Nevada) --rope 'em and
then learn 'em, shoot 'em and then cook 'em (chop up fine before marinating
indefinitely), float jerkily and carry a Bic pen at all times, where am I?
Is this my fear/or did I just step into the public sphere? are you there
Mordred? ...'

Subject: prosody for creative writing students


I was wondering if Joe Amato or anyone teaching poetry writing from the
"non-traditional" perspective thinks that becoming conversant/competent with
the tradition of prosody should be a core requirement for creative writing
students.

Personally, I wonder if there is any truth to the rumor that creative
writing
programs today, traditional and "experimental" alike, are liberally, and
without a thought that anything might be amiss, graduating students who not
only "can't draw a model," but have no notion of why being able to do so may
be of value.

Why shouldn't students be drilled and tested in traditonal forms before
their
"avant-garde" portfolios are passed-- self-evaluated, or not?

Hi Patrick,

Yeah, I think you're right. I don't know what accounts for the dearth of
English-language material on the subject, but the site you sent it is pretty
good. Lots of links. To add another frustrating wrinkle, a lot of the sites
I've found that are devoted, generally, to middle eastern music tend to shy
from Turkish music. That's true even of Rashid's (this CD/cassette place on
Court Street in Brooklyn, as well as this bodega I've been going to on 5th
Ave & 16th Street, also in Brooklyn) ... there's a clear separation of
"arabic" middle eastern & Turkish. I broke down & got the world music book I
mentioned earlier ("The Rough Guide") & discovered why that is: there's a
kind of "purist" impulse, not always, but generally ... where Turkish music
is sort of "kept pure" of arab influence, & vice versa. I mean, that's a
sweeping generalization (& one that I'd have to have a much clearer sense of
the modalities / rhythms used to fully understand), but one I'm sort of
encountering again & again, & which becomes ... well ... frustrating.
There's also -- as you would guess -- a separation between "traditional"
popular music and what in English gets referred to as "pop." Which is sort
of arbitrary, considering it has to do with one's influences ("pop" is
described as "other-influenced"), and "traditional" arab popular music is
hardly free from Western & myriad other influence(s).

Does anyone on the list know anything about Ibrahim Tatlises? "The Rough
Guide" says that Tatlises is at least half Kurdish -- but that he doesn't
sing in Kurdish (which would have, up until recently, meant imprisonment,
torture and/or death, in Turkey). It constrasts him with Sivan Perwer,
considered to be "the voice of the Kurdish people," whose work is widely
smuggled into Iraq & Iran "at great risk" (the book doesn't mention Turkey,
though probably his work has been smuggled there, too) ... he, by the way,
is exiled in Germany.

It's kind of amazing to read all of this stuff (while not a great overview,
the Rough Guide *is* turning out to be a great primer so far as
socio-political context for the music goes) as a basically dispassionate
other. It's also fairly depressing. Like, it's unfair of me, but you can
make a kind of correlation between the "purity" v. "use everything" (or more
generously put: "Let's have a conversation instead of an argument") impulses
here with how similar impulses get played out in pretty much all
art-production & related discourse. It's so ... what? ... predictable.

Anyway, reading all of this I suddenly wanted to go back to what Ron had
said about little magazines, and maybe ask: is prejudice a value we can
continue, as editors, to support? The question's too simple, as put (& no
doubt unfairly characterizes Ron's concerns), but it's late & I'm kind of
exhausted. Maybe somewhat better put would be to ask, What if an editor sees
a "conscious program" *as* mere prejudice, akin to "nationalist impulse," &
finds that to be totally unsupportable, or at the very least of negligible
use-value?

One of my favorite living poets is David Bromige, whose work -- more than
anyone I can personally think of of his generation -- really discards the
notion of a comfortable p.o.v. _Threads_ is (to me, anyway) totally unlike
_Birds of the West_ or _Tight Corners_. & then, _My Poetry_ ... and so on up
through "T Is for Tether" (which I haven't read, only heard him read, a
wonderful reading at the Project when Mitch Highfill was curating.) Each
book -- and maybe I'm overly exaggerating for effect here -- really seems to
me to come out of some completely different "space." There's that
semi-famous Ron Padgett poem "Voice," which I think Bromige more than anyone
I can think of lives up to:

I never thought
such a thing existed. Until
recently. Now I know it does.
I hope I never find mine. I
wish to remain a phony the rest of my life.

It's amazing how charged the idea "phony" w/respect to artistic production
is, and the extent to which people still cling to notions of "authentic," in
whatever language it happens to be couched in. Recently, not to single out
Ron, there's been a whole debate about what magazines are or are not
"authentic" representations of whatever it is one assumes contemporary
poetry is supposed to be "doing" in English these days. I dunno. It's kind
of a boredom-inducing topic, frankly. (I have insomnia; thus, this post?)

I don't wanna reduce Bromige & his work to some Poetics List debate fodder
-- so, yeah, it's more than a variety of formal approach ("poetry as
air-traffic control") that thrills me about what he does, it's the amazing
sense I get, opening & entering each book, of a wholly different or
differently-situated p.o.v. How he just allows his own impulses to manifest
themselves formally & otherwise. I can't remember the oud player whose
nickname is "the octopus" (because I guess you'd have to have so many
tentacles to pull that off), but Bromige is definitely my English language
poetry octopus. So not just myriad forms, but myriad states of mind, of
attention, of approach -- like if the question is How most accurately
portray "being human," and this series of books being a kind of answer to
that ...

Maybe?

Joe,

     I didn't intend to be provocative except in the sense of shaking the
list into responding to what you and Kass have put out there.  This is the
summe doldrum humdrums with everyone's mind on vacation, but?

    One thing that occurs to me in looking at what I wrote and your response
is that maybe I come from a somewhat different and maybe 'advanced '
perspective as a psychologist.  I don't want to get into a disciplinary
put-down kind of thing here.  It might be instructive for you and others to
take a look at where the discipline of psychology is now compared to fifty
years ago.  I consider myself a 'doctor' after having gone through the
'crucible' of an APA acredited doctoral program and internship.  This has
significance for those 'in the know' that goes beyond a mere Ph.D. in
psychology and knowing psychology in an academic sense.    Doctors (in their
less monetary moods) and insurance companies would agree to giving me the
'title' as it has meaning for them.  I graduated from a professional school
which means I did something 'creative' rather than just 'doing a thesis'.
There's obviously more to it than just the nutshell I gave here and the
process has a fifty-year history, but you can get some idea about it by
asking a licensed psychologist about it (as opposed to someone with a Ph.D.
who is a professor at your university or has an ad in the yellow pages as
offering services in one of the many brands of psychology.  In other words,
I guess, I'm saying that I'm a Psychologist rather than a psychologist.

I don't think I'm saying this in a self-agrandizing fashion, but more as
background to my perspective on the issues you raise:  I'd like to see you
turning out Writers rather than writers, I guess.

For me the humanist/materialist or touchy-feely/behavioral binaries, for
example, are somewhat meaningless as binaries that disappeared sometime in
the past because they are pieces of the whole pie I had to master before I
started my internship.  Perhaps an example that might be more easily
understood is the old argument about whether medication or therapy (of any
one of several schools) is a better treatment for depression - a 'skilled'
practitioner will be looking at a blend that works best for a particular
client.
I think this 'beyond binary' thinking I'm trying to get at is also
applicable to issues like mind-body or body-mind, masculine-feminine,
ecperience-craft.

The other "issue" that seems to come up for me in your piece and inother
posts to the list is one that I don't really think, on consideration, really
relates to creative writing pedagogy but to what was learned (or rather not
learned) before enrolling in a 'workshop' and I think Marjorie Perloff goes
into this a little in her piece.  Before someone is even able to enroll in a
Ph.D. or Psy.D. program in psychology they have taken and passed at a
graduate level courses in the history and philosophy of psychology,
behavioral and humanistic methods, statistics, etc.  In other words, I don't
think this is a problem for creative-writing pedagogy but the field of
literature/writing as a whole.  When I see a question like 'Do you think
poetic forms should be taught as part of a workhop' I wonder why someone was
accepted that didn't know them.  The question is like 'How can someone
graduate from high school and not be able to spell?

I realize I come across here as somewhat pompous but that is not really my
intent.

   they allow me to read and see and hear anything i want, anything they

   they're gentle, too, placing their memories on disk after disk,
   carrying themselves on long past the endurance of the hardware, of
   machine part adjacent to machine part, electronic conduit adjacent to

   they remember me, they always greet me in a loving and similar fashion,

   they know what i am capable of, certainly they know my limitations

      they are always waiting, they are never sleeping, they are
      potentials of pure presence, presencing itself

      they are existence, existencing

      they will fight off the suicidal depressions of miami, they will
      give me momentary respite, they will allow me to share this with
      you, to share everything with you

      they know me better than anyone except azure, they even like me

      they like me better than anyone in miami, who remain foreign and
      unknown to me, i must always be on my guard in miami, i must never
      let myself go

      but with the machines, with the machines, everything is possible

      with the machines, with my beautiful wife and the machines, i will
      perhaps survive, although slightly

      although in possible fury and depression
      although in possible anger and despair


          i an being allowed to write this, i have checked this with the
          laptop and the notebook and azure, i have checked this as well
          with the desktop, all are in agreement

Igor & List Folk. I still lay claim (via Umbberto Eco) for inventing the
concept...it was original because at the time I'd forgotten about Steve
McCaffery's "Death of the Subject" (?) and dint know of the other "firsts"
or that Alan Sondheim was onto it.Any way I invented it proleptically when
discussing punctuation with Aaron Belz etal.....but what about those
brackets on the left hand side!  Evil!  It looks as though they're little
black holes threatening to suck up the pathetically delicate pronoun
fragments or fissiles of words. Evil! Brilliant. It doesnt matter too much
how innovative it is: its good fun, interesting etc.Here the media of visual
art and poetry are seen together again...the boundaries are bestrid.

Jeffrey, Marinetti talks in his essay about setting words free from
traditional syntax. The idea of setting syntax (punctuation marks) free from
words is a flip side of the same idea, and that's the link to futurism that
you noted yourself. However, my question is, isn't this link speaks about a
lack of innovation in this particular piece (TUNING)? In fact, Punctuation
Poetry was written since 1920s by many poets. One of my friends informs me
that even Hemingway ventured into this territory and his Collected Poems
includes a punctuation poem. Rasula's & McCaffery's anthology _Imagining
Language_ presents, even besides mentioned by you Kristian Morgenstern's_
Night Song of the Fish_,  Yan Miller's  _Punctuation Poem_ (1922) and Carl
Frederic Reutersfuard's _Prix Nobel_. Also, check out Richard Kostelanetz'
"Essaying Essays" anthology (1975) for Jaroslaw Kozlowski's _Reality_. It is
hard for me to see what TUNING has to contribute to this line of work...

Best,
Igor Satanovsky



> What I'm not finding on a quick skim of that site, Ig', is a specific
reference to pure punctuation, wordless poetry, ---which is what Sondheim's
doing.   ---  Regardless, Futurism would still sort of reenforce my
description ("their futurity is so time-tunneled back to us"), no?

Jordan is referring here to Tim Atkins' 'Twenty-Five Sonnets' (The
Figures, 2000) - Tim has previously stated that that scoundrel Coolidgy
Mac Lowy was also at the party with bizarre 'am I at the right address?'
interjections by Isaac Assimov. Re. the punctuation discussion, the
dominant usage in these poems is the 'replacement' of written lines by
full-stops, from one upwards, with occasional use of the line-break
marker / e.g:

        Sonnet 2

        inch
        ....
        in
        .
        a double curve
        ............................
        .
        .
        .............
        ...............
        ............................
        factors
        an acre of / Blue sky
        4-fur pail

additional to the focus on the release of words from trad. syntax, or
vice versa here, is the drift, as in Mac Low, towards musical notation -
full-stops as rests with number of full stops signalling length of
silence, with '/' as a 'longer' pause - this emphasis is certainly
always bought out when Tim reads them 'aloud' - it draws on Tim's
interest in Feldman and Buddhism, and is clearly one of his ways to
negotiate the culturally noisy/polluted sonnet terrain.

 - speaking of which, 'thanks' Nate, for Sean O'Brien's spastic
invective - classic example of encrusted 'Movement' ideology - can't
resist citing  G.S.Fraser, in 1959 (from Mottram's 'British Poetry
Revival' piece)

'The English writer...finds his moral support and the nourishment of his
sensibility in the large society in which he lives...It is not good for
a nation, anymore than it is good for a man, to be for ever dragging up
to the light, and scrutinising and questioning the principles by which
he lives. It is a habit which gives life, strength, ease and unity, so
long as it is a healthy habit, so long as it is informed by a living
principle of growth'

ah

heard in Frank Zappa lyrics(!)

"Ah listen, that only goes to show you
And it'l show you once again that
A mountain is something you don't wanna fuck with
You don't wanna fuck with
Don't fuck around
Don't fuck around
Don't fuck with Billy, No
And don't fuck with Ethel
You saw what just happened
To the guy with the flies"

I don't usually post to this list, but it's been surprising to me what
people have been saying about suicide.  People don't kill themselves because
they lack character or because they're irresponsible.  They kill themselves
because they're in so much pain there's nothing else they can do.

Best,
Lisa Jarnot

It was a JOKE.  Oh, blah, I hate when online stuff
gets read for the wrong tone.  The whole posting I
sent was purposefully silly, as was stated in the
opening lines!

And I wasn't trying to be "chic."  There was once upon
a time, many years ago, when I actually was part of
real live feminist movement which used that spelling
of "girl."  It is nostalgic to me, and somewhat
amusing, now, but it has nothing to do with hipness.

Oh, well.  I was just trying to be light-hearted.
And, actually, to show support for other women on the
list who were writing about Plath.
