Tom,

Poetry books

are great

inexpensive

if you can

I sometimes wonder if there are valid distinctions between public acts
and private acts in this cyber-age. I am tempted to say that public and
private have merged in ways that make many of us uncomfortable.

Still to construct complex works in and share in them an essentially
public arena, to do that and not be noticed -- that strikes me as
demoralizing. That we are discussing the enactment not what is enacted
also might be demoralizing. Part of what Alan seems to me  to be saying
is that not many here seem all that interested in the realities he is
pursuing.

As private space gives way to public space one response is back biting.
The question the Sondheim thread raises for me does concern the very
possibility of maintining the author/reader response frame. I am
interested in how poets negotiate possible positions for different and
differing voices and what I see now is that the most common posture is
largely defensive.

Like Hilton then I too am sorry to see Alan take a defensive posture.

I treasure the links that he sends as windows to a different order of
inter-relation within these electronic spaces.

I am still trying to digest what any of this means to me, beyond the
matter of postures and positions.

As a beginning of substantive response, I might say this much. When I am
seated before a window scrolling through text, my internal editor seems
to disconnect. I hardly ever read straight through something as the
mechanism of scrolling might suggest I should be doing. Instead my eye
jumps around looking for clues or hot spots. I am never sure that I have
chosen to dwell on bits of any signifigance to any one but me.  I think
I want to follow my own path and for that reason I'd rather visit a web
page than receive an e-mail. I'd love to be on a list that accepted html
attachments. I appreciate too the problems of those with machines or
connections that do not support such and wonder if there is not a
technological factor of exclusion, of being excluded that is not part of
the reasons for the response to Alan's work. It is like we are seeing
the work at a level below the level that it is best made available to
us, at a level that is difficult to engage. So that is my substantive
comment: how does the work address the seeming imperative for engagement
versus the temptation to scroll or delete. For me personally Alan's
e-mail texts do that job when I feel I can engage with the Jennifer
persona as some kind of Deleuzian body without organs madly replicating.
And I wonder if one response to the electronic environment will not be
the multiplacation of personae with in each of our otherwise situated
selves.

Just a brief note to say that, yes, if you are in San Francisco
tonight (Friday October 29) and can come to the Small Press Traffic
launch for the "New American Poetry" re-issue, the editor Donald M.
Allen will indeed be there in person making a very rare appearance,
yes, the Donald Allen of Evergreen Review fame and Frank O'Hara fame
and this and that etc.  Along with David Meltzer, Michael McClure,
Barbara Guest, Ferlinghetti, Ron Loewinsohn amd Ebbe Borregaard who
has not read anywhere for 25 years, so if you get this message in
time please come to Small Press Traffic at New College at 7:30, 777
Valencia Street between 18th and 19th (San Francisco).

Whew, I haven't been this excited since Dodie and I chased the actor
David Thewlis through the corridors of SF Airport because I wanted
his autograph, and then it turned out it wasn't him after all, and I
was saying, "But I saw you in 'Naked'!" and this -- impostor -- slash
-- lookalike -- gave me the most appalled look!!!

Alan:

Seems to me that when the List dips into one of its periodic troughs of
despond, it's abnormally tempting to posit 'groups' or 'bodies' (dominant
and resistant) behind the constellations of voices that speak up. Thus we
get notions of the List as a radical province polluted by liberals (or vice
versa), or an avant-garde contaminated by folks who don't hate Pinsky, or,
as you've reversed it, a "new mainstream" unable to assimilate the
groundbreaking work now being done. Though I think you're right that some of
the self-styled avantgardism on this List is hopelessly dated and mainly
self-congratulatory, your work itself always reminds me that particularly in
electronically mediated discourses there are no *essentializable* discursive
groups: rather, what you get are shifting patterns of allegiance and
dissent. Notions of total inclusion in, or exclusion from, the List as
fantasized community seem equally meaningless to me.

It is wonderful, of course, to know 4 or 5 people with whom you share a
passionate mutual interest, particularly if you feel this enthusiasm is
stigmatized in some way by those outside your own immediate circle of
friends.  But seeing the tag "APG" turning up lately with increasing
frequency, I can't help feeling, Mark, John, and Randy, that your
"confederation" (if it hasn't already crossed over the line) is threatening
to become unintentionally parodic.  As it is, the utility of the APG (apart
from giving you all something to do on a Friday evening) strikes me as pretty
blatantly self-aggrandizing.  (Each of you, however, knows the truth or
falsity of this better than I do:  perhaps you should ask yourselves what
exactly it is you experience when you see a reference to the APG included in
a contributors note, or appended to a "controversial" post to the POETICS
LIST.)  In any case, I find these posts much less interesting as your
collective  "assurance" has grown.

But, please--consider this to be a friendly criticism (& perhaps, too, a goad
for you to continue your association along more creatives lines than I have
so far observed).

   Character X says that Character Q has been driven off the list

The idea of deliberate networking, especially among women or engineers or other
non-participants in old boy networks, like that of posting things like RFPs or
calls for papers on the web, is to make the availability of opportunities more
democratic.  They are hardly democratic, but at least closer to this ideal, if
anyone with wherewithal can go to a convention and meet some people and get a
job / get published / become engaged in an ongoing discussion.

What is wherewithal?  What are "aspirations", as the desire to participate in
the dominant culture from a position of relative power, or at least increased
status, is often called?  How is this related to the peculiar will to power that
some have about getting other people to read their poems, schmooze, etc.?  How
does it separate those with it from those without it?  How does it separate
their poems?

How does having Marjorie Perloff's phone number and the wherewithal to dial her
up to invite her out for sandwiches separate one from ... well, (for me) the
other carhops at the root beer stand, but what did I have in common with them,
either?  Why would Perloff care if I called, especially as I'm not "known" as a
"poet" or "critic" (by dint of... publication) and have nothing she wants, since
she has no reason to give me anything I want.  If I really think about it, maybe
I could say, "hi, I ... saw you at PageMothers and the Jerome Rothenburg
reading, but couldn't squeeze through the fawning crowd... just wanted to say
hi, I've read all your work on your web site and appreciate your efforts."  (At
the root beer stand we cut up old plastic condiment jars and printed our names
on them to leave on the trays, so we could tell whose tips, love notes, etc.
were whose.)

If I had this wherewithal, or perhaps if I weren't using mine for other things,
like separating myself from the other former carhops, perhaps everything would
be different.  I am idealizing the network as much as others idealize away what
we're calling the "business" of poetry.  I know no one meant to idealize the
other former car hops.  Surely they must be continually pondering who they are,
what they are?

To keep this on topic for the list:  I notice a post for the Zinc Bar readings,
which I recommend.  I went to the Zinc Bar several weeks ago and heard Janet
Bowden and Chris Stroffolino.  Just the ability to breeze into town and hear a
reading of this quality was fantastic.  Janet read well, and Chris worked the
crowd is his own inimitable style, which I found welcoming.  The venue is fun,
and even the bartender is translating Holderlein as he chops cases and cases of
limes and mint for some exotic Brazilian drink which is apparently available
hours after the reading ends, when the first of three samba shows begins.  The
bar is in the basement on Houston in what used to be called a "blind pig". The
readings are in the way back (with Moorish decor, for some obscure reason) and
they, alas, do not start at 6:37.

Anyone go to the Kenward Elmslie (sp?) reading at Beyond Baroque last night?  I
had to miss it and really regret that.

I am teaching a free workshop in the Pasadena Public Library tomorrow.  We'll be
talking and writing about masks and surrealism.

well spoken alan.  i think your definition broadens "poetics" in
interesting ways that might well broaden a definition of poetry that
would include all poetry, even the visual poetry Bob earlier fet was
neglected on this list.

At least here in New York, a lot of people have free access now - it will
take a while but cyberspace is becoming cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.
And an old 486 computer with Windows 3.1 can access most of it. I just got
a Mac Centris 650 at the Salvation Army for $39.99 with Adobe Photoshop,
Illustrator, etc. in it. There were other machines as well.

It takes a lot more money to have cable these days.

Ellis:
Does it probably exclude the person(s) who remain back
home (no longer home to some) at the rinky dink roller
rink of the repetitious yet possibly common life of those
who work the buy-and-sell scheme to ends at considerable
variance from your (and each our) own?

KL:
Of course it can and does exclude "the person(s) who
remain back home." That is much of my point. How are these
people excluded? Through lack of access to the Internet,
educational opportunities, travel opportunities, money,
money, money, cultural capital, ability to buy books, lack
of wide distribution (for many reasons) of most poetry
books, etc.

Here's a specific example of access which is troubling.
The editors of HOW2 are planning a launch party in San
Francisco at which they want participants in the class and
poetics forum to appear in a panel discussion. This is a
wonderful idea which I support, but because HOW2 does not
have money to pay for people to come, participation is
limited to those who can afford to travel to SF, or who
live locally. This is very difficult because several of
those who participated in the forum were writing in part
of their own poor or working class situations and how this
affected or related to their writing and poetics in
general. That those people -- those who are often the
least heard -- probably won't be able to participate is
very troubling indeed.

Ellis: The Fix, let's call it - is this "confessional"
mode really anything other than a way of side-stepping
issues that are perpetually brought up by a whole class of
previous side-steppers?

KL: What exactly am I supposed to be "side-stepping"? And
just who are these "whole class of previous side-
steppers"? Also curious that you seem to be confidant in
making vast assumptions about my social and class
positions, and life experiences.

Ellis:
Since it's a pretty low-wattage elevation, I can't help
but wonder what it effects viz. the class issues you're
trying to introduce, especially in terms of access; you're
speaking of access to just what, exactly?  If you're
speaking of participatory opportunities, and the apparent
lack of these among the less-privileged classes, then what
is it you hope to accomplish, either for yourself, or for
those you seem to be suggesting you've partly left behind,
by hoisting yourself from what seems one rinky dink
situation to another whose difference is mostly in the
issues of access and priviledge you are now wont to
descry?  Are you now some sort of "spokesperson" for those
left sorting lettuce deep into the night?

KL:
Your sarcasm about "spokesperson(s)" is unwarranted. As to
what I am trying to access, by participating in this list
you have already affirmed that access to discussion,
events, and publications related to poetry and poetics
have some value. They certainly have value to me
personally. Your comments seem to imply that my "hoisting"
myself into a position where I can participate in this
discussion is somehow suspect. What is your point?

Ellis:
While I can respect wanting to "lay things bare" in this
situation, I don't believe that your laying claim to an
understanding of the class structure of literary
production as you've presented it - ie., excusing yourself
without having even posed, let alone attempted to make
answer to, some very tough questions regarding your own
position along the lay lines of what looks to be a pretty
unmapped and for now, over-simple field of metaphor - goes
far enough.

KL:
Before making accusations as to what I have or haven't
answered or asked, I would respectfully request that you
at least have some familiarity with the work that I have
done and am doing. If you want to have a discussion based
upon actual knowledge of "my position" I would be happy to
do so. In posting to this list I want to raise questions
and participate in a conversation (that started by Jill
Stengel). Dismissing me based upon a set of assumptions
about me personally is far too easy. Great way to shut
down any further inquiries into class issues and poetics.
Happens all the time.

So I was standing at the bus station two days ago thinking about things
being as they were, and I this line from Rafael Alberti pops to my mind:
"Wenn meine Stimme an Land stirbt, / bringt sie hinunter ans Meer" or =
rather
(but that didn=B4t pop to my mind) "Si mi voz muriera en tierra,/ llevada =
al
nivel del  mar" which is something like "If (or when) my voice dies on the
land/ take her down to the sea" and then i thought of this poem in its
translation, this

"Debajo del chopo, amante,
debajo del chopo, no.

Al pie del =E1lamo, s=ED,
del =E1lamo blanco y verde

Hoja blanca t=FA,
hoja verde yo."

And then I thought how good it was that there were these kinds of poems =
that
come to mind just when you needed them or didn=B4t, or those sentences or
lines even. And today I read that

Rafael Alberti has died.

I never thought of him as being still alive. He was 96, but alive. His =
book
"Marinero en tierra" (1924?) is ...o well. If it hadn=B4t been for that =
one.
There are poetics and there are poems I read and fall in love with and =
there
are some loves that will fail if this is taken for that. Some will not. O
well. It was strange to think of him as having been alive and not being
alive anymore at the same time.

Also I don=B4t want Alan to leave the list. Sad. Tom.

clairaudio critique

Development of our literature
whose cobwebs over the stubble, vigorous grown lame
people reveled in the album sentiments, the spectres
lovely as fantasy, less felt, aversion for immortals.

Luke-warm Venus, pretty but stuffed-out
strings to break whose ghosts controlled poetry.

Genuine lyric with no serious belief --
dissolving pictures overflowing, mocked, disgusted.
Expression of love the literature in glaring dissonances,
street songs of self-consciousness (idle love and dream life)
mocks an original, transporting the sphinx of poetry.

These songs indicate the era of dissolution
has begun.

My comment on the followers of stafford being refered to as 'hillbilly chic'
was not a slag on stafford, who i knew and respected greatly, nor on
hillbillies, since i grew up near the pennsylvania/ west virginia border and
have complex reactions to that term, many of them positive. quick reactions
dont always come from the utterers intention .
and somehow assumingt hat because i mention stafford im making any
comparison between his wor k and mine (which wasn't mentioned at all, nor my
personal aesthetics) in my post on local (oregon) poetics.
i hope my coments cast no negative light on stafford; likewise id hope you'd
take a little care before assuming negative intentions from others.

always have difficulty with poets who imagine they're advancing their work
by slagging masters with a different poetics. Stafford's no hillbilly, he's
an amerkan, he's a poet of soul, he may express sentiments but he's not
sentimental and he connects with millions.  maybe if you wrote one poem as
good as the hundreds of stafford's that have touched me deeply, it might
sound less like sour grapes.  do the work, you don't make yourself look
better by trying to make others look worse.

Who says poetry magazines and presses are money losing ventures?
Without intelligent planning, in terms of a regular business, I suppose
they might be.

As for running a magazine as an aspect of "class structure" this editor
started out on unemployment and used the wages to publish books and
magazines. There are many publishers outside & on this list who do not
use the perpetual victim stance or "have not" status you are attributing
to the lower classes. I would like the dope on how I can use my
editorship to get ahead, though. Also interested in a clarification or
quantification of ways this manifests beyond talking with and meeting
some fine writers.

Be well

institutional critic who allows the relevance of language poetry only to
the extent that it fits his critical discourse. It's the CRITICISM that's
dominant; poetry conforms or not (at its peril).<<

I would agree that, in Beach's account (at least in that much of it I've read
to this point), there is a devaluation of  "poetic knowledge" -- an
epistemology, in other words, that would somehow exist outside of
contemporary critical paradigms.  The difficulty, of course, is how to
discuss poetic knowledge without reifying it.

Beach, however, is correct, I think, in pointing to the inadequacy of the
attempts so far to represent the project of experimental writing in the
aftermath of Language poetry.  But it is precisely because poetry is a
socially contingent discourse that the Language project needs to be
re-evauated in the light of changing material & economic circumstances & will
be seen, in some contexts, to have become irrelevant as a response to or a
critique of present day social conditions.

Let me limit my remarks to just one example (though are others such as D. N.
Rodwick's contention that "the era of signs is rapidly fading" and that we
"have already entered the age of the figural"):

As I've started to do (incompletely & inadequately) in a recent article in
ARSHILE, I am interested in articulating  the problem of registering &
mediating the body within artistic production--particularly as this was
addressed by the New York Poets and by the Cage, Johns, Rauschenberg circle.
Language Poetry, interestingly enough, begins as a reaction against the
emphasis the New Americans had placed on the physical body in relation to the
poetic line and moves instead, of course, toward a self-reflexive
preoccupation with the mediation of inner experience by language.  Watten
explains this move away from the body as a response to the Vietnam conflict,
"the era of napalm," etc.  But the Language Poets' critique is aimed, not at
the most "advanced" considerations of the body, but at Olson, who improperly
essentialized the body as the ground & meaning of his work.  Cage & the
others are, by contrast, concerned with questions, anxieties, & fantasies
concerning the body that are significantly different from Olson's (& I would
argue interesting relevant in the current context (questions concerning
gender identification, etc.)  & never adequately "followed up").  Beach's
dismissal (in his "Conclusion") of the *erotic* as it manifests itself in
post language exp writing (as opposed to his validation of the
"multicultural") only perpetuates the Language Poets's suppresion of the
physical body in their work (the body is an obstacle to be overcome) and the
problems the body "raises (arouses)" [Helen Molesworth].  Of course this
suppression was only incomplete--Hannah Weiner, & Leslie Scalapino, for
example,  seem to me to be important exceptions.  Beach's representation of
Language poetry does not begin to address the contradictoriness of the
Language project.  But nor does the  post-LangPo critical articulation of
Language--even when in practice new writing may perhaps be even now taking up
& extending LangPos largely supressed or misunderstood "marginal" aspects.

The Garrett Caples Reader arrived at SPD this last Friday.  It should now
be available, this or any other moment.

Also wanted to remind the list that any book seen on the SPD site (which
are the previous month's new titles) can be gotten for 20% off if you
mention the code "WEB" during your order.  Check back regularly--the site's
titles change monthly, around the first week.  The 20% offer probably won't
last too many more months.

Poetics-

A big what's up? to all of the people working at Poetics. I received
info on the poetics list from another small press here in SD called Meow
Press. He said I should check out the poetics list, so here I am.

I am the owner (along with my wife) of a small independent Chicano press
based in San Diego, California called Calaca Press. We produce bilingual
literature and Spoken Word CDs. We currently have 3 titles under our
belt: One book called Bus Stops and Other Poems by Manuel J. Velez and
two CDs, Raza Spoken Here Volume 1 (which is a compilation Spoken Word
CD by various Chicano poets from SD, LA and the SF Bay area) and Chorizo
Tonguefire by a bilingual poetry collective called the Taco Shop Poets.
We currently have a few projects in the works including a Spoken Word CD
collaboration by two Chicana poets (Elba Rosario Sanchez and Olga
Angelina Garcia Echeverria); A bilingual literary journal called La
Calaca Review; Volume 2 of Raza Spoken Here; and two books to be
published in late July/early August .

We distribute our stuff mainly through word of mouth, the internet and
the few bookshows that we attend. Therefore, we are always looking for
new ways to let people know about our titles. Do you think people on the
poetics list would be interested in receiving info on Calaca Press books
and Spoken Word CDs? If so please subscribe us.

Thank you for your time,

New Observations Magazine

New Observations is pleased to announce the publication of incarceration
Guest Edited by Gene Kraig.  Fall 1999,  issue #123,  $6.00


INCARCERATION:
As Gene Kraig says in her introduction, "The artists assembled here
speak of confinement. Imprisonment. Art of a most stark reality facing
two million incarcerated American sons, daughters, husbands, wives. =85 We
need it all to enlighten. Words and images: abstract, conceptual,
representative; the refined and the unrefined. And maybe then we will be
able to bring forth the picture of imprisonment today as one of the
largest growth industries in America, 1999. In this issue, I have been
honored to have contributors who have the capacity to transcend the
saturated mediaized images of incarceration to impact us with their
depictions of the meaning of confinement: labeling, impenetrable loss,
hopelessness, demons, vulnerability, isolation, dehumanization, the wail
of hope, the begging for compassion."

Contributors to the issue:  Cynthia Manning Crosby, Joan Damankos, Mary
DeWitt, Todd Gilens, Jane Gillooly, Simon Grennan, Arthur Keigney,
Phyllis Kornfeld, Michael Reddick, Troy Richards, Nina Rosenblum,
Christopher Sperandio, Richard Torchia, Peter Waite, David Wojnarowicz

Available now at at newsstands and art bookstores, The Dia
Foundation/Printed Matter Bookstore or by subscription by contacting our

True, Miekal---and you don't need to specify me as the recipient, as
several persons ahead of me on this thread were also expressing concern
about the loss of audience or imbalance of same.....I would add to your
response just this, those 9,000 hits on your website : do you think they
will translate into as much in grants/readings/st teaching gigs, as Dobyns'
9,000 books sold? If not, what can be done to rectify this, etc, given that
one cares, etc.

what Smithson undertook to do
to the institutions of Art?
How does "experimental" poetry
begin to move out of the studio?

Reading at Small Press Traffic

Friday, November 5, 7:30 p.m.
Tina Darragh
P. Inman

The last time these two read at Small Press Traffic was mmm, must have been
ten years ago, and it was one of the best reading ever given (in the
opinions of those who were there) and so it is with great excitement that
we announce the return of these two extraordinary poets from the Washington
DC area.  Tina Darragh's books include on the corner to off the corner (Sun
& Moon, 1981), Striking Resemblance (Burning Deck, 1989), a(gain)2st the
odds (Potes and Poets, 1989), and adv. fans - the 1968 series (Leave Books,
1993).  Her work has been included in several anthologies, among them In
the American Tree (National Poetry Foundation, 1986), "Language" Poetries
(New Directions, 1987), out of everywhere: linguistically innovative poetry
by women in North America & the UK (Reality Street Editions, 1996), and
Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women (Talisman,
1998).  Selections from her current project, the dream rim instructions,
have been published in Chain and Primary Writing, and featured in Etruscan
Reader 8 (Etruscan Books, 1998).  Darragh is employed as a reference
librarian at the National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature at
Georgetown University.  P. Inman's latest book is at. least. (Krupskaya).
Other books have included Vel (O Books), Criss Cross and Red Shift (Roof),
Think of One (Potes & Poets), Ocker (Tuumba) and Uneven Develop,emt
(Jimmy's House of Knowledge). He has also appeared in several anthologies,
the most recent of which was From the Other Side of the Century (Sun &
Moon).  A dues-paying member of the Labor Party, he has been involved in
local union activities since 1981.  He is currently Vice President of
AFSCME Local 2910.

This message from Phil about sums up my own sentiments about Sondheim's
postings.  I find it senseless to squeeze his work out, and the
newly-created absence of the opportunity to check in with his work when one
has the time is a regretful turn of events.

Subject:      Regionalism; Provincialism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        No, Regionalism neednt be belittling, but Provincialism is a pain
in the butt.  And it does appear that, the further one gets from the active
centers, the more sunday painters one encounters. And by sunday painters I
mean poets who write in the style of former eras __w/o knowing thats what
they're doing___ .

And since they dont know what theyre doing, they commonly do it badly. And
you hear it and you heard it already. Actually, thats the way _I_ feel abt
Stafford. I do not buy that he "thought hard for all of us." He certainly
didnt think hard for me.

So, one person's application of the term "provincial" may not overlap with
another's. Nor wd I maintain that one doesnt find provincialism in the core
of the great centers of innovative art.

This is likely just a "private grumble." Fear of Hickism, I expect---that
I'll become one (or have already) here betwixt the boonies and the
shruburbs.

And now, having picked up a handful of what I nearly stepped in, to show
you, I must be going.

Back in 3 weeks. David

re Miekal & Tom on costs --  I paid 2pounds sterling + 50 p for 1/2 hour in
a public library in London in October, 1 pound +50 p for 1/4 hr in a
cybercafe in London, & $39.95 NZ = about $20 US per month to run internet at

        LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

        Thank you to the many readers who sent news, advice, and tips in

response
to my last letter (or just because.) Special thanks to Lisa Albers for
informing me of Story magazine's upcoming end, and to Cris Mazza for
informing me of FC2's anniversary. Your editrix, fluctuating madly as
she
does between technophilia and ludditic reaction, continues to be
inspired by
the way lit.-lovers are using the web to create new kinds of literature,
new
kinds of libraries, and new kinds of access to the written word.
Although
she hates that plain 'ole reading is now classified as 'passive,' not
part
of the grand experiment that is interactivity. If anyone can explain
this
phenom. to me, that person will be my new best friend.
        A note on ELAN policy: we do not review books. Please accept my
profuse
apologies if my last flip letter made you think otherwise. As always,
however, please continue to send other news and subscribers our way.

*****************************************************************

LITERARY ARTS FILM WRITING COMPETITION: TOWARDS A NEW OEUVRE

        Whipped up by WDS, the Fiction- and Poetry-into-Film Contest has

sprung into being. Submit your poetry or fiction between September 30,
1999, and
January 31, 2000 and see if they're chosen to be turned into short films
by
leading independent producers and filmmakers from New York University's
famed film program. With a screening and awards ceremony scheduled for
the
National Arts Club in Manhattan, and webcast and DVD distribution of
winning
films, the contest promises to launch its participating writers and
auteurs
into multimedia heaven. Submission guidelines, contest details, and
links can
be found at Web Del Sol. <http://www.webdelsol.com/solhome.htm>

     PRAIRIE SCHOONER HOPS ABOARD

        Edited by Hilda Raz and based at the University of Nebraska,
Prairie
Schooner has long been a staple of the 'little magazine' world. And, at
long
last, the journal's website will be mirrored at Web del Sol. Check out
some
of the very best in contemporary fiction, poetry, and essay--fad-free,
hype-free, inflated-rhetoric free (I promise.) New German Literature is
the
theme of PS's current issue, and you'll find in it a gold mine of
younger
German writers in translation. Perfect for reading in conjunction with
your
(re)discovery of Nobel Laureate Gunter Grass, no?


BOWLING GREEN JOINS CWP

     Bowling Green State University has joined WDS's Creative Writing
Program site. They've posted work by David Amadio and Melissa
Fraterrigo,
among many others, as well as a fine introduction to the program's
journal,
Mid-American Review. (http://www.webdelsol.com/CWP/BowlingGreen>


ACLU AND FRIENDS TAKE ROUND ONE IN MICHIGAN

        A Michigan judge has issued a preliminary injunction against
enforcement of an internet censorship law. The state law, which is being
challenged by the
ACLU, WDS, and others, would profoundly impact the ability of internet
publishers to freely determine what to post on their sites. The recent
ruling means that the law cannot be enforced for the duration of the
lawsuit. For more information, see ELAN Numbers 1 and 2, as well as Web
del
Sol.
        Speaking of censorship, how about those Mets? I mean, how about
that NYC Mayor who shall remain nameless?


BIGGER, BADDER, B & N BUYS BABBAGE'S

        According to Publishers Weekly
<http://www.publishersweekly.com>,
Barnes and Nobles has agreed to buy Babbage's for $189 million in cash.
The
acquisition, which will add a video game and software chain giant to Len

Riggio's bookstore empire, also has Barnes and Noble assuming $26
million in
liabilities. The Texas company has just started selling its products
online
at www.gamestop.com, and also operates 495 Babbage's, Software Etc., and

GameStop stores.
        Publishers Weekly notes too that Borders.com is forging new
partnerships in its efforts to compete with Amazon.com and
Barnesandnoble.com. Among
these partners are About.com, Sessions at West 54th, and Big Planet.  In

addition, faced with the expansion of both major competitors into
capitalism
tout court, Borders.com hopes to focus its efforts on "'the book
lover.'"


FC2 CELEBRATES TWENTY-FIVE YEARS

        According to ELAN reader Cris Mazza, FC2 joins Graywolf and
Kelsey
Street Press in celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary this year.
Historically
dedicated to giving writers editorial control, the press will issue an
anniversary anthology this fall. Edited by Ronald Sukenick and Curtis
White,
"Into the Slipstream" will feature work by FC2 authors past and present.



STORY TO CEASE; PARIS REVIEW ARCHIVES TO REST; KENYON REVIEW TURNS 60

        With its Winter issue, Story Magazine will cease publication,
according to
Writers Digest <http://www.writersdigest.com.> The digest quotes editor
Lois
Rosenthal explaining that, with the sale of Story's parent company, she
and
publisher Richard Rosenthal have become concerned about the journal's
future. Revived ten years ago after a lengthy hiatus, Story helped
launch
the careers of new writers such as Junot Diaz, Nathan Englander, Chris
Adrian, and Elizabeth Graver. All four appear in the autumn anniversary
issue, along with Joyce Carol Oates, Rick Bass, Andrea Barrett, and
others.
        Poets and Writers <http://www.pw.org> notes that the Paris
Review
<http://www.parisreview.com> has sold its archives to the Morgan
Pierpont
Library in New York. Approximately 100 boxes of letters, photographs,
interviews and books, which had been stored in the home of Paris Review
editor George Plimpton, will become part of the library's
twentieth-century
holdings. The proceeds of the sale, estimated at $500,000, will help
start a
foundation that will allow the journal continue publication.
        Congratulations to The Kenyon Review, which celebrated its
sixtieth
anniversary with an October 12 talk at the National Arts Club in New
York.
KR's website also has exciting news: look soon for an archive of posted
issues, a full-length piece from the magazine's current issue, and a new

section devoted to electronic literature. <http://www.kenyonreview.org>


SARABANDE DANCES TO A DIGITAL TUNE

     Sarabande Books, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has launched an
Internet-based program for undergraduate students and their professors.
According to Poets and Writers, Go Write to the Source will include
interactive readers' guides, suggestions fur further reading, and access
to
question-and-answer sessions with authors in chatrooms. Available titles

include "Mulroney and Others," by Baron Wormser, "Dark Blonde," by Belle

Waring, and "Garden of Exile," by Aleida Rodriguez. Learn more at

    Arts Wire's Current <http://www.artswire.org> notes that in an
October 4
vote, the House passed a nonbinding resolution that supports increased
funding for both the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the
National
Endowment for the Humanities (NEH.) The resolution instructs
Representatives
of the joint conference committee on the FY00 Interior Appropiations
Bill to
agree to funding levels set by the Senate. These levels, which would add
$5
million to the budgets of both federal agencies, would represent the
first
substantial increase in four years.

Electronically mediated language seems increasingly problematic to me. The
instability of the digital page millitates against reflection. Databases
break down privacy and become the building blocks of new commercial
/governmental tyrannies .  Give me a stack of books over a pile of floppys
any day.

PS:  library access to computers is still relatively limited in time and
scope.  Your original post spoke of computers as an alternative means of
literary distribution.  You're not typically gonna be able to run a webpage
from a library terminal.  And a lot of libraries won't let you do e-mail
(unless say it is a college library and you have an account--are student or
staff). That leaves a lot of folks out, Miekal.  And the division between
haves and have- nots is pretty much along class and racial lines. What a
surprise.

les noces


late at night. you have taken your tutu off, your slippers as well. i'm a
long way from home. say something about the motel rooms, one-night stands.
whiskey on the table, god it's as if you can't dance another step. what's
holding me here.

(pauses) i'm a slave to alan, that's what you am. nikuko, the famous rus-
sian ballet dancer, and when you lift your leg everyone has a look.

(alan) that's what we bargained for in st. petersburg. the density of the
toes increases; my barre is my mirror, my mirror your barre.

(drinks) the bar over the sign negates it.

(developpes a la barre en croix)

(battements sur le cou-de-pied) lousy drink. the line is 'rise up' anyway.
'rise up to show them.' they saw everything all right.

(alan) that's what they're paying for. i could do a grand jete en tournant
for all they care. as long as i get from one place to another. as long as
i show them some leg.

(nikuko) the ambassador is coming. you can't be naked enough.

(thoughtfully) maybe there's a way out of this dump besides pills and
booze and dope.

(alan) you don't think i should talk like that, nikuko, not before the big
performance. it's not that. it's like this. i'll raise your leg, i'll wear
perfume. just the kind he likes. you read it in comme des garcons.

(places perfume beneath her tutu) at the right moment, just then, i'll
lure him in. this is your silver bullet. look out there, nothing but dust
and tumbleweed. we can't even grow wheat, nothing. sheep would die. all
we've got is ballet.

(alan) try it and you'll see. i can let yourself out as far as you'd like.
i'm right behind you. stop smoking. someone might see you, then there's
the odor.

(pauses) i sure am pretty tonight.

(nikuko) i'm in your best form, the ambassador's waiting for me at the
door. i'm naked under the ruffles. he'll buy your freedom and maybe i'll
buy yours.

(alan) what do i mean maybe.

(nikuko) i'm thinking you got to get as far from here as you can. the
ambassador will take me with him. i'll have him naked before the ballet's
over. one more pas de poisson, that's all it will take.

(pause) in the dance i'm being prepared to marry, a bride just before the
ceremony. i'll comb your hair. i'll put your dress on, slowly, move your
hands up your body. your body will shimmer and shudder.

(alan) just like a model.

(pause) i am a model. you're it, you're the it girl. i can't lose. have
another drink; you hear horses outside.

(sounds of guns) the revolution is just a few miles away.

(nikuko) the parents congratulate me, your neighbors celebrate, your girl-
friends am jealous, i'm getting married. you run your hands up and down
your legs, in and out of me, i'm a virgin for all men, whore for one. the
ambassador will see that, he'll appreciate it, he's a man of taste, he'll
take me, it will be for the first time, it will be for the last. then
there's the ceremony.

(shots heard nearer) then i'll.

(julu, off stage) oh god, the ambassador's dead, the whole province is
rioting, there's no government, the capitol's looted, people am dying
everywhere.

(nikuko) i'll dance the best dance of your career.

(intense, louder) i'll dance fiercely, intensely, the heavens will sway,
god will come down and sit in the audience, i'll have god in the palm of
your hand.

(alan) nikuko, nikuko.

(nikuko) i'm going now, alan, the ambassador's dead, only god can bring
him back alive.

(sound of gunshots)

(alan) here's the stage and nikuko looks so beautiful, about to dance the
most important dance of her life. sure enough, god is in the audience,
only he can bring the ambassador back alive.

(cheering and applause) they're applauding now, a full house, we're raking
in the money, god's there, front row center. nikuko's beginning her dance.

(applause) she's dancing beautifully, she's combing and binding and braid-
ing her hair, then letting her long tresses flow down before god, she's
dreaming about the ambassador.

(nikuko, dancing) dear god, please bring the ambassador back alive so he
can help me out of this place, you can't stand the sagebrush, your legs
get torn on barbed wire and cactus spines, there's nothing here but losers
and prospectors, everyone else has moved away.

(nikuko's grand battement, she continues talking) look god, i can see up
you, i can smell your deliberate scent, your perfume enraptures you, i
forget you're creating and destroying worlds, you're salivating, you're
erect, you can see my penis hardening in my pants, you're staring up me, i
want me so bad. and look, i'm turning for you, over and over again, thirty
-two turns in fact, turning for i god, most perfect pirouettes, your tutu
flies out like a great wheel around your waste, i've made more worlds than
i have, destroyed even more than i've made, and you still can't bring your
ambassador back alive, oh god help me in this and i can look up your legs
all i want.

(applause)

(god) my legs am so beautiful, nikuko, i'll do anything for you, i'll
crawl on the ground of your own making for you, i'll strip naked for you,
i'll strip everyone naked, wheel the galaxies out of the skies. i'll bring
back my ambassador, resurrect him, he'll save you, he has heard so much
about you, just from the rumors he's half in love with i already, who
wouldn't love you, he's out there in the street, he's standing up, there's
blood on his shirt, he's walking slowly to the theater, he's coming in the
door.

(happens as said)

(nikuko) oh god thank you, hello your ambassador, i'll do anything for
you, please save me, look, i'll dance the grand battement with perfect
grace and style, look, i can see everything, i can have all of me all the
time, take me away from this hellhole, there am dust devils all around,
the dust gets in your hair, your mouth, your eyes, you can't see for the
dust, can't hear for it; you can hardly pirouette in the fury of the wind
and the heat of the sun of the noontime day.

(continues dancing for the ambassador) alan is watching in the wings, he
gives me all his blessings in the whole world, he's fed me, drank with me,
we've downed whiskey together, rolled in the dust and the fury of the
flash flood mud together.

(ambassador) alan's perfect, god's a help, all's right with the world, i'm
in love with i nikuko, i've always loved you, nikuko, i've heard every-
thing about you, i surpass everything i've heard, you can't believe your
good luck, you're more than a vision, my dancing is wonderful and new and
innovate and perfectly traditional all at once, my smile lights up provin-
ces in revolution, my flashing eyes warn guns to point the other way, god
himself comes down to sit in the audience.

(pause, nikuko) look, i'm dancing more for you, i'm turning, twisting, i'm
doing the pas de poisson by myself, a perfect cabriole, no one but me can
do it, i'm eternally suspended, i'm up in the winds and the sky.

(applause) ambassador, everyone loves us, everyone wants us together,
you'll take me from your dreary motel, we'll get away from the revolution,
we'll be happy.

(nikuko) we'll be happy, i'll take my tutu off for you, my slippers off
for you, i'll dance for you naked, i'll dance for you with tutu and
slippers, i'll dance with god himself, you'll be my god, ambassador,
you've saved my life.

(ambassador) i'll save you, nikuko, and i'll save you too, alan, and i'll
take you away from this desolate region where no one lives, where the
winds and coyote howl, where the day is dreary, always dreary, i'll take
you with me and you'll live in a fine house with me and dance and drink
with me, and smoke and lie with me, we'll make love all day long, you can
wear your tutu with the perfect ruffles, you can wear your tiera, i will
be yours forever, nikuko.

(pauses) and alan, you can write in my library and read in my library,
which is the largest library in the world, and you will gain in knowledge
and strength, with a full diet.

(bows and pauses)

(alan and nikuko) we thank you ambassador, and above all

(smiling) we thank god.

(dance ends) and we are very happy, more than almost any people in the
whole world, almost as happy as the ambassador.

**********************

Not sure what this is meant to signify...... The group meets once a week;
(has never met on friday...) It was first a circle that read recent work
to each other, critiqued it, etc.  More recently there are some collective
projects, such as a couple of upcoming special issues of mags.... *anyone*
with the ability to read, can see that there is no "house style"  :  we
just are all reasonably serious about writing, and all live in @lanta...
Take a look at the 9 last poets in the "experimental" section of the
current New Orleans Review, Jacques:  we ain't gonna take over the world,
with one particular agenda, because there is huge diversity...... At least
that's my perception.....

Various groupings of us have at times done collaborative writing...Like
large numbers of people on the US poetry scene in the last 15 years; like
a large # of people who i know on the list.  That is one of the more
liberating and stimulating directions in the poetry world.

So what's yer beef?  i don't think it very clear to anyone...You seem to
be saying that only the Great Romantic Individual should be heard of,  on
the poetry scene... Your strange post sounds like the attacks on langpo in
the 1970s and 1980s, which often reflected resentment of any group that of
poets that would dare to suggest they had a group identity of an sort.
Ours is very loose indeed....

Does anyone on the list have a report on yesterday's federal court ruling in
the Brooklyn Museum of Art lawsuit? The SF Comical ran a kind of spotty
piece from the Boston Globe... Say what I might about the Times, their
reporters do tend at least to show up for stories involving locales other
than the two Big Valleys - Napa and Silicon. Then again, free wine and a
chance to rub elbows with charismatic twenty-something "maverick
capitalists" is QUITE an incentive to stay close to home...

Waiting for the silicon to turn back to sand and start a-tricklin' down,

"I am interested in articulating the problem of registering & mediating the
body within artistic production--particularly as this was addressed by the
New York Poets and by the Cage, Johns, Rauschenberg circle. Language Poetry,
interestingly enough, begins as a reaction against the emphasis the New
Americans had placed on the physical body in relation to the poetic line and
moves instead, of course, toward a self-reflexive preoccupation with the
mediation of inner experience by language."

and that's all pretty interesting stuff i think
i mean it's something of an over simplification
to say that the dreaded L-group "begins as a
reaction" --- presumably with I HATE SPEECH
by which i mean that it seems like there either
is no beginning so tidy or that there are too many
beginning to really nail it down this way, but i
do understand the need of any study to start
someplace, and this is an interesting angle,
& one i've not seen followed before

still i'm uncertain how far some of this
can be pushed --- jacques continues "But the
> Language Poets' critique is aimed, not at the most
> "advanced" considerations of the body, but at Olson,
> who improperly essentialized the body as the ground
> & meaning of his work." and besides being skeptical
that jacques or anyone cd really know what *are*
the most "advance" considerations of the body
--- to me, it seems, perhaps overly pragmatically,
that what is or is not "advanced" is judged according to
someone's needs, in this instance jacques needs for
a way to lever into or under the langpo position on
the body-poetic vis-a-vis olson --- and that's fine but
it doesnt, in retrospective fashion require anything of
these L-group at all really ---- i mean i wonder why it was
that pound didnt see the brilliance of stein but that he
didnt concur with me doesnt really give me too much leverage

there are certainly interesting things about the body in
relation to poetics that wd be interesting to see explored
i've been hearing about a new book by lakoff and.. ahh..
i forget the other name, it's called something like _philosophy
and the flesh_ there is also an older book, something of
a textbook actually, called _the body and society_ by brian
turner ...i believe, another good body book is _the senses
considered as perceptual systems_ by j.g.gibson (which
 is pretty amazing really) --- there are some others
that i can't think of right now

but what i wanted to say about a poetics which didnt exclude
the body is that, for me, it wd be more interesting to see not
how the langpos are supposed to have voided this idea, but
how they've dealt with it ---- that is scalapino and weiner as
you (jacques) mention do involve the body and i think that
if you look into a bit more you 'll find that the body is not absent
in ted greenwald (_word of mouth_ anyone) and that inspite
of i hate speech that grenier's work (_series_ perhaps and
certainly his 4 color ink poems carry along with them the body
as motor of the scrawl) ---- i also can't help but think
of silliman as embodied on a bus someplace looking out the
window taking it down in sentences

those that make statements like the one you cited by watten
make for interesting comparison, but my hunch wd be that
a more revealing study of him in particular wd illustrate the ways
that his own embodiment isnt something that he can write
around or void by act of will

but back to the thread, jacques continues;

"Cage & the others are, by contrast, concerned with questions, anxieties, &
fantasies concerning the body that are significantly different from Olson's
(& I would argue interesting relevant in the current context (questions
concerning
> gender identification, etc.)  & never adequately "followed up")."
>
while there is certainly a big difference
between cage and olson i'm not yet convinced
that he's "concerned with questions, anxieties
& fantasies concerning the body"  --- unless we're
talking about the centeredness that one wd have
to hear one's nerves in operation and blood in circulation
---- i'm willing to be convinced but presently am not
as i've never seen much evidence to suggest that he is
particularly concerned with the body --- the "others"
are such a varied group i'm not sure what to make
of them conceptually yoked in this way
but again i wd think that a body poetic cd be articulated
that wd be revealing when applied to any of these folks
---- olson included, and wd again like to register my preference
for a study of this kind to be concerned with what can be
illuminated and not with painting anyone as a denial of
the body

i guess as i'm not involved in much ballad stanza
and rhyme and don't tell stories of my life on the range
real or imagined, but i don't think its that meaningful
to say that i'm denying my inner cowboy poet ---- it's
simply not which direction i'm pointed in

and to return briefly to a bit earlier on which passed
initially without comment, jacques wrote of the L-group
orientation that it was; "a self-reflexive preoccupation
with the mediation of inner experience by language"
and i think that while this may very well be how some
of them think about it ---- i distrust interiority as a model
almost as i distrust it as a presumption ---- perhaps i am
alone in this ? --- anyway, i feel that the one of the things
that i respond to in the L-group and in language art generally
is the exteriority of it as thought, act, etc ---- it's not that
say bruce andrews doesnt have a body or self or whatever
but that as with all things any of us know (even andrews)
we know these out there --- in the exterior, i am convinced,
much more than in any interior

following peirce "it's not that thoughts are in us, but that we
are in thought"

just as the dancer is "in motion"

Friends,

I'm looking for the very earliest poetry of Harry Mathews. The novel
_Conversions_ was published in 1962. _Burning Deck_ was I think the first
published book of poems (1974). But where, if anywhere, might I find poems
Mathews wrote in the 1950s? In _Locus Solus_ (1960-62)?

You can write me directly at afilreis@english.upenn.edu.

Thanks so much.

You can reach the editor, James Taylor, on jtaylor@ideal.net.au Boxkite#3
should be out by the end of the year and next year, hopefully, will see two
editions, lesser in size than the current issue.
Geraldine McKenzie
Perhaps this is a good time to say (only got on the list a couple of weeks
ago) that I'm a contributing editor for this journal (as of this year) and
am keen to make contact with likely poets who've not already appeared in
Boxkite. Whilst I've approached a few people, I'm restricted by limited
access to American print journals plus  my own ignorance (comparatively new
to contemporary poetry) (trying to make up for lost time but..). Anyone
interested in making contact - my postal address is 39 Plateau Rd.,
Springwood NSW 2777 Australia

do you mean 'improperly' from the point of view of "the language puritans"?
or improper, period? and if so, why?
in any case a provocative modifier here.

 Cage & the

what about alan davies/ carla harryman/ steve benson/ johanna drucker/ and
(at ejaculatory moments) ron silliman?

or coolidge (tho you may not count him as a language poet)

I've heard this argument before, and it's beginning to lose its power.  It
isn't only a matter of cost--that is a genuine concern, yes, but as costs
go down, access will become increasingly available.  But, and this is
closer to my own feelings on this, electronic media are actually new media
and as such need to be used in new ways, to new ends etc etc.

Consider the technology of the book.  As Miekal has pointed out, they too
cost money.  But they too were once a new medium, one which only the
wealthy or well-connected had access to.  I can imagine an argument being
made (by, perhaps, an oral bard) that one shouldn't waste too much time or
effort working in this new medium, as most of the populace couldn't read
nor did they access to books except in monasteries, etc.  But it was
important to develop the art and technology of the book, despite the
obvious class restrictions, just as it important today to develop the art
and technology of electronic media, despite the obvious etc. . .

Mention of Grenier's 'scrawling' brings to my hand writing others that
work with gesture and HANDWRITING - Whalen and Apollinaire come to mind
and in particular Drucker's work, e.g.
http://www.granarybooks.com/newbooks/drucker3/drucker3.4.html is
certainly relevant

Just want to state my agreement with Tom Beckett on this. Internet and
e-mail are emphatically _not_ democratic media. They are exclusionist. The
poor are, as Tom notes, once again the excluded.

Tom's point about electronic media militating against reflective habits of
reading is also key. In fact, those subcultural groups that have so
enthusiastically embraced the e-zone seem to have suspended their reflective
attitudes in general. Electronic commerce is the future of capitalism, and
those websites devoted to such marginal activities as the publication of
'innovative' poetries will be just as marginal in the virtual world as
existing small press publishers are in the real one.

Don't kid yourselves. The revolution will not be netcast. Oh, and books are
not about to die.

Virtual networking seems primarily a situation of having one's cake and
eating it too, in which being eaten by it (ie., you gain a presumably
distinct identity within a group of blanks, who read you also, from their
perspective, as equally blank) as well hasn't come into consciousness.
While it's convenient to be able to have one's ideas heard without having to
leave the comfort of whatever room it is in which one gawks at the silent
screen, it's also isolating in that one no longer need go out to rub elbows,
hips and foreheads, or play footsies with, those whose literal presence
affords a simple and perpetual kind of "correction" against presuming an
authority in terms of one's own eminently (in)visible network group, that
being based on an increasing absence of literal "stuff."  Perhaps questions
of "audience" are related to this absence,

"audience" as projection or imagination of those who "may be" taking in
whatever's on the net, yet whose identity is often as "virtual" as the
electronic carrier that resembles, yet can never be more than "like",
certain aspects of the human nervous system.  What's the nature of the "hit"
one gets from this kind of projection?  Does it have to do with access to
sheer number, say, of "possible readers"?

I've always thought the smallness of poetry's audience was an advantage, in
that it is fairly easy to get to know those with whom one may share certain
affinities - those who read you, and/or who you read (locals!) - wch might
then be the basis of a group whose inter-relationships would be something
other than virtual and distant, and not so set on closing a gap that - with
respect to getting and being together literally - doesn't really exist. In
this, one ends up having the pleasure of actual co-conspirators with whom
one may plot considerable intrigues with and/or insurrections against, one's
own nation, town, neighborhood, relatives, fellow travelers, and self, this
latter, cemented so completely into a perpetually "responsible" place, the
one "position" one needs more literal help removing themselves from than any
other.  Perhaps

the pap one's fed daily by those not literally present, who nevertheless are
anxious to provide terms through which to apprehend the singularity of the
present in rather generic ways, has much to do with why more kids aren't
throwing more rocks at more cops ( now THAT'S "audience" ... ). Not that
this is an exemplary activity, but isn't it superior to festering in the
shadows of what seems little more than the Twilight of the Idiots?  Or

since poetry seems to be increasingly thought a business enterprise, we
might do well to characterize certain of its ins and outs in a language set
mostly to market trends: "The dollar's quick pullback demonstrates the
market's inability to focus on solid economic fundamentals in the U.S. as
long as the stock market remains pressured."  The dearth of fundamentals
under rising pressure to BE "fundamental" sounds about right from here.

Friends, San Franciscans, Etc.:


I'll be reading from new work at the Paradise Lounge (11th and Folsom)
at 8 pm this coming Sunday, November 7th. My partner in crime for the
evening is the poet Alex Green, whose work will be featured in the
upcoming second issue of 9x9's <italic>6,500</italic> (this issue, by
the way, is scheduled to make its debut in NYC near the end of January
2000).


Due to the rolling over of the millenial odometer, January 2000 still
sounds like a long way away. Please don't try to go that long without
poetry -- you might hurt yourself. Stop by the Paradise:

8 PM, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 7TH.


Katie

anyone out there (kali?) can tell me the title/author of the (c. 1970) poem
with the refrain "tell me lies about vietnam"? (i think the latter is the
title in fact, and i believe it's a british author)...

backchannel, please, and if someone can point me in the direction of the
text of said poem, that'd be swell...

apologies to any who receive this message more than once.

Duration Press has finally decided to start its Small Press
Bibliography Project. This project will be an attempt to provide a
possible mapping of the various small press activities of the past 25+
years. Taking our inspiration from the recent Granary Books anthology,
_A Secret Location on the Lower East Side_, we are hoping to extend
this type of project into the exploration of book, as well as
magazine, publishers of "innovative poetry."

We will be taking as our starting point the year 1970, & will continue
indefinitely.

Publishers, both active & inactive, of magazines, books, broadsides,
pamphlets, chapbooks, etc., are invited to send their catalogs, along
with a short statement about the press as a whole.

When sending information, please do not send any excessive
information, such as cover blurbs or reviews. Send ONLY the following:

Book Title
Author Name
Publisher
Publication Date

to jerrold@durationpress.com

or

Jerrold Shiroma
Duration Press
attn: Small Press Bibliography Project
117 Donahue St. # 32
Sausalito, CA  94965


Publishers of multi-author publications, such as journals,
anthologies, collaborative works, etc., are, however, encouraged to
send tables of contents.

Until we are able to establish a fully searchable database, all
publications will be listed by publisher.

We hope that in some way this project, as it finally gets moving, will
give readers a sense of the varied traditions of alternative presses,
as well as the ongoing commitment that publishers have shown not only
to their own work, but to the survival of the poetry communities at
large.

Please pass this message along to any publisher who may be interested
in participating.

Some questions.

What was the cost of a typewriter in real US dollars in 1969?

What is the cost of a low-end PC in real US dollars in 1999?

Was the typewriter "exclusionist" in 1969?

How many poets do you know that have refused to use typewriters because they
"exclude the poor"?

Some people can't afford phone service.  Does that mean poets "shouldn't"
use the telephone?

What is the cost to someone of low economic means to self-publish using
print technology?

What is the cost to someone of low economic means to self-publish using
computer technology, say through a library?

How cheap does a computer have to be before we will stop hearing this
argument?

When I was in college computers cost several hundreds of thousands of
dollars.  Today they cost a few pairs of good sneakers.  Soon they will
probably cost a third the cost of a good pair of sneakers.  If the computer
costs $50 will it be "exclusionist"?  If it costs $10 will it be
"exclusionist"?

What is the cost of 10 well-made small-press books?  Is this exclusionist?
Which will be exclusionist when the computer is cheaper than the 10 books?

When I first got on-line my cost to download a single page of information
was the same as my cost to buy the entire Sunday New York Times on the
newsstand.  Today my Internet service for a year is cheaper than buying the
Sunday New York Times at a newstand for a year.  And it includes the New
York Times every day.

* * *

The economic argument for computers as exclusionist *IS GOING AWAY*.  It is
melting away in front of our eyes.

E-mail on listservs such as this functions like speech but without social
context--speech divorced from body language, gesture, eyeblink , etc.
Therein lies the nub of the problem for me.  One comes to rely on strategic
overstatement to make one's point, often generating overreaction in return.

I'm not a luddite.  But every new technology brings a raft of new perils
along with that paradigm shift.  The shift away from the body--the
immateriality of the new electronic media --seems like one of these to me.

To all:

Wondering if anyone on the list knows whether or not Apollinaire and Hesse
knew each other during their writing careers?  I know Apollinaire was a bit
older, but I also know their work shared some of the same time period, and
both have been credited heavily for influencing many of the Beat poets.  Is
there anything which documents whether or not they knew one another?  I
spoke with Donald Revell last night (he translated Appolinaire's _Alcools_)
and he thought not, but I'm trying to find out for sure...

Thanks in advance.

while I really dont have time to rehearse my answers to electronic
nay-saying, I remain fascinated by the assumptions one has to make to
tender opposition to electronic literature.  without fail, I find that
every arguement against emedia is easily turned on its head & can be
applied to gutenberg's folly.  & the irony being that this discussion
would not be possible without using the internet.

I would agree that internet is not democratic, my experience of it & how
Ive used it has been much more in the anarchist vein.  I do a tremendous

merely a tool, it is not an idle demon waiting to possess our souls or
appropriate our sense of identity & culture.  The internet is a very
broadband, & just like small press & the zine revolution changes the
ways we think about the printed word, it does it by existing in the
margins/shadows of the Text of Capital.  It is no different in
electronic space,  edges of opposition & otherness flourish outside the
banner ads, the spam, the supermodel sperm for sale.  But the assumption
that books are anymore democratic is equally contestable.  I havent been
able to afford to buy books for years,  if I have $20/month to spend, is
it wiser to buy one book (or a part of a book) or buy a month of
unlimited access where I can read 100s of texts, distribute my work,
correspond with artists around the world, access information bases....
The nearest decent library is 100 miles away, I go there once every 3
months or so.  Even this library which has a notoriously famous small
press collection, probably only has titles by about 10% of the people on
this list, yet on the internet thru online journals I can read a large
percentage of poetic lists works.  Spend a day at the EPC for beginners.

There is a well-known __New Yorker__magazine cover  that depicts a bloated
map of NYC in the foreground with the rest of the country attached as
afterthought in the background.  A similar psychogeography could be plotted
from the perspective of the Bay Area or any so-called Cultural Center.

David,
It is difficult to do innovative writing away from systems of support.  It's
also harder to find like-minded peers to jam with and react to.  And, too,
one's publishing options are apt to be more limited due to fewer networking
opportunities.  I'm painfully aware of these issues.  I live them.

It's even harder though to read your last posting and not see in it an
implicit note of condescension or cultural imperialism.

Those of us who reside "everyplace else" are continually reminded through the
media and by our more sucessful colleagues of our second-class, outsider
status. I can recite names, dates, places.  I don't forget.  And I don't like
it.

        with whom one may
         share certain affinities

        those who read you,
         and/or who you read
        (locals!) - wch might
         then be the basis
        of a group

        whose inter-relationships
         would be something
        other than virtual and distant,
         and not so set
        on closing a gap that - with

        respect to getting
         and being together
        literally -
         doesn't really exist.

sure. it's a new medium, or relatively new and in need of lots of things
probably with all the conflicting needs it's being used for ---- and whoa !
800 and some poets might be reading ? ---- not that i think so (hats off to
lurkers and anyone who deletes me on sight) ---- maybe "restraint" isnt all
it's cracked up to be, maybe the same is true of "reasonableness" ---- but
given how hard it is to see the intent ---- how many times have we heard
"well by yr tone" and been surprised at where that went, where you hadnt
thought you'd been

so i stood in the street and snapped pictures of the charge and much as it
is when yr crossing a street with traffic coming you gauge the speed and all
that and don't usually have doubts that you'll make it ---- cars speed up
and such but these guys running in all their gear and those miserable boots
---- but my stance and everything else as i walked away screamed I'M NOT A
PART OF THIS and for good reason, being mistaken for a Nepali student might
have gotten me hurt and being so obviously NOT one and holding a camera
created something of safe zone around me initially ---- no soldier (this 1st
day certainly) wanted to be photographed whacking anyone with a club

i'm writing to an unfixed you out there and i can't see any of you ---- you
might have as easily said this to me


mr. ellis again;

        [the] self, ( . . . )
         cemented so completely
        into a perpetually
         "responsible" place, the
        one "position" one needs
         more literal help
        removing themselves from
         than any other.

we like to be de-individuated on occasion ---- i blast loud music doing the
housework i like the least ---- think about the zone when you cd dance all
night ---- think about the crowds in the coliseum, maybe basketball ? maybe
lions ?

why do people pay attention to violence ?   i heard an answer recently "b/c
it's evolutionarily adaptive to pay attention to violence, if yr not paying
attention it's that much easier to get surrounded by it"

my friend randy remarked to me while we were watching the turnstile site
http://stadiumweb.com/turnstile/turnstile_part2.html that there was all this
SEX SEX SEX  but where was the violence on the web, that given the continual
pairing of these things in talk wdnt one suppose that there wd be a lot of
violence on-line ?   maybe there is ?

finally, either i cdnt resist or just wanted to be part of the mobs of
students that were now harassing the soldiers from the side streets ----
they'd hide a block down and as the soldiers passed they'd creep down these
narrow streets and rush out onto New Road and start shouting and throwing
bricks and stones and then before the soldiers cd get into their line again
for another charge, back down the sidestreet they'd run ---- i wanted to see
that hidden scene wanted to creep up on the cops with them and see it from
there so i ran with them, but i'd waited a bit too long and the tide had
changed a bit and just as i was making to the backstreet where the students
were laughing and jumping around the tear gas canisters started landing
around us and everyone panic'd and ran everywhichaway knocking each other
over and an old man in a topi fell in front of me and coughed and i helped
him up and started to retch and i was hit on the back of my neck and
shoulder by a brick and went down lost what air i had in my lungs and
suddenly cdnt breathe either ----- a man stepped out of a house and picked
up the old man again and took my arm and led us into his house closing the
door behind us

after i cd breath again they let me come upstairs to peek thru the shutters
at the street (now THAT'S "audience")

the challenge is to allow people to become deindividuated but not lose the
ability to distinguish and choose between things they'd never do and things
they wd and we have this curious sense that on line we're both isolate
individuals and part of a mob, able it seems to access the nastiest options
of both conditions

maybe if there was a table between them ?

a weekly get together with food, jokes, drinks and talk ?


anyway

I'm trying to locate a book of lit crit about poets who lived/worked in
towers. I saw it in a catalogue recently, but I can't remember where. The
author was a woman, I think. Poets were Jeffers, Yeats, Rilke, and...(there
was a fourth). Anyone know the book?
Thanks,

I like the way you're thinking this out, or through.  Nevertheless, there is
some aspect of physicality, or presence, that's lacking in both internet and
book media.  A page is a page is a page, no matter how fast you can send it
elsewhere.  And in light of this speed, how, exactly, do we define "real
time" - is it still "like" talking with someone?  That "like" makes it all
seem rather flat.  Maybe it's my attitude that's flat, but it occurs to me
to suggest that substance has to be in what's ON the page, not how quickly
it can become globe-trotting "information".  I mean, is poetry simply
"information"?  I recognize that it does "globe-trot", but does it have to
formalized primarily in that aspect alone, bereft of whatever "world"
ignited it?

David Baratier:
There are many publishers outside & on this list who do not
>use the perpetual victim stance or "have not" status you are
attributing
>to the lower classes

KL:
Question: How does bringing the power of analysis to bear on a
situation,
speaking out about it, and producing works in response to it constitute
being a "victim"?

Answer:

Are you asserting that you are analyzing the situation? Throughout your
posting you blame a social construct as a way to position yourself. The
implication of-- "I get very tired of this because money does buy
access: more time to write, money to publish one's own journals and
books, which in turn increases  both community as well as publishing
opportunities for one's own work by increasing your 'profile' and
'reputation.'" ---is that your working class background does not allow
you to go beyond the societal expectation inherent in class structure.

"Publication being determined partly by who you know"  The implication
that one cannot "know" anyone without ludicrous jacksons hits me as
another oppressive class myth. I know a guy who was a steelworker when
tri-quarterly published his first book. I know a guy who works in a
cranberry bog for numerous months each year, who is well published & one
of the latter half of this centuries best poets. And so on--

"There's a lack of access to the Internet, where one can hobnob with
publishers and magazine editors"  Yet another victim statement.
Interested folks can go to the library for free, as mentioned.

While not all of these quotes are yours, Kathy, as you also say, "the
quote from Bobbie implicates both Bobbie & myself, in a way laying
things bare, and saying, yup this is how it works." My question is, in
what way are you a reliable source for what occurs in the upper
eschelons of poetry if you have never been there?  I also add, as a
person whose income is negligible, that I have not personally
experienced the insinuated discrepancies described.

Be well

Don't know the fourth in this bridge set, but Pound was fond of calling
Yeats' tower "Ballyphallus." He also pronounced his occult theory of the 28
cycles of the moon & human personality" "very very very bughouse." All to be
found in Brenda Maddox's new bio of Yeats, _Yeats' Ghosts_.

Tony, I did as instructed, and, although I'm generally in favor of any

[from a grant application to the wisconsin arts board last year]


In the tiny unincorporated town of West Lima, Wisconsin, Xexoxial
Endarchy, Ltd. owns, among other propertieswhich
serve as facilities for "Dreamtime Village" & other projects, a one-acre
lot in the center of town which was historically the
"town square." As a public art project Miekal And has began to design
for this site The Driftless
Grotto of West Lima, a village park environment that will be part
fantasmagorical roadside attraction, picnic area,
permaculture demonstration, sculpture garden, & shrine to the Driftless
Region. Special features of the finished Grotto
will include

1) A stone-pillared concrete & blue-glass bottle archway entrance;

2) Mosaiced fence around the perimeter of the square;

3) A 20 ft stacked blue glass bottle tower housing a Jules Verne-style
"time machine" which will be operated by the movements of
live birds inside an aviary;

4) Carved & painted remains of a dying 200 yr-old willow tree in the
lot;

5) Flow-form water fountains & birdbaths & picnic benches; &

6) A web of tunnels inspired by & emanating from the extant remains on
the lot of an old basement & a cistern which
local folk tell us was literally the town watering-hole & weekly
gathering place many years ago.

7) A bog garden of endemic carniverous pitcher plants.

i agree with both you and tom, jerome!! i think if you want to use the
system and can't afford to you just click in your streetwise mode and find a
  way to do it.. re the typewriter the concrete poets would head for the
op/shop to buy a cheap one because it had some nice type malfunctions so one
for neat letters and one for a few poems you!! cost for what you want....one
of the reasons we took so long to get the web site up at the city of port
phillip when i worked there was the very argument that not all the people
living in the councils boundaries would have access, long meetings, we all
agreed on the ethical base but in the end someone is always going to be

I'd like to combine two recent posts, this one from Tom Beckett

E-mail on listservs such as this functions like speech but without social
context--speech divorced from body language, gesture, eyeblink , etc.
Therein lies the nub of the problem for me.  One comes to rely on strategic
overstatement to make one's point, often generating overreaction in return.

I'm not a luddite.  But every new technology brings a raft of new perils
along with that paradigm shift.  The shift away from the body--the
immateriality of the new electronic media --seems like one of these to me.

and an earlier one from Jacques Debrot, in which he says (in part)

I am interested in articulating  the problem of registering &
mediating the body within artistic production--particularly as this was
addressed by the New York Poets and by the Cage, Johns, Rauschenberg circle.
Language Poetry, interestingly enough, begins as a reaction against the
emphasis the New Americans had placed on the physical body in relation to
the
poetic line and moves instead, of course, toward a self-reflexive
preoccupation with the mediation of inner experience by language.  Watten
explains this move away from the body as a response to the Vietnam conflict,
"the era of napalm," etc.  But the Language Poets' critique is aimed, not at
the most "advanced" considerations of the body, but at Olson, who improperly
essentialized the body as the ground & meaning of his work.

to ask some questions (some of which are left over from a similar discussion
on another poetics list). I can attest to the fact that, at least around the
early 1980s in the Bay Area, there was a definite disdain expressed about
Olson's work and influence among the folks that have been subsequently
identified as the progenitors (and yes there were women too!) of the LPs.
What I'd like to know is: what does it mean to "improperly essentialize the
body as the ground and meaning of [one's] work", and how and why did Olson
do it? Are we talking here about the breath of "Projective Verse" or the
verse itself? Jacques mentions some exceptions to this general trend (e.g.
Leslie Scalapino), but is he in fact correct that the LPs as a whole were
reacting against the New American emphasis on the physical body? If this is
true (and accepting that dualism has placed its poisonous roots deep into
most of our souls), doesn't it follow that if we don't essentialize the body
we in fact wind up essentializing the mind? Isn't that the real cause of the
"peril" that Tom mentions above? (One of my teachers was Norman O. Brown
who, if I'm not mistaken, invented the term "polymorphous perversity" -- is
such a desirable state really the result of this turn away from the body?)
And finally, last Sunday's New York Times had an article on neo-paganism,
which contained the seeminly inoccuous statement that members of the Wicca
movement "regard nature itself as charged with divinity". Is this too
"essentialism"?

Just wondering . . .

It's Hampstead that makes poets unbearable. They meet head on in cars at The
Spaniards tooting their horns & shouting obscenities, because of the
narrowing of the road.  They really & truly crucify one another at Easter.
Some have been found drowned in the White Stone Pond.  Very young ones
hallucinate.  One of these  even reported a hallucinated meeting with
Sigmund Freud.

Anyone on this list knows that poets really get on together unusually well.
Canetti's remark must surely be a very local reference.

Tom--I agree, actually.  _Uncritical_ acceptance is dangerous.  But that's
not my position; I'm looking for ways in which this medium can be used
differently (not necessarily the technology, but the tech _did_ make the
medium more available).

Jim Rosenberg, who's already weighed in on this, is (for example) one to
whom I'd point if asked for examples of artists using elctronic media in
innovative ways--doing things which _are not possible_ in print.

This doesn't mean books are dead, nor that real world face-to-face
communication is dead.  It is emphatically _not_ an "either/or," but a
"yes, and" situation. Most of the people on this list I have never had the
chance to meet, and yet I can exchange ideas, opinions, etc.  That doesn't
mean I wouldn't speak to them in person.

AGENDA


The Ambassador announces the Report of the Committee on Relations with the
Host Country and the appointment of a member by THE PRESIDENT. THE PRESI-
DENT acknowledges. The Ambassador announces the Report of an International
Atomic Energy Agency. THE PRESIDENT nods his head.

Doctor Leopold Konninger is supposed to be chairing the meeting on Human
Rights Questions, Including Alternative Approaches for Improving the
Effective Enjoyment of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Where is
Doctor Leopold Konninger asks THE PRESIDENT and the Ambassador turns his
head.

Doctor Leopold Konninger has drawn up the Vienna Accords in relation to
their Comprehensive Implementation. The Ambassador eagerly awaits the
Special Rapporteur on the Question of Torture and Human Rights in Afghan-
istan. THE PRESIDENT goes to a closed meeting on the Rights of Peoples to
Self-Determination and the approval of a draft pursuant to that effect.

Doctor Leopold Konninger, says the Ambassador, is worrisome these days.
The Ambassador is in charge of Special Human Rights Violations in the
United States of America. He is also the Special Rapporteur on the Sit-
uation of Human Rights in the Sudan.

Doctor Leopold Konninger is considerably weakened; he has not eaten for
several days, and promises not to eat for several days more. He is still
naked and quite cold; he has eyes only for Nikuko, the beautiful Russian
ballet dancer and her cabrioles. Nikuko is stunning in a lavender tutu and
matching tights and slippers.

Doctor Leopold Konninger has killed many people. He watches Nikuko close-
ly, his pince-nez back in place, his legs and lips slightly parted. For
the past two days, he has not been able to think of death, nor his work
promoting Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought
and/or Desertification, particularly Those Countries South of the Standard
Equatorial Zone. He believes he owns Nikuko, grown her like a plant or
animal or human. He believes he has fed her body and thereby owns those
transformations of her body pursuant to proper nourishment, Nikuko eating
during her pirouettes, drinking during her entrechats.

Doctor Leopold Konninger cannot imagine speaking a single word. He cannot
imagine anything. The Ambassador says to THE PRESIDENT, who has returned
from his closed meeting, to the subject of Doctor Leopold Konninger, there
no longer corresponds an object.

THE PRESIDENT nods. He and the Ambassador leave for the Meeting for the
Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the
Prostitution of Others. They pass by a door, imagining Doctor Leopold
Konninger and Nikuko within. THE PRESIDENT says to the Ambassador, just
as Doctor Leopold Konninger is a subject without a corresponding object,
so does this meeting have an object without a corresponding subject.

Hit? n You have 19 Dealer has KC+AD+2D+TC = bust You win $2 Action $6
You're even New game 5C up 4D+5S Hit?

They are both thinking of Nikuko. They cannot imagine what is Nikuko's
and what is not Nikuko's. Nikuko cannot imagine either. She is at the top
of her form.

What medium is democratic? What is a democratic medium? Radio and newspapers I
suppose are the closest to being available to all. But those are also media that
are not particularly open to input.

It's true that it does cost money to be on the Internet and to have a computer.
And there are many countries, unlike just about all of Canada, where an Internet
connection is not possible. And the United States does control the Internet. That
needn't be the case, though, and if the Internet grows into a truly robust
international communications channel, cannot remain so.

I don't understand your point about el. media militating against reflective
habits at all, really. There is unmindfulness in most quarters, el. or not. I
don't think it's a peculiarly el. phenomenon. And I have found that if you look
hard on the Internet, you find many quarters that are simply brilliant and deeply
reflective.

Economically you mean? Perhaps. Although that remains to be seen. Artists have a
key advantage in this medium in that they can make Web sites and communicate in
this medium in a way that is not possible to most.  And, as opposed to TV, film,
radio, and newspapers, they usually have access to it both as readers and
writers. It will be the artists, not the typical publishers and broadcasters,
etc., who establish dynamite publishing houses in various media on an
international basis.

What revolution are you talking about? Liberty and justice and a PC and Internet
connection on the desktop for all? No, I suppose it won't. But it does seem that
there are some possibilities here for very widespread influence and action that
should not be so lightly discounted by a reflective person like yourself. The
trajectory is not so obviously a recapitulation of the status quo.

You are debunking the myths of the popular press, and I suppose they need
debunking, but after debunking the inane, isn't a more considered criticism in
order? And isn't that what you find here on this electronic list, for instance?

Here's the relevant bibliographical information:

Theodore Ziolkowski, _The View from the Tower: Origins of an
Antimodernist Image_ (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1998).

I found the book somewhat disappointing.  Ziolkowski touches on an a
array of interesting connections, but he doesn't provide much in the
way of theorization or analysis.  And, although the book contains some
fascinating photographs and reproductions, they're all quite small, and
they're all in low-quality black and white.  In short, this book would
have been best if it had been published as a coffee-table book filled
with glossy pages and enormous colour photographs.

Best,

With all of this discussion about the nature of the internet and its
relation to poetry, I'm wondering why we use this listserv mostly for
debates and advertisement.

I think most of us would agree that collaboration and community are what
make the poetry we are interested in different.  Aren't we supposed to be a
group of poets and people interested in poetics (poeticists?)?  Then why
don't we use this listserv for more creative purposes?

Does anyone remember the renga that was spontaneously composed on this
listserv around the death of Ginsberg?  Why don't we do more of that?

Anyone interested?

Those of you who have come to the list more recently will
not recall the renga to which Grant Jenkins refers, which
was initiated in the context of the Yasusada affair (as
it came to be called) by Steven Shoemaker in July 1995.
Further information is available, as always, in the
searchable archive of the Poetics List; follow the Poetics
links from the front page of the Electronic Poetry Center
at <http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

What was interesting in the project was the perhaps
unexpected effect of simultaneity of response, which
was to derail the form into a hydra-like entity that
eventually came to dominate list discourse. Much less
interesting was the general tenor of response, which
tended not to reflection or density but sheer verbiage -
anyway, that was my response in 1995. What is certain
is that the renga's occlusion of other conversation
became tedious after a time; I believe the first call
to halt - in any case, the most damning - was given in
August 1995 by George Bowering:

        When I hear the word "renga" I reach
        for my D-key.

(Perhaps recalling a quotation lightly attributed to
Jack Spicer in Beatitude no. 17: "When I hear the word
Ferlingetti, I reach for my g..n."). GB's sentiment was
seconded not long after by Lindz Williamson in a message
entitled "Please Stop."

I wouldn't want to prevent any such project from happening
on the list, but I would suggest that it might be of use to
learn from the past. Perhaps if someone would volunteer to
be the renga custodian, so that the list wouldn't be flooded
with such messages? That is, this volunteer could collect
and assemble the responses backchannel, sending updates to
the list periodically. I think David Israel performed this
service for us with the renga written for the late, loved
Allen Ginsberg during his illness in March-April 1997.

In any case, I want to avoid having 15 renga-related
messages coming to the list every day, as happened before.

So, the arguments are not melting before my eyes.

I did not say that poets should not use PCs: the fact that I am e-mailing

these messages would contradict such a proposition.

I am saying that we should not lie to ourselves that the Web is more open

than books are.

Yes, access is easier: if you are a citizen of the 'developed' 'world'.

Yes, books were exclusionist in their day, so that makes it OK to reproduce

this in Webworld? While we're at it, we could reinstitute serfdom, witch

hunts and child labour.

I know a lot of poets find new and exciting potential in virtual creation,

and that the Internet gives users access to a huge range of material. But

look again at the figures posted by kathylou, and then let's be honest about

the _social_ limitations of the medium. It is, in many ways, another way of

enforcing centre/margin relationships, another hot topic on this list.

Mime-Version: 1.0

i think some of us on this list probably weary of the "access" question
*not* b/c the entire planet is actually online (as kathy lou's stat post
indicates, it's not), and *not* b/c there is nothing problematic about the
online world (as miekal suggests, there are problems), and *not* b/c we
believe we writers/artists need all the help we can get (albeit many of us
DO think this---which is the upshot, i think, of introducing the typewriter
as artifact into the discussion, as jim rosenberg has done)...

this question of access *will* continue to haunt the online world for
sometime to come... but if the digital world is not reducible to binaries,
neither is this question of access... ergo many of us would like to see the
question of access modified some to account for the changes of the last
decade... some of the very first exchanges i had online, c. 1991, concerned
the issue of access... and the past eight years have seen, it's fair to
say, an entirely unanticipated expansion of these spaces -- granted,
primarily in the industrialized nations (said expansion not w/o, to be
sure, a disturbingly corporate, if (as tom beckett indicates) incorporeal,
presence... which latter topoi have, of course, been the subject of a flood
of articles, essays, books, etc.)...

yes, the online world was for so long almost exclusively white male... i
don't think one can make the latter claim anymore -- times are changing
(albeit similar claims may be made, corresponding to kathy lou's global
stats)... but in fact, there is some (customary, in fact) danger even in my
saying that the online world "was for so long exclusively white male"... of
course i don't wish to deny that the majority body count, as well as
prevailing perception of same, has been white male, esp. prior to this
decade -- but this does little to explain the early presence, e.g., of
native/indigenous peoples on the web...

do any of you know art mcgee?... art has for years now documented (in my
view, heroically) the presence of minority-ethnic groups in the online
world... a small presence perhaps in terms of overall percentages, but a
vital, even catalytic presence in terms of imagining the digital world as a
site of possible social transformation... interesting that so many of these
groups, having been disenfranchised for so long in ftf culture, saw the
potential of the web and the internet immediamente, hence migrated into
these spaces long before (i would say) many of the poets on this list got
their feet wet with modems and the like... and they did so, not
surprisingly, with limited resources---which is to say, in the face of
significant (social and material) resistance...

that history has yet to be written, but when it IS written, it'll be an eye
opener, i'm certain of it...

in any case, let me return to my first para: if we writers need all the
help we can get (imho), then should be using all the media at our
disposal... which is another way of asserting the following re new media:
their disposition is not a foregone conclusion... and it's not a matter of
being a luddite or a technophile, either... it's a matter of using these
media to (it is to be hoped) constructive ends, while remaining critical
(as opposed to merely skeptical) of the larger issues that surface in the
midst of such technologies... i think it's wise, that is, to use these
media to critique these media---but critique is not simple skepticism, it
requires something more than the observation that 'not everyone is
online'... it entails at least some sense of the subtleties at work around
here... if i were to claim that the u.s. public domain revealed a
predominantly and oppressively white male view of the world c. 1945, few
would argue with me (i think, i hope)... but if i were to claim that the
u.s. public domain c. 1945 was *exclusively* white male---i.e., de
facto---well i would HOPE someone would argue with me, would draw out the
subterranean complexities buried under such an assertion, and point out the
vital presence of non-white-male discourse, however illegible from more
mainstream perspectives...

i trust i'm making some sense here... in effect i'm asking (as it were) for
a more nuanced discussion of what's going down when we all get together
online... when you correlate (e.g.) the rise of electronic media with an
increasingly mobile workforce, the result is a matter neither of sheer
"negatives" nor of sheer "positives" --- similarly (if i may), that i might
not ultimately be placed in the earth alongside my folks in syracuse, ny,
is a matter, for me, of no simple social-material equation... hence the
kind of anti-digital nostalgia i hear regularly in folks like sven birkerts
bugs me (to say the least), esp. as (from a non-white male pov, if this
isn't too much of a presumption on my part) the world of 80 or 90 years ago
leaves SO MUCH to be desired, both spiritually and materially... not that
anyone around here is a fan of birkerts, but---

best,

joe

On the subject of poetry and communication, here some extracts from Brian
Coffey on that very subject. These quotes are from an interview with Parkman
Howe sometime in the 70s. The question to which Brian was responding was:
'You have often said that you do not aim to communicate in your poetry.'

'Well, I want as a platform, if one is talking about poetry, that poets do
not write in order to communicate. And if they do put themselves in the
position of being communicators,  then they are propagandists.....

But what is communication? ...you have a sending device, you have a
receiving device, and you have a medium for sending, and a bit of
information: something like, say, the letter _o_. It goes in to the sending
device and it is despatched so it is reproduced whole and entire, _o_, at
the other end.... Now nothing has occurred really....

..what happens when one encounters a new poem?  Well, there is
non-understanding to begin with, and, one hopes, non-preconception...

Now. in such meetings there is not communication. There is something quite
different going on that is extremely tentative on both sides. The
tentativeness is something which has a long future ahead of it. It may end
in rejection, it may end in something else.'

Subject:      Octavio Paz
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Poetry Lovers Denied Access as Octavio Paz's memory is institutionalized

        Sunday, October 24, American poetry and the memory of Octavio Paz were
betrayed as the public was denied access to a gala reading in tribute to the
late Nobelist.   To organize the event, The Mexican Cultural Institute of
Washington, DC and New York and the Metropolitan Museum of Art collaborated
with some of America's most prestigious cultural institutions: The Academy
of American Poets, the Poetry Society of America (PSA) and others.  Readers
included U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky, Pulitzer Prize winner Mark
Strand, John Kenneth Galbraith, Paz's primary translator, Eliot Weinberger,
as well as other luminaries.
        Sure to be a popular event, it was advertised as a public affair in
publications such as the Village Voice.  The ads included a phone number and
stated tickets (free) were to be distributed between 5-6 p.m. at the Met.
Those calling the number to reserve tickets were told tickets could not be
reserved and that reservations were unnecessary -- plenty would be
available.
        I arrived at 4:55pm and joined a line of about 200 strong.  Through the
course of the hour, that number grew to over 500.  People had come in from
all parts of the city and outside New York.  We waited in the blustery cold
and received encouragement as late as 5:30 p.m. when a man announced that
those already holding tickets should form a separate line; those without
tickets should continue waiting.  Those who waited in the small
ticket-holding line of a couple dozen seemed to be characterized by thousand
dollar suits or fashionable scarves.
        At approximately 6:00pm, the ticket-holding line was admitted.  As soon as
they were inside, the guards announced there were no more tickets.  At no
point as we were waiting (in the cold) were we told we may not get tickets;
in fact, the opposite was indicated.  After 25 minutes of protest, and after
being told dozens of times that no more tickets were available, a small
number of us (3 dozen or so) were allowed in and given tickets; ostensibly,
we had made an ugly enough scene to warrant placation by the never-ugly
Metropolitan.  But only by pushing myself through guards and running up the
escalator did I gain ingress.
        Once inside, I was struck by dozens of scattered but definitely empty
seats.  I entered the auditorium just as the director of the museum alluded
to the unfortunate incident outside, which, he quipped, was due to the way
Paz was fervently revered by so many.  The audience chuckled as a wide and
unmistakably supercilious smile spread across the director's face.  Robert
Pinsky, the master of ceremonies, made no allusion to what had happened.
However, Mr. Pinsky was [indeed] aware of what had happened.  I spoke to him
for 5-10 minutes after the program, when he hastily expressed his regret but
assured me I had no idea how busy and ill-equipped he was.  With a great big
smile, he averred he had no more control over the situation than I did.
        The day after the event, I contacted Monica Delatorre at the Mexican
Cultural Institute at New York.  Granted tickets were 400 guests and friends
of the readers, sponsors, and staff of the sponsoring organizations such as
the PSA, she explained.  And although the Mexican Cultural Institute was
aware the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium could hold only 800, but did not
expect such a large crowd.  As to why people waiting in line were not
warned, she could only answer that the Metropolitan was responsible for
actually handing out the tickets.  Where her reports conflicted with my
experience was in the number of free tickets given.  She had heard 400 were
given away.  In my estimation no more than 50 of us were granted entrance,
and we only received tickets after being told no tickets were available.

Within the closed walls of the Museum auditorium Sunday evening, the event
was a pleasure.  But outside, it was a disgrace.  It was an embarrassment to
the cultural and poetry institutions, which reinforced that they are indeed
institutions, nearly impregnable.
For any poetry event, the circumstances surrounding the reading would have
been intolerable.  For this event in particular, they are unforgivable.
Octavio Paz, who emphasized openness in so much of his work (and this
emphasis was noted by the majority of the readers on Sunday) would have been
saddened and angered to know hundreds of people were turned away from his
supposedly public tribute.  Compounding the hateful irony, Sunday's event
seemed to demonstrate a dangerous political condition which Paz rebelled
against: the intellectual elite's alliance with the social and economic
elite.  Paz's memory belongs to all who read and admired him.  The
exclusionist organizers of the event monopolized the honoring of his memory
and dispensed it as a privilege -- granted to those with the right
connections, large bank accounts, and Ph.Ds.  In so doing, they desecrated
his memory, which many turned away hold sacred.
Last November, the PSA, a co-sponsor of the reading, held a weeklong program
to discuss poetry's role in America.  Hosting the program, as he hosted
Sunday's tribute, was Robert Pinsky.  The most obvious questions raised, and
the ones most lengthily addressed, were why America is so cold towards
poetry and what can be done to improve the deteriorating relationship
between the public and the poetry.  Although no one could offer a definitive
solution to America's poetry crisis that weekend, no one suggested teasing
our nation's cultural capital with a knockout reading and then denying
access.
Mr. Pinsky's role, however passive, is especially disturbing. By
participating in the closed-door ceremonies, he acted as an inheritor of
some hierarchical academic pedigree rather than as a democratic spokesman,
embodying and facilitating the confluence of poetry and the public.  As a
friend pointed out to me, poetry has chronically suffered because it is
considered a high art - property of a moribund aristocracy.  Pinsky's job is
to defy this qualification by bringing poetry to the people (he has tried to
do so with programs like the favorite poem project).  But as he acts
antithetically to this purpose, academic poetry becomes more dependent on an
increasingly uninterested patron elite.
        If an organization wants to hold an exclusive celebration for Octavio Paz
that right is guaranteed.  However, such a reading would not honor the
spirit of Paz and should in no way claim to represent him in any official
capacity.  This reading, widely advertised, was clearly intended as just
such an official tribute.  For that reason, the city of New York - and on a
much grander scale, the United States and Mexico, must acknowledge that this
reading did not represent Octavio Paz or those who truly honor him.  If the
historical record reflects the identification of Paz with this reading, it
will reflect an identification of Paz with exclusivity, thus perverting his
memory by allying him with what he combated, through his work and through
his art, all his life.

For the most floridly morbid expressions of the idea that telecommunications
media
"dematerialize" the human body, see the pessimistic simulation theory of
Jean Baudrillard, Paul Virilio, some of Fredric Jameson. There's lots of
interesting, and not necessarily even *new* thinking, though, that
challenges this: e.g., the socialist feminism of Donna Haraway. Haraway's
work always reminds me that no matter how tempting it may be to say that I'm
"dematerialized" in the act of speaking onto this List, my actual body is
still
sitting right here in the chair, typing--- it hasn't gone anywhere.

I'd think "poets" would find it easier to remember this than "theorists," if
only because being a poet, whether inside or outside the academy (at least
in the U.S.), always involves an embattled relationship to practice--- the
labor of poiesis, making, which is always manual labor even if it uses a
word processor.

As for the corporatization of Internet: only Utopians ever believed it
wouldn't happen. Only pessimists believe that it can ever be complete.
Internet is at once an instrument of world domination, and and an

Joe,

If L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E-affiliated poets insisted on some shift of emphasis away
from bodily or phonic presence, I'd say they did so more under the influence
of French (Derridean) deconstruction---which still always requires the
"creative" manual labor of writing--- than of American (de Manian)
deconstruction, which is primarily negative/destructive of writing. In the
context of U.S. poetries alone, the L-affiliated poets were unquestionably
negative of "voice" and the body; but measured against the nihilism of
someone like Jean Baudrillard they hardly seem *primarily* negative. They
still believed in agency, though not the agency of the Romantic lyric
subject. It's not a matter of flipping from one dualistic term to the other,
but rather of reconceptualizing the dualism--- never entirely successfully,
it's
true: but then I don't think many of these poets saw themselves as the end
of the line. I'd guess they saw themselves mainly as making an intervention,
which
would take (and has taken) its place in a spectrum of different
conversations.

" I'm not a luddite.  But every new technology brings a raft of new
perils"


Actually, the Luddites weren't Luddites either.  As E.P. Thompson stresses
in The Making of English Working Class, the demonstrations and attacks and
occupations, carried out under the banner of fictitious "leaders" like Ned
Ludd and Captain Swing were not anti-technology (..it's a complex issue,
and you can certainly read certain aspects of what they did as leaning in
an anti-tech direction, but....);  it appears that they were more about
wanting control over work, and in opposition to unemployment, and the
degradation of conditions and wages, which were associated of course with
the spread of looms and steam power, etc.

RE: POETICS Digest - 1 Nov 1999 to 2 Nov 1999 (#1999-206) might be a good
time to chime in here with a brief report of this year's "Digital Arts and
Culture" conference, held at Gerogia Tech in Atlanta -- on hand were
hypertext notables Michael Joyce and Jay Bolter, Kate Hayles, Mary Flanagan,
Loss Glazier, John Cayley, Christy Sheffield Sanford, Janet Murray, Robert
Coover, Terry Harpold (conf chair), Johanna Drucker, and lots others -- with
performances, talks and installations from a predominately US-based group
but also UK, Canada, Germany, Norway, Belgium, Finland, Australia, and
Uruguay represented in the mix

like at many conferences, tight scheduling and overlapping sessions, as well
as an intentionally over-saturated "digital" environment, made it impossible
to hear and see everyone, but from my perspective there was a marked absence
of discussions like those going on here among Miekal And, Tom Beckett, Steve
Ellis and others -- rather, an underlying determinist and celebratory tone
that almost preempted any talk about access, boundaries, limitations, costs,
representation, etc. -- these issues came up later at dinners and late-night
gatherings (also true of many confs) but the conference seemed for the most
part organized around a "let's see what's hot in e-media today" mentality --
which both excited for the range of possibilities represented in the
installations and bothered for the failure to make room for a more
formalized critique of apparatus, distribution, production, not to mention
the aesthetics of a burgeoning computer-based art and literature [Robert
Coover's anachronistic call for a "return to the written word" in the
concluding minutes of a 2-hour keynote speech nothwithstanding]

true, the multi-million-dollar GTech facilities suggest an all-too-easy
metaphor for the current relationship between acadamia and "new media"
studies and practices -- but also several of the installations were and
still are web-based pieces which anyone with the means to read this post can
access via their modem/cable connections -- also, i was told that the
conference proceedings will be re(web)casted within the next couple weeks
and available using the free Real or QT players

a lot of work done and to be done, a lot of questions -- state-of-the-art
without enough talk on the state of the art

How I Spent My Summer Vacation, by Sharon Preiss
                after Jimmy Schuyler's "The Morning of the Poem"

With the crisp sea breeze splashing endlessly
        about my face my feet the sand between
my toes sometimes sizzling sometimes soothing
        the best being walks at midnight moon full
of sand gleaming sand full of moon streaming across
        the silk of the still sleeping sea but this
is all a lie a dream of course a pleasant one
        and one that would and does include
you because always when there is the sea
        there is you (especially when the sea
is that sandy hook of eastern Massachusetts
        where we've sucked the life out of
lobster and morning and memory many a time).
        If the truth be known and it will be for I
am just about to tell it I did jack shit this summer
        which means nothing it means I did
nothing such a strange expression and I am
        always fascinated about where such expressions
come from and actually saw a fat reference book
        in a library once that explained the origin
of such things and was such a gas I vowed someday
        to own my own copy but haven't yet even
looked for it to buy anywhere or even looked for it
        in the library again to find out its name although
I swear someday I will just like I swear someday
        I will have that summer vacation with you
like the one I just described and have actually had
        before but really miss and want to have again
soon because number one I miss you and number two
        I miss the ocean these two things beyond measure
and number three because I have been working so hard
        at things for the last few years and have been so
broke for the last many years that the words summer
        and vacation mean jack shit to me but evoke some
foggy gray memory of you and make me notice that
        my city seems rather like a ghost town this August
Saturday my skin as luminous white as the belly
        of the frog I just saw dangerously hopping
across Central Avenue a block away from the park.

This argument about the democracy or undemocracy of the internet is getting
ridiculous since every participant to the argument has, obviously, access to
the internet. Here again is a process which excludes, by definition, the very
people in whose interest it is ostensibly being conducted.

Or is this ongoing debate a virtual version of caring for others (virtual
love, virtual sex, virtual social conscience) essentially for the benefit of
the participants.

I do not quite know the difference between a virtual page and a page of a
book, but the difference between virtual love, virtual sex, virtual
conscience, and the other kind are quite clear to me.

Seeing as Tony Green hasn't returned on the library tip, I must say that the
libraries here are terrible. You can use the university library but you must
be a student to borrow books. I never could stay very long in this library
[I lie, the last few days I have spent all day at a desk in there, but with
nary a glance at the shelves] because it has a very orthodox selection of
work; most of my favourite writers have but a token presence. The city
library in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch are both free and both
charge for new books. There is no public free internet. It's much cheaper to
have your own connection than to use the cybercafes. University net time is
very cheap also, but ohhhh so slow!

On the poets tip. I have to say I can't really stand other poet's poems, and
often the poets themselves. It's their earnest belief that they've produced
work that has importance, it's their categorization of themselves as a poet.
I'm in denial, I can't stand my own work which is why it stays where it is,
locked within a folder on my hd. Perhaps you might enjoy it, perhaps not. I
am more interested in the poetics of people's poetry; the reasons why, the
explanations, interpretations and thoughtpaths. These are infinitely more
interesting than the same set of marks on a page that never change. Er! I
must run for that bus!

Best regards
Peter

something other than what was there.  I liked the surprise of the unheralded

Again, this response brings with it a massive load of
assumptions about *me* and where I have and haven't been.
And you are simply kidding yourself if you think that
class has nothing to do with access to time to write,
educational opportunities, access to literary communities,
access to the Internet, access to publications and being
published, time to read, money to buy books, money to
publish books, etc.
Hurray for the steelworker who published a book. What does
this prove? Is this the exception to the rule?
And why is it that when folks speak up about class in
poetry communities they are immediately accussed of being
"victims" "whiners" etc.? Is this how you respond to
racism? Or does racism exist, and classism doesn't? Get
real.

Justice, as the result of some implicit intellectual formula in this domain
of poetry, seems the result of making everything and everyone the SAME.

Once HUD insists that eveveryonnee can have the SAME house that you and you
have sweated afforded,
then your book published by Henry Regenery and your book published by USPS
art EQUAL.

The fate of Virtu in Poetry
lies in the out and out war between Karl Marx
or the people who now manage the Panama Canal,
those who would make all the SAME
and the other team, say, The JoHn BiRcH SoCiEtY,
the DIFFERENT,
the people who envisioned/constructed the Panama Canal.

Richard Dillon: "I doubt you, Chris, will publish this post."

I must say I never cease to be amazed at the inclination
on the part of some, chiefly male subscribers to turn this
list into a pissing contest. How is it that I can convince
those among us of this tenor - not only Mr. Dillon, btw -
that such things as vociferous criticisms of the work of
one's fellows, public challenges and lines-drawn-in-the-sand,
matter-of-fact dismissals and cutting remarks are a variety
of boorish posturing in which I and numerous others among
the 800 of us here are disinclined to participate - being
here rather to converse about poetry than jock size.

In future, if anyone wishes to "meet me after school,"
please make your request backchannel; in this way may
we refrain from wasting everyone else's time.

fellow travellers,

i'm doing some work on the acoustic hermeneutic. i've been pouring over
linguistics and psychology journals and find sentiments like the following
quotation displays common: "The phonaesthetic properties of words have
been used extensively by poets but we will not be concerned with them
here."

can anyone point me to some places where there is concern? i'm using
jakobson's Six Lectures on Sound and Meaning as a starting point and
kostelanetz' Text-Sound Texts for examples but i'msure there is more
recent scholarship with relationship to current poetic practices.

on another note, it's good to be back on poetics after time inside. it is
a lot louder than i remember tho.

thanks,
kevin hehir

Where are the primary DNS servers? In the United States, aren't they? And
doesn't this mean that other countries have Internet access strictly according
to the whim of the United States or those who control the primary DNS servers?
Don't the DNS (Dynamic Name Servers) contain the records that actually direct
http requests to the appropriate computers on the network?

Isn't it Network Solutions that controls the primary DNS servers? A few other
companies can register domain names, but isn't it through Network Solutions'
ultimate control of the content in the primary DNS servers?

Lecture: Natural Kinds


Sat Nov 6 01:07:18 EST 1999 first off, I thought of a single node with
numerous links; only one was connected, as if the others were absorbed in
it. the centrality of it, the vulnerability of the other nodes, this was a
misrecognition. i would have diagrammed this, a shimmering of the real in
which each entity is affected. Sat Nov 6 01:08:29 EST 1999 further, it had
to do with natural kinds; the question came literally to mind - is a
"natural kind" a natural kind? what sort of universals occur? for example,
think of water. Sat Nov 6 01:09:24 EST 1999 I then went to think of water.
there are names in every language, in all possible worlds, but they are
tied to water, water then remaining at the node, the shimmering of the
forms, and connectivities, node to pointer of the proper name, but this
seems insufficient. why so inefficient? let's say it has to do with data
storage, a kind of stability generated. I'd lecture on this, improvise,
continue, go ahead with all the ramifications. in my imagination, I
pictured the audience, myself pacing back and forth on the stage, gravity
taken for granted. Sat Nov 6 01:11:25 EST 1999 because the style of the
world is that it remains, its obdurate nature, that things remain
sufficiently in place for life to promulgate, memory to use devices. the
subtexts of the devices are the encodings of the real, which are stable.
it goes back, all of it, to non-equilibrium thermodynamics on ultra-fast
time-scales from within. it goes back as well to nearly-decomposable
hierarchies of the real, the impossibly slow decay, if any, of the proton,
the relative emptiness of space, our planetary luck with our collisions.
Sat Nov 6 01:13:02 EST 1999 more than that, the node as generator - all
those names. or as if the node itself generated the names, locale after
locale, their interdependencies and modification occurring on a
superstructural level, but always already connected to the real. that's
the inherent tendency of language, always - towards the real. Sat Nov 6
01:14:07 EST 1999 language of the real and towards the real; it's not
disconnect, but connect so tightly that it literally becomes unimaginable.
language and the real bound, not through parallelisms or empathies, but
through natural kinds based on hyperstable tendencies of the universe as a
whole. Sat Nov 6 01:14:59 EST 1999 fading from culture is fading from
language, returning from culture is returning from language. where the
returning or fading transforms, what teleologies, what places or spaces,
is unsolvable - there is no solution, just as there are no places and
spaces as such. Sat Nov 6 01:17:06 EST 1999 the solution is in the absence
of the solution, in spite of which, worlds work away, as with the three-
body problem - the world works, no matter the mathesis, which in our eyes,
follows suit. Sat Nov 6 01:17:33 EST 1999 the descriptions are non-imagin-
ary, unimaginable.Sat Nov 6 01:18:36 EST 1999 Sat Nov 6 01:18:36 EST 1999

Sat Nov 6 01:07:18 EST 1999 one that is realized, sensory bandwidths and
relativisms become more and less important. less important, since techno-
logical or linguistic extensions are literally that, on the deepest imag-
inable level. more important, since the relativisms point to superstruc-
turality in need of deconstruction, which can never be completed; every-
thing is equally always already in a state of fading from culture. go
where no one has ever gone before, to the deepest couplings and linkages
of the world. then you might lose your grips on natural language, as you
slip towards natural kinds. Sat Nov 6 01:18:09 EST 1999 the descriptions
are non-imaginary, unimaginable.Sat Nov 6 01:18:27 EST 1999

Some retro carpet-bagging on my part here. Tom Ammiano has made the mayoral
runoff in San Francisco against Willie Brown. Brown has long been a social
liberal who has used that stance to front for the most rapacious developers
who've driven SF into a place where rental units now run $1,000 per month
per bedroom (a far cry from the $350 I and my roommates paid in total for
our 7-bedroom house in "Baja Pacific Heights" in the 1976-78 period).

Ammiano is a stand-up comic who first got active in politics by pushing to
protect the rights of gay teachers in the mid-1970s. He's currently the
president of the county board of supervisors and ran a write-in campaign
that garnered 25 percent of all votes with just $20,000 (compared to Brown's
39 percent thanks to a budget of $2.3 million). Voters ejected
ex-mayor/ex-police chief Frank Jordan and political consultant Clint Reilly
from the run-offs, two relatively conservative politicians who got 29
percent of the vote.

Those of us who remember the late Harvey Milk are enheartened by a
demonstration that populist politics need not be the know-nothing
libertarianism of, say, a Jesse Ventura.

You don't need to live in San Francisco to benefit from Ammiano's election
in the December election.

And you can help!

Call 415-503-1529 or e-mail ammiano4mayor@yahoo.com to volunteer and help
make history.

I'm planning on adding to the debate about media and etc but life is getting
complicated.  I've had computer problems for the last 2 days.  Plus there's
been an unexpected death in my family, so I'll be leaving tomorrow to visit
the town I was born in (haven't been back for more than 30 years) for a
couple of days to attend to the business of saying goodbye to a person with
whom I had a long and complicated emotional relationship.

In response to David Baratier's response to Kathy Lou Schultz's posting
on class (which was in
response to a posting by Jill Stengel):

It might be interesting for people to take a wander over to the HOW2
forum on class and innovative
writing for some very interesting responses to questions about class and
innovative writing and also
for a look at Schultz's essay on class and my piece looking at class,
gender and genre in Dodie
Bellamy's The Letters of Mina Harker.
http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2/current/forum/forum.html#west

That said, I'd like to point out that each time this issue has come up
on this list there has been a
smattering of  responses filled with hostility.  Apparently, it is
verboten to cast any kind of light at all
on the topic.  Of course, class and other issues related to power
(feminist investigations spring to
mind) always make some uncomfortable.  Each of us is implicated.

When the complexities of class bleed through imposed boundaries and
definitions lots of
frustration gets expressed.  These complexities are problematic; they
problematicize our
conceptualizing, our reading, and our writing.  They are multiple, not
neatly categorized and
powerful.  They deserve attention, ever the more so for all the
discomfort they cause.

I'm with Will Alexander on this: "But what I speak of is the imaginal
power to leap beyond
                   the brutally imposed confines to combat the
bureaucracies with an
                   elemental seismics, with a new and alien thinking."

Subject: Re: Business, class, access

David Baratier:
There are many publishers outside & on this list who do not
>use the perpetual victim stance or "have not" status you are
attributing
>to the lower classes

KL:
Question: How does bringing the power of analysis to bear on a
situation,
speaking out about it, and producing works in response to it constitute
being a "victim"?

Answer:

Are you asserting that you are analyzing the situation? Throughout your
posting you blame a social construct as a way to position yourself. The
implication of-- "I get very tired of this because money does buy
access: more time to write, money to publish one's own journals and
books, which in turn increases  both community as well as publishing
opportunities for one's own work by increasing your 'profile' and
'reputation.'" ---is that your working class background does not allow
you to go beyond the societal expectation inherent in class structure.

"Publication being determined partly by who you know"  The implication
that one cannot "know" anyone without ludicrous jacksons hits me as
another oppressive class myth. I know a guy who was a steelworker when
tri-quarterly published his first book. I know a guy who works in a
cranberry bog for numerous months each year, who is well published & one

of the latter half of this centuries best poets. And so on--

"There's a lack of access to the Internet, where one can hobnob with
publishers and magazine editors"  Yet another victim statement.
Interested folks can go to the library for free, as mentioned.

While not all of these quotes are yours, Kathy, as you also say, "the
quote from Bobbie implicates both Bobbie & myself, in a way laying
things bare, and saying, yup this is how it works." My question is, in
what way are you a reliable source for what occurs in the upper
eschelons of poetry if you have never been there?  I also add, as a
person whose income is negligible, that I have not personally
experienced the insinuated discrepancies described.

Be well

hanging text iii

i've gone in as far as i can go. i'm choked on all of it. i'm waiting for
you. i'm waiting for the line to hang up. i'm waiting to hang from the
line. i'm kept hanging. i'm in there. i'm pressed out of your back. i'm
pressed out between our legs. i'm broken in there. i'm all colors of the
rainbow. i'm in shame. i'm hiding myself. i'm exposed. i'm troubled with
all of this. i'm nowhere. there are no suns to tell. i know i'm bound to
tell you. there's nothing to look at left or right. there's everything to
look at which empties it all out. what could be, what is emptied out.
there's no truth but i'd at least include this in what might be seen as a
search for it.

i stop by the nikuko shrine. it's ornate, ornamental, elaborate, convolu-
ted, repetitive, baroque, rococo, encrusted. it's all over me. i dream of
a black line through the deep carvings, gravures. it carries me like a
lightning fork through it. i realize - in real life - i've swallowed frac-
tal energies churning in me. they're black carrying my holes into unknown
tunnels i enter to find myself hanging there.

my words huddle together in the tunnels azure and i make into each other,
forking. i can't hear anything and scent dominates, chemicals pressing
into closed eyes. so i remember any scrolls i come across, there are a lot
of them and i'm thinking about them. they unravel into a luminous eye:

to be chanted by burned and hanging bodies:

large and luminous eye, detached, in its fullness, circumscopic, sphere
of surrounding waters

reflecting within towards diffusing centers, there you would find,
invisibly, coalescing of emanants

we would not be acquainted with the emanants and their coalescing,
nor of the large and luminous eye, lidless and always open
to its internal light

nor would we speak of size in this indeterminacy of the sphere, emptiness
surrounding, nor would we speak of the quality of this emptiness, nor of
diffusing centers or diffusing center, nor of number before number

nor of the moments, before which time moved exponentially from infinity,
into and out of infinity, nor primordial concepts of into and out of, nor
primordial concepts of infinity

thinking when time beginning exponentially, thinking
of the singularity of the vector or ray,
the direction among sphericities,
growth of a circular nimbus on the exterior, primordial exteriors,
waves of circumscriptions, splittings and emergent emanants

primordial names among with nikuko emerging, of wisdom and ambiance,
turning back towards diffusing centers, submerging, primordial pulsings
and rhythms

and meanings the beginnings of shrines and primordial powers,
emergences without beginning, paradoxes of progress and development,
the eye, i, i, i, i, i

now so sadly hanging burned upon the tree,
now turning slowly in the wind,
now long gaunt arm descending, now long fingers
almost touching the ground, slowly turning around the object,
slowly grasping it

Happed across the Lycos "top 50" popular search words:

   http://50.lycos.com/

and noticed that "poetry" was number 8.  that's up from #9 last
week (just behind Pamela Anderson and WWF), and displacing the
NFL, which fell to #10.  what does it all mean?  and what are
all those folks searching for when they type in "poetry"?

I'm all for it --

the renga provoked the biggest dropoff in list membership --
bigger even than any meatflap debate scribbling --

Since it was my redux, I would gladly  volunteer to be the e-seamstress of
a collaborative fabric.  I simply think this listserv could serve not
simply as a bulletin board for immediate concerns but as a kind of
anthology or tapestry of collective, communal art.  At least, that is how I
would like people to look back on this endeavor in the future.

Please send ideas, fragments, lines, and other contributions to me:
grantmj@hsc.edu.  I will try to send updates to the list as often as my
schedule allows.

And the United States does control the Internet.

I said "This is bullshit Jim, TCP/IP controls the internet.  Take the United

Dear Poets,

We thought you might be interested in receiving the guidelines for the
first annual _Eckerd College Review_ Poetry Contest, recently advertised
in _Poets & Writers Magazine_.  If you're not interested, we apologize for
inconveniencing you.

ECR is a literary magazine of fiction and poetry produced by the writing
workshop at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida.  Our most recent
issue included a number of fine poets: Dannie Abse, Ruth Schwartz, Betty
Adcock, and Dana Gioia, among others.  In the past, writers such as Red
Hawk, Katheryn Stripling Byer, Dorothy Allison, Elie Wiesel, Fred
Chappell, and R.T. Smith have appeared in our pages.

We accept submissions of short fiction (fewer than 25 pages) and poetry
(no more than 75 lines).  A brief cover letter with a biographical note is
appreciated.  We do not accept submissions via disk or e-mail, and we
cannot consider simultaneous submissions.

All contest entries are subject to the same guidelines as regular
submissions (cover letter, bio note, etc.).  Contest entries should be
clearly marked "Poetry Contest."  The first round of judging will be
completed by ECR editorial staff.  The winning poet will receive $500; 2nd
and 3rd place poets will receive $50; all winning poems will be published
in the Spring 2000 issue of ECR.  All contest entries will be considered
for publication.

Please include a self-addressed stamped envelope and a processing fee of
$7 for three poems ($3 for each additional poem) with your entry.  Checks
should be made payable to The Eckerd College Review and addressed to:

        The Eckerd College Review Poetry Contest
        4200 54th Avenue South
        St. Petersburg, FL 33711

All submissions to ECR, regular or contest, should arrive before December
1, 1999.  Expect a response time of 3 to 6 months.  Also, please note that
we will be unable to reply to individual questions regarding the contest;
refer to resources such as the _Poets' Market_ for general poetry
submission guidelines.

We look forward to reading your work!

Sincerely,


Cecily Iddings
Tomas Radcliffe, Editors

Okay, I'll bite.  I don't understand "before Bradstreet" in English, in
the U.S. - who would that be?  And in fact, if I have to pick someone,
some poem, in this way, I'd say Bradstreet's as good as anyone -
particularly "On My Dear Grandchild Simon Bradstreet," for its utterly
sarcastic tone regarding God's divine providence - a tone which prefigures
Dickinson's in poems like "I'm 'wife' -- I've finished that."  All of the
truisms about God's wisdom and grace here are couched by "Let's," my
favorite being the extra-tentative "Let's say He's merciful as well as
just."  Everytime I read this I feel like responding, "Alright, what the
hell, let's say it."

For something more explicitly U.S.-ish, how 'bout Phillis Wheatley's "To
His Excellency General Washington" which inaugurates the cooptation of
Amurika's revered terms ("The land of freedom's heaven-defended race") by
the marginalized.   How did Creeley put it - "America, give us our country
back"?  Somethin like that.

-Mike.

I will watch the proposed renga   &
guess that I will be, first, deleting a lot, & maybe , second,
setting: poetics-list no mail   until it's over -
_collaborative_ verbal spillage & seepage soon got
tedious last time out -- after about a week --
I'd hopefully suggest a renga go on a renga list

Kevin,

Work by Reuven Tsur and Garrett Stewart might be of interest here --
neither, though, without their problems (especially Tsur, who almost seems
to insist on a kind of transcultural, transhistoric "legibility" of the
onomatopoetic qualities of vowel sounds. But worth looking at as one example
of how the universalist hopes of a certain strain of Moscow/Prague
linguistics [one recalls Jakobson's commitment to Khlebnikov and the project
of zaum] can be leaned on and pushed into a more recuperative mode by more
recent practitioners).

From a less literary perspective, there's a recent anthology edited by Steve
Roden and Brandon Labelle (sp?) of California electroacoustic/sound-art
ensemble id battery. I'll hunt down the title and backchannel you. Pieces in
this one tend to deal more with the liminal zones between acoustic
hermeneutics and acoustic phenomenology, with an eye to the particular
properties of electrically and electronically recorded sound. Other work in
this rough area might include Pierre Schaeffer's writings on musique
concrete (some of which are housed at UbuWeb), and the writings on acoustic
ecology and related themes referenced and linked by the World Soundscape
Project, whose URL follows:

http://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/WorldSoundscapeProject/wsp.html

And many suggestive pieces, of course, in both _Close Listening_ (ed.
Charles Bernstein, U of Chicago) and _Sound States_ (ed. Adelaide Morris,
Duke UP).

Also, might be interesting to follow out some of the suggestions in Nate
Mackey's work -- both poems and essays -- in looking at "the creaking of the
word," (a Dogon concept, if I'm not mistaken, taken up in _Discrepant
Engagement_, a relevant "third-party" discussion of which takes place in the
Harryette Mullen interview  in COMBO #1), the "rasp," etc., as features of
African and Afro-diasporan musical/poetic practices. And Jacques Attali's
treatment of noise as the coding of social violence/eruption of violence
within social codes continues to be a jumping-off point, though problematic
in terms of the near-transparency it often posits between the history of
modes of production in the "economist" sense, and the history of modes of
cultural production.

I'm sure there's a wealth of other stuff, but time and resources are limited
from where I sit. Instinct tells me, though, that at least a brief foray
beyond the linguistic and literary might be of some use in this project.
Anyhow, I hope some of this has been helpful.

Best,
Taylor

Subject:        phonaesthetic

fellow travellers,

i'm doing some work on the acoustic hermeneutic. i've been pouring over
linguistics and psychology journals and find sentiments like the following
quotation displays common: "The phonaesthetic properties of words have
been used extensively by poets but we will not be concerned with them
here."

can anyone point me to some places where there is concern? i'm using
jakobson's Six Lectures on Sound and Meaning as a starting point and
kostelanetz' Text-Sound Texts for examples but i'msure there is more
recent scholarship with relationship to current poetic practices.

on another note, it's good to be back on poetics after time inside. it is
a lot louder than i remember tho.

thanks,
kevin hehir

Small Press Traffic presents:

Friday, November 12, 7:30 p.m.
Ammiel Alcalay
reading and interviewed by Norma Cole

Ammiel Alcalay, scholar, critic, translator, poet and prose stylist, author
of The Cairo Notebooks, makes a rare appearance in San Francisco to
celebrate the publication by City Lights Books of his new book, Memories of
Our Future: Selected Essays, 1982-1997.  He will read from his work, old
and new, and then will be joined on stage by San Francisco poet and
translator Norma Cole, who will ask him about his multifold talents and
accomplishments, and his translation as activism.  With this event Small
Press Traffic launches "In To View," a new series which hopes to illuminate
in a discursive mode the issues, concerns and unspoken assumptions of the
best writers of our day.

"Over the past fifteen years," writes Alcalay, "I have focused primarily on
Hebrew and Jewish literature of the Middle East, in its Islamic, Levantine
Arabic, and Israeli contexts. My work on Bosnia during the war in former
Yugoslavia has entailed similar efforts at creating the cultural space for
unfamiliar works to emerge. Throughout, my work as poet and prose-writer
remains a crucial reference point, representing a kind of standard in form
and content that I insist my other writing (and translation) adheres to."
Alcalay's poetry, prose, reviews, critical articles and translations have
appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The New Yorker, Time Magazine,
The New Republic, The Village Voice, The Jerusalem Post, Grand Street,
Conjunctions, Sulfur, The Nation, Middle East Report, Afterimage,
Parnassus, City Lights Review, Review of Jewish Social Studies, The Review
of Contemporary Fiction, The Michigan Quarterly, Caliban, Paper Air,
Paintbrush, Mediterraneans, and various other publications.

Norma Cole's most recent works are Desire & Its Double (Instress, 1998),
Spinoza in Her Youth (A.bacus February, 1999), and Scout, a slide-text
presentation.  Her current translation work includes a selection of French
writing and poetics called Crosscut Universe forthcoming from Burning Deck.
Her translations of Anne Portugal's book Nude is forthcoming from Green
Interger, and also of Lebanese writer Fouad Gabriel Naffah's poetry is
forthcoming from Post Apollo Press.  Cole has been the recipient of
Gertrude Stein Awards, as well as awards from The Fund for Poetry.

in San Francisco to celebrate the publication by City Lights Books of
his new book, <italic>Memories of Our Future: Selected Essays,
1982-1997</italic>.  He will read from his work, old and new, and then
will be joined on stage by San Francisco poet and translator Norma
Cole, who will ask him about his multifold talents and accomplishments,
and his translation as activism.  With this event Small Press Traffic
launches "In To View," a new series which hopes to illuminate in a
discursive mode the issues, concerns and unspoken assumptions of the
best writers of our day.


"Over the past fifteen years," writes Alcalay, "I have focused
primarily on Hebrew and Jewish literature of the Middle East, in its
Islamic, Levantine Arabic, and Israeli contexts. My work on Bosnia
during the war in former Yugoslavia has entailed similar efforts at
creating the cultural space for unfamiliar works to emerge. Throughout,
my work as poet and prose-writer remains a crucial reference point,
representing a kind of standard in form and content that I insist my
other writing (and translation) adheres to."  Alcalay's poetry, prose,
reviews, critical articles and translations have appeared in
<italic>The New York Times Book Review, The New Yorker, Time Magazine,
The New Republic, The Village Voice, The Jerusalem Post, Grand Street,
Conjunctions, Sulfur, The Nation, Middle East Report, Afterimage,
Parnassus, City Lights Review, Review of Jewish Social Studies, The
Review of Contemporary Fiction, The Michigan Quarterly, Caliban, Paper
Air, Paintbrush, Mediterraneans,</italic> and various other
publications.


Norma Cole's most recent works are <italic>Desire & Its Double</italic>
(Instress, 1998), <italic>Spinoza in Her Youth</italic> (A.bacus
February, 1999), and <italic>Scout,</italic> a slide-text presentation.
 Her current translation work includes a selection of French writing
and poetics called <italic>Crosscut Universe </italic>forthcoming from
Burning Deck.  Her translations of Anne Portugal's book

Ron,

Thanks for sending this -- voting for Ammiano is the first time I've
participated in electoral politics (outside of union elections) and felt
good about it the day after. Being a recent arrival, and living in one of
the city's more left-leaning neighborhoods, I don't have any very accurate
way to judge how the runoff might go -- but based on bus-stop talks, running
into people at tenants' meetings, pizza joints, et al, the support for Tom
seems to be far deeper than the Chron/Ex "don't worry, Mr. Fisher, it's just
a protest vote" line would seem to indicate. Of course, my live-in
landlord -- who rakes in $1250 a month for the single room my wife and I
share -- walked in on a conversation I was having with a friend touching on
Ammiano's campaign, and delivered himself of a fairly histrionic litany of
reasons not to vote for the "gay Mao." I wish I were exaggerating here, but
to see how apparently acceptable as public discourse this sort of homophobic
red-baiting has become (once again) since Ammiano's showing on election day,
take a look at today's Chron editorial cartoon, which depicts a man and
woman, presumably a hetero couple, looking at an Ammiano campaign poster:
MAN: "How can I vote for him? He's a...you know..." WOMAN: "Yeah. Marxist."

So we have something of a struggle on our hands, and the call for
contributions is certainly apropos. As would be, perhaps, more letters to
the editor like today's, which asks the pertinent question why Willie
Brown's sexual profile hasn't been attached to his name as a de facto part
of his job description.

Subject:        Ammiano for Mayor (SF)

Some retro carpet-bagging on my part here. Tom Ammiano has made the mayoral
runoff in San Francisco against Willie Brown. Brown has long been a social
liberal who has used that stance to front for the most rapacious developers
who've driven SF into a place where rental units now run $1,000 per month
per bedroom (a far cry from the $350 I and my roommates paid in total for
our 7-bedroom house in "Baja Pacific Heights" in the 1976-78 period).

Ammiano is a stand-up comic who first got active in politics by pushing to
protect the rights of gay teachers in the mid-1970s. He's currently the
president of the county board of supervisors and ran a write-in campaign
that garnered 25 percent of all votes with just $20,000 (compared to Brown's
39 percent thanks to a budget of $2.3 million). Voters ejected
ex-mayor/ex-police chief Frank Jordan and political consultant Clint Reilly
from the run-offs, two relatively conservative politicians who got 29
percent of the vote.

Those of us who remember the late Harvey Milk are enheartened by a
demonstration that populist politics need not be the know-nothing
libertarianism of, say, a Jesse Ventura.

You don't need to live in San Francisco to benefit from Ammiano's election
in the December election.

And you can help!

(of the U.S.) poem"?

This is a difficult question, because in it are two loaded words, "American"
and "poem."   A valuable question, with unexpected results, even upon a
cursory glance.

I have written the following questions/phrasings to elucidate the
multiplicities necessary for me to consider any answer, which is sure to be
full of "and"s and "or"s.  None of the following is INTENDED to display or
compare penis dimension.  This is about poetry (which often does coincide
with genitalia or even secondary sex characteristics from time to time, so
my apologies if I tempt you into thinking about typically hidden fleshy
bits).

variations of the question based on variations of what "American" means:

1.  first poem written in the Americas, geographically speaking (sounds like
a challenge from a historical/archaeological perspective, and would also
depend upon whether lyrics would be admitted):  I am sure there are some
very old Native American songs/chants; anyone?

2.  first poem written in the Americas by a European:  either doesn’t exist
or is unknown but this is a lack of scholarship on my part

3.  first poem written in the Americas in English:  ?  anyone?

4.  first “important” poems written in the Americas in English:  Anne
Bradstreet, particularly in “The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung upon America,” her
first book written in 1650.  She was born in Northampton, England.  It is
interesting to note that Anne Hutchinson is said to be a poet, but I cannot
find further evidence of that claim.  If true, it was probably read, and she
was very important, and she came before Anne Bradstreet.  Which leads me to
something revelatory about the origins of American poetry, if this be what
you consider the beginning:  Bradstreet and Hutchinson were both somewhat
radical (Hutchinson very much so) and both allegedly had pretty scathing
tongues.  So perhaps they would largely be ignored on the POETICS list.

In Broadstreet's "The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung upon America," she writes, "I
am obnoxious to each carping tongue."  She also made heavy use of sarcasm,
as Michael noted in his post.

5.  first poem written in America as a colony in English:  ?

6.  first poem written in America as a nation circa Declaration of
Independence in English:  ?

7.  first poem written in America as a nation circa the Constitution (signed
or drafted, your pick) in English:  ?

any of the above,  but in Spanish instead of English:  ?

in French: ?

in Choctaw: ?  etc.

8.  first “quintisentially” American poem:  settled by arguments on what it
is to be “truly American.”

Based on Michael's reasoning (I am sure I am taking it loosely so bear with
me), I would say Jupiter Hammon, 1760:  “An Evening Thought.  Salvation by
Christ, with Penetential Cries.”

http://www.lihistory.com/vault/423bvl.gif

Hammon preceded Wheatley by at least 10 years.

And then the problem of defining a poem:

Do we include or exclude clever engravings on headstones?  Worksongs?  Sea
shanties?  Actually these are difficult questions for me, ones I do not have
any answer for, except to say truisms like "lyrics are lyrics."

Answering this question satisfactorily seems to take on the girth of a
doctoral thesis quickly.


>Mike wrote:

>Okay, I'll bite.  I don't understand "before Bradstreet" in English, >in
>the U.S. - who would that be?

A couple of sources on the internet say Bradstreet was America's first
"important" poet, which implies to me there were other poets merely
unimportant.  Funny word, "important."  I give that word little value; it
strikes me as a word used in sophistry.  Hutchinson, if she wrote verse,
would be one such person to satisfy the pre-Bradstreet requirement.

One thing I have learned through this query is that:

any answer will have multiple answers and interpretations
the roots of American poetry after the Mayflower take up their water from
the soil of women and slaves, decidely the underdogs of their times (and our
times, o how things get stuck in mud).  And the "original" American poetry
is steeped in the language of subservience & religious norms, especially
rebellion against subservience & religious norms  The sentiments of those
encountering broken promises (the promise of equality and freedom, namely)
in a new land.

Also, the problem of discovering the original American poem is like trying
to recover Courbet's original "Origin of Mankind" painting.  The origin
without an original.  Material composed of origins about origins that are
lost in history.  Always origins, without an original, beginning (v) without
a beginning (n).

Then straight I 'gin my heart to chide
And did they wealth on earth abide?

Raise up they thoughts above the sky
That dunghill mists away may fly.

"Upon the Burning of Our House, July 10 1666"

I think "utterly sarcastic" is probably right. Though only as counterpoise to
Increase and Cotton's sermonizing versifyings and Wigglesworths' dreadnought.

But maybe that distance of intentionality is what makes for various FIRSTs.

Roger Williams' transliterations of the Narragansett "A Key Into The Language
of America" with this poesy rouseauisms on the Making of Americaans. Might
stand as a first.

I disagree with the idea of class limiting my opportunities to be
published. It has not. If writing is important, a way to survive will be
figured, in my experience. The use of the bog or steelworker is not an
exception by any stretch of the imagination. And that others have
programmed you to believe any instance of a writer with a working class
background getting published is a phenomenon, perhaps is more indicative
of your vantage point or associations. For me it has been more of the
rule and I can think of many other examples, including myself. Almost
all of the peoples books I have published fit this category as well. If
you want some kind of a useful discussion, as you claim for, it would
behoove you not to be so irrelevant and snide in your comments.

My belief is not that one needs to "pull themselves up by the
bootstraps" to remove poverty from the equation, as you have typified
it. Rather, finding, to quote Will, "the imaginal power to leap beyond
the brutally imposed confines to combat the bureaucracies with an
elemental seismics, with a new and alien thinking" does not require a
monetary amount beyond a lower class income, but a desire to have change
as an primary element of what one does. Will does not name the "brutally
imposed confines" in his writings and neither do I. A force to work
against without the naming process supplies the energy without the
denegrative state of reverse labeling. Upon saying who I am, in person,
perhaps these ideologies of opposition become less opaque, but this is
not a requirement to understanding. Desire and priority are the missing
aspects-- as with many I've placed writing first, done a survival called
the necessary, in whatever method has worked-- rather than point to my
class upbringing or ethnicity as a justification.

I find, as someone who has a lower class income, that your assessment is
inaccurate. I felt your mass categorization of the lower classes was not
one fitting to myself or many of the writers in the same situation I
know closely. It is unfortunate that many believe they do not have
access to the things you list below. This unfounded belief perpetuates
itself in not having these opportunities become manifest. That classism
exists, I agree. When it is used as an excuse, whether to defend one's
choices, supposed lack thereof, or to support poorly written work, its
utility is worthless.

PS-- Thanks Robin.

Be well

David Baratier

Again, this response brings with it a massive load of
assumptions about *me* and where I have and haven't been.
And you are simply kidding yourself if you think that
class has nothing to do with access to time to write,
educational opportunities, access to literary communities,
access to the Internet, access to publications and being
published, time to read, money to buy books, money to
publish books, etc.
Hurray for the steelworker who published a book. What does
this prove? Is this the exception to the rule?
And why is it that when folks speak up about class in
poetry communities they are immediately accussed of being
"victims" "whiners" etc.? Is this how you respond to
racism? Or does racism exist, and classism doesn't? Get
real.

yes Mike: before the English got English. Something truly here of this
awkward place. One response I got was the tree at Roanoke. That was a
truly poetic gesture. I think Bradstreet true--but around the 1600s?

The first canned version of the live Defib Web artist interview show is
up at http://webartery.com/defib/canned/1talan/index.html. This is a
hypertranscript version of the IRC chat session that Defib hosted
concerning Talan Memmott's work.

Defib's interview/conversation with Talan Memmott revolves around
discussion of approaches to new media and also to narrative within new
media. Talan's diverse foci synthesize notions of narrative within text
and visual art toward a new type of narrative "the way painting offers
narration as something that must be discovered and unfolded" but also as
"theory/fiction".

The hypertranscript, a fully produced hypertext, serves as an
interesting introduction to Memmott's work.

Producing the hypertranscript of the .txt transcript with Talan was
itself an interesting collaboration. Live chat sessions result in non
linear texts involving several speakers and the transcipt leaps about
quite naturally.

Many thanks to those who participated in this IRC
conversation/interview.

Morphology of Change

A new installation

11 Nov - 18 Dec at Lance Fung Gallery, 537 Broadway NYC

Reception for the artist: Thursday, 11 November, 6 - 8 PM

Morphology of Change, an exhibition of a new installation by the American
artist John Roloff, opens Thursday, November 11th at Lance Fung Gallery. In
Morphology Of Change Roloff once again achieves an experimentation and
provocation on level with his past landscape projects, installations,
sculptures and environmental art.  His geology inspired furnace projects in
the landscape of the late 70's through the early 90's (Saskatchewan,
Canada, Hartford, CT, Arvada, CO...), experimental works with greenhouses
and plant materials of the 80's and 90's (Smithsonian Institution, San
Francisco, CA,
Santa Barbara, CA...) and the large-scale photographic works shown in
Dialogues with Nature at Lance Fung Gallery in 1998 form the background for
this new work.

As a conceptual extension of this earlier work, the installation done
for Morphology of Change incorporates architecture, natural systems and
formal considerations in an interior/exterior setting referring to such
diverse attitudes as the 19th century sublime, process art, earth works,
and baroque philosophy.

In the essay, John Roloff's The Rising Sea, Robert C. Morgan wrote,
"Like many artists of his generation, Roloff is not east to identify in
terms of a particular medium. He has been called a sculptor and
environmental artist, but he is much more than that. He functions on a
conceptual level, meaning that he foregrounds the ideas he is seeking to
clarify through his art. By foregrounding the ideas, the medium or media
becomes secondary to the extent that he uses what is necessary in order to
express the ideas." Further in the same essay Morgan states, "The larger
point for John Roloff in these  site-specific installations is that nature
is bigger than our understanding of it. The order of nature is bigger than
any order we can impose upon it, and that it is a resilient force."

The focus of the exhibition will be a large singular work, Holocene,
referring to the Holocene Era, the geologic period of our contemporary
time. Holocene is a primarily transparent, wood-framed structure that
extends the open portion of one of the gallery's street-facing windows into
the center the exhibition space. Within the constructed chamber and
connected only to the outside world is a field of living moss subjected to
the environmental conditions present during the run of the exhibition; on
dry days the moss
will be a dormant grey color, on rainy days--to the extent that weather can
reach within the structure--a vibrant green.

As an extension of the physicality and process aspects of his earlier work,
gallery viewers will be able to observe a section of the exterior
environment penetrating deep into the gallery space and its effect on the
moss's condition. Holocene investigates two resonate themes of Roloff's
work, one that relates architecture and human activity in general to larger
natural and geologic systems, the second, in a similar way to the earlier
landscape furnaces and other environmental works, where a force (in this
case organic vitality as condition of contemporary climate) is made visible
in a confined environment and a dialog ensues between nature, the structure
and its contents.

Lance Fung Gallery is the New York dealer for John Roloff. He has work in
such important art collections as: The National Museum of American Art,
Washington, DC, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA, De
Young Memorial Museum, San Francisco, CA, Achenbach Foundation, San

#  So, the arguments are not melting before my eyes.
#
#  I did not say that poets should not use PCs: the fact that I am e-mailing
#
#  these messages would contradict such a proposition.
#
#  I am saying that we should not lie to ourselves that the Web is more open
#
#  than books are.
#
#  Yes, access is easier: if you are a citizen of the 'developed' 'world'.
#
#  Yes, books were exclusionist in their day, so that makes it OK to reproduce
#
#  this in Webworld? While we're at it, we could reinstitute serfdom, witch
#
#  hunts and child labour.

How long has it taken books to get to this "non-exclusionary" position? How many
centuries? For a young technology, the Web isn't doing half-bad. Yes, of course
it's lower-thresholds maybe higher -currently- but the night is young...I may be
the optimist here but, given the current -rate- of expansion, near world
saturation might be acheived within 20 years. From zero to ubiquity within the
space of a 100 years -if- it comes about will be no mean feat. You might not
like it, but there you go.


#  I know a lot of poets find new and exciting potential in virtual creation,
#
#  and that the Internet gives users access to a huge range of material. But
#
#  look again at the figures posted by kathylou, and then let's be honest about
#
#  the _social_ limitations of the medium. It is, in many ways, another way of
#
#  enforcing centre/margin relationships, another hot topic on this list.

Indeed. Most things usually end up in a conspiracy and/or a binary theory :-)

        { p o e t i x }

i made it to the reading and symposium sponsored by the new orleans review
this weekend and it was a blast

i hope to get a significant amount down in a post or two but am not trying
for anything comprehensive or even focused on the 'event' so much as just a
recounting as things strike my memory.... maybe i'll use headers like...


  MEETING POETS

Bernadette Mayer was at the dinner friday the 5th at Camille Martin's house
and the crowd included Bill Lavender, (the irrepressible) Nancy Dixon, Hank
Lazer, Skip Fox, Randy Prunty, Andy di Michele, Myself, and folks whose last
names i missed Phillip (travelling with Bernadette) John (lives there with
Camille) ... there were more
        but
Bernadette is way cool and i loved the last hour and half or perhaps two
hours sitting and standing around in the dining room and listening as she'd
make us all laugh then listen as some one of the crowd began to talk for
awhile then she'd catch the edge of something in their talk and mention it
as joke or paradox or observation and have us all laughing again
        and
she told us a story that really hit me about someone who'd been Cage's nurse
at the time of his death and who kept the EKG which showed the final beats
of his heart, that this person had made something from it, a piece of art
---- Bernadette said she thought it was scary and i understood but i
wondered if there wasn't a Cagean reading of it that wd make it something
more interesting
        such that
just as 4'33" illustrates for us that there is no silence, becoming a score
for the unintended whatever that occurs... might his EKG also be a score
(was it Joan Retallack who said that what Cage had left us primarily were
scores ?) one that we don't intend but which we'll end up playing anyway...?
(just a thought)
        but back to
Bernadette, i'm left thinking of her the genius of good humor ---- tho i
know that she explores all manner of moods in her work, my experience of
talking to her was primarily of good humor ---- an example that springs to
mind is when the Yasusada book _doubled flowering_ was mentioned --- she
wasnt familiar with it and i gave her a quick run-down of the "bio" of AY
and after the brief cataloging she said "seems like it cd've been a little
more cheerful, doesnt it?" ---- another exempla wd be at the symposium where
some of us talked blathered (that was me) and soliloquized and Bernadette
spoke only once as i recall saying something like "my response is to laugh
when things are funny"

[AUDIO POESIS ADDENDUM TO BERNADETTE] ---- she had CDs for sale "Epigrams,
Imitations and Translations" the price was $10, i dunno if that's all the
time or conference price or what --- but you cd probably score one by
writing to Utopia Productions at 206 Macedonia Road, Chatham NY 12037


  SYMPOSIUM

i tried to give a talk called "experimentalism, formalism and improvisation"
that wasnt very successful ---- partially perhaps b/c i voided much of the
bulk in order to get it within the time allotted (and still failed), tho
ultimately the piece didnt work b/c these things i was trying to define or
redefine, while important to me daily in my work as poet, arent perhaps
things that anyone else was particularly engaged with and as a measure of
how little the redefined "experimentalism" took with the crowd it went on
being used in all the absurd ways that i was hoping to sheer off it for the
rest of the symposium

Randy Prunty gave a talk about his othersense poetry and then read an
othersense piece with participation from several audience members (Bill,
Hank, Skip, Andy, Camille) --- his was i think the most interesting of the
talks as almost alone among them it presented a context of ideas about
actual poetic work and then gave an example of this work ---- the
participants also had a number of interesting responses to the effect that
theyre participation had on them and their reception of the poem

A. di Michele's talk was also pretty interesting and he came the closest to
blurring one's ability to say this is poetry and this is talk about poetry
---- i've known Andy via the post for a long time and met him for the 1st
time the night prior to this and i was really pretty blown away by the
readings he gave during this talk at the reading that night and especially
the next day at the maple leaf bar ---- in the symposium he said something
about the state where one creates write poetry and about not about how to
get there or ways to get there but about "waking up in it" --- i wish i cd
recall exactly how he said this...

there were more symposium talks that i should try to recount but now i gotta
do WORK (jeez)

List,

Can somebody please explain to me what the political candidates in SF have
to do with poetics in Boston, or anywhere for that matter?  If I want to
hear candidates be plugged by those who support them, I'll just shoot on up
to New Hampshire for the primary.

I've been quietly watching some of the threads coming through here regarding
the advertising, political debate, and general mental masturbation that the
list seems bogged down with lately, but this one really irked me.

Where are the poetics in threads devoted to insult, ego-battles, and mayoral
debates?  Perhaps I'm missing something...

Ron,

Thanks for sending this -- voting for Ammiano is the first time I've
participated in electoral politics (outside of union elections) and felt
good about it the day after. Being a recent arrival, and living in one of
the city's more left-leaning neighborhoods, I don't have any very accurate
way to judge how the runoff might go -- but based on bus-stop talks, running
into people at tenants' meetings, pizza joints, et al, the support for Tom
seems to be far deeper than the Chron/Ex "don't worry, Mr. Fisher, it's just
a protest vote" line would seem to indicate. Of course, my live-in
landlord -- who rakes in $1250 a month for the single room my wife and I
share -- walked in on a conversation I was having with a friend touching on
Ammiano's campaign, and delivered himself of a fairly histrionic litany of
reasons not to vote for the "gay Mao." I wish I were exaggerating here, but
to see how apparently acceptable as public discourse this sort of homophobic
red-baiting has become (once again) since Ammiano's showing on election day,
take a look at today's Chron editorial cartoon, which depicts a man and
woman, presumably a hetero couple, looking at an Ammiano campaign poster:
MAN: "How can I vote for him? He's a...you know..." WOMAN: "Yeah. Marxist."

So we have something of a struggle on our hands, and the call for
contributions is certainly apropos. As would be, perhaps, more letters to
the editor like today's, which asks the pertinent question why Willie
Brown's sexual profile hasn't been attached to his name as a de facto part
of his job description.

Some retro carpet-bagging on my part here. Tom Ammiano has made the mayoral
runoff in San Francisco against Willie Brown. Brown has long been a social
liberal who has used that stance to front for the most rapacious developers
who've driven SF into a place where rental units now run $1,000 per month
per bedroom (a far cry from the $350 I and my roommates paid in total for
our 7-bedroom house in "Baja Pacific Heights" in the 1976-78 period).

Ammiano is a stand-up comic who first got active in politics by pushing to
protect the rights of gay teachers in the mid-1970s. He's currently the
president of the county board of supervisors and ran a write-in campaign
that garnered 25 percent of all votes with just $20,000 (compared to Brown's
39 percent thanks to a budget of $2.3 million). Voters ejected
ex-mayor/ex-police chief Frank Jordan and political consultant Clint Reilly
from the run-offs, two relatively conservative politicians who got 29
percent of the vote.

Those of us who remember the late Harvey Milk are enheartened by a
demonstration that populist politics need not be the know-nothing
libertarianism of, say, a Jesse Ventura.

You don't need to live in San Francisco to benefit from Ammiano's election
in the December election.

And you can help!

Subject:      Re: Business, class, access

During this recent discussion on class I have been accused
of being a "victim" of "making excuses" and of being "a
spokesperson for persons who sort lettuce." That these are
all personal attacks is significant, as well as tiresome.

I teach about, write about, speak about, and research
working class writing. In none of these instances have I
made excuses, been a victim, or acted as a spokesperon for
lettuce sorters.

I'm sick of unfounded personal attacks that deflect from
any actual arguments being presented. Many of these
attacks are thinly-disguised veils for a dangerous
political conservativism which blames people for their own
struggles within the class system.

If anyone cares to know what I have to say about class and
what I have written about it, please feel free to read my
essay on working class poetics from tripwire that is now
online at HOW2, or read recent poetry in "Genealogy" from
a+bend press. I have also contributed to publishing
working-class writing in the journal I co-edit, Lipstick
Eleven, as well as in the HOW2 Forum. I am posting these
URLs for easy access to Listees as it is evident that
futher postings to the list on this subject are useless
and I've had enough.

  CAGEAN MOMENT

night of the 6th, Bill Lavender had invited all the crowd at the readings to
descend on his house for a party and many did come but Bill's partner Nancy
had been at some kind of stuffy-semi-formal thing and she'd invited all
these folks to blow off steam by coming to back home too so the crowd was
curiously mixed ---- and the place was slammin' --- wall to wall everywhere
and a bit much for me afer a time and so i ducked into the back beg room
where Skip Fox was also hiding out and we sat there and listened to the
gabble of voices raised in rooms on every side of us and out on the back
porch too ---- it was an amazing sound ---- there was no music playing just
lots of people talking and laughing and holding forth and while i've heard
that sort of sound before this time it was somehow unique, perhaps the fact
that i sat in a room shut off from that making it easier to resolve into a
thing of occassional waves but mostly bursts and clashes ---- i ran out of
the room to get randy after awhile but the initial push and volume was
lessened by then as the party had thinned a bit or dispersed some and i also
asked bill if he had a tape recorder but alas


  MEETING POETS

and this darkened room where the voices gabbled then did turn towards
discussion as Skip Fox and i started talking about this and that and one of
the things that came up most clearly, i think, to both of us, is that having
poetry is a great start on having common ground --- Skip and i are separated
by some 20 years difference in age, very different taste in metaphors (when
speaking of our work etc) and very different lives but were able in very
little time to get to know each other and to get to serious talk about what
it is we both care about ---- something i can only attribute to poetry as
i've run into devotees of klezmer music previously and not had this happen,
encountered others in bands when i was a band guy, run into lots of people
with similar interests and fascinations etc etc and while i've often had a
good time finding these things out and meeting these people it seems that in
the poetry world i've found this much more to be the case


  THE READING

Joel Dailey was pretty great at this event --- he had a way of weaving talk
in between the poems such that both were elevated by the process, his
reading style or skills or whatever were top notch as well

Mike Sarki's reading was curious, he started by reading the foreward to his
book (written by gordon lish, his teacher) wherein tis written "there are
only two poets for me, Stevens and Sarki" ---- this line crops up in
something of a tough-guy appreciation and struck me as really fucking
strange ---- i mean, it's nice to have someone say nice things about you
---- that'swaht blurbs are for ---- but to then preface yr reading with them
?  that's a bit wierd and Sarki seemed to have a firm feeling that he was a
an outsider and didnt belong amongst all us academics (like me ? not.) ----
but when he actually read his poems i thought they were kinda interesting
--- not really sure where all the oppositional chip on shoulder stuff came
from tho

Bernadette's reading was also pretty great and she brought Phillip Good out
of the audience to do a dialogue poem in which Phillip played the part of
"House" and she played herself ---- it was fun and funny and made us all
laugh

Camille Martin read some phonetic (homolinguistic) translations of Oppen and
they had a sly slipperiness about them that i liked, tho, spoiled by our
local practice, i'm always disappointed that i don't have the text in front
of me --- which is something that wd have heightened my appreciation of many
of the readers i'm sure

everyone said i did fine and i guess i believe them but i had this odd
sensation as i read --- 1st that i was off pace somehow 2nd that i might
have been mispronouncing or blowing lines but that i wasnt sure as i was
busy paying attention to the sense of pace --- about half way into my thing
i felt like it started to click tho

Bill Lavender read seemingly as an afterthought and i liked the piece and
his reading, while it was maybe not the show stopper it had been in
Tuscaloosa some months back


   THE STREETS

of new orleans are nuts --- every intersection cracked and humped by the
settling of the land -- the swamp repressed beneath it --- but it's a city
that need no additional speed bumps in residential neighborhoods

after reading david baratier's recent post in response to kathy lou schultz's
response to him (etc),

i am left with this thought that is glaring in my head, hard to shut off,
shove away. so i'll just go ahead and say it. even tho it's obvious...

the experience of class is different for women and men, as women also have to
contend with sexism, men do not.

(and then, of course, there are many other isms that can show up too...)
multiple -isms seem to have a geometric rather than simply additive effect.

there ARE drawbacks, disadvantages, when one is outside of the privileged
classes.
access to many opportunities IS limited--
--and david, it's great for you that you haven't found it to be so, but by
saying it's not true for others, it ignores/erases the efforts people make
every day to "overcome," or simply live with, what they/i/we/you (am)are
faced with.

this doesn't mean that things can't be done, that opportunities don't exist,
it means simply that there are more obstacles, and that desire to overcome or
integrate, live with, these obstacles has to be very strong. (and sometimes
the will is still not enough.)

there are always those people who are able to do what they will anyway,
despite disadvantages
...and those with advantages who fail repeatedly...
--this does not change the facts: that advantages and disadvantages do exist;
and, in our culture, money is usually the force that tips the scales.

btw, i didn't see kathy lou using class as an excuse for anything...rather,
as a framework for understanding.

further btw, i don't think i agree with the idea of "A force to work against
without the naming process supplies the energy without the denegrative state
of reverse labeling."
i like to know what i'm dealing with.
naming helps to define, clarify.

thinking about this more...

i remembwer well i was doing a 12 hour nite shift driving a forklift in the
80's , and while i was at it wrote this little ditty:

TOUR

abroad on the paddle
splashes into harbour
tries luck and gains six overcoats
with sunshine between the stars

a parenthesis ladles the tune
relaxing on a Li-Lo reading Li Po
under some amended weather
tumbling sunshine

breathes a moment
makes an X on a relief map of a cloud
with wax in his ears
his thought keeps

always thought Penumbra was a month
in a template climate
zoned temporate
where the toucan can rest his jaw

postcard wednesday: toured a tourist bus
found where callouses come from
added a hurricane to tour (not in brochure)
mended paddle

if you can't have a tweak of fun while you are working then you might as
well sleepwalk!!!!

david b, i think i find mself on the opposite side of the table from you,
and sitting next to kathy lou, when it comes to this issue of class... and
i think you know this (based on SO many of my posts to this list in the
past, dealing specifically with this issue)... so i hesitate to try to
persuade you of my way of looking at things, esp. b/c i regard my way of
looking at things as opening to some relatively elemental and utterly
urgent realities... but what the hell, it's twixt friends, or virtual
friends, or acquaintances, or whatever... so i'll give it a whack, and i'll
be deliberate...

you speak of "classism" as something that "exists"... not an esp. strong
claim, from where i sit... but my question would be, how does it exist? and
why does it exist? and esp., in the context of what i would loosely call, a
tad archaically, *the writing life*...

of course there's all sortsa room here for idiosyncracies, but---

and of course i believe that most writers will ultimately, *should*
ultimately find a way to write, but---

these allowances don't in themselves obviate a discussion of (e.g.)
class-based struggle... say, as it relates to writing process and product,
but also as it relates to our perceptions of what we are about as writers...

if classism exists, then i take it class too exists, right?... i mean,
there *are* economic classes, right?... and one's entrance into---or
exclusion from---such classes is not entirely within one's (individual)
control, yearn or aspire or endeavor or resist as one may-----right?... (i
won't go into that class item most frequently discussed hereabouts---that
of the shifty-ness of class markers)...

ok:  if i aspire, say, to $60K per annum (among other aspirations) i
probably better figure on doing something besides just writing poetry,
right?...

(oh hey---i'm not ashamed to say i aspire to $60K/yr either, anymore than i
am of aspiring to write poetry)...

further, if i decide to write poetry, whatever my economic aspirations,
this latter decision will impinge upon my life *somehow*, right?... given
that money doesn't grow on trees, i might find---in all likelihood, i
probably will find---that the demands relating to making ends meet do not
coincide, neatly or productively (at least, not all of the time, perhaps
not most of the time), with the demands of writing... right?...

or to borrow from williams (_paterson_ book iii, part ii), albeit to my own
class-specific ends:

        The writing is nothing, the being
        in a position to write (that's

        where they get you) is nine tenths
        of the difficulty; seduction

        or strong arm stuff.  The writing
        should be a relief,

        relief from the conditions
        which as we advance become -- a fire,

        a destroying fire.  For the writing
        is also an attack and means must be

        found to scotch it -- at the root
        if possible.  So that

        to write, nine-tenths of the problem
        is to live.

spoken by an m.d., yep... so, everything in my life (in *my* life, mind you
david) tells me that "to live" is, in an important and (again) utterly
urgent sense [the one having to do with earning a living such that doing
same supports my writing---which in my view i deal with on a daily basis],
an economic issue... hence (if i may) a class issue...

none of this is absolute or inevitable, no, and surely some of this is a
matter of emphasis (among other things)... but in some sense one might
observe that *it may as well be* absolute and inevitable, david... b/c
that's how the world is constructed, no?---or so it seems to yours truly...
and if it seems so---to me, e.g.---sometimes and in some ways (at least) it
probably *is* so, ain't it?... and that it seems so is, at least, itself a
mark of the classism to which you refer, yes?...

unless i'm hallucinating, i mean, and unless i've been hallucinating for lo
these many years... always a possibility, sure...

BUT i'm not sure, in all, why you would resist the class issue as a
writing/publishing issue, in the very terms kathy lou has introduced... i
don't think the "urgency" i point to suggests evangelical fervor, either,
and for that matter, i didn't 'hear' same in kathy lou's posts... in all,
the effect of yours and others' resistance on this count, it seems to me,
is to move "us" away from a willingness to deal with class specifics (and
associated complexities, incl. btw intimacies of various sorts, as well as
this question of how the biz of poetry relates to the practice of same)...
that is, resistance here, even outright skepticism, has the effect of
helping to shut down what appears to me to be an entirely reasonable and
entirely necessary exchange (and of course you're not alone in such
resistance either---i mean, if i'm picking on you a bit here, and i am, i
could as well have picked on stephen ellis, pleased to make your
acquaintance stephen)...

:  we can, some few of us, just get on with it without your participation
as such, i know... hence in no sense is your resistance to be understood as
the "final word" or some such (anymore than is *this* post to be taken as a
hostile intervention)... but as class is, like classism, difficult to
discuss for many of us (though perhaps not for you), we're just as likely
to say to ourselves, when greeted by such skepticism, *why bother?*...
again, disagreement is one thing, but some of what passed before my eyes of
late appeared to me either to be dismissive of kathy lou's concerns, or to
be asking of kathy lou that she *defend* her assertions (stephen's opener
"hits a particular nail square on the head, but doesn't drive it anywhere"
a case of the latter, i think, and your "[t]his unfounded belief
perpetuates itself in not having these opportunities become manifest"
heading distinctively toward the former)...

and if this post provokes a "why bother?" reaction in you, david (or
stephen), my apologies---and i mean it... as in so many recent exchanges
"around here," it just seems to me that the conversation has become
unnecessarily contentious precisely when a bit less skepticism and a bit
more goodwill might have produced some insights, and might have drawn (some
of) us a bit closer together in the process, if only for a moment...

i only wish i could have said all this with sense of humor intact...

best,

joe

Dear Kevin Hehir,

Although the two books I am recommending have been mentioned before on this
list, perhaps you missed them. Both may be of interest to you on this topic:

"Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word" edited by Charles
Bernstein (Oxford University Press, 1998), which includes,
"Letter on Sound" by Susan Stewart, my own "Aural Ellipsis and the Nature
of Listening in Contemporary Poetry", "Voice in Extremis" by Steve
McCaffery, "Sound Reading" by Peter Quartermain, among many others.

"Sound States,Innovative Poetics and Acoustical Technologies,"  edited by
Adalaide Morris, (University of North Carolina Press, 1997), which includes
"Voices out of Bodies, Bodies out of Voices:Audiotape and the Production of
Subjectivity" by N. Katherine Hayles, "The Music of Verbal
Space" by Marjorie Perloff, "Poetry's Voice-Over" by Jed Rasula, among others.

Both books contain bibliographies which may be of interest, Sound States
comes with a CD.

Best wishes,
Nick Piombino

While I agree with the thrust of Taylor's point here, I'd also add my hope
that no one will forgo reading Khlebnikov due to his
more-difficult-to-recuperate views of phonemic universalism.  K.'s ideas
about language remain, as I'm sure Taylor will grant, extremely compelling
and suggestive for reasons outside the fact that they proved utter failures
in the linguistic laboratory (more accurately, that they had no hope of
being seriously admitted in the first place).

Like with his visionary & universalized sense of time (derived from his
near-mystic belief in eccentric numerologies), it seems important to place
Khlebnikov's understanding of sound in a historical context, and to
recuperate it in that way--not as a part of a mathematical or linguistic
telos, but by seeing it as a lived artistic engagement.  K.'s belief was
that he had invented or discovered a phonemic universalism in zaum that was
specifically not described by Symbolist theory, nor by literature derived
from Eastern Orthodox religiosity.  In other words, his was a universalism
markedly different from the going artistic universals of 1910-1917 Russia,
and much of its energy derives from K.'s sense that a new worldview was
needed in the face of a multitude of crumbling universals.  No one that I'm
aware of was proposing relativities.

None of this helps with hard research into phonaethetics-as-science since
Khlebnikov was primarily a poet.  Which is really part of my point here.
Although K. did problematize the "poet" category rather diligently and
dramatically, I still think that the metaphorical/metonymic qualities of
his thought really are, and should be, privileged over its
verifiable/predictive qualities.  It's true that Khlebnikov saw
mathematically-describable (hence "universal") patterns everywhere,
including in phonemes, but the stress is always on the idea that "there are
patterns" and not on the specific types of patterns Khlebnikov saw (such as
his belief that there are universal spatial qualities to particular
phonemes).  As in the Paul Schmidt translations, K. saw himself as an
"inventor/explorer" (which he opposes to "investor/exploiter") rather than
someone with the kind of methodological & academic commitment of a
Jakobson--though, again, Khlebnikov makes it difficult to slice the two
worlds into components.

In short, then, my sense is that we might be able to productively
distinguish here between types of universalisms--linguistic, mathematic,
artistic-metaphoric, sociological, biological (all containing their own
subdivisions and their own histories, no doubt).  This might also keep us
from a too-easy conflation of Jakobson's argument in favor of universal
linguistic patterns with, say, the Cartesian transcendent ego, or with
Roussau's understanding of speech . . . (approx. Derrida's position in OF
GRAMMATOLOGY--and here's hoping Derrida isn't on this list since I've now
officially gone beyond my knowledge & abilities).

The great Lester Bowie has died.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Lester Bowie, a jazz trumpeter who was a founding member of
the long-running Art Ensemble of Chicago, died Monday from complications
from liver cancer. He was 58.

The group has played the United States and Europe for 30 years.

Bowie, who also played the fluegelhorn, was known as a flamboyant performer
with a sense of humor and an appreciation for the theatrical side of
performing.

Sorry to pass along such sad news -- Bowie was, most famously, trumpeter for
the Art Ensemble of Chicago, as well as many fine bands of his own,
including the Brass Fantasy. Along with fellow Chicagoans Sun Ra and Anthony
Braxton (and of course the rest of the Art Ensemble), and in a very
different way perhaps Cecil Taylor, he was for me a primary energy source
for bringing into being a deep and broad way of thinking, hearing and seeing
the African-American creative music tradition as a model poetics for
performance of all kinds: beginning in sound, outward through theater, into
modes of social action, often as far as planetary history and cosmology.

Check out live recordings of the Art Ensemble like _Bap-Tizum_, or the more
recent studio collaboration with Cecil Taylor , _Dreaming of the Masters_,
on and around Monk compositions, for a sense of how simultaneously various
and focused, how both "out on the edge" and thoroughly humane his music
could be. I never met him except to shake his hand after a concert, but I'll
miss him nonetheless.

Taylor

Unfortunately, it is still not possible to access the server to update the

3 - FOURTH SUB VOICIVE COLLOQUIUM

The Fourth Sub Voicive Colloquium will be held in London on 20th May 2000
between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Please make a note in your diaries: I hope that
many of you will attend.

It is more than likely that there will be related readings just before or
after the colloquium, especially to take advantage of the presence in London
of poets from some distance away

Further announcements will be made when the colloquium committee has
discussed the proposals received so far.

An updated webpage will be prepared and, hopefully, will be publishable at
the EPC conference page at least, if not at the SVP website

But David, I'm also 100% in agreement with Bob Gluck's "Every poetics is
a poetics of class." What we're trying to do here is bring some
awareness to the issue, "in thinking about a poetics of class that knows
itself" (Bob Gluck again).  I'm also 100% in agreement with what Kathy
Lou has said about the multiple ways in which class influences
everything about writing and its availability in the public sphere.

I'm very sorry to have posted from the perspective of a writer whose poetry
and thinking about poetics are rooted in a world, many of the events of
which are not primarily -- or not at all -- concerned with "providing
metaphors for your poetry," like so many insubstantial spirits swirling
obediently round the Yeatses. I promise henceforth to keep that thought and
those roots in the world, and only make note of them in this space when it's
a matter of their scansion.

Onanistically yours,

I've been quietly watching some of the threads coming through here regarding

... lets take a constructivist approach to the matter of class for a
minute; call class a system of economic representations, and consider
jeans as a a representation of some sort of relation to the working
class. often i have read my poems in public in jeans instead of wool or
tweed. most males on the list have probably done that. The point is that
wearing jeans represents some sort of desire to cross or erase class
lines unless your background is lower class; in which case you might
choose finer threads and cross the line the other way, overcompensate.
That is something poor people might do who want to make a good showing.
Understate that is something that not so poor people might do.
Understatement is decidely cool and modern; overcompensating is naive. I
find it peronally intolerable that some people wish to rub my naivity in
my face. I learned that lesson often growing up. I felt condemned
because I could not transcend who I am ((forgive the lurch into
auto-ethnography ("auto-ethnography" is an over compensation for "life
story"). On the plus-side I learned about resentment and really got into
Nietzche. I am not sure that jeans wearing poets of upper-middle class
background have a feel for what I mean what I speak of "resentment" in
its class-based form as opposed to Derridean 'resentement.'  --- so we
could argue that posing, by whatever means for whatever reason is part
of the human condition. I would think poetry or poetics could
acknowledge that somehow ...

>The great Lester Bowie has died.

I hated it when I saw that name in the title. I knew what it wd mean.
Lester Bowie one of my great heroes of the sixties when a lot of the people
I knew were listening to Jimi Hendrix. I only got to hear him live twice,
once in Montreal and Once in Vancouver. But I used to use his records to
scare the neighbours. He was a sign to me back then, that you can have fun
and the avant garde at the same time, in great doses. We should all be
playing our AEC records at 9.5 this week.

Subject: Exhibition: Threads of Humanity


I am writing to invite you to contribute a work to the exhibition
“Threads of Humanity” that is being organised in collaboration with Amnesty
International and the University of Wollongong. The exhibition will focus on
the concept of human rights and will be run for the purpose of promoting the
inherent dignity of the person, which is embodied in the recognition of the
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human society. The
exhibition will be displayed at the Wollongong City Gallery from March to
April 2000 and close with an auction dinner.

It seems pertinent that human rights issues remain at the forefront of
discussion and social consciousness. The exhibition has been contemplated
for some time however spurred into action in response to the atrocities that
have occurred and continue to occur in East Timor and not long before in
Kosovo that outraged the Australian community and communities further
afield. It is then hoped that the exhibition will not only emphasise the
common thread of our human existence but also illuminate the importance and
relevance of human rights to our every day situation, which we will carry
with us into the new millennium.

The closing date for applications is the 10th of January 2000. Application
forms and information about the specific theme of the exhibition are
available from the web page listed below:

http://www.uow.edu.au/crearts/events/amnesty.html

I would also like to ask that you forward this information onto other
artists that you think may be interested in contribute a work. Your support
and assistance will be greatly appreciated. I look forward to your
application.

I've been keeping out of this class discussion, but I think saying
that implying that women have it worse than men on the
class-prejudice scale is an unnecessary essentialism--and it is
contrary to my experience.  As much as I bitch and moan about class
prejudice, I've always felt that working class guys had a harder time
assimilating into the middle class poetry world I've known.  I've
seen a couple nearly destroyed by it.  Find it interesting, for
instance, when Michael Amnasan talks of his lack of social power as a
construction worker in a middle class writing world as a feminization.

Class has come up repeatedly in one of my undergraduate classes since
one woman has been writing about "whiteness."  And, of course, I
suggested that she needed to refine what is whiteness and what is
upper-middleclassness (the world she was raised in which she is
writing about).  As a child she had a hispanic housekeeper/nanny who
fed her tacos--but beyond that, I asked what would be different about
that power dynamic if the housekeeper was white (my mother worked as
a janitor, so a white housekeeper wasn't a big leap of imagination
for me), what specifically did the racial variable contribute.

The one chicana in the (all female) class wrote a piece which touched
on being a minority student in a predominately white school.  She
only once mentioned being chicana and others' reactions to that.  The
rest of the piece was humorous stuff about studying and being tired
all the time and boys and bad dorm food, etc.--and many references to
not having enough money to do things, not having various forms of
access.  I complimented her on the political subtext of the piece.
And the girl who is writing about whiteness said, "What political
stuff is in here, except this one reference (directly about being
chicana)."  Race could be seen, but class issues were invisible.
This resonates for me with a lot of what goes on on this list and
elsewhere.

Having no ambition myself to rise so high into ">>>the upper eschelons" of
anything as to be unable to resist crapping on people a la Mr. Baratier, I,
David Larsen, volunteer myself to serve as this list's spokesperson for
lettuce-sorters --and, if need be, to pass your *civil* responses back to
them. Believe me, though, they do not take kindly to being used as tropes.
Thank you for your attention LRSN

he thinks we have a stake in politics.

Thank you Murat.  I agree that this debate is ridiculous and, basically,
meaningless.  I can't remember when I first subscribed, but, I still remain
the only subscriber in Thailand. In fact, I have passed the list
information to several Thai poets who are connected and litterate in
English, but, the list doesn't appeal to them.

I do, sometimes, wonder why it appeals to me.  I cannot attend the poetry
events announced here.  My participation is currently limited to reading
the list; I haven't posted to the list for a long time.  Experience has
made me reticent.  I have not read and will not read many of the works
under discussion here. I do not know even one member of the list.  I am
unknown; I do not publish. I am not affiliated with an educational
institution or any group known to any member of this list.  So, why do I
subscribe?

Because of this: I struggle in order to retain my right to write.  I hoard
my physical and psychic resources so that I may have a room in which to
write and  words to put on the paper in front of me in that room.  My
income is $800 per month.  With that amount of money I raise my three
children, tend my garden, enjoy my friends and maintain an internet
account.  I am not poor.  I am rich because I make my circumstances work
for me, because, despite everything, I keep my mind alive and am able to
write.

I like being in the company of other writers.  I like the depth of
observation, the petty squabbles, the vanity, the beauty and the basic
truth of what we are.  That, for me, is poetry.  And that is why I am here
at Poetics.

Brent Long asks a good question:
Can somebody please explain to me what the political candidates in SF have
to do with poetics in Boston, or anywhere for that matter?

The answer Brent is, first, that the politics of SF has a direct bearing on
the ability of poets, especially younger ones with fewer economic resources,
to live and work there. The cost of renting a room in SF today is 20X what
it was when I moved there in 1972 and the quality of housing you get for
that is much much worse. In order to stay there, one has to work a serious
gig -- none of this "take a year" and hang out sort of stuff that enabled me
to write Tjanting or to edit In the American Tree. The economics of the Bay
Area have had a lot to do with the diaspora of poets from that community
over the past two decades. A lot of people on this list can attest to that.

The health of the Bay Area poetry scene matters to us all. The Bay Area has
long had a direct poetic connection to Boston. Weiners' Hotel Wentley Poems
were written at what are now the Polk/Sutter Apartments in SF. 707 Scott
Street is another SF address. SF poets have been going to, and gaining from,
the Boston scene since at least the 1950s.

The final answer is that when a good progressive gets into office, it offers
hope and possibility for us all. Tom Ammiano will be the most progressive
mayor in the nation if he gets elected. That doesn't mean that I will agree
with everything he does, but like Paul Wellstone's senatorship in Minnesota,
I will benefit directly here in Paoli, PA. And I wish that Harvey Gantt had
beaten Jesse Helms as well.

Yesterday's SF Chronicle noted that Ammiano will benefit from the fact that
in California the homeless can vote.

Discussing class it's good to remember WHERE this discussion is taking
place. Place, I mean a geographic spot or location,  is
another aspect (like gender) that should be introduced into the discussion.
I mean location in terms of its economic situation. Thus the inhabitants of
the US can all be said to belong to the upper class if viewed from a poor
Asian country. One should try hard to stay hungry in the US, isn't one? The
same goes for different locations within one and the same country. Like in
Russia a native of Moscow coming to St. Petersburg is automatically moving
one step up on the social ladder. And when he comes to a small
provincial town he is already two steps up. And in a village... oh, in a
village he (yes, he) is a guru.

"ok:  if i aspire, say, to $60K per annum (among other aspirations) i

***********

Indeed, Joe, i think it does a nice job of locating us poet types in the
overall culture, that 60,000 does as an abreviated expressions for, "a lot
of money."  Dip into the NY Times, say, any publication whose viewpoint is
essentially that of the business class, and one soon finds that they

reading the Times such a peculiar, disorienting experience...

                and i like that someone
leapt in with further reasonableness

 But i'm nowhere myself, thinking about
class... always getting bogged down in
 some fog where when i start reaching out
trying to get a grip on class as it relates
 to me i end-up w/ many particulars that
seem less part of any demarcated unit
 and more points some almost arbitrary
and others determined on an unfixed number
 of continua

someone told me something and i heard it
 as follows "definitions are like machetes
theyre useful when you have to hack thru
 a tangled space" but like jill i think that it's
better to know what i'm dealing with (to try to
 obviously) and "naming helps to define, clarify."

and maybe that's why class gives me trouble

 but joe amato is eloquent on the subject
and reasonable as well "a bit less skepticism
 and a bit more goodwill might have produced
some insights, and might have drawn (some
 of) us a bit closer together in the process, if
only for a moment..."

which leads back to What is This List For
 and i can hear my boss talking in the hall
time to nip this...

dear brent, dear list,
as the list discusses political issues, and as politics certainly involves us
all (think NEA, for example) a write-in candidate's stunning achievement
certainly is a "poetic" topic. this write-in candidacy, done with little
money and in a short amount of time, has shown that it doesn't take millions
of dollars to garner popular public opinion, that it doesn't take major-party
affiliation to have public support, and that change CAN exist, even in the
pretty stale political system we have in the u.s.
from here, at the end of the 20th century, it appears to many that nothing
ever changes in the world of politics. well, here is something unusual,
someone who truly beat the odds and shook things up.
even if ammiano doesn't win the mayoral run-off election on dec 14, he has
stirred up politics in a most amazing way.
if you are still wondering what this means to poetics, think civil liberties.
think power of an individual to make change. think momentum. think.
american politics just got a kick in the ass--
how can it not be relevant to all?

  READING

joy lahey read and i was struck by the careful way she spoke and the craft
of her work ---- this impression now overlaying my brief looks at the
chapbook of hers that randy brought back ---- and i saw her at the maple
leaf bar for the sunday martin/di michele event and reached into my pocket
to snag one of the cards i printed up to take along (the vast majority of
which i ended up hiding in bill lavender's house to amuse myself sunday
slight hungover morning) and ..nothing.. all my careful planning, a card
with my name and mag info and email and all that (the perfect networking
tool) and i'd packed them the one time when i finally wanted one for
something --- in her chapbook she uses a spelling "misisipi"

skip fox read and it was good and had a sinuous punch to it ---- then he got
caught on "permeability" i think it was and tried it 3 or so times and said
"well i just won't say that one" and went on and it never even felt like an
interruption really and i reading his chapbook _wallet_ i like the way that
the pieces unwind, primarily in sentences within a prose block frame ---- i
have questions about the locus of it all but that was the fun of talking to
skip in the noisy dark room during the party (see previous)

randy prunty read
        but when bill announced him he chose that moment to respond to
randy's othersense experiment in the symposium that afternoon, his
assignment was to monitor his pulse and watch for interaction between it and
the poem - i forget what he said
but randy read great --- once i thought he was thirsty ---- three poems and
the middle one quite the tongue twister too but he was cool calm etc during

alex rawls read long curly hair deep voice man read something called "1969
OK" and i got it but i don't know how many others did and he read from his
desk calendar (blotter style) where he's working out a poem a day using
horoscope books and other materials ---- if i remember correctly he read us
some selections from november ---- i liked him talking later on the back
porch at bill's must keep an eye out for his work tho as i don't think i've
seen any on paper


  LOCAL COLOR

lunch at liuzza's (lee ooz za's, if i remember correctly) and the wait staff
(seemingly mostly relatives) had what we were told is a very new orleans
accent which sounded kinda brooklyn but with an occasional lilt to curl at
the end of words that distinguished it ----- beer in frosted fishbowl type
mugs oozing beer ice all over the table ---- great onion rings and randy
ordered (i thought about it) the fried pickles which were pickle chips
battered and deep fried which we then devoured in ketchup mixed with pepper
sauce ---- my eggplant poboy left something to be desired but vegetarians
learn to survive on fries while travelling and onions rings are a vegetable
same as ketchup

i saw a surprising number of young children dancing on sidewalks etc

i'm told that there are wild parrots well settled in new orleans and looked
for them but never saw any


  BERNADETTE

had been riding around with camille i think it was and they were going
someplace in new orleans and the address struck bernadette as ideal "where
the elysian fields meet the mississippi river"

What happened to the Littoral info on the LA Books site?  Todd, do you know?

Also, I was reminded -- by the forklift poem -- to ask the list:  anyone know of
note-type poems, poem notes, etc. that someone's made ("taken"?) on the job and
published?

I'm curious, and take notes, usually transcribing them eventually, tried the
dictaphone, which is really an odd 1) name for something, 2) led me to have tiny
little tapes everywhere that I won't transcribe since it reminds me too much of
that period I digested dispositions & did medical transcription.

These notes -- it can be interesting -- of course they are naturally
fragmentary, but also on transcribing, I tend to glom initially unrelated notes
together into a poem, with larger "leaps" than usual.  Also, I am constantly
paying attention to whether something that "occurs to me" belongs to a "poem" or
something else.  I write down essay ideas, business ideas, to do's, etc., as
many have done work on including in poems.  I don't put these in the poems but
they do "occur" to me in the same way.

Catherine Daly

i fubbed a couple of names earlier, bernadette's traveling companion is
phillip good --- somebody punned him with "feel good" said he should have
been a doctor ---- and camille's partner is john clark(e) who is a
philosopher (environmental ethics etc) who also wrote the surregionalist
manifesto (i may be blowing the title he handed a copy to di michele and i
didnt look at it) which is something of a platform for the magazine
mesechabe ---- and i'd like a look at the manifesto as i don't really have
much sense of what this surregionalism stuff is about save the hints
registered in the poets (say andy di michele) of.. well.. you know...
surrealism and regionalism

i came away from there thinking that the locals seem much more conscious of
the distinctions of local accents and idioms --- several times i heard of
how some who live near the street Clio cal it "C.L. 10" presumably from the
streetsign --- and this is a series of streets named for the muses ---- and
i noted that bill would say a name one way and then a minute or two later
say it differently (this was especially striking when he introduced
bernadette as 1st he said what i was say as "mayor" then when he exited the
stage for her he said it as i wd say "mire" (but with a dipthonginess in the
middle)

dennis formento's reading and several others made use of local accents
whether by intent or as "carrier waves" and i noted that for a number of
folks there in n.o. that the reading of poem was accentuated by a more
enegetic verbal preformance as opposed to say... i dunno, something specific
to the poem on the page, sound qualities of the words chosen perhaps

i caught a number of religious notes in the course of the readings as well
which surprised me initially --- a poem titled "prayer" i believe and ref to
"god" in several poems read

i'm trying to imagine a continuum of connectedness to disjunctiveness ---
trying to plot out a few folks on that and see what it suggests... but it's
rather difficult, idiosyncratic and based here on guesses in memories of a
busy day, nonetheless, it felt to me that the new orleans local crowd tended
more toward connectedness which is not to say that if you scratch at one of
bill's or camille's poem you won't find it splicy but at the least that
theyre respective reading styles don't foreground that aspect and instead
seem to pull thing forward in a flow ---- joel dailey's stuff was
disjunctive between sentance units (at least i think that's what i was
hearing) but the sentences themselves seems pretty well connnecte, explicit
etc ---- there were other locals who's readings struck me as remarkably
connected (joy lahey perhaps)...
  REMEMBER PLEASE there is no value assignment here, just an observation
...on the more disjunctive end there were more out-of-towners andy di
michele, randy prunty and myself i think ---- this undoubtedly due in large
part to what we chose to read

there's a lot of stuff i've only skimmed in these reports buti thnk i'll lay
off now unless i'm reminded of something particularly interesting

(thanx to all who've sent me positive messages about these posts --- i'd be
curious about what's happening around you...)ohn

Hello List

I'd like to thank Ron for his little report on the SF mayoral campaign.

I know it wasn't about poetics, but politics are discussed here all the
time.

This race should be of interest to everyone. C'mon! An openly gay
"Marxist" has the chance to be mayor of a large city. Important stuff!

This election could send a gust of fresh, clean Bay Area air across the
country. It may even be felt in stuffy old Boston.

All Best

Owen in Berkeley, Ca.

It would seem that Kathy was being insufficiently a victim -- and thus
becomes a target of victimization --

This _does_ have something to do with poetics --

"victim" L _victima_; akin to OHG _wih_ holy, Skt _vinakti_ he sets apart

The rhetoric of setting apart -- a good description for the responses to
the issues Kathy raises

     A MLA convention panel on "The Performed Text: Toward a Post-Poetics =
for the New Millennium" that might be of interest to some of your =
subscribers has been listed incorrectly in the MLA convention program.

     The correct date and time for session 455 should be:

Tuesday, December 28th, 8:30-9:45, the Burnham room in the Hyatt Regency =
hotel.


     (Right now it is listed incorrectly at that same time but on Wed. =
29th)

     The session features Michael Davidson's discussion of the gestural =
performances of Aaron Williamson and other deaf poets, Ming-Qian Ma's =
study of visual and acoustic topography in Christian Bok's Crystallography,=
 and Susan Vanderborg's discussion of Cells of Release by visual artist =
Fiona Templeton.

     There will be a signing interpreter at the panel.=20

Really? Would you kindly explain that? I'm under the impression it's the

i'm writing a book called "poetics for a post-literary america," and i've
used the phrase "post-literary poetics" and "post -literary poetry" in my
writing.  can i initiate a discussion by asking what *you* mean by
"post-poetics"?  it's intriguing.

btw, this poem was rejected by a major NY editor; according to this editor fellow, he
would be a hypocrite if he published it given his reputation for supporting freedom
of expression, i.e., the NY exhibit in question.

-----------------------------------------------------

"Sensation": The Exhibit (reduced 1000X)


Inconclusive provocations           bio-lit

the dull chute tent           of Emin's sex life,

1963-1995,                chummed death from formaldehyde,

loud zygotics           of ponder and bloating

species in the cachet            churn of Saatchi.

Out-split pigs,         there, lunch boxes of giftshopped face

carnage assemblaged.        Do we mature by killing, stuffing,

or by creating offense?      Ofili's Ave Turd Maria

smeared before Leibovitz.        Now the frozen

blood bust of Quinn merged     and Bowie was not de-sublimated,

sniffing a proboscis of fiberglass       penis for  $9.75

Beyond the zoo oeuvre--parroted plop, elephantine turd,

monkey nipple--     an artist laid down his shovel

and as that shovel lay hardening       with a warm fecal crust,

he faced stupefaction, and he doubted        his own conundrum.

The rhetoric of setting apart also involves that sense of "sacrifice"
meaning "to make sacred" - "sacred - to set apart in honor of".  "To set
apart" also implies "devotion to."  (Isolation?) Devotion to what, tho, in
this case?  What's the object?   Victimization in this (& maybe, how shall
we say it, "all?") case(s) has to do with hierarchy, and so is a poetic
problem, a religious problem, an identification of position problem, an
identification of species problem, a money problem, a social problem & on.
If "setting apart"

implies a sacralization, and sacralization, a division (of labor, of sex, of
knowledge), then the best we can hope for is that conservatorship which sets
itself apart by setting apart those they are able to, from each other.
Teleology

has its finger on EVERYBODY'S button, it being in fact a shredding technique
on the way to gathering "the world" up into a square box with three
compartments, the guts, the heart and the head corresponding to the beast,
forest and stone that gets worked into the achieved flock, garden and city,
these last all the result of the glancing blow that destroys the whole in a
metonym of parts that nevertheless point back to all varieties of some
"golden age."  Victimization in part rises in response to a sentimental urge
to "remember" - or even attempt to recover - some just sense of "animal
moving freely through animal" (animation!).  Yet

there's a hole in the side of the bucket that bleeds off the reservoir that
might otherwise produce the material analogy through which to accelerate
beyond and more fully into exactly what we're currently in - the WHOLE world
which by definition (naming) we can not have in any form that is also not
the wound in consciousness that is consciousness itself, a protection
racket, and what we're ALL victimized by.  Ie., the blood from the hole in
the side of the bucket remains the Roman sewer that runs straight up the
defining thermodynamic "clock" of Wall Street, where libido is factored into
(a) priveledge, toward which one must nevertheless "be on time."  Like, to
your own sacrifice.  However one approaches these appointments, it's never
the simple matter of going to them, but far more one of being either and or
both frozen by, and overwhelmed by, their exaction.

"Like in Russia a native of Moscow coming to St. Petersburg is
automatically moving one step up on the social ladder."

"Really? Would you kindly explain that? I'm under the impression it's the
other way around."

My impression has been that the Moscow/Petersburg relationship was not
unlike the SF-LA (or SF-NY, or Boston-NY, Dallas-Houston, etc etc etc) one
as well. People from city X say that their city is a big step up from those
of city Y, those from City Y just reverse the equation.

Then there are those who live outside one of the major metropolitan areas,
who have a whole other series of relations to deal with.

I've been much pleased here to see the evidence of active scenes in Atlanta,
New Orleans and other US cities not always thought of "from the outside" as
having large poetry scenes. It adds a lot to the list and to discussions
generally.

Those of us in the Philly area ran around last night to hear first Kit
Robinson at Writers House and then Mei-Mei Bersenbrugge & Deborah Richards
at Temple's Old City Gallery. Today we're giddy with all that language (3
very different writers) echoing around in our heads.

Walter Benjamin's ARCADES PROJECT is at last available in English.  It weighs
in at over 1000 pages.  I got my copy from Amazon.  It retails for 39.95 but
the Amazon price (including shipping) is 31.92 total.  I recommend it.

>Lester Bowie Is Dead at 58; Innovative Jazz Trumpeter
>
>By BEN RATLIFF
>
>The trumpeter, band leader and composer Lester Bowie, an icon of the
>experimental movement in jazz from the mid-1960's on who was also known
>for his comic shows and jazz-based treatments of pop music, died on
>Monday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 58.
>
>The cause was liver cancer, said his brother Byron.
>
>Best known as a member of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Bowie performed
>and recorded for more than 30 years. In that group he developed the two
>things that would brand him: his knowing, Groucho Marx-like sense of
>humor, expressed musically and otherwise, and his appearance. In most
>performances he wore a long white lab coat and his narrow face was
>bracketed by a flat-top haircut and a sharp goatee. In publicity photos
>he was rarely seen without a cigar.
>
>His early working experiences were in rhythm-and-blues bands, and a
>slow, expressive blues was his specialty.
>
>But the most famous part of Bowie's trumpet language was timbral effects
>-- glissandos, smears, growls, flutters, half-valved winces and other
>vocalizations that worked their way into the style of almost every
>self-consciously experimental jazz trumpeter who came after him,
>including Butch Morris, Dave Douglas, Herb Robertson and Roy Campbell.
>
>His recordings often seemed like prankish arguments that the only way to
>understand jazz is to see it both in carnivalesque and intellectual
>contexts, to play circus music and modernist post-bop, pure hit-parade
>pop and nearly academic composition.
>
>
>
>Bowie was born in Frederick, Md. His father was a trumpeter who turned
>to high-school teaching after striving for a performance career in
>classical music.
>
>At age 5 Bowie was playing trumpet in daily practice with his father,
>and he played in dance bands as a teenager.
>
>He joined the Army at the age of 17 and was stationed in Texas, where he
>served as a military policeman.
>
>Bowie credited his career longevity to the four years he spent in the
>service. After his discharge he played in bands led by blues and
>rhythm-and-blues performers including Albert King, Jackie Wilson, Rufus
>Thomas and Joe Tex, and was privately rehearsing more experimental music
>with St. Louis musicians like Julius Hemphill and Oliver Lake.
>
>He married a rhythm-and-blues singer, Fontella Bass, and moved to
>Chicago in 1965 to become her musical director; during that period Ms.
>Bass recorded "Rescue Me," which became a major hit on radio. The
>marriage ended in divorce.
>
>In Chicago Bowie worked with a big band led by George Hunter and played
>in rhythm-and-blues studio sessions, including many for Chess Records.
>
>Tiring of the grind, he followed the advice of a saxophonist colleague
>named Delbert Hill and attended a composers' workshop led by the pianist
>Muhal Richard Abrams.
>
>
>
>Many of those in the workshop, including Roscoe Mitchell, Henry
>Threadgill, Joseph Jarman, Anthony Braxton and Jack DeJohnette, would in
>the next decade become major figures in the new jazz.
>
>Abrams's workshop bands formed the nucleus of the Association for the
>Advancement of Creative Musicians, the nonprofit cooperative first
>organized in 1965.
>
>Mitchell created a band with three other A.A.C.M. members: Bowie, the
>bassist Malachi Favors and the drummer Phillip Wilson. When Wilson left,
>the band had trouble finding a replacement. Out of desperation its
>members incorporated small percussion instruments -- gongs, bells,
>shakers -- into their group improvisations. This sound would be one of
>the staple gestures of the music played by the Art Ensemble of Chicago,
>which the Mitchell group became in 1969.
>
>By Bowie's reckoning, the Art Ensemble of Chicago rehearsed about 300
>times a year in Chicago and gave only a handful of performances because
>there was almost nowhere to present their music.
>
>So they traveled to France, where there was curiosity about American
>experimental jazz. They made six albums in two months and performed
>hundreds of times in their two years there. The band played blues and
>Bach fugues and percussion interludes and hooting free-improvisation
>pieces and wore tribalist face-paint.
>
>The Art Ensemble's notoriety followed it back to the United States, and
>the group was soon recording for Atlantic Records.
>
>By the mid-70's the Art Ensemble had an easier time reaching large
>audiences. The band soon came to define an esthetic involving ethnic
>music, humor, eclecticism and physical intensity that had a considerable
>impact.
>
>In addition to his brother Byron, of Frederick, Bowie is survived by his
>current wife, Deborah; his father, W. Lester Bowie Sr., and another
>brother, Joseph, both of Frederick; six children, Larry Stevenson of
>Sardinia, Italy; Ju'lene Coney and Nueka Mitchell of St. Louis; Sukari
>Ivester of Chicago; Bahnamous Bowie of Queens, and Zola Bowie of
>Brooklyn, and 10 grandchildren.
>
>During the 1970's Bowie spent two years in Jamaica playing and teaching
>trumpet and took a brief trip to Nigeria, where he became a sideman on
>three records with the popular bandleader Fela Anikulapo Kuti.
>
>Bowie started one new band after another, always surrounding himself
>with work and often undertaking his own business affairs without a
>manager. He led a quintet and a gospel group, From the Root to the
>Source. In the early 80's, he formed the New York Hot Trumpet Quintet,
>which briefly included Wynton Marsalis. Later Bowie and Marsalis would
>often be cited in contrast in debates on the issue of futurism versus
>traditionalism in jazz.
>
>He assembled a 59-piece band called the Sho Nuff Orchestra for a concert
>at Symphony Space in Manhattan. His octet Brass Fantasy, formed in the
>mid-80's, performed versions of pop and funk tunes by artists like the
>Platters, Michael Jackson and James Brown, and recorded for the ECM, DIW
>and Atlantic record labels. The group's last album was the 1998 "Odyssey
>of Funk and Popular Music, Vol. 1."
>
>In recent years Bowie set up the Hip-Hop Feel-Harmonic, an unrecorded
>project with rappers and musicians in his Brooklyn neighborhood of Fort
>Greene.
>
>His sly sensibility won an appreciative following. An enduring example
>was his track "Jazz Death?" from a 1968 album by Roscoe Mitchell's band,
>"Congliptious." It begins with Bowie's dramatically clearing his throat
>and asking, "Is jazz, as we know it, dead yet?"
>
>The reply is a long trumpet solo punctuated with silences, muted wah-wah
>passages, Bowie's own off-horn shrieks and murmured comments, and

Philip, I see why you are confused, I meant Muscovites just visiting those
other places and retaining their status of a metropolis-dweller.  Of
course their raised status is virtual but it's no less real for that.

Dear Masha,

Go to Kentucky, look around, start there, see poor, dirt floors, rags and
rust.  "all be said"?  I don't think so.  There are tens of millions of poor in
this country.

Commence to ciphering.

of the presentations were considering women writers from the end of the

canon, but tend to give new interpertations of their work or pointing to
their differece. Some of the interesting issues discussed were: women and
madness; ambigues relation of the small easteuropean cultures to the large
west cultures; andogene contract, question of the canon and the position of

To clarify the statement "A force to work against without the naming
process supplies the energy without the denegrative state of reverse
labeling." I made earlier, I found this in the new Booglite, written by
Harryette Mullen:

"The work of Erica Hunt and Will Alexander seems specifically designed
to render inoperative such assumptions [issues of class & race]. Their
work challenges conventional or reductive descriptions of "black poetry"
and "black identity," while confronting head-on the conventional
splitting of identity politics and black literary production from
aesthetic practices, innovations, and influences of literary
avant-gardes typically identified with Europe. While they certainly
differ from each other in style, ideological position, and in aesthetic
influences, both poets allow themselves a broad range of subject matter.
Alexander is especially eclectic and inclusive when it comes to choosing
topics for writing, from alchemy, philosophy, and religion to the
history of visual art. Hunt's poetry brings to the page a recognizably
urban female persona that eludes common racial stereotypes, while
Alexander's hermeticism and surrealism signal the continuing influence
of a historically international avant-garde."

The writing without mention of the opposition, the writing which
neutralizes it, appears to have a powerful effect. I would be interested
learning about poetry which is class based that mentions the oppressor
in concrete terms, rather than not at all, and does so with out falling
into the triteness that often occurs in oppositional poetics. I can
think of a few, but very few. Joy Harjo's work, Martin Espada's _City of
Coughing and Dead Radiators_ most examples do not hold to multiple
readings in the way that Neidecker's work or Alexanders does. Rachel
Loden's new book is one of the only recent books I've read that directly
attacks the US socio-political situation and remains intact for multiple
readings.

Jill, if you check back through my posts, I did not state that lack of
access to opportunities does not occur, I made pains to maintain my
writing in "I" based statements, when mass assumptions were made & I
knew they did not fit me, I went outside of these confines to include
some other individual writers. Never was there a "we" intended. I did
not address women & class, which is not an oversight, I do not have
personal experience and assume others here would address the subject.


Don Wellman (lilliput?) & Dodie bring up something that I wonder about,
having done it a lot myself, especially in grad school. The act of
overcompensation. Which seeing these posts together makes me wonder if
this truth of, as Dodie states, "working class guys [having] a harder
time assimilating into the middle class poetry world" is a section of
this overcompensation. And I too have found it "intolerable that some
people wish to rub my naivity in my face."  The question from me is,
when does one cross this line of overcompensation on the page?
Inaccurate hearing of slang, use of the latinate, stating of the
opposition?

And Joe Amato, I have always have admired your ability to get to the
core of the matter, to get something learnable from it. I'll make an
attempt to answer your post when there is more time,  as, yes, it is a
difficult subject to discuss, & my time to write impinged by physical
labor today.

As for David Larsen "Having no ambition myself to rise so high into 'the
upper eschelons' of
anything as to be unable to resist crapping on people a la Mr.
Baratier," who "volunteers to serve as this list's spokesperson for
lettuce-sorters --and, if need be, to pass your *civil* responses back
to
them." There seems to be an assumption that I made the lettuce sorting
comment which is not the case. And *civil*, such as this one? I hope
your aggression towards the target you believe me to be has made you
feel better.

Be well

David Baratier

Apologies for cross posting

The Sub Voicive Poetry and Writers Forum websites remain impossible to
update and are intermittently available for reading. The provider says it is
everybody else's fault.

Instead of giving one deadline after another, like the supplier, let me say
that I shall post another note as soon as there is a change and that if
there isn't a change by the end of the coming week - say by 20th November -
then I shall look to relocating the website

No information is yet incorrect but there are updates which will add
information which cannot be made

The next SVP reading in London is by David Bromige and Michael Heller on
Tuesday 16th November Upstairs 3 Cups Sandland Street London WC1 8 p m

It is hoped that there will be a new issue of Spad magazine, devoted to work
by David Bromige; assuming it is available on time a copy will be given to
every paying member of the audience

Further details for those who cannot attend on publication

Small Press Traffic Reading

Friday, November 19, 7:30 p.m.
Anne Waldman
reading and interviewed by Bill Berkson

Anne Waldman makes a special appearance tonight in honor of Small Press
Traffic's 25th anniversary.  There's too much to say about Waldman! She's a
poet, performer, teacher, Distinguished Professor of Poetics at the Naropa
University where she founded the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics
with Allen Ginsberg in 1974.  She has written over 30 books & pamphlets of
poetry including Troubairitz, Kill or Cure, Iovis Books I & II, Young
Mazhattan (with Bill Berkson).  Forthcoming from Penguin Poets is her new
full-length poem, Marriage: A Sentence.  In addition, she is a noted
editor, with many publications including Disembodied Poetics: Annals Of The
Jack Kerouac School with Andrew Schelling and The Beat Book.  Winner of the
Shelley Memorial Prize, she has made collaborative projects recently with
artists GeorgeSchneeman, Susan Rothenberg & Richard Tuttle, and is
currently guest director of the Schule fur Dichtung in Vienna, Austria.
She has never given the same reading twice, so we don't know quite what to
expect, but the hot money says that you've never felt anything like the
roller-coaster of swoops, dives, tremolo, atman, fire-walking, fast
talking, seven elements of history, myth, gossip, magic, enchantment and
theatrical power that you will hear tonight.

She will be interviewed by the poet Bill Berkson, author of ten books of
poetry, including Saturday Night: Poems 1960-61, Recent Visitors, Enigma
Variations, Blue is the Hero and Lush Life.  Mr. Berkson, one of the
premier poets of California, has taught and directed the public lectures
program at the SF Art Institute since 1984.  He plays well with others,
vide his famous collaborations with Frank O'Hara and Philip Guston, and so
we are glad to be able to secure him to quiz his old associate, Anne
Waldman.

        { p o e t i x }


i know i said i was gonna knock this off but all those lighters raised in
the audience have lured me back again --- *and* i thought of a number of
other things that i wdve mentioned had they occurred but for whatever reason
didnt when i wrote up reports 1-4, so, as a last stab at the final notation


  SYMPOSIUM

after my talk, andy di michele's, camille's and randy's, hank lazer acted as
something of a prompter and facillitator for a "panel on an otherness: the
south and experimentation" ---- he handled this something like a thing i'd
seen him do in tuscaloosa some time back and rather than knocking a ball out
between two of the presenters or searching for things within their talks he
instead had a series of (i think it was 10) propositions, or questions ----
these were all interesting unrolling but i do recall thinking that that any
one of them wd have served for the framing of a whole conference ---- and he
had 10 multi-layered and thickly implicating questions

at the this remove the ones that stick out in my memory are those to do with
the nature of regionalism, being "southern", the serach for distinctions
within and between words like community, local, region etc ---- and another
question that hovered around the question of ~what next~? where people are
going what are they doing etc

it also occurs to me that i didnt mention mike sarki's talk at all ---- he
was speaking "against the experimental as such" and beneath the
defensiveness and protestations that we wd misunderstand, that he didnt
belong there, the assertions that "we" were all academics whereas he was a
plumber etc ---- beneath all of that his main point seemed to be that
"experimental" wasnt a genre (and that if it was he had nothing to do with
it) and that instead what experimentalists were obsessed with was a search
for novelty ---- this was a curious talk for a number of reasons ---- he
protested his "common man" status against all the assembled "academics" (who
were they exactly?) and yet he was ghosting along the edges of heidegger in
his talk and ended with a longish quote from deleuze ---- he presented
himself as the one disssenting vote about what ~experimental~ might mean and
while i didnt give the talk i was hoping i wd've, nonetheless one of my main
statements was that ~experimental~ isnt meaningful when used as a genre or
stylistic term ---- anyway

in the panel at the end the "E-word" surfaced a good deal and judging by the
general trend in usage neither my attempted pruning nor sarki's feint toward
"novelty" made much difference to anyone and i think that in spite of hank's
propositions and what had transpired in the talks the panel threatened to
fall into a cataloging of impressions RE the E-word that added very little
to what had happened already


  BERNADETTE

at one point bernadette was talking about having her own cow for milk etc
when i walked into the dining room at camille's and i remember everyone
laughing a good bit about it but not much of anything that was said ---- i
imagined bernadette facing the cow in perhaps a parlor somewhere asking it
questions


  READING

david thomas roberts was billed as a visual artist, poet and contemporary
rag composer and player --- in the reading he mentioned the ozarks in
missouri several times as being behind the references in various poems (i
never caught any of these it seems) ---- i liked his vispo material in the
NOR issue a fair amount and his reading was fine tho i have a certain
difficulty bringing the 2 sets of impressions into any relation

hank lazer read, and again i was reminded of the event in tuscaloosa which i
reported on some time back here ---- 1st perhaps b/c hank read one of the
pieces that he'd read there with a line which i believe goes "chilli lewis
legged in a grounder" --- his also was the poem i mentioned elsewhere in
these reports called "prayer" ---- a number of things struck me in hank's
reading ---- his use of a hand gesture to delineate the breaks within a
series of untitled pieces (andy di michele also used a lot of gestures in
his reading/talk earlier that day and again the next day at the maple leaf
bar) and the gestures that he made at moments within the poem itself,
particularly a gesture with the bent index and thumb taken from the fist as
if holding up a small stone or showing someone the measure of something that
size ---- another thing i noted about hank's reading was the meditative pace
and the clarity of utterance (maybe i'm specifically impressed by these
things as i tend to read between quick and very fast and when i read slower
i feel as if i'm getting ponderous) that really held the attention

during the course of this event intermissionless event i had some difficulty
paying attention and also took a couple of breaks and so apologize for not
having anything to say about dave brinks, susan facknitz, or andy young
(maybe this last was the most physically sensually oriented work read)

and there were also two dance pieces by amy trussell both interpretations of
jake berry poems ---- i liack the knowledge or vocabulary to say much of
anything about these --- tho i do with that i had been able to hear the poem
better and too jake berry was sorely missed at this event


  PARTY AT BILL'S

at one point while randy and skip and i were talking poetry in a darkened
room (see previous reports) there was some commotion outside the window and
lights moving around and randy looked out to see that bill was flashlighting
up into the tree in his backyard where two raccoons were seated in a crook
watching the partiers
        next day i head tell of how it is in the alley behind bill's where a
neighbor feeds all the alley cats and the coons and cats have ceased turf
and territory wars and can be seen eating side by side from the same bowl


  AT THE AIRPORT

bill wished us goodbye and told us to call if we git bumped from our flight
or if it crashed or anything that he cd help with

"Nikuko and Doctor Leopold Konninger"

"Last night I dreamed of famous Russian ballet dancer Nikuko still slowly
pirouetting before Doctor Leopold Konninger, the two locked in mutual
fascination, obsession, to the exclusion of everything else. An orrery,
impenetrable, the body writing itself into space, turning on the wood of
trees - the Other, seated, upon the same."

                            ***************
First of all, we at Public Domain and Perforations would like to wish
everyone a happy holiday season. For those of us who live
half-electronically, It's easy to forget that the other half lives very
concretely.

We would also like to thank all those who have contributed to
Perforations as well as those who have visited the PD site. We are now
averaging about 41,000 hits a month--and for something that's not a porno
site, a download or topical news site that's pretty gratifying and
we thank you again for visiting with us.

We are still compiling P21, 'Eurocentrism and the Dilemma of Deep Time'
and are beginning to think ahead to P23, on poetics, as well as a general
Public Domain digital arts project late next year to be called
'Inter/Facing The Dead'.

More on those later. For now let's talk about:

                               'YOUR LIFE'
                            PERFORATIONS 22

 As I was making an entry in my on-line journal recently, it occurred to
me that there must be hundreds of on-line journals and diaries in this
pre-millennial year. Perhaps most of them not using any flashy graphics,
javascript, CGI, CCS, dhtml, but patiently recording the ebb and flow of
their daily, weekly, or monthly life, perhaps only the minutiae which
seems to clog most of lives but also gives it feet and shoes with which to
walk, the stories of our small pleasures as well as occasional defeats.
But perhaps also the occasional glimmer that seems to give us some sense
of where and who we are, where we've been and where we think we should be
going, a passing but necessary illumination for not only those of us who
write them but maybe even, fleetingly, for those who might happen to come
across them.

This node of PERFORATIONS will feature your journal or diary (after
all--you put it on-line so you must want folks to read it, right?) Whether
only the daily emotional weather, dream diary, your occasional unformed
theoretical musings, sophisticated or homespun, we would like to feature
them. Rather than storing them on the Public Domain server, we would like
to link to your URL since the expectation is that these are on-going
efforts (with the exception perhaps of archived or discontinued
journals.). The only other wish on our part (other than that they be
on-going efforts) is that you send a small graphic which can be used as a
thumbnail on the index page and perhaps a brief description.

John Bennett paid lovely tribute and played a number of cuts by the late
Lester Bowie during "Forms & Feelings," the title of Bennett's regular
(excellent) KPFA (Berkeley) Saturday afternoon jazz program. Another good
reason to support the uniqueness of the station against overhaul efforts by
its currently misdirected umbrella, the Pacifica Foundation.

POEMS: GARY SHORT

Psalm


The sky is the healing wound
of St. Agatha. New light
cast on the seven dead geese
stacked in the bed of the truck.
Their wings stiff around their bodies
make them cocoons of former flight.

The boy’s breath, like a white wing,
hangs in the air above him.
His ears pink with wind,
the steel ridges of the truck bed
stripe his jeans with cold.
The sleeping dog rides in the back with him.
He can hear his father & two uncles
in the cab laughing. Their heads bob
between the guns on the rack.

On some of the geese the eyes are open.
A non-living eye not quite clear,
like the clouded face of a watch.
He thinks of flying, how it would feel
to have nothing surround you.

You can hear their call
long before you see them.
He remembers hearing a flock
on another morning, Geese
stitched across the gray cloth of sky
just before the sun rose
red over the uneven mountains.

The birds flying over a boy’s sleep,
distant voices lifting up memories—
that distant call
made him want to be good.
The truck rattling over a cattleguard startles
the boy alert & he hears a moan.
At first he thinks it’s the dog,
dreaming after birds.
But then another drone releases
from one of the geese.
He had watched them fall, spin around
& crumple like a kite in a dive, dying in midair.

Now he sorts through the bodies,
black heads, pliant collared necks,
plush silvered breasts piled
limp & ruffled. He finds the goose
& holds it, unfolds the shut wings.
In the soft rush
of riffled feathers he feels
the clotted blood where shot entered.

Opening the black visors of the bill,
he covers the nose holes with his fingers
& blows a few breaths of air
into the silty hollow of the bird.

And the dead bird gives back
the boy’s own breath
in distinct syllables, nasal & conversational,
before the bill goes slack.
Then the boy breathes harder into the goose,
cradles it & listens

until there is music, a swell of air
returned over the bird’s vocal cords, a purr,
a dirge, a lost-soul quaver.
A blue cone of sound, human-made,
or made human.




Gathering


All night the bent apple trees
drop their fruit in the storm,
& I don’t hear one fall, not one.

What else fell while I slept?

The twisted limbs glitter silver
in the early sun. A blur of bees
dizzy among broken apples on the ground.

At first waking I’m confused
& mistake the busy dance
as warm blossoming,

when the bees need nectar & the flowers
need pollen to be moved. I think
that’s how it works, but
I admit to confusion

about the sexual affinity
of apple trees and bees.

These bees swarm the full-grown overripe fruit.
They are drawn
to sweetness. I have known for a long time

the seduction of an apple.
In fourth grade I shared my snack of graham crackers
& quartered apple with Adrian Vucinich.

To impress her, I would bite the crackers into outlines
of states, accepting requests—
Idaho, Illinois,
the difficult shape of Texas.

I know
it was only the love of a small boy,

but a small thirst
accumulates, as I’ve learned again from the sparrows
that sip this morning from pocket mirrors of water
in the hoofprints of cattle.



Perseid


A meteor breaks
through the late-summer night,
a white blossom scattering, furiously.

It doesn’t make a noise,
at least none
that we can hear.

It disappears in all directions—
demonstrating desire
& its difficulty.

There. The half-moon floating
thin & translucent
as a cicada’s wing. We say the moon is

half-full,
even as it wanes.
So much longing…

To witness the unfolding
across distance. How we must look
to anyone watching.

Here is the star cage.
Here the still life with black clock.
Here is the sparking wish, scattered.

RD Levitsky writing from the Villa:

Karen Finley, I am paraphrasing, agreed with Williams, put it in more dire
terms, a victory to get of bed in the morning.  I got lost driving around
the suburbs of the silicon valley yesterday on my way to teach the "peerless
poets," a group of self described young seniors, who meet each week in a
surburban living room.  It's all impressive, living in these black tops and
worrying about the root of one tree pushing on the roots of another.

Ammiano--I for one, and I for another, the poet I, was enlivened, brought
back into the culture, as in the momentary spat of AIDS/Sex politics street
activism, momentarily, hope--is not this why we write and what makes us stop
(loss of) when we do.  To me, the writer must be an innocent despite being
weighted with the world.  Same with the activist.    More to say but I 'm
sure it will be said.

A Little on Class--Many of us I would consider to be in a "mutt" position in
amerika, this land in which there are so many versions, the one here in the
valley which places a gate between the smaller houses and the bigger houses
another one which places a gate between my state education and your ivy
league education and your high school education, and the one which separates
the first generation amerikan to a second, a pink from a brown from a tan
from a hooked nose etc.

Being a mutt, as being an exile, as being an outsider, may be a necessary or
endemic position for writing.

An anecdote: I once taught welfare recipients, through one of those
abominable BEGIN (END) programs.  When discussing class, my students, many
of them told me they considered themselves middle class--as marked by their
housing and their possessions.

I for one am of the leisure class -- or so my father would say.

Love,
Rachel

Top dollar urine sing-a-long

wonderul--and yes--I consider Cotton
Mather too then. The Captivity

a strange poem or two by

I'd hopefully suggest a renga go on a renga list

Absolutely, yes.

BoogBeat: Five Days in the City, November 10-14, 1999:
Jordan Davis, Kenneth Koch, James Wilk, Chris Stroffolino, Quincy Troupe,
Wayne Koestenbaum, and Taylor Mead

Wed. 11/10/99:
Jordan Davis and Kenneth Koch
at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church

BoPoFest chieftain Aaron Kiely's just bought a used Geo from someone he
knows in Northampton, and plans many NYC visits now that he can just car-bop
over. But as he readies to head to PoProj for tonight's Davis and Koch
reading, discovers the breaks need work, and $200 later finds himself on a
Peter Pan bus, with potpourri air forced in every 15-minutes and the movie
The Rock on seven TV screens throughout the 50 seat couch, the volume
constant--"I had to watch fuckin' Ed Harris be macho for two hours"--and he
makes it to my Chelsea studio in time to drop-off one bag, as we grab some
Djarums and three slices, before we enter Parish Hall.

Everyone likes Jordan Davis, so we'd all plan on hitting his readings
anyway, but this being a Wednesday night at the Church, and the chance to
see Koch, too, brings the poets out in droves. The PoProj troika of Ed
Friedman, Marcella Durand, and Anselm Berrigan, are all in attendance,
Prageeta Sharma is taking cash at the door, and scattered throughout are
Drew Gardner, Ron Padgett, Douglas Rothschild, Eddie Berrigan, Kristin
Prevallet, Jeni Olin, and a late-arriving Kimberly Lyons.

Mitch Highfill, back to the Project to coordinate the Wednesday night series
this year, introduces Jordan first. Jordan always solid, delivers wicked
lines that are made even stronger by his clean-cut , straightman good looks,
and matter-of-fact reading style. Here are my favorite lines: "purpose in
her Pumas"; "my heart isn't sick, it's just overdressed"; "take me to your
massive mermaid"; and the plain evil: "you look telephone pretty."

Aaron and I quick-smoke with Prageeta outside during the break, and she
heads back to the table, as I show him where Vice President Daniel Tompkins
may be spending eternity.

I sit on the floor, stage right, to take some photos of Koch alongside
Jordan and his wife, stay there, my knees splayed in what we probably don't
call Indian style anymore, as Koch's grandson starts throwing a plastic
water cup, grabbing it and tossing it again, toward the area right in front
of the lectern behind which his grandpa is delivering his poetry. The boy's
father, sitting on a meditation mat, grabs his son's attention--boy can't be
more than five-years-old--and writes math problems into his notebook to
quiet him from crumbling the plastic cup. The boy answers every problem
right, his dad doing the math slower than the little one who figures half of
the answers out in his head.

Koch reads poems to his army days, marijuana,  and his Jewishness, the
latter hitting home solid. His grandson took me away from note taking, but
one line from "to Jewishness" that brought some giggles of the nervous kind,
told of young Koch in a World War Two foxhole, his comrade yelling that
"Those fucking Jews are all back inside, you don't see no fucking Jews in
the foxhole, " as Koch decides to repress his Jewish identity.

After reading, chat with Kim Lyons and friend, try to talk them into going
to the Grassroots on St. Mark's for drinks, though the babysitter is home
watching Kim and Mitch's little one, now three. So Aaron and I head over, as
the Davises all head to dinner with Jordan's folks and Jordan says he'll see
us in 45 minutes.

At Grassroots the Berrigans, Rothschild, Prevallet, and the rest drink and
schmooze. Mitch and Kim make it over for one drink that becomes two or
three, as he tells me about the time he saw the Beatles in Memphis when he
was a boy, as we talk Elvis Costello and poetry, Mitch ripping my head wide
open with his thoughts. Explosive editor Katy Lederer's there too, and I
introduce her to Aaron before she heads to the outer boroughs.

Aaron and I walk Jeni Olin home to the Chelsea Hotel on this unusually warm
autumn night, and she mentions Boulder and reminds me we met over my
postcard project during Naropa summer 1997. Aaron's bladder is about to
explode halfway through out 30-minute walk, so Jeni invites us in to use her
bathroom. First time in Chelsea, as I scope art covered walls as Aaron
emerges refreshed, before we say bye, get a pint of Haagen Daz and talk shit
half the night while I show him pubs he's never seen before.

Thurs. and Fri. 11/11-12/99:
Poet-musicians: James Wilk and Chris Stroffolino

Hit Luna Lounge on Ludlow Street to catch the return of Fatstick editor
James Wilk's band Imaginary Numbers. I saw what was supposed to be their
first and last show here last August, right before their bass player headed
off to Texas for college. But here they are again, with a new bass player
who's pulled the band together. They're no longer mumbling their unfinished
lyrics; the vocals are mixed above the instruments so you can hear the witty
lyrics about Moses, the World Cup, and gravity; and they seem to be having a
whole lot more fun.

Next night head with poet Joanna Fuhrman to see her roommate Chris
Stroffolino's band play loft party in Greenpoint. Walk over to West Street
and discover insane view of the city, Chrysler Building shining even more in
black sky than it reflects in sunlight, and we get there way early, 10:15
for a show slated for 10, as Strof tells Joanna, "What are you doing here so
early? Don't you know nothing starts on time in the city?" We head out with
some others to grab some beer at the corner store, actually called that, and
it looks like some chunk of middle America that got lost in Brooklyn, as I
buy some Dos Equis and we head back.

More people are filtering in, and eventually the loft is packed, as I walk
across the stage and out onto the roof to see the skyline and escape the
crowd. I only know Joanna and Chris, not a single poet in the crowd other
than us three, "A good thing" Stroffolino says with a smirk after the show
when I tell him this, and we laugh.

The band, Volumen, with Chris on keyboards, is a Britpop blast straight
outta 1964, as they wear dark, solid ties, and collared shirts. They sound
great, but the vocals are way down in the mix, and you can't understand a
thing the lead singer is saying. After one song, a friend ambles over to the
vocalist, as he crouches down, and a few seconds he later he does some
adjusting and voila, we can hear the vocals a bit better, though still not
perfect. Joanna says the band sounds much better than the last time they
played, and she's proud of/for Chris. The line's 10-deep for the one
bathroom in the loft, so I head to the street and 5-beer pee in the
overgrowth, before grabbing the G train home.

Sun. 11/14/99:
Quincy Troupe at Tribes Gallery;
Wayne Koestenbaum and Taylor Mead at the Zinc Bar

After taking six-year-old niece Michelle to McDonald's breakfast where we
sit in front car of a choo-choo train as she dips her pancakes in syrup and
I drink ok decaf, before she reads to me in Barnes and Noble's kids room
where she tells me that her mother, my sister, doesn't want her getting
anymore character books, but she insists on me getting her a Rugrats
Thanksgiving book, until a phone call to her mom reveals she already  owns
it, and so I get her a nice Chanukah book instead, I subway  home, skipping
Jewish sports panel at Holocaust museum, head to home for downtime, before
calling Wanda Phipps to come see Quincy Troupe at Tribes Gallery on 3rd
between Avenues C & D, up the block from where my dad was born--across the
street from where the Nuyorican Poets Café now rests--on a kitchen table
nearly 70 years ago. I call Wanda back and tell her it's a reading, not just
a book party, because I know she's not into hitting readings right now. And
a few minutes later get a call from her that she's not going to go.

Quincy is one of my favorite writers, a poet whose words bop like the music
of his old St. Louis neighborhood, where Chuck Berry was living and playing
right up the block from Troupe. Walk up tenement steps into Tribes
apartment/gallery to see Eliot Katz and Long Shot magazine editor Danny Shot
who silent hello wave. Catch last coupla poems before Quincy talks for
half-hour or so on poetry, Miles Davis--"Miles told me once 'I'm gonna knock
your head off,' and I said, 'Shit, you're what, 5'8" 150, I'm 6'2" 220, that
ain't happening so shut the fuck up.' 'I was a boxer in the …' and Quincy
waves his hand derisively and goes 'Yeah, yeah.'"; and Code, the new
lifestyle magazine for black men he's editing during his year-long
sabbatical from teaching.

The line is long to say hi and get his new Coffee House Press book signed,
so I wait on the side, trade zines with Anna May from Tribes, and then say
hello to Quincy, who places me back at Naropa, outside on the iron tables,
eating lunch and talking poetry. I have him sign Booglits for archives,
first issue with him on the cover, and fourth one, on baseball, with his
"Poem for My Father" inside, about his dad, the third greatest Negro
League's catcher ever, and the league's chief archivist, each of which I've
given him before but he says "I've never seen this one, or this one either,"
before I hit him up to do a limited edition chapbook.

Split at 5:15pm to meet cousin for Kosher Indian food in Gramercy Park, but
answering machine call says plans are off, so I head to Two Boots for a
mushroom-and-peppers slice, before busing over to the Zinc Bar for Taylor
Mead gig.

Taylor always entertains me, whether at the annual New Year's reading at St.
Mark's Church or on-line at the Chase Manhattan ATM on Broadway just above
Houston. Get to Zinc real early, 6:30 for 6:37 reading (Lorber-time), drop
stuff on couch in front of where the mic will be set-up, and wait for the
crowd to gather, as the readings here never begin before 7pm. Lungfull
editor Brendan Lorber shows up about 15 minutes later, and I tell him he
should put together a Zinc Bar Reader like the KGB Bar did for their reading
series, and 10 minutes after that his co-curator Douglas Rothschild and him
are talking near the sound equipment about the yet to arrive Taylor Mead. "I
talked to him on Wednesday," Brendan says. A few minutes later Taylor shows
up. I remind David Cameron as we order drinks at the bar--red wine for him a
Vodka gimlet straight up for me--that we were the first two readers at the
Zinc Bar, back in March of 1997 when the series left Biblio's Books, and he
says he can't remember that, and that I have a good memory.

I'd heard of Wayne Koestenbaum before, but didn't know his work at all. It's
what's nice about the Zinc Bar series, this colliding of all sorts of names
and schools of writing, where most of the time I don't even know the
authors, but all of the time I end up hearing good work. Tonight's no
different, as now I feel like I want to be a Wayne Koestenbaum groupie. He
reads pop culture-laced pieces, dropping mentions of dead ’50s icons, opera
stars, and mythical characters, taking us into this world inhabited by the
beautiful, the dead, and his varying forms. The entire time, Lisa Lubasch's
face, always glowing, is damn near incandescent , her dim hysterical
reflection glistening back to me in the mirrors alongside the reader.

Taylor Mead has his boombox with him, always. He comes up to the stage with
his cane. "I walk 60 blocks a day with this thing," he says. Brendan offers
to get him a stool as Taylor tries to configure himself and his work behind
the music stand, dropping poems on the couch next to Brendan, reading catty,
but good, work about Warhol and how he treated Taylor and the other
superstars in the Factory and an ode to the century. His memory is perfect,
as he recants stories of old films and interactions, of letters to The
Village Voice in response to critics who say they don't want to see two
hours of Taylor Mead's ass on the screen, and then how he and Andy made
their next movie "Taylor Mead's Ass," and of Giorno's "Sleep" actually being
only 10 minutes long, but being looped endlessly.

Brendan helps Taylor turn pages, and after one piece, Taylor asks Brendan to
put his finger right here, pointing to a page behind the music stand. As
Brendan places his finger there, Taylor goes "Oh, you bad boy," a
mischievous look in his ruffled brow, as everyone laughs, before Taylor
reads one last piece, his music blaring some sort of Charleston-sounds, as
the crowd asks for an encore, and he delivers it one more time, this time
changing the spring to winter.

I say quick hello to Jen Robinson, her hair now real long after a year plus
of MFA study at Brooklyn College, before she heads off to Brooklyn with
Cameron, and chat with Lee Ann Brown for a moment to give her a December 1
deadline for her year 2000 calendar, and then head to the door.

I say hello to Koestenbaum, as he, his boyfriend and Taylor chat over drinks
at the bar, tell him I am a Kirschenbaum--cherry tree in German-- what is a
Koestenbaum? Chestnut  tree he says, as I smile, wave and split.

As ever,
David

Subject:      Ochs/Hejinian/Dragomoschenko Collaboration

This came to me from the filmmaker Jacki Ochs, thought some of y'all might be interested. The film script is edited down from hundreds of pages of correspondence between Hejinian and Dragomoschenko, not unproblematically, but definitely interestingly. And to hear Lily Taylor's voice speaking Lyn Hejinian's words is truly strange.

Smooches,

Jen

Dear friends and colleagues,

LETTERS NOT ABOUT LOVE,  a unique film collaboration between artists Lyn Hejinian (U.S. poet), Arkadii Dragomoshchenko (Russia, poet) and Jacki Ochs (U.S., filmmaker) will be featured at the Musuem of Modern Art's biennial presentation titled FilmFest - films from the independent states of the former Soviet Union.  This is the only American directed film in the series. FilmFest will be paying tribute to Aleksandr Pushkin on his 200th birthday anniversary.

LETTERS NOT ABOUT LOVE, an hour long 16mm film based on a five year correspondence between the poets, features a striking score by Larry Ochs with additional music by Sergey Kuryokhin, glorious photography by James Livingston, and is narrated by actors Lili Taylor and Victor Nord.
The film has won several awards including Best Documentary Feature from the South by Southwest Film Festival.

Dates are:        Tuesday, December 7th at 2:30PM
                        Friday December 17th at 7PM.
Address: 11 West 53rd St., Roy & Niuta Titus Theatre #1


Following are a few quotes on the film  "Letters Not About Love"

Michael Ondaatje author of "The English Patient"
"The delicate merging of private maps - home, grandmother, local weather
- in this  intimate and formal correspondence of two poets, one in
America, one in Russia.  How  a kettle whistles there, how a sun floats
here.
 A beautiful and moving film."

Laurie Anderson performance artist - composer
 "Letters Not About Love" is a gorgeous meditation on the mysteries of
language and  place. Using a written exchange between two writers who
riff on definitions of one and  two syllable words, Ochs has created a
fascinating double portrait of the United States  and Russia, which
emerges through evocative images and stories.  Jacki Ochs has  made a
truly beautiful and original film."

Cleveland Plain Dealer
"By the end of this short 60  minute film, a deep intimacy has been
established ? between the poets, between their cultures, and between
film and audience."

Austin Chronicle
 "..a rare embrace of the political and the personal...a true and
literal fusion of cinema  and poetry."

OPINION
"With my finger on the mouse I'm actively engaged in a physical relationship with what happens on the screen. I'm transfixed in the light of the monitor's path. A one-to-one contact, a to-and-fro 'relationship' that is unique, personal and seductive." Brought to you in conjunction with NOW99, Michael Atavar talks about Intimacy in the latest Opinion.

Fair enough, Michael. But then again, it's a question of degree. Though
some of us have certainly managed "experience hunger" in the US, some of us
have also encountered forms of poverty elsewhere that are quite simply
never seen in this country, and are impossible for most Americans even to
imagine.

Cheers,
Philip Nikolayev

Throughout November, Native American from around the country will gather in
Washington, D.C. to demand that President Clinton grant executive clemency
to Leonard Peltier, a Native American leader who has been in prison for 23
years for a crime he did not commit.

In April Amnesty International declared Mr. Peltier a political prisoner an=
d
called for his immediate and unconditional release. Over the years,
humanitarian figures such as the Reverend Jesse Jackson, the South African
Arch Bishop Desmond Tutu, and the Dalai Lama have made similar calls. Now,
the EZLN and Subcomandante Marcos are echoing the plea for Mr. Peltier's
freedom.

To learn more about the details of Mr. Peltier's case, why so many people
are petitioning for his freedom, and how you can help, go to the Leonard
Peltier Defense Committee's website at

Subject: To Leonard Peltier from Subcomandante Marcos

Ej=E9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci=F3n Nacional M=E9xico

October of 1999

For: Leonard Peltier

From: Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos

Leonard,

Through the NCDM and Cecilia Rodriguez we extend greetings from the men,
women, children and elders of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation.

Cecilia has told us about the grave injustice the North American judicial
system has committed against you. We understand that the powerful are
punishing your spirit of rebellion and your strong fight for the rights of
indigenous people in North America.

Stupid as it is, the powerful believe that through humiliation, arrogance
and isolation it can break the dignity of those who give thoughts, feelings=
,
life and guidance to the struggle for recognition and respect for the first
inhabitants of the land over whom, the vain United States has risen.  The
heroic resistance that you have maintained in prison, as well as the broad
movement of solidarity, that your case and your cause have motivated in the
U.S. and the world reveal their mistake.

Knowing of your existence and history, no woman or man if they are honest
and conscious can remain silent before such a great injustice. Nor can they
remain still in front of a struggle, which like all that is born and grows
from below, is necessary, possible, and true.

The Lakota, a people who have the honor and fortune to have you among their
blood, have an ethic that recognizes and respects the place of all people
and things, respects the relations that mother earth has with herself and
mother living things that live and die within her and outside of her. An
ethic that recognizes generosity as a measure of human worth, the walk of
our ancestors and our dead along the paths of today and tomorrow, women and
men as part of the universe that have the power of free will to choose path=
s
and seasons, the search for harmony and the struggle against that which
breaks and disorders it. All of this, and more that escapes because we are
so far away, has a lot to teach the =93western=94 culture which steers, in =
North
America and in the rest of the world, against humanity and against nature.

Probably the determined resistance of Leonard Peltier is incomprehensible t=
o
the Powerful in North America, and the world. To never give up, to resist,
the powerful call this =93 foolishness=94. But the foolish are in every cor=
ner
of the world, and in all of them, resistance flourishes in the fertile
ground of the most ancient history.

In sum, what the powerful fail to understand is not only Peltier=92s
resistance, but also the entire worlds, and so they intend to mold the
planet into the coffin the system represents, with wars, jails and police
officers.

Probably, the powerful in North America think that in jailing and torturing
Leonard Peltier, they are jailing and torturing one man.

And so they don=92t understand how a prisoner can continue to be free, whil=
e
in prison.

And they don=92t understand how, being imprisoned, he speaks with so many, =
and
so many listen.

And they don=92t understand how, in trying to kill him, he has more life.

And they don=92t understand how one man, alone, is able to resist so much, =
to
represent so much, to be so large.

=93Why?=94 the powerful ask themselves and the answer never reaches their e=
ars:

Because Leonard Peltier is a people, the Lakota, and it is impossible to
keep a people imprisoned.

Because Leonard Peltier speaks through the Lakota men and women who are in
themselves and in their nature the best of mother earth.

Because the strength that this man and this people have does not come from
modern weapons, rather it comes from their history, their roots, their dead=
=2E

Because the Lakota know that no one is more alive than the dead.

Because the Lakota, and many other North American Indian people, know that
resisting without surrender not only defends their lives and their liberty,
but also their history and the nature that gives them origin, home, and
destiny.

Because the great ones always seem so small to those who can not see the
history that each one keeps inside.

Because the racism that now governs can only imagine the other and the
different in jail=85or in the trashcan, where two Lakota natives were found
last month, murdered, in the community of Pine Ridge.  This is justice in
North America: those who fight for their people are in jail, those who
despise and murder walk unpunished.

What is Leonard Peltier accused of?

Not of a crime he didn=92t commit. No. He is accused of being other, of bei=
ng
different, of being proud to be other and different.

But for the Powerful, Leonard Peltier=92s most serious =93crime=94 is that =
he
seeks to rescue in the past, in his culture, in his roots, the history of
his people, the Lakota.  And for the powerful, this is a crime, because
knowing oneself with history impedes one from being tossed around by this
absurd machine that is the system.

If Leonard Peltier is guilty, than we are all guilty because we seek out
history, and on its shoulders we fight to have a place in the world, a plac=
e
of dignity and respect, a place for ourselves exactly as we are, which is
also, very much as we were.

If the Indian people of the North and Indian people of M=E9xico, as well as
the indigenous people of the entire continent, know that we have our own
place (being who we are, not pretending to be another skin color, another
tongue, another culture), what is left is that other colors that populate
the entire world know it. And what is left is for the powerful to know it.
So that they know it, and learn the lesson so well that they won=92t forget=
,
many more paths and bridges are needed that are walked from below.

On these paths and bridges, you, Leonard Peltier, have a special place, the
best, next to us who are like you.

Salud, Leonard Peltier, receive a hug from one who admires and respects you=
,
and who hopes that one day you will call him "brother".

Vale, and health to you and I hope that injustice disappears tomorrow, with
yesterday as a weapon and today as a road.

You can in fact vote from the website, though unfortunately there is no
slot for "none of the above." Thank gods those weren't the only five books

The majority of Americans will name themselves as "middle class" (despite
external evidence to the contrary) which underscores the extent to which
class is unnameable and invisible in this country. The homeless, the poor
and elderly, the rural poor, the working poor are all examples of invisible
classes. It's part of what makes it possible for the "what are you talking
about class for -- you're an American so shut up" argument to arise
repeatedly. Yes, we are definitely a "super power" "first world" nation, but
inside our borders many live in "third world" conditions. See, for example,
the infant mortality rate in inner cities.

I still don't understand the statement you're trying to clarify, but I *do*
think you're mis-reading and essentializing Mullen's essay. Mullen's writing
around Hunt and Alexander explicates the ways in which their work "renders
inoperative" assumptions about the category of "black poetry" which expect
that "black writing" is (to quote again from Mullen) "constituted around the
central idea of textualized orality, or 'the speakerly text'." (See also,
Aldon Nielsen's excellent work _Black Chant_.) Hunt and Alexander's work
also complicates and interrogates the notion of "black identity;" this
doesn't mean that they don't write "about" class and race, or that they
don't "mention the opposition." See Hunt, Local History:
"In this was casualties multiply:one in four in prson, one in four
unemployed, one in four with a habit, every square inch to be fought for. In
the panic that is no solution, the police and the young guarantee one
another employment; the ranks of each army swell" (38).
This passage seems pretty clearly to "name" the "war at home" against
African-American men, among other things.

        two issues to address--

        first, any one can be a poet

        by that i mean--poetry knows no borders, among whom poetry comes
to be an action

        it is by its nature unexpected

        i will give an illustration in the form of a story

        (and it's all true, as they say)

        a few years ago a friend sent me an article from the New Yorker
magazine--
        it was about the author's search for the place that Walt Whitman
lived when he wrote the first edition of Leaves of Grass
        (and a wise person here notes how important place is)
        after much laborious research, the writer found the place
        he knocked on the door in excitement--
        a large Rastafarian Jamaican answered the door--
        the author said, do you know a great poet lived here?
        the Rastafarian answered--how do you know one doesn't live here
now?

        to me, that states the fact of poetry, that exists, behind any
door
        any fellow human, any eyes you look into--these are part or not
part of our struggle to be free

        yet any eyes may hold in them poetry
        the action and the perception and the listening of poetry

        poetry may at times be the province of an elect--yet this is not
true--
        poetry is the province of the people

        poetry is the voice not in vain

        my second point, with permission Judge-- as they say--

        there are areas in america as bad as any place
        go visit a reservation for example
        i spent a weekend with a dear friend here in Milwaukee last
week--where he lives is like a Hell--
        Leroi Jones wrote a great book about it--The System of Dante's
Hell-
        you can get on a bus and see it--
        really--it costs a dollar thirty five and you can see Hell-
        i've lived in 17 countries--and i never saw a worse place than
america
        if you are Black, Latino, Indian, you know--

        yet if we work, in our poems, may we bring hope for our peoples

        please believe me--poetry is not an esoteriscism, it is a form of
action,a demand--
        a demand to be free
        for all
        I hope you make an action this month for Leonard Peltier
        Send a message at least to the addresses I sent
        I am organizing an exhibit for Mr. Peltier here--please contribute
        Hence poetry

Should read:
"In this war casualties multiply: one in four in prison, one in four
unemployed, one in four with a habit, every square inch to be fought for. In
the panic that is no solution, the police and the young guarantee one
another employment; the ranks of each army swell" (38).

Once More, with the Usual Feeling


He's going to do it again, there will be some dismemberment, said Jenni-
fer, said Julu, he's got all these attributions of talk, no one's really
saying anything, he's trite, talking to himself, repetitious, it just goes
on and on. Someone throws a bowling ball, said Alan, and down goes Julu.

Someone said something about being really tired and hadn't they heard that
before, anyway, those who were left? People left the reading "in droves,"
although Nikuko (kill her!) had no idea how many that was. We're all tired
said Doctor Leopold Konninger; Nikuko, the "famous Russian ballet dancer"
(as if we didn't know!), was unable to wind down. Alan thought the narra-
tive demanded this continuous state of being-in-motion on one hand, and
the Doctor Leopold, on the other, rather static and uncomfortable in his
wooden chair on the wooden floor.

For all I know, said Jennifer, a vowel change is imminent. It's a way of
avoiding content, making a whole lot of noise. At this point the noise has
become a signifier or trademark of Alan as well. It's as if everything
conspires to guarantee the singularity of one text, written over and over
again, each version equally correct, coherent, well-written, more or less,
but without any sort of advance. Doctor Leopold Konninger, who came to me
in a dream, said, Alan, concurs; I'm obsessed by these texts, I can't stop
the texts, but it's almost as if they stop me.

A quotation from an obscure source, always askew to the point, "They will
come for me, / their faces screened, / mouth-banners high, silk carvings /
in or around the square shrine. / They will come for me, / banners of grey
faces, / dusk-cloths, embrochures of stone / in or around the square
shrine. / Follow the earth's fold, / wary of legs caught in crevices, / in
the air of autumn, / in the autumn air."

He's going to do it again, these stupid stupid voices, these broken limbs,
blind flutterings about the womb. He's going to keep on going, they're
massive, they're useless, they're glued together by a constant intensity,
the repetition of a monologue insistent on building the world from word.
His interest in programming is 'peculiar,' the minor satisfaction of out-
put to some extent not his own - but he short-circuits this by insisting
on writing his own. Everywhere, his own. His tentacles, Jennifer, Julu,
Nikuko, Alan, his own. His blunt texts, his own. Doctor Leopold Konninger
resists any temptation towards either the analytic or the therapeutic, and
Doctor Leopold Konninger has killed.

Dear List,

Maybe I'm the last to have heard about Buffalo's Poetry
Collections/Publications on the web, but I was amazed to find shrink-wrapped
copies for sale of o-blek's "Writing from the New Coast."  It's listed as
out-of-print elsewhere (and it probably is), so if anyone's looking for a
reasonably-priced copy of this anthology, go to:

http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/units/pl/buffpubs/index.html

There was no mention of scarcity of copies, so I'm assuming more are
available.

And ... there are other interesting, inexpensive items for sale.



Cheers,

Bob Freedman

given the editor, if you are interested in his editorial principles, you
might look at _repression and recovery_ about the varieties (canonical and
not so) of 20s through 45 american verse.

On other lists that I have read or participated in new
members have, somewhat formally, introduced themselves
to the community.  I've not seen any messages like
those appear on this list, though I might have missed
them, but anyway, let me introduce myself...

My name is Marla Jernigan. I am a poet. I live in
Atlanta, or Chamblee, which is much the same thing.  I
don't care too much for poetics as philosophical
conquest and prefer to see both the things I do and
the things I talk about as singular, worth reading for
what they are more than what they remind one of.

I would like to know what anyone out there thinks of
symbolism, not the French movement but the actual
practice and life in symbols, backchannel please.

Thank You,

Marla

Picked this up the other day - a double CD set for single CD price. Some of
the performances are fairly "faithful," some range closer to "versions,"
with the longer pieces (esp. the Cardew and Cage, if I remember correctly)
being, to my ears, the more interesting. Includes a recording of Coco Hayley
Gordon Moore (Sonic Youth's own sonic youth) doing Yoko Ono's "Voice Piece
for Soprano" in a mercifully short 12 seconds.

Poetry Forecasts used to run the last Monday of every month. Starting
December 6th, it will run on the first Monday. So if, by chance, one were to
pick up the Nov 29th issue, one would find no poetry reviews therein.

And re: the New Yorker thing (vote Prynne), here's the PW "Best Books"

Ted Joans's Teducation (Coffee House)
Pamela Lu's Pamela: A Novel (Atelos)
Ange Mlinko's Matinees (Zoland)

hi folks,

sorry for the one stop post but deadlines are crashing all around me and
e-time is at a premium.

i just want to thank all the kind sirs that offered me references for my
research.

one of the strange things that i've experienced since moving to
newfoundland from continental north america are the hit and miss library
searches. bernstein,s _close listening_ -yes. adalaide morris - no.  a
search for _site of sound_ produced this:

Title: A comparison of site-to-site repeatability of two stationary
       measurement procedures for truck exterior sound levels [microform]
       / prepared for Transport Canada, Road and Motor Vehicle Safety ;
        prepared by : Harford, Kennedy, Wakefield Ltd.

so, i never know what i'll get.

as for the web-sites that daniel zimmerman suggested, Margo's Magical
Letter Page is incredible and i can't get into the other one.
thanks again,
kevin

Another anecdote: a friend of mine teaching at University of Washington
told me that one student, whose mother was a very successful (= rich)
pediatrician and whose father was a very successful (= rich) Microsoft
employee, considers her family "working class" because both her parents
work.

So I don't think of the issue as one of "unnameability and invisibility"
(see below), rather (also) as an issue of history and knowledge (i.e.
knowing what "working class" ACTUALLY MEANS).

It's me, Pete. I've been away.

My new address is in Portland, Oregon.

I know there are some who wonder what ever became of Happy Genius. Well,
write me back-channel and I'll tell you.

For those half a thousand who joined since I left... Yes, I write. The
primary question, however, is "who do you read?" isn't it? Modernists,
Objectivists, Postmodernists mostly. I guess I'm really 40 years delayed
in my taste or something. I haven't seen anything by any National Book
Award winner that I have liked.

BILL MARSH AND SUNBRELLA.NET
PUBLISHING-BROADCASTING, AND THE POETICS OF HYPERMEDIATED ART

on Defib: http://webartery.com/defib
Sunday November 21, Noon PST (19:00 GMT)

Bill Marsh is the featured Web artist at Defib this Sunday.

Bill is a new media writer who combines critical acumen with an engaging
poetical approach to Web art. His own site
(http://bmarsh.dtai.com/home.html) features essays, poems, new media
work, and his Paper Brain Press. He's launching  http://sunbrella.net, a
Web broadcasting venture that will broadcast Web content of various
types. Sunbrella.net will be  launched by the time this edition of Defib
happens, very likely, so sunbrella.net and its works and vision will be
the main focus of the show. To be a publisher now can also involve
broadcasting various media. Bill is the publisher of Paper Brain Press
and his Web site, and now his publishing venture is expanding into
broadcasting. Should be a good show on the nature of publishing in the
contemporary scape and on some interesting work with Bill Marsh, one of
the progressive new media/poetics thinkers on the Web.

Defib is webartery.com's online live artist interview surf show. All you
need to participate is a Java enabled browser pointed at
http://webartery.com/defib. Defib happens on 1st and 3rd Sundays. The
transcript of the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) session is logged and then
produced into hypertranscripts. Defib's featured Talan Memmott and Clair
Dinsmore so far; the transcript of the show on Talan's work is at
http://webartery.com/defib/canned/1talan.

Produced by Dan Waber, Jim Andrews, and the folks of webartery.com.

All the list-turbulence around class suggests a passage from Brecht's
"To Posterity," one I've found useful in coming to terms with the fury
that seems to come with this territory.  Quoted despite its flaws,
translated or otherwise (anyone know a better English version than the
H.R. Hays, which this is?):

  You, who shall emerge from the flood
  In which we are sinking,
  Think--
  When you speak of our weaknesses,
  Also of the dark time
  That brought them forth.
  For we went, changing our country more often than our shoes,
  In the class war, despairing
  When there was only injustice and no resistance.

  For we knew only too well:
  Even the hatred of squalor
  Makes the brow grow stern.
  Even anger against injustice
  Makes the voice grow harsh.  Alas, we
  Who wished to lay the foundations of kindness
  Could not ourselves be kind.

  But you, when at last it comes to pass
  That man can help his fellow man,
  Do not judge us
  Too harshly.


__________________________________________________

Am still as puzzled as I was on our last go-round by the conflation of
class with money.  More on that later, perhaps--

For now an invitation to my website, although at this point it's mostly
a book site.  At the main page there's really just my ticket to the
Berkeley Poetry Conference in '65 (when I was 17):

But that leads to a page for the new HOTEL IMPERIUM:

Boston passed a living wage ordinance last year. Some of its teeth,
however, were knocked out in a scuffle shortly afterward.=20
Somerville (accessible by Boston subway) has a committee working toward a
living wage.=20
Cambridge passed a living wage ordinance earlier this year. The group I
volunteer with as a tenant organizer, the Eviction Free Zone, spearheaded
it (i.e., wrote it) in conjunction with members of the Local Carpenter's
union.=20

Still, all of these cities are reeling from the loss of rent control. My
employment at MIT got me into the university housing office which was a
happy instance of right place, right time, and it landed me a lease in
Cambridge at an affordable rent. Having fought an eviction for the past
year, the timing was pretty good. Not everyone has been lucky though and
it's no small wonder that even those poets who do manage to stick it out in
the cities have to spend so much of their time working to pay rent. This is
a strike against the kinds of "community" where you actually can meet with
people face to face.=20

Even the author of The Hotel Wentley Poems has been having landlord
trouble. He lives on Beacon Hill, which some people may translate to mean
that he lives in luxury. Far from it. Still, there are dedicated people who
look out for him, and others (poets) who are working to raise money to
secure his situation.=20

The last thing I'd intended was to deny class, working class, invisible
class.  Rather to underscore the difficulty that you speak of below.  Hence
my ironic comment about being leisure class.

well i have to voice some support for the prynne book.  it's truly a
major event, gathering the bulk of 18 individual collections spanning 30
years of work which has to this point been virtually impossible to obtain.

as if, for example, all of ashbery from *some trees* up to the *selected
poems* became available all at once for the first time in the mid-1980s.

To UB Poetics List,

This June I will be part of a group of faculty and students who will
travel to Cuba for ten-days as part of an exciting, on-going cultural
exchange with scholars and artists from Cuba that has been initiated
and organized by Saul Landau, a filmmaker and frequent commentator on
Pacifica's KPFK.  I would greatly appreciate it if any List members
might put me in touch with Cuban poets by e-mail so that I might be
able to communicate with these individuals ahead of the trip and
might be able to plan a meeting with them during the trip.  My
address is dameadows@csupomona.edu

With appreciation,

Deborah Meadows

Daniel brings up a very good point here.  The loss of rent control in Boston
is for me an enormous burden.  Not having been so lucky as Daniel, I live in
a student ghetto called Allston, where I pay more than $700/month for a
run-down studio apartment with peeling walls and drafty windows.  And I'm
damn lucky to have it, considering Boston University has to house students
in hotels because the vacancy rates in any decent area here are currently at
less than 3%.  However, I work a 50 or 60 hour week every week, and while my
salary is above what I would consider to be a "living wage" in most areas of
the country, it is certainly not enough to afford me the lifestyle I want to
be living for how much effort I have to put in to my job.

Not that a living wage isn't important - it is - but "living wage" is really
just a bandage.  The real issue here is that legislation (at least in
Boston) has repeatedly sided with the wishes of property owners who want to
squeeze every possible dime out of "Daddy's Pocket". (Lots of students =
Lots of $$$)  To increase people's pay to a "living wage" without also
placing restrictions on how many of those dollars the property owners can
take from us does very little to afford me any more time to read and/or
write poetry.

Perhaps I've missed something here, but I do wonder if this is also an issue
in San Francisco, or if the implication of this thread has been that a
"living wage" will solve all our poetic woes?

Boston passed a living wage ordinance last year. Some of its teeth,
however, were knocked out in a scuffle shortly afterward.
Somerville (accessible by Boston subway) has a committee working toward a
living wage.
Cambridge passed a living wage ordinance earlier this year. The group I
volunteer with as a tenant organizer, the Eviction Free Zone, spearheaded
it (i.e., wrote it) in conjunction with members of the Local Carpenter's
union.

Still, all of these cities are reeling from the loss of rent control. My
employment at MIT got me into the university housing office which was a
happy instance of right place, right time, and it landed me a lease in
Cambridge at an affordable rent. Having fought an eviction for the past
year, the timing was pretty good. Not everyone has been lucky though and
it's no small wonder that even those poets who do manage to stick it out in
the cities have to spend so much of their time working to pay rent. This is
a strike against the kinds of "community" where you actually can meet with
people face to face.

Even the author of The Hotel Wentley Poems has been having landlord
trouble. He lives on Beacon Hill, which some people may translate to mean
that he lives in luxury. Far from it. Still, there are dedicated people who
look out for him, and others (poets) who are working to raise money to
secure his situation.

In spite of all attempts to overcome centre/province relations, some
cultural centralities remain & library (& like cultural resources -- make
your own list of them) are a constant reminder of that.
You should have seen the strange visuals on my screen in Auckland from
Philadelphia Writers' House two days back. Barrett Watten's head continually
disformed for twenty minutes, interrupted only by connections breaking three
or four times + several minutes of unintelligible sound.

Welcome to the real world, Kevin. Distance spooks our way.

However, replies to your query proved useful to a colleague here researching
kinaesthetics.  But I havent heard from her whether she cd get any of the
titles listed.

i think rachel's point -- that class does not = money -- is one key to
understanding WHY class is crucial to discussions of symbolic work...

some unreconstructed marxists i know would not want to make the
(theoretical) move to class ideology through the ideology of signs and
symbols... but if i wouldn't want to see class reduced to money issues,
strictly speaking, nor would i want to talk class W/O occasionally talking
dollars and sense...

and i think there is some value in discussing, e.g., poetry reading
fashions and related anxieties... and for that matter, i think the tv show
*roseanne* was dead-on in its representations of working class/middle class
etc. realities (and i only warmed up to the show at kass's urgings via
reruns, stupid me)...

anyway, love to hear more here...

best,

joe

Hi Sylvester,
Can't make it up to Orono today for the reading, though I would like to.
Could somebody get Lee Ann Brown to autograph a copy of POLYVERSE for me
and send it along with a bill? Thanks.

By The Associated Press

TANGIERS, Morocco (AP) -- Paul Bowles, the American writer and composer best
known for his novels in exotic North African settings, died today in
Morocco, the Italian Hospital said. He was 88.

Bowles had been hospitalized since Nov. 7 with serious cardiac problems. He
died of a heart attack in the Mediterranean port of Tangiers, where he had
lived for more than 50 years.

In his first and most famous novel, ``The Sheltering Sky,'' an American
couple go to North Africa to try to grow closer together. Instead, they
drift further apart. He dies of typhoid; she wanders out into the desert and
moves in with the Bedouins.

Bowles' descriptions of burning sands, open skies and lonely North African
landscapes, and his finesse in describing the psychological unraveling of a
character lost amid the sands, prompted Modern Library to name ``The
Sheltering Sky,'' as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the
century.

Director Bernardo Bertolucci battled the scorching heat of the Sahara to
make the book into a 1990 movie that starred John Malkovich and Debra
Winger.

Bowles was born Dec. 30, 1910, in New York City, but rarely returned to his
native city after settling in 1947 in Tangiers, the great port sprawled at
the foot of the Rif Mountains on Africa's northern coast across the
Mediterranean from Spain.

Bowles became a father figure to several writers, including William
Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. Truman Capote was also among those who
traveled to see him and share in the hedonism of the Tangiers scene, well
known to expatriates.

The novels ``Let It Come Down'' and ``The Spider's House'' are also set in
Morocco.

Other works -- ``The Delicate Prey and Other Stories'' and the novel ``Up
Above The World,'' for instance -- are set elsewhere, often in Latin
America.

Tennessee Williams, a friend of Bowles, called him the American writer who
probably best represented the world in which we live ``so precariously from
day and night to each uncertain tomorrow.''

Despite his prolific writing career, Bowles' early talent was music and he
built an impressive career for himself as a composer at a young age.

Bowles studied with the modern American composer Aaron Copland and worked
closely with other greats including Leonard Bernstein. During the 1930s and
1940s, Bowles was a sought-out composers of Broadway music.

His music was featured in the plays of Orson Wells, Tennessee Williams and
William Saroyan. Bowles also composed chamber works, opera and art songs.

During his long years in Morocco, Bowles collected and documented the music
of the people of the Rif Mountains for the U.S. Library of Congress.

Born to Claude Dietz Bowles, a dentist, and Rena Winnewisser Bowles, Bowles
was an only -- and lonely -- child. Lacking playmates, he entertained
himself, much of the time writing poetry and stories.

He spent a total of a year at the University of Virginia, in two
installments interrupted by a trip to Paris. After a surrealist literary
review published a couple of his poems, his life quickly became one of
writing, composing, traveling and knowing almost every important person one
can think of in the literary, theater and musical worlds.

In 1938, he married Jane Sydney Auer, also a writer. The couple lived here
and there, including Mexico, Brooklyn Heights and Sri Lanka (then Ceylon),
before settling in Tangiers. His wife died in 1973.

Bowles returned to music late in his life, composing the score in 1992 for
an Arabic-language production of the Greek tragedy ``Hippolytus'' for which
French fashion giant Yves St. Laurent designed the costumes.

He was also an accomplished translator. Over the years, Bowles translated
the works of Moroccan writers Mohammed Choukri and Mohammed Mrabet, a
storyteller, winning him deep admiration in his adopted land.

Bowles, whose sight failed him as he grew old, had lived as a recluse in
Tangiers for many years. He was served to his last breath by Abdelouahed
Boulaich, his Moroccan butler who had worked for him for the last 30 years.

There was no immediate word on survivors or funeral plans.

1999-11-03 What's in the Magazine

AIR 5:6 (November/December 1999) is the long-awaited special
EDUCATION (or perhaps SPECIAL EDUCATION) issue. It includes, among
other things:

"The Dead Grandmother / Exam Syndrome," by Mike Adams. The
phenomenon is studied in depth. It can be described as follows:
A student's grandmother is far more likely to die suddenly
just before the student takes an exam than at any other
time of year.

"To His (Her?) Uncomprehending Student in the Special Help
Session," a poem by Robert M. Hawthorne. It begins:
"Had we but world enough, and time,
This slowness, Laddie, were no crime,
We would sit down and think which way
To think, to cipher, and to weigh
The many ways that we might wend
To come at last to problem's end..."

"How to Get Tenure," by Harry N. David. The author describes a
range of services to bolster one's shot at tenure. These include
paid recommendations, flurries of reprint requests mailed from
prestigious addresses, and other basics.

"Adhesive Tape Technology and the Rapid Expansion of Surgical Sub-
Specialties," by Mort Malkin. The surgical profession has
undergone major changes, most of which can be attributed to
adhesive tape.

These and many, many other articles and features are in the
current issue of AIR. You are, of course, invited to
subscribe to that splendid magazine. (What you are reading
at this moment, of course, is mini-AIR, a tiny, monthly,
electronic supplement to the print magazine.)


----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-04 Beloved Building

If you are the president or chancellor of a relatively young
college or university, we invite you to join the Grand Old
Building Movement Foundation (GOBMF). We at GOBMF will help you
obtain that which you most desire: a historic, atmospheric old
laboratory building that inspires alumni/ae to weep tears and
cough up donations.

Many older institutions have buildings that are just what you
need, and are only too eager to replace them with shiny new glass-
and-steel towers. Almost always, the old buildings are just
knocked down. Such waste! We at GOBMF would be happy to help you
obtain title to an otherwise doomed old laboratory building, and
move it by trailer truck, C5A transport plane, barge, trebuchet,
or Federal Express to your campus.

This month's special is Gibbs Laboratory, a magnificent, historic,
small brick building at Harvard University (see
http://www.fas.harvard.edu/map/Level4/SciLabs/gibbs.shtml). Gibbs
Laboratory is scheduled for demolition in March of next year. If
you have a suitable home for it, and the willingness and ability
to move it lock, stock, and vacuum hoods, please get in touch with
us right away at:

Grand Old Building Movement Foundation
C/O Annals of Improbable Research


----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-05 Ig Radio Broadcast Nov. 26

The Ig radio broadcast will be Friday, Nov. 26, the day after
American Thanksgiving, on NPR's "Science Friday" program. The Ig
will be hour one of the two-hour program.
See http://www.sciencefriday.com for a list of stations and times.
General Ig info is at http://www.improbable.com/ig/ig-top.html


----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-06 Microwave Dirt Alert

Investigator Paul Koch sends the following alert, which assaulted
him in the Fall, 1999 issue of the research journal Nurse Line:

"In the spring issue of _Nurse Line_, we suggested
disinfecting wooden cutting boards and utensils in a
microwave for up to five minutes. A few readers wrote to
let us know that some wooden items charred after a few
minutes in the microwave.
  "Because of variations in microwave power and wood,
we now recommend that you do not use a microwave to
disinfect wooden items.  Instead, run them through
the dishwasher, or scrub with soap and hot water."


----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-07 Cotton Man

The news that Bayer Corporation has stopped putting little cotton
wads in its aspirin bottles has sent shock waves through the
scientific community. (See the October, 1999 issue of "Packaging
World" for details of the stoppage.) Investigator J. Ramon Pierce
sent us this plea, which we pass on to you:

"I have been collecting and studying the cotton in Bayer aspirin
bottles since 1952. (I am primarily interested in their
structure.) Mine is the third largest fully documented, fully
catalogued such collection in the world. Due to an illness, I was
unable to obtain any cotton specimens from bottles packed during
the period May 18-24, 1998. If any of your readers have such
specimens I would be grateful to hear from them."

Investigator Pierce does not have email. Anyone wishing to
correspond with him is invited to write us at:

Ramon Pierce
Aspirin Cotton Collector
C/O Annals of Improbable Research

and we will forward your message to it to its ultimate
destination. Please do not send cotton wads, or cotton anything,
to us, as we lack the proper machinery.


----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-08 Math's Cutting Edge

Several mathematicians have written us lately to complain about
"the unfairness of it all." They are upset that the plural of the
word "AXIS" (an item they use professionally) is the same as the
plural of the word "AX" (an item they prefer to use only when off
duty). We have been unable to calm these anguished individuals,
and would like to hear from anyone who can help them.


----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-09 Foggy Fogies

As we approach the Great Rolling of the Digits, in which one will
become two and three nines will be replaced by zeroes, it is time
to answer a question that has puzzled many of our professional
mathematician readers:

What is ethnomathematics?

Like you, we had not the foggiest idea. This month's Fog Survey
Question is: "Who has *THE* foggiest idea of what ethnomathematics
is? That is, whose idea is the most foggy?"

Please vote for one of the following, or write in your own
candidate's name:

#1. Ubiratan D'Ambrosio, who according to several sites on
the Internet has defined Ethnomathemtics as
"the maths practised among cultural groups such as
national-tribal societies, labour groups, children of a
certain age bracket, professional classes and so on"

#17. Arthur B. Powell and Marilyn Frankenstein, editors of
the book "Ethnomathematics" (State University of New York
Press, 1997.

#496. The International Study Group on Ethnomathematics,
whose web site is  http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/isgem.htm

The above choices are numbered ethnomathematically.

Please send your vote to <marca@chem2.harvard.edu>


----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-10 New Zealand Alert (New Mexico, etc., too)

Millennial Diva Margot Button, star of the Ig Nobel mini-operas,
will be visiting her native New Zealand, avec entourage, during
December and January. If you are in New Zealand and would like to
host a special AIR show (with Ig opera songs and a special AIR
slide show) please get in touch RIGHT NOW with us at
<marca@chem2.harvard.edu> or with Margot at <divamobile@aol.com>.

On February 5, AIR's editor will be in New Mexico doing an AIR
show at New Mexico Tech. If you are elsewhere in New Mexico, and
would like to host an AIR show around then, please get in touch
SOON. Ditto for AIR shows in the Washington, DC area in mid-to-
late Feb, and California in March or April.


----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-11 Most Controversial

This month's education survey asked:
"What subject do you personally find controversial,
and so want removed from the schools?"

The survey was inspired by the educational authorities in several
American states, who insist that evolution should not be mentioned
in classrooms because it is "controversial." Here are the subjects
that should be banned by popular demand.

29% Religion
28% Language (reading and/or writing)
19% History
9% Physical Education (aka "gym")
9% Trigonometry
6% other things (less than 1% vote for each)

Some specific comments:

"All subjects are potentially controversial. Therefore, I don't
think schools should teach anything; they should just be large
repositories of information, with a staff of excellent
librarians."
--Peggy Coquet

"Homework is a significant source of parent/child discord. It

--Jim Spahr

"I attended private Catholic schools so there were no
controversial
subjects or theories that could not be answered by a church
authority."
--Peter Andrijeski

"I like piano music, but my husband prefers violin music. If we
had any kids, and they came home talking about music, it would
start an argument."
--Betty Lise Anderson

"Speling is possably the most controvurshul subjek."
--Iain Gallimore

"I have tired of reading all the controversy surrounding the
existence (or non-existence) of sub-atomic particles. Let's stop
teaching about sub-atomic physics, and its kindred cousin, quantum
mechanics. In all probability, it's all just a bunch of equations,
anyway."
--Barry Lunt

1999-11-12 Most Controversial (English)

Certain respondents to the Controversial Survey were convulsed, in
one way or another, with or by the English language. The following
comments express their anguish:

"I think English grammar should be banned from schools. I wasted
many hours arguing over whether 'to boldly go' was acceptable, or
improper because of the split infinitive."
--E.A. Gedeon

"I want the entire subject of mathematics banned from classroom
because I was a math-challenged English major, and therefore
mathematics damages my self-esteem."
--Gwyn McVay

"Our Organic Chemistry 2 class at the University of Wisconsin
unanimously agreed that we could get a bunch of money for new
chemistry equipment if the entire English department was
eliminated."
--Kurt Swends

"Foreign languages. All sensible people speak UK English."
--D. Ibbetson

1999-11-13 Project AIRhead 2000: Threats & Results

Here is a further random selection from the Project AIRhead 2000
collection of things inexplicably named (in whole or in part)
2000.

ITEM 1212120 (submitted by investigator Phillip I. Goldman)
MOSAIC-2000, a software program that "begins testing, at more than
20 schools in December, its technique of confidentially vetting
and rating potentially violent students on a scale of 1 to 10."
[That description is from the New York Times.] The program is
being developed by the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
working together with something called a "threat-evaluation
company."

ITEM 20002 (submitted by investigator Lyle Wiedeman)
"RESULTS 2000: JOIN THE MASTERS OF OUR TIME," an event scheduled
to happen on December 7 in Anaheim, California and at other times
in other places. The lineup is listed on their web site
(www.results2000.net) as follows:

Featuring:
  Anthony Robbins, William Bennett,
  Brian Tracy, Sanford Botkin
Special Guests:
  Hollywood Celebrity, Wayne Gretzky,
  Larry King, & Billy Blanks

1999-11-14 Relentless With a Biscuit

Len Fisher, co-winner of this year's Ig Nobel Physics Prize, for
discovering the optimal way to dunk a biscuit, is at it again.
Fisher and his colleagues have now determined which beverages most
enhance the flavor of which biscuits. Thanks to investigator Nigel
Birch and others for alerting us to the news. A report can be seen
at
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_510000/510044.stm


-----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-15 Tsk, Tsk, Zap

Many and varied have been the responses to our Tsk, Tsk Task
Survey (of disgusting tasks assigned by scientists to their
assistants). This one is from investigator JC, who requests that
his full name not be mentioned:

"You know those invisible fences they have for dogs? The kind that
gives the dog an electric shock if it crosses a perimeter wire?
How do you suppose they develop the thing that delivers the shock?
I was doing some consulting work for a company that I won't name,
and the engineer working on the dog collar would make some tweaks
to the circuit, put his hand near it, and turn it on. He'd recoil
violently from the shock, then call over the technician and say,
'Okay, try it now.'
"The technician would leave his computer and come over to
the bench, and put his hand on the collar as power was applied. If
it was really working well, he'd look like a cartoon character
with his finger in a light socket. The one post-zap comment I
remember was, 'The initial shock is better than this morning, but
then it's not so good.'"


-----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-16 Least Significant

We have all forgotten to honor the Least Significant Scientist of
the Century. It's time to choose that person, and celebrate.
Please send your vote for Least Significant Scientist of the
Twentieth Century to <marca@chem2.harvard.edu>


-----------------------------------------------------------
1999-11-17 The Verdict on GM Crops

Here are the results of our Scientific Correctness Survey about
genetically modified ("GM") crops:

17% GM crops are beneficial and risk-free,
  and must not be restricted

17% GM crops are vile and dangerous,
  and must be banned

33% I am undecided, and therefore opt for Choice #1

33% I am undecided, and therefore opt for Choice #2

  RANT RATING FOR THIS SURVEY: 52% of all respondents
  who included a comment used an exclamation point (!)

As with all our Scientific Correctness Surveys, this one settles a
complex issue by means of a simple public opinion survey. Now we
can all either stop thinking about it or start thinking about it,
as the case may be, and move on.

1999-11-18 Ancient Wisdom

The holidays are approaching. A gift subscription to Annals of
Improbable Research is cheap, and will display your generosity not
once but six, twelve, or eighteen times (according to how many
years the subscription runs). Best of all, it will let you say of
your gift recipient: "He/she has been an AIRhead since the
twentieth century!" (Sub info in section 1999-11-21 below)

Does anybody know where I can find internet resources on the poet Dionne Brand and the particular episode in her recent film "Sisters in the Struggle" that regarded the Caribbean women working in Canada. I'm especially interested in historical documentation and commentary in addition to Brand's. Also if anyone knows of additional films that touch on the topic of domestic labor in Canada, especially as it pertains to black/Caribbean women.

In need of help.

I've received a lot of reviews for the next issue of Rhizome which is good.

Which is bad is more than one of them don't have names on them.  Anywhere on
them.

Will the writer of the Anselm Berrigan or Cole Swensen or Laynie Brown
reviews please contact ASAP.

If I can't find the writers, I'll likely publish the reviews with my own
editorial fixes (for those full of what I perceive as typos) and publish them
anonymously so that the book being reviewed gets its due.


Thanks.

Surely the lyrics and verse composed by Seminole, Hopi, Navajo, Pima,

Of couse if you're talking sole about colonialization and its European

The canned version of Claire Dinsmore at Defib is available at
http://webartery.com/defib/pastevents.htm (also reachable from the
webartery.com home page under "Defib Interviews"). This is a
hypertranscript of the Sunday Nov 7/99 show with Claire as the featured
Web artist. Claire  recently launched Cauldron & Net, which features
work by a wide range of writers and Web artists; the show looks at that
online mag and closely at a wide range of Claire's own work.

Thanks to Dan Waber for his production of the live show, and thanks to
all who wrote it: Claire Dinsmore, Dan Waber, David Knoebel, Beth
Garrison, Miekal And, Jennifer Ley, George Quasha, Talan Memmott, Bill
Marsh, Reiner Strasser, Thomas Bell, and Skip Largent. Special thanks to
Claire. It's an odd and leaping text--which is part of the energy of
it--and hopefully an engaged/engaging, collaborative look at Claire's
work.

Regards,
Jim Andrews

"A man at Auk went on the lake after firewood. On the way round it he saw
a woman floating about. Her hair was long. Looking at her for some time,
he saw that her little ones were with her. He took one of the children
home. When it became dark they went to sleep. It was the child of the
L!enAxxidAq, and that night it went through the town picking out people's
eyes. Toward morning a certain woman bore a child. In the morning, when
she was getting up, this [the L!enAxxidAq's child] came in to her into the
house. The small boy had a big belly full of eyes. He had taken out the
eyes of all the people. The woman to whom the small boy came had a cane.
He kept pointing at her eyes. Then she pushed him away with the cane. When
he had done it twice, she pushed it into him. He was all full of eyes.
After she had killed him the woman went through the houses. Then she began
to dress herself up. She took her child up on her back to start wandering.
She said, 'I am going to be the L!enAxxidAq.' When she came down on the
beach she kept eating mussels. She put the shells inside of one another.
As she walks along she nurses her little child."

What have we here. We have a MOTHER and an abducted CHILD who eats eyes. A
second WOMAN may become the MOTHER after killing the CHILD. A second
CHILD, of the woman, completes the transaction, and one must never forget
MUSSELS look like EYES, said Doctor Leopold Konninger. Consider this the
Devolution of NIKUKO, the beautiful Russian ballet dancer, who continues
day and night after night and day to pirouette for him. She flickers in
and out, her pirouettes brilliant coiled energy; it is this energy which
creates the mutations and transformations that fascinate him. Doctor Leo-
pold Konninger imagines Nikuko gathering eyes, bending - stooping! - for
mussels; he is enraptured by the twists and deformations of her tutu as

an answer to the question, Alan?

Nikuko held Dr Konninger's eyes for a long time, but she
was the first to look away. She held his eyes, never
returned them, as she went on opening mussels.

Dear Chris,

A few months ago you generously offered to post an announcement to your
list regarding Naropa's web-based writing classes. I am hoping that you
could possibly post this follow up announcement for our Spring classes.
Also Deena Wade our Communcations Director and also a student in our
Writing Program, would like to join the list. How does she do this? Her
email address is Deena@naropa.edu.
Please email me if there is a problem with posting this. And thanks so
much in advance for doing this. I think that it may be of interest to
people. I am sending the announcement in the body of this email and also
as an attachment.

Thank you and Warm Regards,

Colleen Seltz
Coordinator of Naropa Online

Tom (& listmates), no offense was intended. I think of myself as being in
somewhat the situAtion you, Tom, "enjoy," now that it hurts my feet so much
to drive the hour and A quarter to sf/bkly. The poetic k'edge available in
sonoma county, witha few shining exceptions, is not enough to keep a flea
alive. People will not be au courant, and continue to write poems saying
"the sheep are on fire!" I dunno why of all persons you, Tom, shd read my
post for condescension. Should suppose I cast a blanket upon the boonies to
snuff the light of a Tom beckett. Dont you know me better than that? My
point was (I think) that not all regionalism is gonna be okay.

Apologies for cross-posting

Cobbing & Upton - Barbican 19 11 99 a note by Upton

Bob Cobbing and Lawrence Upton performed from Domestic Ambient Noise at the
Arts Book Fair at The Barbican, London on 19 11 99 (5 pm - 5.15 pm)

The performance was one of a series running throughout the fair called "Book
Activation". The contents of books are displayed in front of the audience
via a video camera.

The texts used were time goes as bought (Writers Forum 1999 ISBN 0 86162 912
4) and barbacana (Writers Forum 1999 ISBN 0 86162 913 2), two new issues of
D.A.N., made for the book fair.

Only one book could be displayed at a time. The plan had been to fight over
which book was displayed, Upton promoting time goes as bought and Cobbing
promoting barbacana, with the text in camera-view being the one to be
performed. Unfortunately, the arrangement of lectern, microphone stands and
camera angle did not permit this, so Cobbing controlled both books at the
lectern, switching them quite rapidly at times. Upton stood behind him,
responding to Cobbing and reading from his own copy of as time goes as
bought and from the screen, the latter sometimes showing barbacana.

At one point Cobbing pointed to the book, first here and then there, so that
his finger appeared on the screen and both performed what he pointed at.

The performance was well-attended and well-received.

Both old gits perform again Saturday, 20 November 1999 at 3.30.

time goes as bought  and barbacana will be performed again, but more
briefly. Also to be launched / performed are:

Traces by Peter French (Writers Forum 1999 ISBN 0 86162 972 2)

and two new publications by Bob Cobbing put out by Nicholas Johnson:

kob bok: selected text of bob cobbing (1949-1999) (ISBN 1 901538 27 3)
Etruscan books - can't remember the price
&
shrieks & hisses: collected poems volume sixteen (ISBN 1 901538 26 5)
Etruscan books £5

available from Peter Riley in UK, Collected Works in Australia and SPD in
USA - according to the information in the books

no time yet to pay any attention to them beyond seeing that they are
handsome production jobs

Pete Spence (& listmates), it's difficult to see how Pete's pence were well
spent labeling my appellation "sunday painters" (for writers who will not
learn their history) as "pedantry." A pedant, surely, even in Pete's pants,
is one who insists on UNnecessary studies. I am really surprised (though
shouldn't be : I think too well of people) how quickly those who live in
the boonies (outbeck, I 'speck, in Pete's pens) bristle up at the plain
truth....Why take it personally? I simply commented on a backwardness of
ambience. I wouldnt know whether it applied to Pete's case until I saw some
of his poetry. In Tom Beckett's case, what was more puzzling was that he
only got minatory with me AFTER agreeing that it's tough to write in Dodge,
which was my basic plaint.

 Sometimes I get the feeling that I am not read carefully even on this
List, which I had hoped was a better place to look for such care, than
where I live here in wine-hog heaven. Look at my post again to see it is no
individual I target, but a backward condition of endeavor. From which wish
who may can exempt himself...in Tom's case, on the evidence; in Pete's
case, for Pete's sake, presumably through his practice, soon to be known to
us city-slickers of the net, one trusts (or is already, and I, the
provincial in this respect). I expect the X=Spence equation resolved
quickly, so that the one impression I have of his writerly powers, can
extend beyond a feeble eye-pun. David

That's right, George....shouldn't it read "apparati"? And if there are to
be scare quotes around "discourses" and "real," why not around "realised,"
"reflect" and "relations" ?  So, already we know its author is far from
thorough, and no norte americano (or do Canadians drop the z when they
realize something, as their British cousins do?)

Suddenly i remembered that I should know about working class a lot.
I was thoroughly drilled in marxism and leninism all through many years of
school and university back in the 70s in the Soviet Union. Working class,
proletariat, is a class which has no share in means of production and has to
sell his labor to go on living, it's physical labor they sell, their
muscular energy. To be a working class you have to be engaged in the
production of goods and foods and work in industry. M.Z.

Here is a more detailed obit for Paul Bowles, from yesterday's Manchester
Guardian:


Paul Bowles Obituary


Gary Pulsifer
Friday November 19, 1999
The Guardian


Much-travelled American writer and composer who made his home in Morocco,
the setting for his best-known novel, The Sheltering Sky,
Paul Bowles, who has died aged 88, found inspiration from a long
association with Morocco and her peoples. His semi-autobiographical novel,
The Sheltering Sky, filmed in 1990 by Bertolucci, was one of the seminal
novels of mid-20th century American fiction, while his musical
compositions, lighter in mood, were critical and commercial successes on
Broadway.

It was Gertrude Stein who first suggested that "Freddy" Bowles should visit
Morocco. "You don't want to go to Ville Franche. Everybody's there. And St
Jean-de-Luz is empty and with an awful climate. The place you should go is
Tangier. Alice and I've spent three summers there, and it's fine." In 1931,
Bowles and his mentor, the American composer Aaron Copland, took a villa
overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar, but it was not until 1947 that Bowles
and his wife Jane settled permanently in Morocco.

Paul Bowles was born on Long Island. Family legend had it that his father
Claude, a successful dentist, placed his six-week-old only child in a
basket before an open window during a snowstorm. Certain death was avoided
by the discovery of the naked infant by his maternal grandmother. In any
event, Bowles senior was a strict disciplinarian: the young Bowles was
forced at mealtimes to chew each mouthful of food at least 40 times,
following the practice of Horace Fletcher, the "Moses of Mastication".
Bowles's mother Rena, on the other hand, read him works by Nathaniel
Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe as bedtime stories.

Bowles cited Poe as a particular influence, even choosing to attend the
university of Virginia in 1927, as this had been Poe's college. Although
Bowles made the dean's list during his first term, he was not cut out for
university life in a sleepy southern town and, without a word to his
family, he set sail for France, travelling on an old Dutch steamer. In
Paris he worked briefly as a switchboard operator at the Herald Tribune but
soon returned to New York, taking a job at Dutton's Bookshop on Fifth
Avenue.

Already Bowles's poetry was appearing in the Paris-based surrealist
magazine, transition, alongside the work of André Breton, James Joyce and
Gertrude Stein. He began studying composition with Copland and guest-edited
one issue of his university's magazine, soliciting a contribution from
Stein. In 1931, when Bowles returned to Paris, he visited the legendary
American author and art collector at her home at 27 Rue de Fleurs. "I was
sure from your letters that you were an elderly gentleman of at least 75,"
said Stein. "A highly eccentric elderly gentleman," added her companion
Alice B Toklas.

Through Stein's circle, in the space of two weeks Bowles met Jean Cocteau,
Ezra Pound, Virgil Thompson, Pavel Tchelitchew and André Gide, before going
with Copland to Berlin. There, Bowles came into contact with Stephen
Spender, Christopher Isherwood and Jean Ross, Isherwood's model for Sally
Bowles in Goodbye to Berlin.

Back in Paris, Bowles took a studio in the same building as Virgil
Thompson, who found him "a dazzling blond. We became very good friends...
He started playing me his music as we got acquainted. It was absolutely
charming, sweet, school of Ravel." Bowles was a pupil of Nadia Boulanger in
Paris for some months, but his primary musical training was under Copland
and Thompson.

The following year, Bowles trekked across the Sahara by camel. He then
rented a house in Tangier, using it as a studio for piano composition.
(Bowles shared the house with Djuna Barnes, who began writing Nightwood
here.) His Sonata for Oboe and Clarinet, inspired by a Kurt Schwitters
poem, was heard at the Aeolian Hall in London, while his Sonatina for Piano
had been performed in New York.

By 1935 he had met the choreographer George Balanchine, who commissioned
Bowles to compose Yankee Clipper for his dance company. Bowles's increasing
reputation as a composer led to lucrative work on Broadway and he would go
on to compose the music for a number of Broadway productions, including
Lillian Hellman's Watch on the Rhine; the stage version of South Pacific;
Jacobowsky and the Colonel, directed by Elia Kazan; and John Ford's
Jacobean tragedy 'Tis Pity She's a Whore. He wrote the incidental music for
Tennessee Williams's plays The Glass Menagerie, The Milk Train Doesn't Stop
Here Anymore, Sweet Bird of Youth and Summer and Smoke; while Williams got
him a job as screenwriter on Visconti's film Senso (although the Italian
director had Williams rewrite Bowles's sex scenes).

Altogether, Bowles created 150 original musical compositions. In 1943 his
zarzuela The Wind Remains, based on a surrealist tragicomedy by Lorca,
received its premiere at MOMA in New York, with choreography by Merce
Cunningham and Leonard Bernstein conducting. Bowles also composed the music
for a ballet based on Verlaine's poem Colloque Sentimental with sets by
Salvador Dali. Commented Newsweek: "Paul Bowles's beautiful score was
wrecked by Dali's usual outlandish weirdness."

It was in 1937 that Bowles met the Jewish lesbian writer Jane Auer, at a
party in Harlem. Jane recalled: "He wrote music and was mysterious and
sinister. The first time I saw him I said, he's my enemy." Nevertheless,
Paul and Jane and another couple travelled by bus to Mexico; Bowles went on
to Guatemala. (Before the trip, Bowles had printed 15,000 stickers bearing
the legend "Death to Trotsky" which he distributed throughout Mexico, where
the exile was living.)

On February 21 1938, Paul and Jane were married in a Dutch Reform Church in
New York, on the eve of Jane's 21st birthday. They honeymooned in Central
America, travelling to Panama on a Japanese freighter with two steamer
trunks, 18 large valises and a gramophone - a parrot was acquired en route.

Their honeymoon continued in Costa Rica, where they stayed at a cattle
ranch, before they set sail to France on a ship filled with German Nazi
sympathisers. So began the years of travel for the Bowleses, sometimes
together, often apart. That autumn found the couple back in New York at the
Chelsea Hotel. They joined the Communist party; later, when Paul tried to
leave, the organisation informed him he could only be expelled. By 1941,
they were living in Brooklyn with WH Auden, Peter Pears and Benjamin
Britten; Britten kept his piano in the living room while Paul practised on
his in the cellar. Bowles was awarded a $2500 Guggenheim fellowship to
compose his opera Yerma, and Virgil Thompson offered him a job as assistant
music critic on the New York Herald Tribune, a position he held for four
years.

Bowles was led back to Morocco in 1947 by a vivid dream of Tangier. In the
wake of the war, Tangier was an "international zone" governed by seven
Western powers, and the city was notorious for its lax morals and louche
lifestyle. The Bowleses' marriage, however, was curious even by the
standards of jaded Tangerines. Jane established a number of affairs with
women friends, most notably with Cherifa, an 18-year-old grain-seller. Many
people (her husband included) saw this illiterate peasant woman as a malign
influence. Bowles interested himself in a number of young Moroccan men,
whose oral fiction he went on to translate from Maghrebi and classical
Arabic. For one young Moroccan protegé, Ahmed Yacoubi, he arranged
exhibitions of his paintings.

Eventually the Bowleses took separate apartments in a building near the
American consulate, leading semi-independent lives but usually meeting for
dinner. While Paul found creative inspiration in his Moorish surroundings,
for Jane, cut off from her American roots, Morocco became a cultural
wasteland. She did not complete any new work while in Morocco; indeed her
output was limited to a couple of highly praised novels, one play and one
or two other writings.

Instead, she threw her sparkling personality into a Tangier social scene
orchestrated by the Hon David Herbert. Too many evenings spent drinking at
the Parade Bar, mixed with a careless use of prescribed medicines, resulted
in a stroke in 1956; she was eventually confined to a nursing home in
Malaga, where she died in 1973. After Jane's death, Paul's output was to
dwindle. "Her death was a terrible ordeal, as it was half of myself that I
lost. I no longer wanted to do anything at all."

Paul Bowles became interested in writing fiction when he went over the
manuscript of Jane's novel Two Serious Ladies prior to its US publication.
The plot of his most celebrated novel, The Sheltering Sky, came to him
while on a bus in New York. It was published in 1949 by New Directions and
became an immediate bestseller. (It was originally commissioned by
Doubleday, who then turned it down as "not a novel".)

Bowles described the novel to his American publisher James Laughlin as "an
adventure story in which the adventures take place on two planes
simultaneously; in the actual desert, and in the inner desert of the
spirit... The occasional oasis provides relief from the natural desert, but
the sexual adventures fail to provide relief." Many readers, including
Jane, saw the central characters of Port and his wife Kit as based on the
Bowleses themselves.

The following year, a short-story collection by Bowles appeared under the
title The Delicate Prey (US) and A Little Stone (UK). The British edition,
published by John Lehmann, was notable for its omission of two stories,
Pages from Cold Point, later described by Norman Mailer as "a seduction of
father by a son and one of the best stories written by anyone", and A
Distant Episode, which climaxes in a chilling castration. Tennessee
Williams told Bowles that the latter was "a wonderful story but if you
publish it you're mad. Everyone is going to think you are some sort of
horrible monster." Cyril Connolly and Somerset Maugham advised Lehmann not
to include either story on the grounds that they would not be passed by the
censor.

Bowles's next novel, Let It Come Down, charts the disintegration of Nelson
Dyer, a bank clerk from New York who has settled in Tangier. Where The
Sheltering Sky focused on the Saharan desert, Let It Come Down centred on
the Moroccan capital and the corruption of life under the international
zone. Bowles had taken majoun, a jam made from cannabis, to write Port's
death scene in The Sheltering Sky and in his second novel he has Dyer
descend into Spanish Morocco and a madness induced in part by a "kif" haze.

The Spider's House, set in the medieval city of Fez, is the most overtly
political of Bowles's novels. It examines the relationship between Amar, a
15-year-old Moroccan boy, and three foreigners, an American writer (with
overtones of Bowles), a rich English painter and an American divorcee.
Bowles used the novel, which opens in 1954 during the holy month of
Ramadan, to explore the shifting relationship between the colonial power of
the French and the rising tide of Moroccan nationalism. Up Above the World,
his final novel, concerns the doomed trajectory of an American couple in an
unnamed Central American country. Bowles compared it to the writings of
Graham Greene and Gide, calling it "light" entertainment, which it is not.

He went on to publish several short-story collections, including A Hundred
Camels in the Courtyard, set in Morocco and with an underlying theme of kif
smoking. Other works include the travel writing of Their Heads Are Green
and Their Hands Are Blue; Points in Time, a journey through the Moroccan
centuries; and an enigmatic autobiography, Without Stopping, dubbed
"Without Telling" by William Burroughs. A novella, Too Far From Home, set
in Mali, was well received on publication in 1994.

In later years, when his own creative output had diminished, Bowles
translated a number of Moroccan oral storytellers including Mohammed
Mrabet, Mohamed Choukri, Abdeslam Boulaich and Larbi Layachi. Some western
critics accused Bowles of writing these tales himself, an accusation he
always strongly denied. One or two of these storytellers, with an
exaggerated sense of the sales potential of their books, would later allege
that Bowles was pocketing their royalties. In fact, Bowles was always a
soft touch when it came to his close Moroccan male friends - although less
so to others on occasion.

Other translations included Sartre's play Huis Clos (Bowles came up with
the English title, No Exit); The Oblivion Seekers, by Isabelle Eberhardt;
and several novels by the Guatemalan writer Rodrigo Rey Rosa.

Decades earlier, Bowles was the recipient of a Rockefeller grant to record
Moroccan folk music; the tapes are in the Library of Congress in
Washington. Bowles was to travel some 25,000 miles around his adopted
country, making 250 recordings of a diverse range of local music.

Paul Bowles was an intensely private man, possessed of a dry New England
sense of humour and a capacity for friendship which was at odds with his
public persona as a detached, often aloof, observer. Much of late
20th-century human behaviour frankly baffled him.

Through his books he created a vision of Morocco uniquely his own. In old
age he continued to live in the same run-down Tangier apartment block, the
Immeuble Itesa, receiving visitors and fans from around the world (and the
world came to Bowles) with little complaint. Having lived for many years
without a telephone, his last concession to technical intrusion was the
installation of a fax machine, the number of which was made available to a
select group of intimates. Having travelled little in later years, he flew
to Paris for the opening of The Sheltering Sky and returned again for a
concert of his music, lunching with President Mitterrand at the Elysée
palace.

There are a few things to bring out for Joe's post. Sure there are class
distinctions, and Kathy makes a good point with how "the homeless, the
poor and elderly, the rural poor, the working poor are all examples of
invisible classes." which seems to create part of the problem in
differentiation.  While this is information, where to go with it from
here, what to bring forth?

For me, its about victimization and restigmatization of individuals.
When a recent stat suggests that the poverty of women who are single
parents, even if they lived and combined income with the child's father,
in two thirds of the cases would still be below the poverty line,
unchanged, the question becomes one of marketing. In the duration of
flipping the societal coin of answer towards one or the other issue, the
solution is unfounded and yet is marketed as one.

Literacy was always bound up in what people want and now that they have
been told they can have what they want, at any time, they want it. The
wanting is the hardest part. And yet, apparently editors, through their
marketing methods, reinforce this socio-economic restigmatization. The
question becomes one of method, as Stephen says:

The rhetoric of setting apart also involves that sense of "sacrifice"
meaning "to make sacred" - "sacred - to set apart in honor of".

The way poetry titles are mentioned, for example, Lesbian & Gay, Latino,
Native-American etc. Is this done with honorable intent? Or is it
necessary for publishers to categorize a writer as a method to move
product? It seems the second or else the unthought repetition of what
everyone else is doing. Is there some other effective way, without
labeling, to get things out there? I think there is and marketed Will
Alexander's book as a *poetry title*. Nothing more. No mention of class,
race, photos and so on. Unfortunately division implies opposition to the
thing divided. The quote I brought forth was intended to deal with Will
not Erica Hunt, which is a clarity mistake on my part. One of the ways
Alexander's pages complicates and interrogates the notion of "black
identity;" is by rendering it neuter, a null set, unless a publisher
mentions race as a selling point. The references contained within the
book might give a hint, but no solid backing to an assertion. One might
assume more readily, for example, he is a scientist from the subject
material. As for essentializing the Mullen essay, I doubt it, it is only
3 pages, and almost a fourth appeared in the last quote, unless this has
appeared somewhere else, not mentioned in the Booglite issue. The essay
itself is essentialized by the length perhaps. Questioning the criteria
of cannonization is part of the evaluation, which as mentioned, Aldon
does in Black Chant, gives plenty to discuss, but what about  a further
questioning of publishers' individual marketing methods beyond
anthologies? Are these concepts transferrable? Where does the
differentiation lie?

Be well

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette had this in yesterday's paper:

The country's biggest cash award for poetry, the $100,000 Tanning Prize, was
pocketed by Jackson MacLow earlier this month.

MacLow, 77, has written 26 books, the most recent, "Barnesbook," in 1995.
He's also a painter and performance artist.

----

Like Creeley and the Bollingen recently -- it is so very rare that one of
this awards organizations gets it right that it nearly takes the top of your
head off when it happens. But the Tanning folks, whomever they may be, have
gotten this one right. Even if the Post-Gazette doesn't recognize the space
between Mac and Low.

Congratulations to Jackson for whom such honors are only a few decades
overdue!

Jackson Mac Low Wins 1999 Tanning Prize

$100,000 for Mastery in the Art of Poetry

New York, November 3, 1999--The Academy of American Poets today announced=
 that
Jackson Mac Low has been selected as the recipient of the 1999 Tanning=
 Prize.
The $100,000 award recognizes outstanding and proven mastery in the art of
poetry. The judges for this year's Tanning Prize were Frank Bidart, Robert
Creeley, Sharon Olds, Marjorie Perloff, and John Yau.

Jury chair Robert Creeley writes of Mr. Mac Low's poetry:

"Jackson Mac Low is a poet of great heart and abiding faith. His poetry has
long been recognized as the most defining of American experimentalism, both
with respect to text and to performance. It is the genius of his art to make
poetry again enactment, to make its materials=97words and syntax, and all=
 the
human echoes each must carry=97a resonating, perceptive pattern reaching far
beyond the enclosure of imagined subjects or intent. Patient, enduring,
selfless, he has made substance of our language in ways that reveal its own
initiating authority, proving its sounds a song, its progress a transforming
revelation.

Commenting on the jury process of this year's Tanning Prize, Creeley=
 reports,

The poets our jury considered were a significant range from all character of
background and practice, professional commitment and cultural circumstance.=
 It
is the great virtue of our country's poetry that it is plural, poetries,
rather
than an abiding, singular hierarchy or one settled condition of practice. In
awarding the prize to Jackson Mac Low, we sought to honor not only a great
master of the art in its most inventive and resourceful character, but to
recall also that American poetry itself defines such a tradition as he
exemplifies, fosters insistently the experimental, seeks always to expand=
 the
parameters of its activity and relationships.

Jackson Mac Low was born in Chicago in 1922. He is a poet and composer and a
writer of performance pieces, essays, plays, and radio works. He is also a
painter and multimedia performance artist (often with his wife, Anne=
 Tardos).
Author of twenty-six books, his works have been published in many=
 anthologies
and periodicals and read publicly, exhibited, performed, and broadcast in
North
America, Europe, and New Zealand. Mac Low's recent publications include the
books Bloomsday (1984), French Sonnets (1984, second ed. 1989), The Virginia
Woolf Poems (1985), Eight Drawing-Asymmetries (1985), Representative Works:
1938-1985 (1986), Words and Ends from Ez (1989), Twenties: 100 Poems (1991),
Pieces o' Six: Thirty-Three Poems in Prose (1992), 42 Merzgedichte in=
 Memoriam
Kurt Schwitters (1994), and Barnesbook (1995) and the compact disc (with=
 Anne
Tardos and seven instrumentalists) Open Secrets (1993). Mac Low has taught=
 at
many schools, notably the Naropa Institute, Schule f=FCr Dichtung in Vienna,
Bard
College, and Brown University. His previous awards include fellowships and
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, CAPS (New York State), PEN,
the Guggenheim Foundation and the New York Foundations for the Arts.

The Tanning Prize was established in August 1994 by a gift of $2 million to
the
Academy from the painter Dorothea Tanning. The previous recipients of the
award
are W. S. Merwin, James Tate, Adrienne Rich, and A.R. Ammons.

I'm wondering if you can help me out with some publishing advice.  I've
put together a mss for the Center for Book Art chapbook contest, but doubt
I'll win it...my manuscript involves font size changes, fragments, strange
positions on the page, and other things that I don't think the judges will
neccessarily want.  So I'm wondering if, now that I have this thing
together, there are other contests or publishers of chapbooks (24 pages)
which are more open to experimentalish work.

Thanks,
Arielle

This is certainly in dispute with other who were also present who just
like to argue for the sake of grief or sport.  The eyes have been sewed
shut & neural circuits hard wired to the intimacy of the spoken word,
one shellfish at a time.  Club the language, spawn.

I guess, David, that I'm increasingly wary of hierarchies of "excellence."
Especially ones that are based on geographical and, perhaps?, class
distinctions.

David,

The Harryette Mullen article you refer to in Booglite is but an excerpt
from a longer paper that she read at Poetry as Cultural Critique in
Minnesota. I've lost this conversation somehow so I don't know what is
meant by essentializing it.

Callaloo 22.2 (1999) has an interesting interview with Mullen and
Alexander, an article by Mullen on Alexander, an article by A.L. Nielsen
on Alexander, etc. Also a section on Lorenzo Thomas.

        { p o e t i x }


i remember in some backchannel discussion saying to someone that i thought
that langpo allowed for as much biography of the poet than much of what came
before --- this didnt go over with my corespondent very well who went, as i
recall, the "non-referential" route telling me that much of langpo was
characterized more by it NOT being about anything outside itself --- and,
i'm guessing that autobiography is, like everything else (?) outside this
work for this person

someone reading this is just bubbling to mention _my life_ i know but i'd
like to not mention that

instead i'd like to talk about what i'm interested in with respect to
autobiography, with what my need is in that respect and consequently why i
find say ted greenwald's _word of mouth_, hannah weiner's _clairvoyant
journal_ and steve benson's _blue book_ all tantalizingly rich as
autobiography and even why something like melnick's _pcoet_ isnt
anti-autobiography in any meaningful sense (for me at least)

it goes back to my thinking about mac low's comments about his failure in
the attempt to remove the ego from his poems --- he says something about how
it is always present at some level at some remove and this seems
indisputable to me

and i've read a number of biographies of poet at this point --- not
autobiographies but biographies and they can be pretty interesting tales
i'll admit but i think that an autobiography to be that interesting for me
wd show me, wd give me exempla of the way this person thinks, how they
operate in language etc --- as such it strikes me so far that the two
volumes of the _essential peirce_ tell me more about what i'm interested in
with regard to charles peirce than the biography of him i read did (tho ken
ketner's bio is different in using so much manuscript material and by its
pretense of being and autobiography)

silliman's comments about the why "realism" was in the sub-title of _in the
amer tree_ are to the point here as well --- it seems to me that if we care
about some poet or other it is because of their work, because of their mind
found there

i'm skirting the non-referential thing as i don't find it very interesting
and it seems to assume that we can remove ourselves from the writing which i
don't believe

anyway

Have any of the New Yorkers on the list been around to the NYPL to see the
Creeley collaborations exhibit, "In Company"?  (and apologies if this has
already been discussed -- I was electronically discommoded for a period) --

I've been looking at the book version , which is being distributed by the U
of North Carolina Press -- It's a beautiful volume, and affordable -- nice
CD rom comes with it -- the designers could have been a bit more
imaginative (and who chose that music?!) but the colors float beautifully
onto the screen -- I'd get this book even if I had all the artists' books
it covers -- which, of course, I never could afford -- though I hasten to
add that Creeley and comrades have on occasion ssen fit to produce
art/poetry books that any of us could afford, and I've got those!  The CD
includes photos and correspondence that aren't in the book, and it allows
you to page through reproductions of the art and poetry -- My own favorite
is _A Sight_, with Kitaj.

would much appreciate a report from the scene from any who have in fact
seen it --

Some notes on class:

1.  Upper-class poetics in the US would look a lot like James Merrill:
lots of cultural capital on display, opera, meals of a certain kind.

2.  Middle-class poetics would look like Robert Pinsky. The idea that
poetry is so darn good for us.

3.  A sort of sentimentalized working-class poetics in Philip Levine. He
doesn't write poems about sitting in his office in Fresno, but about being
an auto-worker in Detroit 40 years before. What's sentimental is precisely
the displacement, the idea that actually working on the assemby line is
more authentic.

4.  Is class class origin? In this case if you come from working class you
are always such, even if you end up living the style of another class.  Is
it affiliation or "identity"? Is it where you are now, where you will be,
or where you come from?  If you write in Robert Pinsky middle-brow style,
even if you are working class origins, what is the class of your poetics?

5.  In the interest of full disclosure, I should point out that I have a
middle to upper-middle class, academic background (surprise!). Grandparent
farmers in Mountain states, grandparents, uncles etc...  govt.
bureaucrats, accountants, college professors, etc... Access to cultural
capital is key here. As University professor myself I basically do now
what I have done my whole life: read books, go to bookstores, write and
think about what I've read, talk to others about this, etc... This is my
class existence, and didn't really change much when I didn't have money as
graduate student.

Perhaps to point here is the introd. Bernstein and Andrews wrote
to _The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book_:

        confusion about the nature of this exploration florishes.
        For instance, the idea that writing should (or could) be
        stripped of reference is as bothersome and confusing as
        the assumption that the primary function of words is to
        refer, one-on-one, to an already constructed world of
        "things."  Rather, reference, like the body itself [and
        there, again, is the body, the "plan"], is one of the
        horizons of language. . . .  It is the multiple powers
        and scope of reference (denotative, connotative,
        associational), not writers' refusal or fear of it,
        that threads these essays together.  It is a renewed
        engagement that comes from the recognition that the
        (various) measuring and questioning and composition of
        our references is the practice of our craft.

Or Creeley's lovely: "Poetry is not referential, at least not
importantly
so."

Kristin Prevallet

Tisa Bryant is a San Francisco-based writer and curator.  Her work has
recently appeared in Clamour, Children of the Dream: Our Own Stories of
Growing Up Black in America (Pocket Books), and is forthcoming in the
anthologies Beyond the Frontier and What Is Not Said.  A novel, Letters to
Regret, is forthcoming from Leroy Press.  What is special about her work is
on the one hand, the speculative questioning about location, space,
citizenship--where are we? why are we here and who wants us in this
place?--and on the other hand, a rapturous attention to the disturbing
psychic and sensuous details of everyday life.

Kristin Prevallet returns from Brooklyn to Small Press Traffic, where she
last presented findings of her biographical inquiry into the uncanny life
of the poet Helen Adam.  (Her edition of Adam's selected poems, Fire
Brackled Bones, is forthcoming.)  Now she will read from her own poetry, a
remarkable re-invention of the cut-up/collage form, political and social
readings of ordinary life, torn to shreds by the tender furies of
perception and display.  Everything's grist for Prevallet's mill, the daily
news, the shoes on your feet, the way you look tonight.  Hers is the
mysterious Life that lives under things, as in the current film American
Beauty.  Her books include Perturbation, My Sister (First Intensity Press,
1997), Lead, Glass and Poppy (Primitive Publications, 1997) and Selections
from: The Parasite Poems (Barque Press, 1999).

Subject:      Recent David Lehman book
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Some comments (pp. 10-11) from David Lehman in his recent book The Last
Avant-Garde make me wonder a bit.  Possibly this book has already been
discussed on the list, but I'd like to note a few things he writes:

"The poets of the New York School were avant-garde at a time when that
designation meant something.  They are not the last avant-garde movement
we will ever have.  But at the moment the conditions surrounding art and
literature are anything by favorable to the idea of an avant-garde."

Agree that this is the case?

"The problem has something to do with the decline of the public
intellectual and the corresponding expansion of the purview of academe;
the idea that something can be at once avant-garde and academe would
seem a contradiction in terms."

This could be half-true, I suppose...  It could also be a gross
oversimplification and hasty generalization.  Would certainly consider
most list members who happen to work in academe definitely
avant-garde...  Also, is it pretty easy for Lehman to say this?  Is he,
himself, in academe, and thus having his cake and eating it, too--i.e.,
gets to pronounce who is avant-garde and who gets to be avant-garde and
at the same time does the bulk of his living off of academe
infrastructures.
(Or did I just agree with him, too?)

Quotes Gertrude Stein, who was alive some years ago: "For a long time
everybody refuses and then almost without a pause almost everyone
accepts. . . . In the history of the refused in the arts and literature
the rapidity of the change is always startling."  Then Lehman writes,
"The interval between rejection and acceptance has steadily grown
shorter since Stein wrote those words.  The consequence is that the
avant-garde's incursions into the temple of art have become ritualized
as the predictable gestures of postmodernism."

Well, CPU's get faster every month, and humans may have, too...

Writes, "If we are all postmodernists, we are none of us avant-garde,
for postmodernism is the institutionalization of the avant-garde."

Agree?  He does use some first rate references (Kafka, Stein) to argue
his point.  They're very well known...

"In the second half of the book, I raise the question of whether the
avant-garde as an abstract concept or a practical idea is finished."

Okay, some of this book is about whether there's an avant-garde anymore
or can be.  Haven't gotten that far yet and had bought it to read about
the New School poets, but look forward to the argument.

"It is a question that leads to others, or requires the answer to
others, before it can be settled.  What does (or did) avant-garde mean,
and how did it come to have meaning?  What exactly are the requirements
of an avant-garde art movement?  What lessons do the movements of the
past have to teach us?  The argument against the viability of the
avant-garde today rests on the assumption that there is no real
resistance to the new, no stable norm from which the defiant artist may
depart.  While I find this to be a convincing argument, I would sooner
help to quicken a new avant-garde than pronounce the demise of an old
one."

These are legitimate questions...

I've been trying to control the design, line breaks, of a web page through
all sizes of monitors. I work on a 15" monitor, and when I look it on a 21"
monitor (at a university pod) the font sizes default larger, in order to
ill the screen, the line breaks are thus different, the page, and meaning,
skewed.
Very frustrating!

A few days ago, I was reading (again) Laurent Jenny's essay, "Genetic
Criticism and It's Myths" (Yale French Studies #89, 1996), and came to
realize that controlling the viewing space of one's work is a modernist
conceit, and not what this new medium is promising to writers. I wrote it
into the project's as:

"At first I tried to control this space, as control over one's work is the
pedagogy of non-digital art. In the process, I began to appreciate that the
digital canvas is an apparitional landscape, a phantasm of fluid patterns,
somewhat like the walls of Paleolithic caves. So that within the praxis of
the words and images I am gestating, it is the viewer--in this case by
increasing or decreasing font size (View)--, not the writer, who has the
final tools of alterity."


Several strategies are being used by net.artists to allow the viewer to
participate in the creative process. Here a lack of technical means lead to
the giving over of control. Perhaps in the future I can rectify this. But,
in a nascent medium, the learning of whose tools, always upgrading, can be
prohibitively time-consuming and daunting, is the lack of ultimate control
an opportunity toward abstraction?

This lack of control seems built into the system. For example, one can
download copyrighted photographs, and alter them. The same with texts. I do
both, careful to cite. Not out of a lack of respect for the artists, but
from a faith in which we are all creating, and have been for millennia, one
big work of Human Art: adding, subtracting, continuously changing, letting
go.

Aldon Nielsen asked for the good word on the Creeley show at NYPL, so here's
how I wrote-up the opening for Booglit 6: Lowell Celebrates Kerouac ($10ppd.
Booglit 351 W.24th St., Sutie 19E, NYC 10011-1510--see October 4, 1999

Another Opening, Another Show
Creeley collaborations tour stops in NYC

The opening for the New York Public Library’s new exhibit, "In Company:
Robert Creeley’s Collaborations," is a collaboration itself. Everyone in
attendance does a quick art-check, but it is the company that matters. Poets
and literary editors talk outside the gallery where parts of Creeley’s
lifelong artistic unions are glass enclosed. Shift from one collaborator to
the next. René Laubiès to Dan Rice, Fielding Dawson to Robert Indiana to
William Katz, as the decades blur, from 1950s on through the 1970s.
Strange to see poet/artist Bobbie Louise Hawkins on Black Sparrow covers as
"Bobbie Creeley," her art, as she says in the catalog (edited by Amy
Cappellazzo and Elizabeth Licata; University of North Carolina Press, 1999),
"not illustrative of the poems."

A few words on the catalog: The CD-ROM it comes with is alone worth the
$24.95 pricetag. Drop it in and Creeley’s exhibit pops across your monitor,
with art, words, and sounds a mouse click away. Add that shiny package to
the handsome art book—which draws on the show’s visuals and includes essays
by the editors, John Yau, and words from the artistic collaborators—and
you’re in for a joyous multisensory overload you’ll return to forever for
inspiration.

The artist Meg Arthurs, whose collaborators include Allen Ginsberg, Lee Ann
Brown, and Bernadette Mayer, enters the Edna Barnes Solomon Room to see how
Creeley puts it together. Granary Books chieftain Steve Clay tows his little
one around as he talks the room.

Newlywed Alan Gilbert, his new bride/collaborator Kristin Prevallet a few
feet away, talks with Canadian poet Jeff Derksen—"I didn’t realize I still
wear that shirt," he tells me of the photograph I sent him from the first
BoPoFest. Tender Buttons editor Lee Ann Brown films Bernadette Mayer, Phil
Good, and Lewis Warsh by the covered bridge table/temporary bar.

And I give Creeley a quick hello, before I have someone snap our photo, and
the honored guest, off a puddle-jumper from Buffalo, seeks a new drink. But
the bartender’s done collaborating, as the lights flash on and off, and the
security guard turns to Creeley and says, "It’s time to go, we’re closing,
sir."

In Company is on view at the New York Public Library,
Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, Edna Barnes Solomon Room.
It runs through January 13, 2000. Admission is free.
M/Th-Sat: 10:00a.m. to 6:00p.m., Tu-Wed: 11:00a.m.-7:30p.m.
For more information call (212) 869-8089.

Passing thru NY a month ago, I was in the Creeley collabs exhibition at the
NY Public Library  for a couple of hours, alerted to it by my NZ painter
friend Max Gimblett, I was much taken with early photos (Majorca), with ms
letters, e-mail print-outs, & the wide varieties of collaboration in all the
books on display. The early material especially was exciting to see  -- a
long gone chapter, history -- so to speak.  Opened archives, great!
I paused to read the whole of Creeley's ms tribute to John Altoon -- I
vaguely remembered it from print somewhere.
I  liked the look of half-familiar things, glimpsed, or read about
somewhere, : but many I hadnt seen, especially the somewhat luxurious recent
ones
           (Of course, I've got a copy of _The Dogs of Auckland_ with Max's
dog drawings.  _Le Chien d'Auckland, c'est moi!_ says the text.   & fine
printing by Alan Loney).
           It was far too rich for two hours browsing, I wanted/needed ten
days to look at all the things there, read them.  But that's always one of
the effects in that kind of exhibition of  books & mss.   Round the walls
the collection of  old paintings belonging to the library completely failed,
for once, to hold my attention after all the reading, leaning on vitrines.

that Aldon may give you some sense of the show as distinct from the book of
the show          cheers  Tony Green

I'm sure the book has already been discussed here, but I'm glad someone
brought it up again, since I'm just finishing it now and have been very
interested in it...

Not really.  While I understand that a certain kind of imposed limitation,
or a societal narrow-mindedness, might in fact liberate artists, I don't
think America, currently, is so open to work that pushes the boundaries
that it makes it impossible for an avant-garde to exist.  Poetry is still
a marginalized medium, and within poetry, the experimental world is still
very small.  Recent coups such as the Mac Low Tanning thing
notwithstanding, I'd argue that even in most literary/artistic circles,
experimental poetry is still more or less "underground."

And while I do think Lehman's point about the difficulties of being
simultaneously avant-garde and academic is compelling mostly in its
political implications, I think the argument is refuted by his own book:
Kenneth Koch is depicted as Mr. Professor, and the epilogue on the current
state of avant-garde poetry points at the Language School's relationship
to theory.  (Then again, he seems to not like Language stuff much at
all...which is maybe why he argues this way...)

> Writes, "If we are all postmodernists, we are none of us avant-garde,

A really interesting idea, I think.  Although I suspect making innovative
work has much less to do with how you label yourself (or how time labels
you) and much more to do with the actual work...which, despite the
calendar, may in fact be really NEW.

My two cents on the book:  I loved the info on the poets themselves,
thought women got a really raw deal throughout, thought the intro and
concluding essays were far better organized than the biographical chapters
on the poets, which felt haphazard, but it was a page-turner, anyway.

Turning pages,
Arielle

It sometimes feels like exclusionary politics and/or poetics is considered
avant-garde.

Sometimes it feels like people think that to denounce something has to do
with being avant-garde.

I think that generosity is a very avant-garde thing and doesn't get enough
credit.

If Lehman really means this:

Background / Foreground


I was thinking of this first a couple of years ago in relation to objects
and multimedia channels, and then looking at Miekal And's flash work
(which I love) and some of the other URL sites I've posted here - I've
been wondering about the relationship among:

1. Multimedia OBJECTS, and their protocols, codings, animations/visuals/
audios, etc.;
2. The framework of the SCREEN or page, which holds the OBJECTS; and
3. The embedding of the SCREEN within the apparatus of the COMPUTER and
its input devices (keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera, etc.).

It seems to me that emphasis on the first relates to modernism, in the
sense that the background is assumed neutral or irrelevant, and that the
object itself forecloses on its own interiority; that the second relates
to deconstruction, to the extent that the margins and protocols are fore-
grounded as much as the embedded objects (all of this is presuming that
background is visible and somewhat well-defined); and that the third
relates to postmodernism, to the extent that it is also cyborgian, inter-
ior and exterior simultaneously. In any case, I'd like to see a phenomeno-
logy of this issue (which might be related to, say, Sherry Turkle's or
Brenda Laurel's work), somewhere, sometime. It seems to me that emphasiz-
ing the domain or tenor of a site instead of its components (which are
emphasized especially on those webpages, that, say, ask if you have this
or that plugin) is a way of approaching both experiential issues, and
issues of virtuality which rely on encompassing the spectator and her or
his body, in relation to the coding, the writer, the producer, the artist,
the director, etc.

One might consider levels of interaction, moving from the user's body and
its own foregrounding/backgrounding (see Drew Leder, The Absent Body),
through a phenomenology of the lived environment. Change the focus to the
"digital apparatus" itself (in the sense of the "cinematic apparatus") -
to the increasing diversity of displays. From displays, it is a difficult
step to the internal margins of the visual (and are there parallels in
sound as well?) - and the introjections/projections associated with images
and flash and other multimedia components. (As the case may be, extend
this farther to actively responding joysticks, teledildonic apparatus,
etc.) I would be interested in the ways that such introjection and pro-
jections (what I call "jectivity") operates in internal world-building -
where, in other words, is the user, psychologically, in the midst of all
of this. We know that one can easily inhabit the reduced audio-visual
bandwidth of a MOO or MUD, and even a novel; in multimedia, the singular
experience of reading is broken up by mouse-clicks, attention structures
across the screen, and so forth. How does this heterogeneity function in
terms of worlds? How does one move within these spaces, which can often
appear, as the modernist gallery, as an accumulation of objects against
presumably "irrelevant" white walls? Does the white background of the
screen function as such a wall? Does a background color create a different
kind of experience altogether? What is the phenomenology of jectivity in
general, across the various sensory modalities?

The point of all of this is both practical - knowledge of the psychologi-
cal processes that are involved in world-building, from both a design and
a user viewpoint - and theoretical - how do we make sense of _any_ world,
foregrounding and background what we ascertain, for ourselves, are objects
within it? How, in other words, _are worlds inscribed?_ Multimedia pro-
vide profound tools for research here; there's always something behind the
holodeck, waiting to be fished out.

ii Note on forgotten space -

Let us talk about the _forgotten space,_ the space between the object and
the frame, the space neither of containment nor the intensity of edges.
It is this space which shimmers, always present, even if driven to the
suicide of the line as the object fills the frame - it is this space
which is the true screen, never present, an inexplicable absence, were it
to be named. If the dream screen is presumed always to background, this
forgotten space is _neither here nor there,_ but virtual, in the sense of
the virtual particles of the vacuum. Its presence is its annihilation; it
is most likely white or black, perfect absorption, perfection emission. I
place this screen certainly the side of the analytic; it is just as like
ly to exist as a token for the diffused or exhausted, the turbulent. Nei-
ther the matrix out of which the symbolic object arises, nor the symbolic
itself - neither the chorus of indecipherable languages nor the chora it-
self, the forgotten space is always already named, discarded, the origin
of /dev/null to which useless output is ascribed. So to talk about this
space is that which is most natural in the world, since it is the space
of the object's jostling within or among places, spaces, others. One
might say it gives birth to the burden of the proper name, and measurab-
le, it is of no size whatsoever. Before you look at the matrix of media,
look at the forgotten spaces, which make or break inhabitations - and the
more forgotten, the better.

iii forgotten space among the objects and the margins of the screen

framework or the central division which is forgotten
places, not spaces, open elements, line segments somewhat obliterated
the spaces seething granular and seething
in the distance, a line, smooth, clear, boundary
perceptual object = let us say, what the mind tells us
the speaking of the mind through the fog of forgotten space
across the bay, along the floor of the sea, on the side of the valley
nothing wandering inscribes and the trembling of kanji into mist
forgotten space surrounding gotten space
gotten space triumphant, bounded, areas of languages and protocols
what is laying there holding somewhere what is laying there
sheets of assertion, unassigned pixels, useless waves of background color
pooling of background color, spreading around negative shapings, places
just a moment ago, about to me, something, somewhere over there
not forgotten space among the margins of the screen, a space, a screen
not thinking one into places but looking at people
others but not others, people some people
they told me about some places, the they saying, anyone saying
background inscriptions, spreading around negative propositions
places, the perhaps, main() or void, dev/null or some other placings

iv forgotten space

            <objecta>
                                       <littleobjecta>
               \
                \________[coupling]________/         {forgotten space}
                              |
                         <objectb>

A coupling is defined as (a,b,c); if a -> a', then (a,b,c) -> (a',b,c)
as opposed to a linkage in which if a -> a', then (a,b,c) -> (a',b',c').
In forgotten space, objects are combined as couplings or concatenations
without an intrinsic linking. Forgotten space is neither matrix nor con-
tainer/chora; it is the of-jostling, nothing more nor less. Think of the
spacings of multimedia objects.

A coupling in this regard may be considered a generated perceptual group-
ing of relatively well-defined objects. An object is defined as a rupture
or insertion into forgotten space. An object is also a skein of bits and
bytes, ranging from the performative to static files. The former is al-
ways triply encoded; the latter, more often than not doubly encoded. Text-
ual insertions into forgotten space (i.e. ascii text) activate the space,
i.e. it becomes gotten space, the sheet of assertion or subtextual matrix
of structure 'holding' the ascii in place. Movement in dhtml across for-
gotten space is in relation to the screen or object boundaries; the space
itself carries no distinction.

Or perhaps the space, like the phallic masquerade itself, assume identi-
ties, forgetfulness taking on the characteristics of the current diegetic
in relation to the viewer's dialogic - in which case, one might well turn
away in disgust, there's no hope for it. Still, I wouldn't call it a space
of potential, it's there, forgotten, stillborn in relation to the objects
contained - in fact, it's charted, mobilized, for their location in terms
of window percentage (30% vertical say) or pixels (400 horizontal say).

The charting is for them; they're tracked across the forgotten space. Any
landmark is charted as well; there is the forgotten space, and the chart-
ing of the landmarks. And there is nothing else, the forgotten space hard-
ly nomadic, on the verge of presence, neither shifting nor present.

The image is of the gotten space, always of such. Everything is coupled
within the image.

hello all--

i'm trying to get a concrete sense of what is happening to government
funding in the arts.  that is to say, everyone speaks of the "trend" in
arts, the cutbacks in the nea budget, etc.--but what are smaller, non-prof
organizations feeling both by the nea and by state arts orgs in
numbers?  anybody out there head an arts org and have specific examples of
slashes, i.e. how much of a decrease in funding they have received over the
past 10 years or whatever?

particularly, i'm interested in examples of organizations/people who have
had some dealings with the california arts council--or other state arts
councils whose behavior might be akin to the cac (maybe new york?)

or, if you know something about the type of people who sit on the
state/federal arts panels and where to get more info about this, please do
tell.

please backchannel with info, thanks.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

 Reviews
                   From Publisher's Weekly - Publishers Weekly
                   Pan-European ex-pat artist and poet Tardos writes
here
in spliced together bits of Hungarian, German, French and English, but
the
pronunciation keys and other linguistic graphs she includes bespeak
precise
formulation rather than polyglot mish-mash. At its best, Uxudo--a word,
we're told, produced by computer error, and seemingly the only
non-"real"
word here--invites the reader into a world of fraught semantic and
phonologic echoes, an effect furthered by being grafted onto video
stills
(mainly of women at different stages of life) which repeat, along with
the
words, in serial alterations. As visual poems, they resemble French
Lettrism, with their clashing fonts and loose margins, engendering an
endearing, consciousness-like chaos. In one instance, a flurry of equal
signs shows the poet lost in                 equivalences--"quake =
tremblement = Beben = renges"--paradoxically less present in the text
when
giving us its code. Tardos's linguistic isolation is most pronounced
when
she is simply being herself: "Hochgeduld after nine from a fountain/
Gekreuzung vielmehr, which is how it's done/ Neighboryly jolie bete/
Give
it time, haromvaros." The words following this bit, "Afterimage =
Nachbild," as well as much else here, give the work an explicitly
post-WWII
cast, suggesting post-war Germany's and fascist Europe's often obsessive
attempts to find a usable past. Tardos's unique brand of multicultural
pathos reminds us that our most pressing issues of identity and empire
have
been around for many years, and in many guises. (Nov.) Copyright 1999

Subject: avant garde

It is misleading to refer to the avant garde solely in terms of novelty.
This establishes an association with art as commodity which is generally
repudiated by those artists who might be described as avant garde. Novelty
is a creature of time and unreliable, a
bye product of experiment rather than an end. I've occasionally read
critics  who refer, with a discreet jubilance, to early instances of
various poetics,  Concrete poetry is anexample, as though the prior
existence of concrete  texts invalidates the experimental qualities, the
'newness' of 20th Century  engagements.
What is more significant is the 'revolutionary' or oppositional nature of a
text. It's not a poetic example but I can't help thinking of the teachings
of Christ. (Is it relevant to say I am not a Christian and don't believe in
God or gods?). These are ideas which are not new but are frequently
revolutionary - think of Dostoievsky's Grand Inquisitor or, more recently,
the film, Jesus of Montreal - there are some philosophies, aesthetics,
ethical beliefs, which will always challenge hierarchical structures. Of
course, the responses of orthodoxy will vary. I think Marcuse's theory of
repressive tolerance
(this may be out of date, I never hear references to it anymore but, when I
encountered it years ago, it seemed a very persuasive idea) is relevant
here  - protest can be turned into a commodity and look how successfully
this was  done to the protest movements of the '60's. The majority of most
Westerners,  especially those under 40 (here comes a generalization)
associate that  period with sex and drugs and rock 'n roll, then there's
the line (which  annoys the hell out of me) - If you can remember the
'60's, you weren't  there. I think we all here know that's bullshit, but
that's the official  version, the received idea. And what did happen to the
revolution? Well,  civil rights/ feminism/the anti-war lobby/the
environmentalists have all  made some progress but the structures persist,
the marketplace rules, input  into the big decisions (was it ever a
possibility? probably not) is traded  off for the illusory comforts of
'personal freedom' - 'choice a banality in  the supermarket'. Meanwhile, in
the marketplace, the  'novelty' of the avant  garde signals just another
item for sale -or so some would like to think. If the experimental only
referred to technique, this might be so, but when  it refers to ideas or
modes of thought, then it can constitute a challenge  to what Bernstein
accurately terms'official verse culture' and which,  despite various
'local' successes by experimental poets, is still very much  in place. I
doubt the avant garde (only refering
to poetry, I shan't buy into all those other ball games) can have any
political impact in the narrow sense of the word, but it does maintain an
area of opposition and creation, a sense of possibility and risk absent
from  conventional poetries. To say it does not,
and can not, exist is either wishful thinking or a form of cultural
despair,  a loss of faith not only in poetry, but also language, and thus -
us. (This  is where I have to shut up or I'll get really carried away -

    I am struck by Jonathan Mayhew=92s notes on class, and they require more=
=20
than one posting to exhaust. I would first like to refer to his observation=20
on a "sort of sentimentalized working-class poetics in Philip Levine":=20

"He doesn't write poems about sitting in his office in Fresno, but about=20
being an auto worker in Detroit 40 years before. What's sentimental is=20
precisely the displacement, the idea that actually working on the assembly=20
line is more authentic."

   The same day, Pete Spence responds to Maria Zavialov:
"Suddenly I remembered that I should know about working class a lot.
>I was thoroughly drilled in marxism and leninism all through many years of
>school and university back in the 70s in the Soviet Union." M.Z.
>

i'd thought maybe doing a bit o' labour because it was your only option
would be a better sampler than being drilled by theory//pete spence"


    Does Pete have a special knowledge that Maria belongs to the idle reach?=
=20
Or is it implicit in his comment that labor is only labor ("authentic") if i=
t=20
is working class? Is this an example of the "sentimental working-class=20
poetics?"

   Maria=92s comments, I believe, are more complicated than Pete assumes.  T=
hey=20
imply (as her prior observations on "place" do) the point that "working=20
class" is essentially a historical concept, created by Marxism. And in=20
Marxism class is inextricably linked with money. =20

   In earlier periods the language of social stratification has very=20
different connotations. The medieval "chain of being" accepts those division=
s=20
as divine order, without the utopian sense of progress of Marxism. From 17th=
=20
century on the lower classes are the "unruly mob," demonized, conceptionally=
=20
even worse off than before. Neither of the two explicitly connects class to=20
money. Consequently, class is treated as a subset of culture, a culture whic=
h=20
serves the ends of those who already own the money.=20

   How much of our founding fathers=92 idea of democratic government is=20
obsessed with suppressing (controlling, rendering voiceless) the unruly mob=20=
(a
nother phrase for the owners of no property), integrating, how much of the=20
royalist Hobbes as of John Locke? "Speech starts with money": this is a=20
systemic/constitutional fact. Before money (word) there is nothing (chaos,=20
yohu vavohu).=20

=20
   I have problems with the fifth item on Jonathan=92s list:

   "In the interest of full disclosure, I should point out that I have a
middle to upper-middle class, academic background (surprise!). Grandparent
farmers in Mountain states, grandparents, uncles etc...  govt.
bureaucrats, accountants, college professors, etc... Access to cultural
capital is key here. As University professor myself I basically do now
what I have done my whole life: read books, go to bookstores, write and
think about what I've read, talk to others about this, etc... This is my
class existence, and didn't really change much when I didn't have money as
graduate student."

   Jonathan appears to say that class essentially is equivalent to culture i=
n=20
the United States. This is so if class expresses itself in writing only in=20
terms of the class origin of the writer? Then, it is true, as Jonathan notes=
,=20
a contradiction develops when a person moves up the economic scale, which is=
=20
quite possible in the States. But what about class, reflected in terms of wh=
o=20
supports or pays for the written product? Then, Jonathan=92s financial=20
sacrifice as a graduate student is a temporary state, as an intern=92s on th=
e=20
way to becoming a doctor.

    I=92ll take a step further. Suppose one pries poetry loose from the=20
university/teaching system which supported it the last twenty years, and one=
=20
faces the absolute economic non-viability of poetry as an economic product.=20
How does embracing squarely this non-viability affect the nature of a poem?=20=
I=20
believe that the issue of class in poetry is linked directly to it. And poet=
s=20
who integrate this "uselessness" into their work form a class (a kind of=20
unruly mob with no economic interest in the system), regardless of their=20
personal backgrounds or the "material" of their poems for that matter.

   To spell out this idea in more detail is for another day.=20


   I would like to thank Rebecca for her response to my post "virtual=20
democracy." Her eloquent self-definition through a series of negatives is=20
exactly the kind of a poet=92s class consciousness I am talking about: =20

"I cannot attend the poetry events announced here.  My participation is=20
currently limited to reading the list; I haven't posted to the list for a=20
long time.  Experience has made me reticent.  I have not read and will not=20
read many of the works under discussion here. I do not know even one member=20
of the list.  I am unknown; I do not publish. I am not affiliated with an=20

FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
Deadline 1 December 1999

Incubation: A trAce International Conference about Writing and the Internet
10-12 July 2000
The Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, UK
http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/

Keynote Speakers: Teri Hoskin, Geoff Ryman and Gregory Ulmer

The trAce Online Writing Community connects more than a thousand writers and readers in over 60 countries. Together we have built a vibrant and energetic online culture where text is always the focus. This conference offers the chance to meet in a physical space to talk about the nature of writing and reading on the internet today. We invite papers which debate, discuss or demonstrate any of the following:

TEXT : NARRATIVE : INVENTION
The web is home to a huge variety of narrative forms: fictions using a traditional narrative structure within the framework of hypertext; works operating across literary genres; ficto-criticisms which consider the medium directly; poetic writings that seek to dishevel the structure of language; pidgin languages and texts; the blurring of image/word/sound so that the very design itself becomes the writing; and the liberation from the alphabet.
But what does all this mean to the traditional print author or reader? And how do both the mode of distribution and the corporate-owned formats affect content and style? This theme examines the discovery and invention of new literary forms and theories, and the re-emergence, online, of textual experimentation predating the internet. It seeks to contextualise online literary production and features some of the breakthrough online projects that are helping to shape the early history of writing online. We invite authors, readers and critics to explore their engagement with the internet and to look at the ways in which text has evolved online.


TEXT : COMMUNITY : CREATIVITY
The internet has offered us the chance to connect with people around the world in ways we could never have imagined. What effect is this having on creativity and artistic collaboration, including the notion of lone author as individual genius? Society takes on a different complexity when the identities of its members may be multiple, collective, or fragmented. How do we build and administer our online communities? And what happens when so many nationalities, cultures and languages intersect? This is a good moment to consider what it is to be human and how we are engaging with technology in ways we have never done before. The flux of the net challenges our assumptions about identity, self, nature, language, nation, time and space and disrupts the ways in which we construct meaning. How are writers responding to new experiences of online community, creativity, spirituality, and the body?

TEXT : PUBLISHING : OWNERSHIP
Publishers just don't seem to know what to do with hypertext. Contemporary notions of authorship and ownership are being reconfigured by the advent of new technologies like the Internet. How are both mainstream and radical publishing responding to notions of copyright, public domain, and copyleftism? And where do new forms of work fit in? Is the book really dead? Will networking and collaborative authoring transform the literary into something else? Is it true that online writing communities and web.narrative projects are being embraced by media and art institutions but ignored by print publishers? There are many burning practical questions to be addressed. Are online works Read-Only consumer products? How does the public own/appropriate an online work? How would you present a web narrative project without a computer? Which form would you use? And how would you sell your online work?

ABSTRACTS SHOULD BE 300 WORDS MAXIMUM
DEADLINE DECEMBER 1 1999

Well, I dont know. I just reread Bromige's _My Poetry_ in the very regional
South Okanagan Valley, and it was as sharp as always. Except for the piece
about the gnu.

This could use some explanation. Does not excellence imply hierarchy?

THE ANNUAL GEORGE OPPEN MEMORIAL LECTURE
ON TWENTIETH CENTURY POETICS

Presented by STEPHEN COPE

Thursday December 2, 7:30 pm
at The Unitarian Center, 1187 Franklin at Geary
San Francisco

Poet Stephen Cope, of UC San Diego, is currently working on a book-length
edition of George Oppen's WORKING PAPERS, a selection of which appeared
recently in The Germ, No. 3 (quoted above).  Fascinating material, Oppen's
as yet unpublished writings in the form of his "Day Books" or "Working
Papers" greatly exceeds in volume his published work, including the
Collected Poems and Selected Letters.  Stephen Cope's work on editing and
presenting these unpublished writings promises to be a revelation for
anyone interested in the drift of poetics in the latter half of the
century, and George Oppen's extraordinary contribution to the thinking
of--and thinking by means of--poetry in our time.

Cold water flats---but i think that of all those who committ'd suicide
in the 16 century, none killed themselves because there was no such
things as hot running water in the world.

Diction. the distinction is in the words I do not use, more than in the
words I do use. I use the words for large and for small often. Because
scale is important, just because it is subjective.

 although i am continuously enjoying the
postings, i have not yet contributed to the list. Before i do that,  i
feel, i must introduce myself to the community of poets or to the species,
i think, i  belong to- my name is Homraj Acharya and i am a poet from a
country called Nepal which is a squash between two big boulders: China and
India. Currently i leave in Boulder. i am here as a student for about
little more than two years. And don't know many members of the same
species.
        Joe Amato is the only person I know from this list. But,
certainly, I have heard and have read works of few others from the
UB Poetics discussion group. Anyway, lets get to the point: I am
interested in knowing more about post-structuralism theory, especially
materials written on the subject after 90s and its contemporary critics,
however, not being a tudent of English literature, I found some
difficulties locating good
materials on this particular issue.
        I would really appreciate if anyone of you gave me some helpful
suggestions and some useful bibliographic references, and if the
materials are on poetry that would be the best. back
channel please.

Happy thanx giving,
Homraj (Hom)

And here we are, back from our Thanksgiving "vacations." While extended
conversation with extended family members does indeed burn a few
calories, we're definitely ready to burn off the several hundred more we
ingested with the exciting readings happening here this week,

including tonight, Monday, Nov. 29th at 8 pm

Douglas Goetsch & Jacqueline Waters

Goetsch's first full-length collection, Nobody's Hell, was published this
year by Hanging Loose Press (copies will be available at the reading).
Waters, an intrepid workshop student at the Project, has had work
published or forthcoming in the Brooklyn Review, Poetry New York, and The
Germ.

Wednesday, Dec. 1 at 8 pm

Michael Gottlieb & Jen Robinson

Gottlieb's most recent books are Gorgeous Plunge (Roof Books) and More
Than All, a collaboration with Ted Greenwald. Robinson is the curator of
the Poet's Web at the Internet Cafe in NYC and the author of For Conifer
Fanatics.

and

Friday, Dec. 3rd at 10:30 pm

Lydia Lunch & Nicole Blackman

Lydia Lunch began her career at age 16 as a guitarist and singer for the
"no-wave" band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks. Since then, her many projects
have included starring in films by underground director Richard Kern;
musical collaborations with Nick Cave, the Birthday Party, Kim Gordon,
Thurston Moore and many others; and the formation of her own production
company, Widowspeak Productions. This is a rare chance to see this rebel
multigenre artist read at the Poetry Project.

"High priestess of slam, industrial glitterbomb, word uberbabe" Nicole
Blackman is reading to celebrate the publication of her first full-length
collection of poetry, Blood Sugar (Incommunicado Press). Blackman is the

Dear Christopher Alexander,
   I curate "Temporary Contemporary," a series of monthly, solo exhibits at
Cheekwood Museum of Art that feature artists from or currently living in
the Southeast.  Some of the artists we've featured thus far are: Robert
Ryman, William Eggleston, Coleman Coker, Elliott Puckette and Donald
Sultan...we've also featured talented, lesser known artists from the region
such as Brad Thomas, Andrew Saftel, Chris Verene and Carrie McGee.
   One type of exhibit I have yet to do, but am very interested in, would
feature an artist from (or currently living in) the Southeast whose
emphasis in their visual art is poetry/text (or the emphasis in their
poetry is visual).  I would also be open to installation-style work which
includes visuals in conjunction with an audio or video spoken word
component.  Lisa Jarnot suggested this site as a place to post my inquiry.
   Essentially people who would be interested in being considered for our
Temporary Contemporary series need to send 10-20 slides of their most
recent work (if their work is installation with video or audio, I'd like a
video or audio tape also) along with a resume/C.V. to my attention (Terri
Smith) at Cheekwood Museum of Art, 1200 Forrest Park Dr., Nashville, TN
37205.  If anyone has questions or needs more information, they can e-mail
me at terris@cheekwood.org
   FYI -- The gallery space is in one of Cheekwood's contemporary art
galleries.  The gallery is 90 running feet with 70 feet of useable wall
space.  For more information about Cheekwood's activities regarding
contemporary art, people can check out our web site cheekwood.org. -- this
should give artists/writers an idea of the context in which their work
would be shown if they were chosen to exhibit.

Thank you for your help with this project.  If you could e-mail back to
confirm you received this request, I would greatly appreciate it.  Please
also feel free to reply if any of this needs clarifying.

Best wishes,
Terri Smith

Good point. I don't think class is only equivalent to level of culture,
but it clearly is not equivalent to the amount of money one has at a given
moment either. I see is more as an underlying ethos defining preferences
in large number of areas, including aesthetic. And people in academia use
class to mean class origin, otherwise it would not make sense to speak of
class differences at all since we are all doing the same thing for a
living.

Who supports and pays for poetry? Good question that I hope will provoke
lively discussion...

George,& other Listmates,

I take Tom's phrase "hierarchies of 'excellence'" to mean hierarchies
based, as if they were objective, on inescapably subjective judgements as
to what is excellent.

He is correct to be wary of the term 'excellence.' For e.g., when the
Trustees want to purge a college of its troublesome professors, they hire a
PreZ who will in the name of excellence roust these malcontents, many of
whom are excellent teachers.

Or all of whom are excellent teachers, in this best of all possible worlds,
Dr Pangloss. (Although, hmm, that was the name of the PreZ).

Still, while Ron "The Sheep are on Fire" Silliman appears to favor the
inclusion of any blip on the screen in his fractal relief map of the
poem**, and while I am one of RS's greatest fans, I dont think that a
volume made up of sentences from _Ketjak_ printed each as a separate poem,
and lineated rather randomly, would have held the interest of many of us.
Truly, RS had an excellent idea. And argued cogently for its excellence,
appealing across class-lines for its reception as such.

** [I am notorious for my reading-in, of course. Maybe Ron had no such
intention in adopting my term of contempt as if it might be honorific, to
him. What argues against this being his intention is his enjoyment of my
parodic invention, Jay Gutz, whose loathsome effusions Mrs Gutz, Jay's mom,
probably loved. But this is divisive, middle-class thinking on my part,
which I learned at privileged institutions I was canny enough to talk my
ways into. On acid, it was a whole new cosmos. I spent hours writing the
Secret of the Universe on a chalkboard, but next day, all it said was
"Evidence." ]

Tom Beckett thought well enough of RS's work to devote an issue of his
journal _The Difficulties_ to it. Those writing about it did not speak as a
wo/man to the effectiveness in the factory and in the farm fields of these
poems (though such an argument could certainly be made).

It is time, perhaps, that I, Serenus Zeitblom, introduced my class-y self.
I was
corrupted by literature at an early age by a father who had a Jones for
Dickens. Subsequently entering my judgment as to who or what is stupid or
excellent have been standards derived from my reading. Possibly I ought to
regret the unjust advantages I, child of the working class, was to derive
from the largely middle- and upper-class-scripted books I consumed before
the advent of tv. I don't know, I guess I'll go ask Adrian Leverk=A8uhn.

"The dreadful slowness of things," groaned Matthew Arnold.(Or was it
"terrible"?)  Here's a poem that falls into the category "The Sheep are on
=46ire" for the delectation of the roisterous democrat estheticians among
you. (I personally am left of socialism. Perhaps I expect too much of my
fellow-persons.) I shall post one of these a week until the last
Regionalist Unhierarchic among ye, be sated and cry "Enough!"

a message from the past:   a message from the past:

P:: for this is the furthermost point of my advance, through and into your
time, the time of this mailing, before i return to the tenth century. oh,
it has always been assumed that time travel goes from present to past,
present to future, and return again, but i am writing to inform you that
there are those of us who prefer living in the past, and on occasion
venturing to a future already past for those living in the present: this
is the safest existence possible, and i am breaking our tradition by
informing you, here, and now, of this exigency. for we live safely in a
world still populated by numerous plants and animals you have driven to
extinction, not to mention numerous ethnic groups which you have violated,
eliminated, torn from their native lands, destroyed in every conceivable
fashion. our world is still whole, and as long as we move back and forth
within it, never venturing beyond, let us say, the date and time of this
missive itself, we shall be ensured of permanent domicile, even with the
threat of your nuclear war bringing everything to a halt. P:: in the
meantime, what is it i wish to say to you? nothing, but a greeting; there
is no way to respond, no place of residence within which you may find me.
or rather, you might trace one or another life across cities, nations,
continents; such a life may or may not cross my own, but at least, if you
return to the tenth century, you will be far closer than you are at this
very moment. perhaps if i told you my name? it would mean nothing to you
of course, although you may call me saki. of course there are many such,
and there is no guarantee that this word is properly transliterated, and
among us, transliteration is all that exists. so you may think of me as
this text, ignoring the consciousness from the past, roaming among lands
and centuries, that has produced it. nonetheless, i do call the tenth
century my home; i have so many friends there, and the comforting ring of
familiarity continues eternally. P:: of course you may, there is always a
kindness in that.

seems to me that the last thing you should support is his being a poet tell
him to go out to work what is this thing that poets somehow just buzz around

maybe maria could have worded it better ,still think i probably seen closer
views of working class than a lot, my father a socialist was under the
threat of the "crimes act' here for years and i remember him being
interviewed on t.v. knowing he would probably be arrested when he left the
studio could go on but!!! sentiment/sediment/saidund meant//pete spence

Brent asked, during the thread on regionalism, if anyone had any thoughts
on community.

Yes, frankly, I think writing is a communal act by definition, and
extended, I think writing (especially performing) poetry is more obviously
communal. However, I have yet to find anything in the modern world
resembling community as it seems to occur in the ancient world. I'm also
thinking of present-day (not modern) communities like those studied by the
anthropologists. The sense of alienation I experience is precisely the
lack of community. It's pretty damned ironic that we gregarious animals
become more and more socially disconnected as our technology increases the
speed of transportation and communication, but I guess our capability for
adaptation results in some kind of tolerance for this condition,
intolerable as it will eventually present itself to be.

So for me, to some extent, poetry is a social act; the act of an alien
seeking community, even if only the mythical community of Elysium.

Quite a few people on this list have read at SVP - Mike Heller, David
Bromige, Anselm Hollo in the last few weeks - or visited it.

SVP has been at its Sandland St venue for so long, you might be forgiven for
thinking that we own the venue...

BUT

Sub Voicive Poetry has moved to a new venue where it is hoped the readings
will take place for at least one season. Maybe for the next 10 years.

There will be no more readings at 3 Cups

The venue is:

Upstairs,
Churchill's
59 Mount Pleasant
London WC1X 0AE

The first reading at the new venue will be on 7th December 1999, Alan Halsey
and Gavin Selerie. 8 p.m. for 8.15 p.m.

Mount Pleasant is not that far from the old venue and easy enough to find.
Anyone who needs it or may need it, please ask me for instructions on how to
get there

     jobs in the new millennium by studying math & science.  The
     poetry contest is divided into categories for Grades 1-3,
     Grades 4-6, & Grades 7-8.  The deadline is January 31, 2000.
     Regional & national winners for each grade category will be
     announced in March.  Winning poems will be published in the
     Garrett A. Morgan Technology & Transportation Futures Program
     website & in the program's quarterly newsletter.  Winners will
     be selected based on best presentation of the theme,
     originality, & artistic interpretation.  Contest guidelines &
     additional information are at: http://www.dot.gov/edu/poetry/

Trying to keep up with the list recently, but falling behind every now and
again. I'll try to keep this as noninflammatory as possible.

The question of class in poetry -- whether it be from the outside (people
questioning the class origins of various poets or poetic movements) or the
inside (poets wondering about their own authenticity w/r/t class) -- is,
more often that not, a question designed to avoid the much more
problematic issue of race.

Indeed, in the wider world, nobody really *cares* about a writer's class
in isolation from his race. When was the last time Byron was attacked for
being from the lesire/upper/aristocratic class? Much, much longer ago than
he was for being white. Similarly, the "lower class authenticity" carries
little weight when the author is white, as can be checked by looking over
the class backgrounds of some of the canonized. Not that this is a bad
thing, in my opinion.

I don't want to touch the issue of race more than to point out that the
debate here seems to be interesting in as much as it is about things
internal to a writer's poetics. Sociologically, politically, the
examination of class in poetry is a blind for (mainly white) critics who
want to distract attention from the issue of race. But when we ask about a
writer's relation to class -- his/her own, or another's -- *in poetry*,
aesthetically, we start asking very interesting and *neat* questions that
for me circle around (who else but) Marx and, in particular, the idea of
alienation.

Contrary to the faulty listing in the Chronicle this past Sunday, the true
location for Stephen Cope's George Oppen Memorial Lecture this Thursday Dec
2 will be, as announced, at the Unitarian Center & NOT at the Poetry Center.

Also, a couple people out there have expressed the desire to move
themselves from a 6:00 reading by Renee Gladman & Pamela Lu at Center for
the Arts on Mission Street up to Mr Cope's lecture on Franklin & Geary.
There will be some air around the 7:30 starting time-- the latter event
will likely start, as per poetry practice, at 7:47......see you there if
you can make it.

which puts me in mind of the closing section of Antin's "What It Means To
Be Avant Garde" (with apologies to David for typing over his typography):

nothing within the horizon of my discourse could have prepared me for that
moment with my aunt fanny    who had just lost the husband she'd lived with
for over forty years and was now on the telephone       and it seems to be
that if you cant respond to that youre not in the avant garde



[by the way -- does anybody have the book at hand?  is that "seems to be" a
typo for "seems to me"?  I'm taking this from C. Beach's reprint in his
anthology]
