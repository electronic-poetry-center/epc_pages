(NB - for any of you who are bored or annoyed with my reading reports from
Naropa, I can only say - I'm beginning to feel the same way too! This will
probably be the last...)

Last Saturday under the Naropa Big Top poet/playwright/impresario
extraordinaire Kevin Killian presented his workshop class production of
"Daily Life: The Crime of the Century." This was my first experience of
contemporary innovative poetic drama and I found it thoroughly delightful. I
fear the spirit of the play and its general air of festive hilarity, vocal
innovation and poetic ingenuity won't translate into a thumbnail post.  All
I can say is: you should been here!

Though largely episodic in nature, the play's main storyline revolved around
an alleged poetry attack - by a man or a woman ("there's no gender parity
among the poetry deprived") - who broke into a Boulder home to interrupt a
man watching the "blue light of TV" by reciting poetry. "Boulder - such a
quiet town.  I never thought anything like  p o e t r y  could happen to
me!" But, as one character observed: "we're all characters in a strange
police drama." The clever and _very funny_ blend of Ramsey case parody and
poetic riffing/hijinks made for an hour and a half of enthralled bemusement
and hearty laughter.

A few random lines from no scenes in particular:

"Alas, in Hell we're outside the juridical belt of TV or even Kodak."

"What is that specious quality that makes us locate yesterday just around
the corner?"

"Meaning is one slippery motherfucker - either way someone gets hurt."

Kevin appeared for the finale with chorus, produced a silk scarf from his
pocket, and launched into a bang-on version of Anne Waldman complete with
gesticulating flourishes.  Kudos to the maestro and his wonderful cast and
crew.

Fellow-listlings, yesterday, bowering then tal following bowering,
discussed one of "my" sentences that in fact, as he posted to point out,
had been from mark weiss; today, henry attributes to me the origin of the
masturbatory metaphor, whereas in fact I was picking it up from tal's
response to my original conjecture re construction of poet i.d. For those
of you who still find, under the conditions of its being waged, this

Folks:

Told everyone I was leaving for a while, but still here. I sent
in my "unsub" command, received the confirmation that I was "now
removed," and came up today to find about ninety messages! Now I'm
told by Poetics that I'm subscribed under a "different address"
through my server. It is sure difficult to free oneself from the pull
of this list.

But among those many messages I wasn't expecting to find is one by
Dan Bouchard, wherein the claim is made that I was playing a
"self-promotional card" by forwarding a "private letter" from Eliot
Weinberger to two lists where there was much discussion about the
Beneath a Single Moon anthology. I and "others" only prove the point,
Daniel adds with intended irony and in paraphrase of EW, that "the
Left historically bickers ad nauseum while the Right triumphs."

Well, how could I not re-sub, if only for today, to offer one last
bickering reply?

So now geez, Dan, and c'mon. Why in such a political pucker?
Weinberger, in generous spirit, sent the letter with a note inviting
me to send it on, if I wished, to both Poetics and CAP-l. He sent the
post and offered permission to forward it without my even asking, and
I did so because his points were typically interesting and very
relevant to the ongoing discussion. Others later wrote in that they
appreciated his remarks, and I received a few back-channel notes
thanking me for the forward. Therefore, hey, tranquilo, camarada.

Still, that's just to clarify this particular instance, not to say
that I'm beyond being self-promoting and self-serving! And when I
come back, you can all bet that I'll be sending in as many
self-serving posts as I can muster. That is, if my
"address-switching" server is serving my self as it should be.

Patria libre o morir,
Kent

Both Kim Dawn & David Bromige responded with playful "ad hominem" sexual
innuendo.  That's the common denominator.  Most on the list probably don't
remember the exact occasion anyway & it's a useless spent debate but I
thought I'd try to have the last word anyway hah hah...

Pre-Hitler & Hitler Germany, what do I know, I don't have a background in it,
but my take on it is that one was expression and one was repression but that
for both it was a "topic". Sexuality as topic produces a lot of books now,
that's the similarity I see; as if words & theories will provide a relief
from actuality, or a countering.  I understand it's a fruitful area for
speculation.  Dante thought about it too, didn't he?  Words are offered
up to Venus Genetrix & Beatrice.  But I guess Dante recognized his poetry
was an image of reality, not a prescription. That's why he ended in baby talk.

I'm trying to shock without offending, but that's impossible either way.

There is no common audience because speaking for the U.S. the nation has
experienced cultural divide (a learning process) since the end of WW 2.
I'm not saying the divisions weren't there before in actuality - I mean
specifically CULTURAL divide. Discontinuity comes home, the chickens,
Reagan's thespian chickens, come home to roost.  & poets talk to each other
about their differences instead of composing correlations for an audience.
This is the list speaking, nor of one man.  Sigismundo Fascismo fecit,
sleep tight verbo-hobos...continuity...blah blah...

Dr. Tal--

Now, this is interesting. I guess we live in really different countries, or
worlds or something.
You said:

>I experienced your decision to label me "Ms." in your previous post as both
>distancing and patronizing.

Now, why would that be? As far as I recall, I was not doing any labelling.
I was not labelling, but addressing, in a fashion that, in my country,
shows respect for an often-stated desire by women (I hope that word is
okay; it is a good word up here) not to be a "Mr' with an "s" added, and
not to be "Miss." It is definitely not patronizing, but quite the opposite
here. On the other hand, as I said earlier, to use "Dr." is usually meant
to be distancing, and often sarcastic. But as you don't use it that way
there, I feel that it is all right (though it still makes me uncomfortable)
to address you that way.


>("Ms." is used snidely as often as it is used respectfully)

Again, I am not familiar with that usage. Perhaps it is a regional thing.

>  Two rules of civility I try always to observe:  don't
>call people outta their names; don't insult their parents.

This sounds interesting. I dont understand the expression. Well, I live on
the west coast of Canada, and you live somewhere in the US. I feel as if I
_sort of_ get it, but would really like to get it right.


>
>The "Ivy League" presumption is, in fact, hilarious.

I didnt mean to be presuming. I thought I was just asking. I cant figure
out what I did to get called names so much.

Subject:      identity and list capital (long)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

i want to try to consider the discussions of identity here under what
pierre bourdieu has called symbolic capital, within the specific field of
cultural production that is this list.  nothing in what i write shd be
misconstrued as a personal attack, hence i try to refer not to persons on
the list but their words/posts and the symbolic capital (for convenience
think "presumed worth" to the list, hence "list capital") they carry.

dodie bellamy wrote:
<<And I am not here going to defend myself against charges of misogeny and
staunchly maintaining the status quo of female suppression.  My whole
project has been working against this.  I feel KTan's doing a similar thing
to what I found particularly problematic in Kim Dawn's original
posts--she's pressure one to stand up and defend one's LIBERALNESS.
Liberalness is a bourgeois invention.  Perhaps one cannot be radical and
bourgeois at the same time.  I think even Kim Dawn, at this point, is tired
of the discussion of her eruption into this list.  As a performance it
would have been more palatable if she didn't begin it by attacking a list
member who is a friend of mine.>>

the words i wish to focus in on here are "palatable" and "attacking."
the first essentially -- metaphorically and literally -- has to do with
taste.  dodie b found kim's original posts, simply put, distasteful --
a reaction, an interpretation, indeed heightened by the fact that db
perceived those posts as personally attacking her friend jay.  as a
performance, kim's posts were certainly open, on the immediate surface, to
such an interpretation -- tho i'm sure this was not their intent.

but from there, it didn't take long for db's posts to do exactly the same
thing to kd (a list member who is a friend of mine) that db perceived kd
doing to jay, only at a much deeper level of what i will call rhetorical
violence.  kim's posts played, perhaps too roughly, with jay's sense of
list decorum/tedium; db's posts didn't simply play with or question but
dismissed outright the legitimacy of kim's position as a writing subject,
and not just on the list but tout court: in essence, attempted to strip
her writing of any and all list capital.

we have thus moved from mere palatability -- i don't like it -- to
validity and judgment -- it is not valid writing, the position of this
writing-subject is unacceptable, it/he/she has no value/worth.  witness
the judgment contained in daniel bouchard's post:

>Kim Dawn's posts, on the other hand, were 1) pretty obnoxious, 2) pretty
>stupid, and 3) pretty obnoxious and pretty stupid. Am I undermining her
>"authority" or "femininity" by saying so?

undermining authority, delegitimizing writing and a position-taking within
a specific field of production, yes.

kali tal writes, helping my point:
<<The above statements are matters of opinion, and quite loaded opinion at
that.  You say them as if they are self-evident, and create a situation in
which you frame everyone who does not agree with you as also "stupid" (for
not recognizing stupidity) and possibly "obnoxious.">>

or, attempting to effect a shift in list capital: kd's writing is stupid
and youd be stupid to put your stock or recognition into it.  kt
continues:

<<The "undermining" I refer to is a result of tactics which seek to
dismiss arguments or artworks based on the idea that certain people are
not *worth* listening to for [insert_your_reason_here].>>

kt is describing what i'm calling list capital.  dodie b's posts carry a
lot of authority or symbolic capital on this list: she is known and
respected personally and through her writings by many listmembers.  kd
does not and is not, we don't know her authorial intentions, all we have
is her writing, which, if we buy into the field as it's being staked, has
no worth. kt describes the dynamics of list capital when she writes:

<<Whatever an author's *intentions*, it is the words on the screen that
readers see.  Those who know Bellamy can add their deeper understanding to
the interpretation of her words, but those who don't are forced to work
with the texts at hand.  This is, perhaps, another illustration that
identity *matters*.>>

though, i wd argue, substitute kt's "identity" for list capital.  and the
relative shares of it possessed by db's and kd's posts.

bourdieu would argue further that the rules of the game in a field of
production are such that those who posessess symbolic capital set the
rules of the game, namely maintaining their domination of the field and
their accumulation of symbolic capital; likewise those who don't have the
capital are always trying to take a position in the field that will earn
them recognition and capital and the overthrow of the dominants.  i do not
think this extent of bourdieu's model applies here: makes the people
behind the posts too ruthlessly darwinistic, which i don't think is the
case.

but the movement of list capital and position-takings in this electronic
field of production always involves risks, as kt points out:

<<"Being read" is the risk that writers take and--one assumes--the goal
for which they strive.  *How* a reader reads is out of the author's
control, though understanding how (different) readers read might provide
one a certain amount of useful information.  At least that's how I
see/read it.>>

perhaps kd's initial posts consituted a high-risk position-taking in this
list field.  still, understanding how readers read and writers write here
amounts, moreso, i believe, than any capital, to the most important rule
of the game and the reason why we are all subscribed.

That (or those) are great questions--though I don't know how
seriously to take you here.  Art is to hide art?  But it never does,
does it?
Maybe in my post about an epithalamium--trying to make it
"reader-friendly"--I implied that I didn't think poems ought
necessarily  to be
"reader friendly," though I don't myself buy into that.  It is simply
that there are different kinds of friendliness(es) and different
kinds of readers.

I confess that in my post I revealed my own  distrust of
readers--and I think that comes from having been in a writing
workshop.  The only word I can think of here is "oy" (my mother's
word)  but there are
others.  And back to the question about audiences:  I used to worry that the
poems I wrote were too layered and subjective, and I remember
on the first day of a
workshop with Alice Fulton, she asked us what we thought our
weaknesses were as poets, or what we wanted to work on, and I said I
wanted my poems to be simpler, and she said, "why would you want
that?"  (I was even more naive then than I am now, of course.)  So I
stopped trying to write poems that everyone could swallow really
easily  (the kind sometimes favored by workshop participants), a kind
which I could never write in the first place.
Also, I'd been reading a lot of theory and poems started reflecting
that in ways that not all workshop participants could see --also, I got interested
 in writing from a position (subjectivity) that was
not "universal" (or pre-determined/defined), in part a reaction
to the inherent pressures of a writing workshop, and the writing workshop, as
I saw it, reflected a mainstream CW push towards conventionality,
which was not always a reflection of the poets teaching the workshops, but
of the students concurring  en masse within them and commenting on
each other's work.   I found the most interesting poems were poems
that made the group the most fractious.  But I hate talking so
generally, and I don't want to raise the spectre of workshops again.
I guess I am trying to say (to be more discreet and refined about
this) that Thanksgiving isn't my favorite holiday.  First of all,
it's all relative(s).

DW Winnicott said something to the effect that for an artist, the
only urge stronger than the wish to communicate is the wish not to
be found.  Now this is very relevant to me and my life, as a poet
etc., and something I've been thinking about in terms of the
"identity" posts, which point to some wish to"find" the author, on the
part of the reader, and an extension of that, to "fix" the author
in terms of his or her "identity."  (Q:  Does the author need to be
fixed?)  Is identity a supplement?  in that double sense of adding
meaning and/or/also, being simply additional (an excess).

to Karlein van den Beukel and everyone,

Thank you for your posting re flowers. To me your letter felt poetic
(rather than hectic?) and more like what I hope to find in this
correspondence. More of 'human mind' rather than 'human nature' (in
Gertrude Stein's use of these terms).

I'm surprised that those who are arguing about identity seem to ignore her
saying that only while she let go of her identity 'as my little dog knows
me' could she write what she wrote (for that is how masterpieces are
written).

But I prefer not to make that distinction between the writer and the
writing and like to see biographical and factual information becoming parts
of the work (types jones, remembering that this and all postings are parts
of the cyberepic?)

I've not read Zukovsky's poems but am inspired to do so now.

greetings and thanks

jcj



In case you or others do not know them Gertrude Stein's remarks about
identity and 'human mind' and 'human nature' are in 'What are masterpieces
and why are there so few of them?' (in 'Look at me now and here I am'), in
'The geographical history of America', and also elsewhere in her writings.

Two responses today--I'm really quite shocked at myself.   Anyway, I
too thought chartreuse was pinkish until a friend of mine in grad
school bought a vile green VW camper van, and another friend
 referred to it as "chartreuse." I knew she was correct because she
was on a full fellowship.

But here I'm thinking, there must be a link--is it the word "fuschia"
which shares sounds with "chartreuse?"  Or is it a spectral
pinkishness?  Nabokov talks about associating  letters of the
alphabet with colors & sensations when he was a child;  there must be a
cerebral path between sounds and color, sound-waves and frequencies
of light?  (No, it's more likely to be socially constructed.)

And the irony is, I left graduate school because I didn't think I
thought right for it.  But it wasn't merely the chartreuse . . .

Granted.  (And thanks for sending me back to Bourdieu -- I haven't read
him in years).

But are there not situations in which it is legitimate to undermine
authority (or, to use Bourdieu's term, to deprive another of capital)?
To move the frame of reference from Bourdieu to Habermas, one could say
that a true public sphere depends on the ability of participants to
attempt to legitimize and delegitimize.

Leaving aside the argument about Kim Dawn's first posts, I'm sure there
are some positions and speech acts that Tom feels ought to lack
discursive capital, and situations in which he would (in the language of
classical liberalism) present counter-arguments and negative judgements
against such positions or (in the Marxian sociological terms of
Bourdieu) seek to delegitimate the capital of such positions.

So I'm left wondering, Tom: do you object to the whole system, or to a
particular judgement made within the system?   Maybe I lack imagination,
but I find it hard to believe that you would argue against people on the
list offering their judgements of the value of the capital of various
posts, and in so doing modifying the value of that capital.  Do you have
an alternative vision in mind?

First of all Tom, I never said anything like Kim D was worthless, my
launching into her writing was a response to comparing her performance on
this public forum to the novels of Kathy Acker--I was stating that this
space (the p-list) with a captured audience has a totally different
dynamic/literary expectations than the space of a novel, which is a
come-as-you-wish space, a rarified space where various agreements are made.
I still stand by my opinion that writing sexually explicit material to be
TABOO is not necessarily literature--in fact, that intent, is what I think
undermines most attempts at creating quality writing dealing with
sexuality.  Look at _Fear of Flying_, for example, Jong's character's
incessant concerns with others watching her to the point one wonders if
she's experiencing *anything* within the experiences herself.

I appreciate your concern and support of your friend, and I also appreciate
your restrained tone.  I think much of my frustration with KDawn's initial
emergence on the list stems from my larger frustrations with
heterosexuality, its claustrophobic conservativeness regarding sexuality.
I don't know if you are familiar with my work, but my entire project has
been dealing with female sexuality in a squirm-in-your seats manner.  When
I started doing this I was a bit older than Kim, but I received no support
whatsoever from women, scorn from some--and this was the early 80s before
Feminism was totally dead.  All the support I got to develop my interest in
female sexuality (and I have a primary interest in psychoanalytic stuff,
i.e., the primal) came from gay men, and I'm probably lucky in that for in
the gay community there is a vocabulary for dealing with sexuality and an
acceptance of it--or shall I use a theory buzz word and say a "privileging"
of it.

And even though you folks fanticize all this authority and power, to this
day when I read, such as at Naropa recently, while there are people (most
of them in their 20s) who *really* get into it, there are many others
(especially from my own generation) who walk away stiffly and refuse to
look me in the eye.  I don't think this thing is ever going to get easy for
me.

I also would imagine that had Kim Dawn done her performance on the Queer
Studies list (a space where sexuality/theory/literature is regularly
discussed) that it would not have gone down without question.  Some of the
members, I'm sure, would have jumped on her like pirannahs (I guess I
should have picked an image I could spell) for her VIOLENCE.  But here on
the p-list, I'm the one who is accused of violence.  Fortuntely, I always
enjoy it when academics use that word, "violence," it's like this sniper
tactic that puts the opponent to shame.  One always imagines hands thrown
to forehead to ward off the offensive psychological blow (I'm stealing this
gesture from Terry Castle's _The Apparitional Lesbian_).  Avital Ronell is
the queen of using the word violence--I get thrilled everytime she says it.
Too bad she moved to the East Coast.

I think that rehashing Kim Dawn's performances are like beating a dead
horse (no offense Kim, no one here, I'm sure, thinks you're anything like a
dead horse).  Her position on the list, I feel, has been accepted, and the
shock value of her posts has dissipated, I doubt if she ruffles any tail
feathers (I'm into this animal motif) today.  I won't go over your
thoughtful post point by point because there's NO POINT to my doing that--I
just want to add, though, that some of the stuff your calling me on is
K-Tal's interpretation of my posts, not my posts themselves.

For me, *the* question here is why K-Tal continues to attack *the*
person/WOMAN (me) on the list whose whole writing project supports and
illustrates everything she's talking about.  A quick look up my name on
AltaVista will offer many hits, so anybody could find out tons about my
project without moving their butt.  I hope research she does for her
academic books is more careful than what has been exhibited here.

Tom Orange's attempt to apply Pierre Bourdieu's notion of symbolic capital
to this thread [and to the list in general] is an interesting new
development. But I don't think that his effort to sort out the issues quite
succeeds, because in spite of his efforts to be detached and objective, he
has still simply sided with his friend.

For me, knowing absolutely no one personally on this list, it is hard to
justify the claim that Dodie Bellamy is operating "at a much deeper level
of what i will call rhetorical violence" than, say, Kim Dawn. What kind of
"list capital" was left for Jay Schwartz after Kim Dawn's "performance"?

As far as I can see, rhetorical violence was used by both sides, in this
battle for symbolic capital. The question that interests me is to what
extent Bourdieu's terms can help us to clarify the issues that Tom Orange
has raised.

It is interesting to look at this list [or any list] as a "field of
cultural production", with its own "rules of the game", and to observe in
this light the struggle of its members for recognition and domination and
authority [symbolic capital]. It is also puzzling that Tom backs away from
such a model of the list's activities, because it is "too ruthlessly
darwinistic." Why bring it in and then throw it away?

How is authority established, accd to Bourdieu? Well, one thing that he
stresses is the role of relevant institutions in the assertion and
maintenance of power. Now if Dodie Bellamy had said [or implied] something
like "as a professor of English at some Ivy league school, I now declare
you [Kim Dawn] unpalatable and aggressive..." [etc.], that performance
would have gotten its symbolic capital from her institutional authority.
But clearly she did not say or imply any such thing, nor does she have, as
she has said, any such institutional authority.

In my view, that is one of the important and valuable things about this
medium: the imposition of institutional power is very difficult, if not
impossible [let's hope that we can preserve this sort of freedom for this
and any other list]. As far as I can see, the only person who has real
power in this sense is the list owner, who, like some deus otiosus, has not
shown any signs of using it.

Another important idea from Bourdieu is the notion that the performative
utterance is magical. This seems to me to come close to what Tom was
getting at in analyzing Dodie Bellamy's language. Acts of self-assertion,
of naming or labelling [e.g., "you're obnoxious"], of investiture, etc.
etc., are *directly* effective: the mere saying so makes it so. In
Bourdieu's sense [and in mine] that is magic [a very social magic, as
Bourdieu stresses].

I think that Tom is right to suggest that Dodie Bellamy has used this sort
of magic on this list [if that is what he is suggesting]. But surely that
is what *everyone* involved has done [and mostly quite well, I might add].
And though this sort of magic is in no way confined to poetry, certainly
you find it there all the time [though not always, to be sure]....

Sorry for the length of this. Hope it's of use.

        Henry, what is this fascination with things nazi? I must say it
parallels yr ability to re write history, perfectly. Yes, I see, you are
counting on listlings not being able to remember a sequence of events,
which inability gives you carte blanche to re arrange the facts to serve
some purpose of yr own. It makes all the difference in the world whether
the masturbatory imagery began with me or began with Kali Tal. Once the cat
is out of the bag & directed towards oneself, it is not uncivil to yell
"Get yr fucken cat outa my face!" For those of you on a POETICS list, I
assume careful reading is the first order of attention. Henry, why cant you
come right out & admit it : you attrributed the _origin_ of the
masturbatory metaphor to me, whereas in truth it issued from Kali Tal.

And why dont you apologize to the members of this List for stating that
their memories are no better than yours? db

if I misrepresented your posts.  I haven't gone back the archives to check.
My point was that "ad hominem" attacks & insinuations are out of line.
When we write to this discussion, we open ourselves up to criticism,
that's part of the game.  But we all know when an attack gets "personal".
Suddenly we're no longer talking semi-peacefully.  We're

You may be right.  I think our last messages crossed.  Maybe some diligent
person can go dig out the exact quotes.  Here's how I remembered it: Kali
Tal compared - in the abstract - a sort of reader-oriented criticism with
male masturbation fantasies.  I remember being surprised at your reply,
which seemed to "personalize" it - i.e., you said maybe Kali should
look into her OWN responses, etc. The context in which I stated this
was in questioning Kali - I thought she was defending Kim Dawn's public
pornography attack on Jay and slamming your public "innuendo" attack
in which case she was defending/slamming the same thing by different
people.

Anybody still awake out there?  As I say, David, if I've got it wrong,
my apologies.  If Kali started with the "personal", then you've got
a point.  I am sure we will get down to the fine print & bore evryone
to tears.  Meanwhile, you are all great guys & gals out there,
peace & love.  - Henry Gould

Thinking about Henry's recent post which ended with the stipulations that
"& there are very few poets with an idiom that energizes and unites" in
our present moment, and not getting into the off-shoot argument re:
sexuality/masturbation/whatever which I wasn't following, and partially
getting into the idea that an interest in "bio-sexuality" could be the
result of a kind of nostalgic desire for unity (have I got that right?).
So, anyway, my thought: I'm not sure the desire for unity is a very
healthy desire; which is to say, I don't think I want a poet "with an
idiom that unites," at least in any traditional sense, though energizing
might be nice.  Harryette Mullen says in a couple interviews I recently
read that, in *Muse & Drudge* she was trying to allow the poem to function
on enough levels that everybody/anybody might find something of
significance in it, or might find many things of momentary significance
predicated on when, where and with whom they read it.  But anyone who's
read M & D (Mullen's not Pynchon's, and, as an aside, I prefer the former)
would, it seems to me, be reluctant to throw a word like unity around in
describing it.  So, if anything, perhaps its non-unifying means towards
semi-unifying ends, a kind of tactic you might likewise find variously in
Nate Mackey's novels or, to some degree, Paul Beatty's poems.  But all of
them, I'm guessing, would say that the dream of speaking to/for/with/about
everyone is a bunch of malarky (there's no was that's spelled right) -
what's more, it seems the more one indulges that dream the less chance one
has of speaking to anyone beyond one's own tiny group-thinking enclave.
Essentializing selves - selves which speak alot about unity - get pretty
boring, pretty fast, in my(s) experience(s)..I'm reading Henry's comments
as in a similar vein, though perhaps with a more cyclical view of history,
a sense that the youngsters are more inclined than usual to live w/
disunity b/c we're part of the latest Fin de Whatever - which is to say
folks like us come around every hundred years or so.  But, far as I can
tell Unity w/ a capital U is not a term poised for a comeback, and none of
my fellow youner poets - correct me if I'm wrong here guys - are hustling
to shore fragaments against their ruins.

Guys are automatically "Mr." (when they aren't Dr. or Rev. or Col. or whatever).
*Women* are "Mrs.", "Miss," or "Ms."  I've seen very few forms on which
"Mr." or "Ms." is the only alternative.  Often it's a choice, for women,
between "Ms." and "Mrs." (which defeats the purpose of "Ms.", which was to
create an honorific that--like "Mr."--is not dependent upon the matrimonial
state of the female in question).  And frequently, as a female, you have a
choice between all three feminine honorifics.  What this usually means is
you're either married, not married, or (in the minds of many men *and*
women) pissed off.  Whether you intend it or not, calling a woman "Ms." has
the effect of declaring her a certain *kind* of woman--the *kind* of woman
who wants to be called "Ms."  Now, definition of that "kind" varies, but, as
I said, it's as often snide as it is respectful.  In this era of vicious
antifeminist backlash (and what era hasn't been that era?) the term is quite
loaded. Perhaps it is not on the West Coast of Canada, but, overall, I think
it's safer to address women as they sign themselves (which, in my case, is
always "Kali"), or with gender nonspecific honorifics ("Dr."), or, if one is
uncomfortable with that, by last name only ("Tal"), or by full name.

"Don't call me out of my name" is an African-American expression, but it has
a meaning that crosses quite a few cultures.  Many people regard names as
powerful, and *naming* as a great power.  (I'm not talking about being
superstitious or mystical about this, I'm talking about a person's sense of
identity within a particular cultural context.)  The sensitivity about names
is particularly apparent in groups whose names have been imposed upon them
from outside.  African-Americans were named by their masters in the
antebellum period, and after the Civil War the first two things almost all
of them did when they were freed were to 1) go in search of their families;
and 2) change their names.  Women in Western cultures traditionally are
given the patronym at birth, and then *that* is taken away and replaced with
the husband's name at marriage.  Since well before Lucy Stone, American
women have been sensitive to the implications of such horse-trading
gestures.  "Calling someone out of their name" is, quite literally, claiming
the power to make someone be what they are not. Those are fighting words in
many communities, just like insults that begin with, "Yo mama" are fighting
words.  One engages in such behavior only if one *expects* to find oneself
in a signifyin' contest or a rough game of the dozens.

>I didnt mean to be presuming. I thought I was just asking. I cant figure
>out what I did to get called names so much.

I don't *think* I've called you *any* names.  I've commented on texts and
rhetorical strategies, but I don't know you well enough (at all) to call
*you* anything.

Thanks Jay - and others who have backchanneled re: my off the cuff Naropa
reading reports. I plan to attend at least two more readings before the
Summer Program is over - Lorenzo Thomas's this week and Lisa Jarnot &
Kristen Prevallet's next week. Also hope to see T. Begley, whose work with
Olga Broumas I very much admire (unfortunately, Olga could not make it to
Boulder I've been told). These readings have been great and I feel very
lucky to be here - but they do raise the troubling question: Is it possible
to have too much poetry?

Too much is not enough,

I'm from New York, I've lived all over the country, and I've never used Ms.
except when I don't know what else to use. More often than not it's what I
use in letters when I'm depending on the good will of the recipient, as in
asking for a job, a blurb, etc, and the recipient has not made public her
marital status. Anything, including mister ("who do you think you are,
mister?"), can be used to call out.

BRAVO HENRY!

only thing is, when you get flamed, you are faced with the big choice: 1) do i
refuse to add capital to the flames piling up and let stinker with the flame
thrower think they burned me; 2) do i burn their flamethrower to melted glop
and sear everyone unfortunate enough to be standing around.

ideally, of course, one would be way cool, and dump water on whole thing, real
real COLD water, no?
e
i'm feeling, like, way into the COOL thing because it is very hot and i am
wearing grown-up-lady nicey-nice clothes this afternoon, but discovered, too
late, a stain on the sleeve.

this is an example of the identity of the writer undergoing modification by the
identity of the writer as she constructs an identity that reconstructs itself,
endlessly acquiring imaginary capital

or not, as the case may be...

David Israel, I think, adds:

"on the other side of the ledger, there's the Chinese-painting
reference (don't recall exact wording) -- being "like legs on a
snake" (i.e., where you've painted a snake but then feel you've gotta
embelish it & add more . . . )"

There's a great saying in French, "ca me fera un bel jambe" ("that's gonna
make me a great leg"), for something useless received (or heard).

On the same subject, I now realize that it was my friend David Bromige I
nastied in my most recent attack on reading poetry to figure yourself out.
That'll make him a great leg. I wish I'd restrained myself, especially
since I didn't explain myself very clearly.

There is no life without identity, that's obvious (see my post to this list
on 5/17/97). But, being introduced is only the beginning of the relationship.

How, for example, would it be possible for David and Kali Tal to back out
of a brouhaha that *must* be based on mutual misunderstandings which
develop out of writing in different times/places and having this
keyhole-sized medium through which to perceive each other? Esp. since you
have to back out the same keyhole?

Anyway, I stick absolutely and without compromise -- unless someone should
disagree, that is (in which case I'm going to be forced to repeat my
position with additive decorations) -- to my statement that a poem is a
social contract between writer and reader. Whoever you are.

ditto me -- ms. is used to be respectful.  one says ms. to NOT colonize woman
based on marital status.  one says ms. to imply you are interested in, and
speaking to, the woman, not her patriarchal positioning.

i say ms. to other women older than me to include them in the girl's club, to
be most honorific and formal thus showing them i respect them, while doing it
in a way that is modern and feminist.

how would anyone know kali was a dr. -- it isn't in her posts, though her

Just to add a note of comparative data to the Ms thread:

I worked for many years as a secretary in law firms in San Francisco,
New York, Washington, DC.  In such environments -- (and I think,
likely, more broadly in much business correspondence in the U.S.) -- Ms.
has long been is a standard (indeed, the requisite) form of salutation for
all women.  In these environments, "Mrs." or "Miss" are, generally
speaking, no longer in use -- they are considered outdated.

Not suggesting this is found (or should be found) everywhere -- just
noting that, interestingly, it's what I've observed in the noted context.

In any case, I accept David B.'s suggestion that he had no hostile intent in
using that form of salutation; -- & I'm sure he (and anyone else here) will
be happy enough to address Kali Tal as she might best prefer.

stemware).

Electronic writing is, I suppose, writing from the place of the

Heh heh he, he used the word "cognition."
And, heh, heh, "Joyce."

'In virtual space there is no smell...'

Pity.

Now Derek Walcott - there's a poet whose texts, it seems to me, are very
interested in poetics, history, AND identity (and I doan think saying a
text is interested in identity is cynical at all.  In fact, I formally
nominate pritchpa@SILVERPLUME.IIX.COM for "Most Outrageous Remark on the
Poetics List, 1997. What's valuable about the Diary of Anne Frank to her
readers is not her "Jewishness"?????  Yeah, ummm, sure.).

Anyway, I think Walcott works thru much of the interesting stuff contained
in the recent discussion of identity and poetics - he ain't the only one
mind you, and he ain't necessarily the best, but he's all I got at the
moment:

Here's some bits from Walcott's "The Fortunate Traveller" and "Midsummer"

        Now at the rising of Venus-- the steady star
        that survives translation, if one can call this lamp
        the planet that pierces us over indigo islands--
        despite the critical sand flies, I accept my function
        as a colonial upstart at the end of an empire,
        a single, circling, homeless satellite.

The fortunate traveller is "homeless" not because there is no home-- the
other site "fills its exiles with horror" -- but he cannot relate to it,
cannot inscribe himself into it.  But he or she is ambivalent about the
privileges and pleasures of "travelling" in the spaces that have
previously excluded her.

Heh heh heh, he wrote "inscribe."

        It's good that everything is gone, except their language,
        which is everything.  And it may be a childish revenge
        at the presumption of empires to hear the worm
        gnawing their solemn columns into coral.

        ...

        and to buy porous fragments of the Parthenon
        from a fisherman in Tobago, but the fear exists,
        Delenda est Carthago on the rose horizon...

The traveler's ambivalence is reinforced by his realization that though
everything is gone, THE LANGUAGE REMAINS, which is "everything."  THE
LANGUAGE still embodies the complex intertwining of knowledge, history and
power that resulted from empire. One of the many ironies of being a
"fortunate" traveler is that he or she is now bound to that very language.
The structures of violence have been "enabling."  But language, at another
level, also means the power of representation, the power to map or remap
the world, AND THE WEST STILL HAS THAT POWER.

Heh, heh, hee, he said "empire."

        So, however far you have travelled, your
        steps make more holes and the mesh is multiplied--
        or why should you suddenly think of Tomas Venclova,
        and why should I care about whatever they did to Heberto
        when exiles must make their own maps, when this asphalt
        takes you far from the action, past hedges of unaligned flowers?

If the "traveler" must engage in making maps of his own, that is,
construct new affiliations in the metropolis, how can that construct take
into account the "disorder," the dis-location, that had made him "a
homeless satellite" in the first place?  What can be excluded, and what
must remain excluded or suppressed in this new map?  The identity of the
"fortunate traveler" is necessarily undetermined and uncertain, since it

Heh, heh, he wrote "metropolis."
And, yeah, yeah, ... "detour."

Defecation/writing is not normally painful, is it?  Freud suggested
(and God knows Joyce did)  that it's actually quite pleasurable, perhaps
the most deeply repressed pleasure of our culture--of Christian culture,
with its fear of the unclean.  But pleasure is never "supposed"  to be
solitary, let alone anal. And why should the strokes of pen or keyboard or
fart or bowel movement be painful:  ugh!  Painful to the ego, perhaps;
but that's a secondary effect and another story.

I didn't mean to sound so completely nostalgic about "unity"... I said
for our country the divisions, the dis-unity, have been a learning process.
There's no way to plan intellectually what motivates your writing, it
just runs too deep, I think.  When you think you are writing just to
write the best you can in the form, you discover you are hungry for
an audience.  It runs deep, I say.  What's the motive, what's the
message informing or underlying the art for art's sake (or is there
a message)...  depends on the pen, depends on the "time". On the
underlying impulse.  I write because I have loved to read from an
early age & wanted to do that too, I'm sure that's the common motive.
Or one of them.

If you believe there is something to be said for common understanding
on the basis of common humanity, then "unity" can't be all bad, though
the DANGERS are obvious for writers & others.  & I can't think of a
better work of art than one which would address unity & dis-unity
together & bring them under the same tent... - Henry Gould

thank you to lbd, robert, dodie b, and george for yr considered posts.  i
want to respond w/o adding too much to the bandwidth that this thread is
already taking up.

Robert Archambeau asks:
> But are there not situations in which it is legitimate to undermine
> authority (or, to use Bourdieu's term, to deprive another of capital)?

yes i suppose, since the alternate undermining and reinforcement of
capital defines the very dynamic of the field, the position-takings and
position-maintainings within it.  i have a hard time w/habermas tho, cuz i
dont think rationality-based consensus is possible (unless we
reconceptualize rationality, a serious option): witness the uproar here.

and sure, from one's position in the field and the dispositions (habitus)
which drive one to take such positions, one wd recognize certain speech
acts as deserving more symbolic capital than others.  our dispositions
clash, struggles ensue; but the object of our study -- in this case
writing as a product contained w/in a specific cultural field -- is just
that, an object with no intrinsic worth of its own: we project worth upon
writing.  or rather: worth is a residuum, an effect of the interactions of
habitus and field.  i hope this makes sense.  to be nietzschean abt it:
there is no valuable writing (or alternately, all writing has value), only
attributions of value to writing.

robert also asks:
> So I'm left wondering, Tom: do you object to the whole system, or to a
> particular judgement made within the system?   Maybe I lack imagination,
> but I find it hard to believe that you would argue against people on the

i find the system, the model, compelling. as a participant in the field,
i am disposed to agree with some judgments and disagree with others. i
have my own stakes, my own capital to invest and accumulate, all of which
are operating without my full conscious awareness.  the alternative -- to
play the game with the rules always fully upfront -- is untenable at best.
could you imagine: "i found so-and-so's post interesting but i would like
to respond by attempting to take away some of their list capital..."

George Thompson, wanting to push me further, writes:
> But I don't think that his [my] effort to sort out the issues quite
> succeeds, because in spite of his efforts to be detached and objective, he
> has still simply sided with his friend.

quite true. such is my disposition, which always thwarts any attempt to be
detached and objective. questioning my claims abt rhetorical violence, gt
asks:
> What kind of "list capital" was left for Jay Schwartz after Kim Dawn's
> "performance"?
> As far as I can see, rhetorical violence was used by both sides, in this
> battle for symbolic capital.

as kali suggested, jay had a number of different avenues for recovering
any symbolic capital presumably lost -- perhaps even more -- as a result
of kim's performance.  dodie b's defense of jay and her devaluation of
kim's writing -- again subject to dodie's own dispositions (and abt which
i am learning more -- thanks db) just like any of us, and which, as dodie
correctly points out to me, stopped short of dodie's calling kim's writing
worthless (this was left to robert's posting) -- were an attempt to
recover and redistribute the capital.  a powerful one, imo, given dodie's
more dominant position in our field relative to kim.

i'll shy away from talking further abt violence, at dodie's suggestion,
since she's right, it is becoming a rather banal academicism.  plus it's
an area i havent really thought through yet.  gt continues:

> It is also puzzling that Tom backs away from
> such a model of the list's activities, because it is "too ruthlessly
> darwinistic." Why bring it in and then throw it away?

i do so not only as an exercise of restraint and decorum, but b/c i don't
feel confortable saying that any member of this list is a machiavellian
capital-baron out to dominate the list at the expense of everyone else.  i
don't believe it, tho one could push bourdieu's model that way i suppose.

i wd speak more abt belief than what gt calls "magic," altho there is
something ritualistic abt the way authors are consecrated in bourdieu's
sense.

> I think that Tom is right to suggest that Dodie Bellamy has used this sort
> of magic on this list [if that is what he is suggesting]. But surely that
> is what *everyone* involved has done [and mostly quite well, I might add].

absolutely.  we all do it, rarely announcing it as such.  what's
important, and what bourdieu helps me do, is maintain an awareness of the
game.

Oh geez David (blush) - really, you shouldn't have! But the year is not half
done yet...

For the record (there seems to be a lot of this lately!) I did not say that
a text's "being interested" in identity is cynical. I said that it seemed
cynical to say that Anne Frank's belief in the basic goodness of human
beings did her "no good," as Maria Damon stated, the obvious implication
being that if people were good, she could have lived out "a normal life." I
understand Maria's revulsion over the invocation of Frank as a cynosure of
icky sweet virtue. References to Mother Teresa (who never met a Haitian
dictator she didn't like) make me feel the same way. And if Maria is too
blissed out at the Cape to respond to what was basically a rather idle
devil's advocate comment, that's fine. In my view, though, Frank's belief in
"goodness" underwrites her entire book and without it the book would lose
its value - indeed, its meaning - it would be guilty of bad faith. I did not
mean to imply, either, that "hope" constituted the longing for something
beyond mortality. Hope as a spiritual quality provides its own
justification, especially for those in extremis and without appeal - it is
not to be confused with mere optimism. To paraphrase Augustine, "The reward
of hope is hope." Call it a frivolous tautology, if you like...

I enjoyed your earlier posting on this debate, David, though as David
Bromige pointed out, it raised as many questions as it sought to answer.  So
I'm puzzled by your outburst.  It doesn't seem to me that anyone is
attacking you... (And I'd like to thank as well Tom Orange, George Thompson
and Robert Archambeau for their most useful sidebars on Bourdieu's theory of
symbolic capital vis-a-vis List interactions).

What strikes me most about the lines from the Walcott poem you post is their
applicability to a broader range of human experience - namely, that ol'
existential condition of exile, shipwreck etc we all find ourselves in
(except those of us, of course, who really know what our identity is and are
free of such concerns). Maybe this debate about identity hinges more on
differences between a broader reading of a text and a more narrow form of
reading. I don't know.  I for one would like it if someone could take a stab
(perhaps Kali Tal?) at defining exactly what is meant by identity since we
seem to be arguing over different variants of this concept. For me, identity
is a form of narrative created in order to obtain some sense of belonging in
a world which rarely provides it - and when it does, it's all too often on a
suspect, if not specious, basis. Since identity partakes both of innate and
more or less inflexible, characteristics (race, gender) as well as highly
mutable ones (religion, politics, etc.), doesn't our discussion need somehow
to take this into account?

not frivolous; but to expand: optimism itself (for that matter) needn't be
sneered at.  As remarked Aurobindo Ghose (if I recall aright):

it was my observation that "ms." was used as often disrespectfully as
respectfully.  how you use "ms." doesn't account for how others use it.  i
use it, too.  but i am aware of the context in which i use it, and that i
*do* use it in a fashion which affirms that it is a term of respect. the use
of "ms." as a term of disrespect is so common that it's become a hollywood
convention (george clooney's character uses "ms" in that disrespectful sense
in the latest _batman_ adventure, and there are myriad other examples).  the
implication in disrespectful usage is that a "real lady" doesn't *need* to
use "ms."

>how would anyone know kali was a dr. -- it isn't in her posts, though her

what do these two statements have to do with each other?  my point was *not*
that i *wished* to be called "dr.," but that I preferred "dr.-which-I-do-
not-wish-to-be-called" to "ms.-which-I-do-not-wish-to-be-called." as to how
anyone would know, well, there are several answers:  one might presume (not
an insult if one were incorrect); one might have read any of a number of
earlier posts which made some passing reference to finishing a dissertation
or turning a diss into a book; one might do (as dodie bellamy suggested, and
i had already done) a search on the web.  but what does the yale address
have to do with anything?  my email address is a yale address because it was
while i was at yale that i developed an internet "habit"--changing the
address at this point would be an incredible task.  in point of fact,
however, i *am* in the process of changing my address because i *don't* like
the "yale" identification.

interesting, your choice of the word "harangue" to describe my posts.  it's
a term that means--in it's kindest sense--"a speech addressed to an
assembly," which is what we are all generating.  but its most common usages
are for speeches that are loud and vehement, tirades, or formal and
pompous--a word used to dismiss not the content of a speech, but its manner
and presentation, its, um, decorum.  i think it's a lot easier to set aside
the question of content and replace it with a critique of manner.  if one
were to ask for an exemplary definition of "harangue," i might, in fact,
give the quoted paragraph above.  there is no room for *me* in there at
all--what you offer is a quite-literally-breathless blanket condemnation of
all of the roles you think i play. it is chiefly compelling for its clear
delineation of the (presumably more virtuous) oppositions and concomittant
insecurities it might describe.

i yam what i yam.  i don't like a lot of things about the academy; that
doesn't mean i didn't excel in it or that i do not value anything it has to
offer.  i am passionate about teaching and my teaching experience adds to my
understanding of the world.  i am concerned with class issues, and i do
quite self-consciously publish primarily poets of working-class origins
and/or identifications. on the other hand, poems i return to again and
again, which are the keystones of my sense of self, range from eliot's _four
quartets_, almost everything by wallace stevens, atwood's circe/mud poems to
shange's _nappy edges_. i do not, myself, *identify* as working-class and i
am always conscious of the privileges of birth which separate me from
working-class status no matter what my economic level might be at a given
time.  i *have* spent a great deal of time immersed in the study of certain
african american cultures, in which i claim some competence. like any other
competence, it was achieved through a great deal of effort and attention,
and, no, i don't think that people who *haven't* paid as much attention or
expended as much effort usually have access to the same level of
understanding of a subject.  (and this would be glaringly obvious and
"natural" if my area of competence/"expertise" were, say, southern European
cultures of the Middle Ages).  annoyingly, i insist on acknowledging my
subjectivity as a sexual abuse survivor *in* my scholarly essays on the
topic of sexual abuse literature. people ask me if i am an historian or a
literary critic and i, being irritating but accurate, say, "yes."  sometimes
i dress funky and mohawk my hair or shave my head. i wear a lot of earrings,
and get tattoed and have some piercings, which certainly does not uphold any
claim to the status of a "regular girl."  on the other hand, i like to play
dress-up and you can sometimes find me in white chiffon and gold lame heels.
riotous complexity has, for me, real charm.  i am a lot of things.  i
sincerely hope that you are too.

>what word DOES one take kali tal at?  whenever one tries, one gets haranged for
>not taking her at a different one?!  could it be

i have no interest in winning or losing.  i have an interest in *being*, in
manifesting, in being SEEN/READ.  an UNSEEN/UNREAD person can't take part in
any sort of exchange, and i am by nature an exchanging sort of animal.
"play" for me is not competitive--i watch the wolves who inhabit my living
space play and what they are doing is testing, and learning, and
reformulating or reaffirming their notions of the world around them and
their place within it.  *that* is what i am after.  whether you feel like
you "win" or "lose" in our exchange is up to you, and determined primarily
by how you decide to engage with my texts.

hey, speakin' (for the moment) as a Jew, I'd say what's valuable about the
Diary is, indeed, not the (mere fact of) AF's Jewishness.  There might be
lots of boring diaries written by Jews (and certainly there are lots of
books by Jews that are much less interesting).

What's interesting in the Diary is (for instance) the emergant psychology
& the narrative freshness, &c.

The fact of Jewishness is integral to all that, of course -- is part of the
given context.  But the Diary of Sei Shonagon is also interesting (for its
emergent psychology, sense of freshness, etc.) -- despite the fact it's not
written by a Jew.

Jewishness is hardly what makes AF's diary interesting per se, -- but it is
a factor of interest in our consideration of the work.

(but all that's pretty rudimentary, no?)

I don't have them with me right now, but I'll track em down.  In the
meantime, could others help?  One was with Louis Cabri et al, during a
trip to visit our friends to the North.  The other one I'm drawing a blank
on, but I promise to go find it.  Aside from the interview issue, I think
she's just wonderful, super-good, etc.  Anyone want to talk about her
work?  -Mike.

It has recently been determined that all posts to the POETICS list from
San Jose State university are in reality being sent from a location in
Boulder, Colorado, a town often visited by David Bromige.  It has also
been confirmed that David Bromige and Kali Tal have never been seen in the
saem place at the same time.  Draw your own conclusions and post
yourselves accordingly.

In the case of ears and origins, one might consider Waley's observation:

The methods of Chuang Tzu are those of the poet, and in the case of poetry

<< That (or those) are great questions--though I don't know how
seriously to take you here.  Art is to hide art?  But it never does, does it?
Maybe in my post about an epithalamium--trying to make it
"reader-friendly"--I implied that I didn't think poems ought necessarily
to be "reader friendly," though I don't myself buy into that.  It is simply
that there are different kinds of friendliness(es) and different kinds of
readers. >>

certainly there are.  Incidentally -- in keeping with the recent Bromige
theme of misattribution (or, as a variant on it: that of misconceived
direction), it was my impression (if I can remember all this aright --
which maybe I don't) that Henry's poem wasn't (specifically) responsive
to your post; but rather, I thought it had been (more or less specifically)
responsive to other threads-of-the-day --

but Anyway, to look at

> ARS EST CELARE ARTEM
> (art is to hide art).

I somewhat think Henry is purposely taking the saying slightly askew of
its original sense (though only slightly) -- for his purpose (which seems
an interesting purpose) --

I'm no classicist (& know no Latin) & was unfamiliar w/ the aphorism
before here encountering it (and BTW, does anyone know who said it? --
I asked Henry, but he doesn't remember) --

still, my hunch is it means something like this:

"that is most artful which manages [artfully] to conceal its artfulness" --

[bit like Lao-Tse's "the sage conceals his wisdom, keeps his jade buried in
burlap" (or something along those lines, I forget the exact phrase)] --

relationship between artful (ars, eh?) in sense of: artistically
accomplished, done w/ finesse, beautifully wrought, -- and artful (artem,
eh?) in sense of "characterized by deception / deceit" -- is interesting.

That there is art (deception / trickery) in art, is, yes, interesting.

(That there is R.Reagan in the nested "yes" is, yes, weird.)

This connects with the famous seduction thread.

(Was there a fam. seduction thread? -- or am I being artful?)

I suppose what's most charming can also be what seems to hide (almost)
its own charm.  Such paradoxes seem central to many poetics(es).

/ / / / /

BTW, -- dovetailing here to the unity thread -- I'm reminded of a poem of
Wallace Stevens' called something like "On the Road Home" (?) -- relating
what wd. appear to be a conversation abt. metaphysics with (I felt) his
wife -- wherein Stevens writes something roughly like this:

It is only when she said
"no, all words are not forms of a single word"
that the moon shone through the cloud [?]
the fox ran out of its hole [?]
the grapes became fuller [?], ____er, _____er . .

it's in some 3 or 4 stanzas, and repeats the pattern; -- to paraphrase: it is
only when one says "no, it's not a question unity, it's the maniness itself"
that the charm & meaning & presenxse before the senses of the detailed
perfection of the maniness seeps up and arrests one.

(Like this:  "Only when we said 'it's all absence' did presence insinuate
itself.  Only when we remarked, "no, there's no particular meaning here"
that the ocean wave curled into its own dark sweep, the sand-dune
crinkled, the cricket-chir resumed . .  . )   Perhaps it IS unity that
develops or emerges -- but this seems most possible -- it seems to
become palpable -- precisely when the name of unity is contradicted &
the notion of oneness is denied.  In this lies much mysticism (which ain't,
from my pen, perjorative, nor from my keypad, a fallacy).

I don't have Mr. Stevens on hand, and can't recall the poem fully enough;
-- a marvelous poem -- addressing crucial ideas charmingly & winningly --
ideas of unity & duality, as related (specifically) to poetics & aesthetics
& experience & what one comes to know abt. such things & how.

I (mildly) blush to allow I first acquainted this poem through the good
offices of Robert Bly (whose capital in some circles -- to borrow the
pop-monetary metaphr -- might be a bit in the low double digits at best,
but I like the guy anyway) -- from his *A Little Book on the Human
Shadow.*  Bly cites this poem in propounding a theory abt. Stevens &
his development that seems a bit dubious (though interesting); in any
case, he cites it to illustrate the depth, sensuality, & soul-quality evident
in early Stevens (which he felt was thinned & compromised in later work
from W.C.); -- anyway, the poem's worth the price of admission (either
to *A Little Book* or to the Stevens oeuvre; -- but properly speaking it's
more a door (or was for me) toward some of the riches of the latter).

cheers, d.i.

In-Reply-To:  <s3b9519e.001@SKGF.COM>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A couple of people have written to me trying to reconcile my own sexual
explicitness with my negative reaction to Kim Dawn's original entry into
this list, which certain individuals see as prudishness or hypocrisy on my
part.

It's been said that when KD attacked Jay Schwartz's virtual nipples with
virtual pinking shears, this was a form of sexual play, that Jay was then
free to play back.

In SM attempts are made to clarify the line between sexual play and sexual
violence.  There are contracts, there are code words to emit if one has had
too much.  But, the essential difference between play and violence, as I
understand it, is the mutual consent of the partners.  This isn't news, I'm
sure, to any of you--it's much a part of legal definitions (at least in the
U.S.).

Since neither Jay Schwartz, nor other list members, had consented to Kim
Dawn's aggressive pornographic whatever that was directed towards Jay, I do
not feel it should be categorized as sexual play, but as sexual violence.
I do not challenge her right to use sexual explicit material in her
writing, I merely challenge its non-consentual use.

I know, on the other hand, that it is a time-honored strategy of the
avant-garde to shock the bourgeoisie, and this is probably what KD was
trying to do.  I'm reminded of when I used to work in the file room of a
large university library before it was computerized, and I had to sit among
row upon row of library cards, filing them by library of congress numbers,
feeling miserably oppressed, I had this recurring fantasy of standing on
the table with the cards and pissing all over them.  And this poetics list
must often seem like a stack of cards.

As far as reading such material in public, to me, that is a shady area.  At
Naropa, I was invited to read, and the people who invited me were familiar
with my work, but some of the audience members weren't, so is violence
being perpetrated upon them?

Yes, please post the information about where to find the interviews with
Harryette Mullen, who (by the way) has generously agreed to give a poetry
reading at MLA this December in Toronto.  I proposed the poetry reading as a
"companion" to a special sesson on "The Contemporary Long Poem: Feminist
Intersections and Experiments."  The poets who will be reading are Kathleen
Fraser, Sharon Doubiago, Harryette Mullen, and Karen Brennan.

There were two good papers at the Rutgers conference on Mullen's work (by Kate
Pearcy and Michael Davidson), and they should soon be posted to our website:
http://english.rutgers.edu/poetry.html.  I'll let you know when the papers are
on line.

Here's one interview: Calvin Bedient, "The Solo Mysterioso Blues: An Interview
with HArryette Mullen," CALLALLOO Summer 1996

Mullen's work might bring us back to the thread about "voice" that preoccupied
the list a while back. She talks, somewhere, about the importance of speech
patterns and her mother's "southern black voice" to her writing.  What strikes
me is the taste of speech & tongue in her work, and the words shattered open,
exposed as archives and histories.

Re my previous post:  meant to put in a disclaimer about the "couple of
charming ladies at his side" image, w/ its woman-as-ornament connotations.
Didn't really *want* it there, for my point, but there it was, and it
didn't seem right to just cut it out.  Something else to try, perhaps, to
imagine a different way...

Speaking of appropriating images, i just turned on MTV for the first
time in a *long* time and was taken by the Bone, Thugs-n-Harmony
Batman bricolage, transforming that annoying practice of splicing movie
scenes into videos into something sharp and interesting, drawing on the
darkness of Gotham much more compellingly than the movie itself, i
thought...

Don't know this band, but was impressed with the lightning fast,
polyrythmic rap.  Anybody know if they have any good stuff out there?

I suppose I'm being hypersensituve, since I can't imagine anyone but me
cares about this, but I think Tom Orange has me all wrong when he says
that:

> worthless (this was left to robert's posting)


Just reread my post to make sure, and the only thing I said about Kim
Dawn was:

> Leaving aside the argument about Kim Dawn's first posts, I'm sure there
> are some positions and speech acts that Tom feels ought to lack
> discursive capital

How you get _any_ kind of opinion on Kim Dawn out of that is beyond
me.    I wanted to leave aside the particular case and find out whether
you found the system you described generally acceptable or not (and your
subsequent post was admirably clear in answering me on that count, Tom
-- thanks).

As to having an opinion on the whole Kim Dawn Baker/Jay Schwartz affair,
I feel unqualified to speak -- I didn't follow the thread very closely
(does being uninterested equal calling someone worthless?  I'm not
interested in agronomy either, but am damn glad there are people who
know how to grow grapes like the ones that went into the cool glass of
chardonnay I'm about to go drink on this blazing Chicago afternoon).

"witness the uproar here" (Tom O.)

Can i get a witness?  AMEN!

"Duke made you use all your senses . . . immediately the eyes and ears and
the whole body starts to come full up, 100 percent.  You're right up
there.  You're like a bird.  Every look is important, every motion is
important.  I remember we played the Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, and
Duke came to me and said, "I want you to play a drum solo in church."  In
those days, I thought a drum solo in church sounded kind of weird.  So he
let me digest that for about two or three days, then he came back to me
and said, 'My music is based on the first three words of the Bible: In the
beginning.  In the beginning we had lightning and thunder.  That's you,
Lou.'  It wasn't a drum solo anymore. It was lightning and thunder." [not
*that's* "magic"!--S.]  -- Louie Bellson, jazz drummer, on his experience
in the Duke Ellington band

And:

"Like he came to me and was telling me about Buddy Bolden in New Orleans
and said, 'So, when are you going to portray the role of Buddy Bolden?'  I
said, 'I don't know that much about him."  He said, "Oh sure: He was
suave, he was debonaire, he was dapper and he always loved to have a
couple of charming ladies at his side.  He could tune up in New Orleans
and break glasses across the river in Algiers.  He had the biggest,
fattest sound, and he could bend the note and play diminishes.'  He said
'Play me some diminishes.'  and I did, and he said, "That's him!  You
*are* Buddy Bolden!  And I believed it.  [magic again!]  -- Clark Terry
(trumpeter)

---

So: the band as another "field of cultural production," site of
mutual/musical inspiring?  Sure Duke was the Boss (much moreso than
anything we have here) and sure there was hierarchy, but it's the
particular gesture here i'm interested in here (like a bird).  I agree
with, I think it was George T., that listspace can also *resist*
"institutional" power dynamics.  All this talk about "list capital" is
making me tired, freezin' me up.  I'm *not* attacking Tom O's original
post--I see his point.  Sure.  But we're also free, i think, to imagine
things another way, to bring that other way into being (You *are* Buddy
Bolden!...  believe it, s

Subject:      Tagore / Orientalism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A few weeks ago Steven Marks referred to an article by Amartya Sen in the
NYRB [June 26, 1997], "Tagore and his India." I promptly went out and found
the article, read it, and I've been brooding over it ever since. It seems
to me to be a good, accurate account of Tagore's life and his role in
India's pre-Independence cultural life.

A basic motif in the article is to contrast Tagore's anti-nationalistic,
democratic liberalism and enlightened rationalism and modernism, against
Gandhi's intensely religious nationalism and his anti-modernism. Sen's
sympathies are, I think, explicitly with Tagore [though he concedes
Gandhi's moral authority, of course].

The source of my brooding is that, on the one hand, my political sympathies
lie entirely with Tagore. There is a ferocious Hindu fundamentalism at work
in India today that is responsible for much of the Hindu-Muslim hostilities
that plague the sub-continent, as well as for the continuing influence of
Hinduism's awful caste system, with all of its brutal untouchability,
widow-burning, infanticide [esp. of girls], etc. [not to say of course that
Gandhi condoned any of this]. Even in my own more or less irrelevant
researches into Vedic matters [a long dead tradition, by the way], I have
several times collided with Hindu fundamentalists who like to think that
they are continuing "Vedic ways" and who invent fantastic accounts of Vedic
"wisdom."

On the other hand, Tagore's poetry has never worked for me. There is almost
universal deference among Bengali literati and scholars for his Bengali
poetry. But for me at least [unable to read his Bengali] his poetry does
not carry over to the English translations, which have always seemed to me
to be more or less bad pre-modern romanticism.

Gandhi remains a more interesting figure for me, not only because of his
indisputable "truth-force" [satyagraha], which without raising a stick
*forced* the British out of India, but because he was a more astute
observer of the ways in which traditional imagery and traditional ideology
worked on his culture. I think that Gandhi's [entirely sincere] manipulaton
of the traditional image of the "holy man" was brilliant political theater.
And even in his weirdnesses [re sexuality and and the body], on the whole
Gandhi seems more relevant today than Tagore does.  Think of his fasting in
light of Kafka's story "A Hunger Artist", or in light of the recent
discussions of symbolic capital... His technique of non-violent resistence
is rooted in a sophisticated [tho unarticulated] philosophy of violence...
etc....

Best,
George Thompson

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

It has been a little over a month since I posted my List of (American)
Poetry Schools hoping for corrections, additions, comments. . . .  I got
a few back-channeled comments but not a single concrete suggestion,
privately or publicly, for the improvement of the list.  I think it's
important enough to repeat, though, so here it is again, with a few
changes that I hope are improvements.


    MAINSTREAM POETRY

What's in all the standard anthologies; Vendler-certified; many
sub-schools, some of which are:

      1. Iowa-Workshop Poetry (e.g., Bell)

      2. Surrealist Poetry (e.g., Bly)

      3. Ecological Poetry (e.g., Snyder)

      4. Jump-Cut Poetry (e.g., Ashbery)

    EASY-STREAM POETRY

A variety of poetry that, based on its popularity, ought to be
mainstream but is shut out of the major anthologies because academics
look down on it.

      1. Light Verse

      2. Haiku

    LANGUAGE POETRY (or "Acadominant" Poetry)

The poetry in *In the American Tree*, the Messerli anthology, etc.;
Perloff-certified; several sub-schools that I lack the knowledge to
untangle

    CONTRA-GENTEEL POETRY

All the 'unrefined" plain-writing poets inspired by W.C. Williams, Frank
O'Hara, the Beats, Bukowski.  (Note: I include the social identity poets
in this school--but, of course, many poets, particularly the social
identity poets, are in more than one group--Maya Angelou, for instance,
seems to me at times Mainstream, and at times Contra-Genteel.)  The main
sub-schools I know of are:

      1. Conversationalist Poetry (e.g., O'Hara)

      2. Beat Poetry (e.g., Corso, Bukowski), with several sub-
divisions

      3. Social Identity Poetry (e.g., Wanda Coleman, the Vietnam stuff
Kali Tal is pushing)  (this group is an expansion of what I previously
was calling "Ethnic Poetry")

      4. Pop-Rhyme, which sudivides into Rap and the Neo-James-
Whitcomb-Reilly School (yes, I need a less condescending name for this
group--and probably for the Iowa-Workshop school)

      5. Wild-Woman Poetry (e.g., Townsend) (another name that could be
improved)

    NEOFORMALIST POETRY

Poetry continuing the techniques of traditional English poetry,
especially meter.

   PLURAESTHETIC POETRY

Any poetry that mixes expressive modalities:

      1. Visual Poetry (e.g., Kempton)  (Which I for a time was
over-meticulously calling "visio-textual poetry")

      2. Sound Poetry (e.g., McCaffery)  (Which I for a time was
over-meticulously calling "audio-textual poetry")

      3. Performance Poetry (e.g., Jack Foley)

      4. Mathematical Poetry (e.g., LeRoy Gorman)

      5. Flow-Chart Poetry (I've seen some but don't remember the name
of anyone who does it)

      6. Compucentric Poetry, or poetry using computer language (e.g.,
Sondheim, sometimes)  (an addition since last time)

      7. Polylingual Poetry (e.g., John M. Bennett, Susan Smith Nash,
Sheila Murphy)  (another addition)

    INFRA-VERBAL POETRY

Poetry whose focus is the inside of words.  Joyce and Carroll are
infra-verbal poetry's chief forebears--and Cummings, whom I've come to
consider more an infra-verbal than a visual poet

    HYPERTEXTUAL POETRY

I know almost nothing about this.  It might just be pluraesthetic poetry
in a new medium.  Or even ordinary poetry in a new medium.

There they are, again, the eight main schools of poetry I'm aware of (or
remember).  For the second time I ask: any additions, corrections,
comments?  Or ideas as to why the list has generated so little in the
way of feedback?

this is a marvellous distinction.  it seems to me natural to want to
determine one's own naming, to control others' perception of one, but
maybe all that is possible is the choice among various less desirable
outcomes...

on this island where I live questions of (national) identity have become
very important, there being those who prefer to not be Chinese but rather
Taiwanese (and a few vice versa). important issues but kinda reductive
(or is the correct word "essentialist"?  I'm a little behind on my theory.

no doubt I will not prefer whatever I may be called as a consequence of
emerging from my lurking, or perhaps I will pass unnoticed

is it better to be called (perceived) in a way that one does not "prefer"
or instead to simply not be called anything?

I think all of this has something to do with poetry, though whether with
language poetry maybe that's another question

more likely cerebral/synaesthetic origin -

maybe something along the lines of Deleuzian percepts may be useful

I am informed by one "Pearl Poet" that Mr. Bromige did in fact write
everything, but that he has not yet read it all.  I was on the point of
asking how this could have been accomplished when communications were
disrupted by something the news media insist on terming a "handover."
Once the "handover" is complete, the "Pearl Poet" promises further
revelations.

I'm off in a week's time for an extended stay in Paris (to end of November)
& wondering if anyone knows of events (exhibitions, festivals, concerts,
readings) & can back-channel the information.  Plans -- more specifically --
are to work with Pierre J. on the collected poems and plays of Picasso
(for which co-translators [from Spanish/French] are hereby solicited) and
with Steve Clay of Granary Books on a (real) anthology of "the book" as
sequel to _The Book, Spiritual Instrument_.  I'll also be doing side trips
& readings, etc. in Geneva (La Batie Sound Poetry), London (Mottram
conference & SubVoicive readings) and Madrid, but don't want too much
getting in the way of simply being/writing in Paris.  I will, however, be
interested in meeting those who want to meet up and with whom I may be
crossing paths.

Paris address (if I can use the list as a means for delivering it) is
c/o Woodward/Blau, 5 rue Leon Jouhaux, 75010 Paris, tel. 42.39.50.75 [after
August 1], and e-mail to ucsd.edu will also be forwarded to local Paris
number.

While we're on this persistent identity question, I'd just like to tell
the Listserv that I am here and would love to receive my usual quota of
posts.

"Who is
Frank Moore?"

As I was looking through *Selected Writings of Paul Valery* (by David
Bromige) the other day, I found this felicitous passage:

"All these people who create, half certain, half uncertain of their
powers, feel two beings in them, one known and the other unknown, whose
incessant intercourse and unexpected exchanges give birth in the end to a
certain product. I do not know what I am going to do; yet my mind believes
it knows itself; and I build on the knowledge, I count on it, it is what I
call _myself_. But I shall surprise myself; if I doubted it I should be
nothing. I know that I shall be astonished by a certain thought that is
going to come to me before long--and yet I ask myself for this surprise, I
build on it and count on it as I count on my certainty. I hope for
something unexpected which I designate. I need both my known and my
unknown." (From *With Reference to Adonis*)

Isn't that GREAT?

That is to say, maybe the whole question of identity means different
things to writers and critics (not, of course, that they're necessarily
different, but . . .)

When the person who was putting together an oral biography of Wallace
Stevens went to his office mates at the Hartford some years after he died
and informed them that he was, in fact, an award-winning American poet,
many of them couldn't believe it.

"You mean WALLY?"

Finally, I'm sorry indeed to have missed Kevin's impersonation of Anne
Waldman in my brief descent upon Naropa this last weekend; I'm sure I
would have been on the ground. Thanks for your reports, Patrick -- even
though I have some minor quibbles with your reportage, I can safely say to
everyone that Naropa has, in fact, finally gone legit in a big way.

perhaps, but in May 1997 David & Kali were both in Tucson, Arizona, and
David offered a discussion session and a reading for a poetry/poetics
organization of which Kali is a member. Like Tenney Nathanson, I too
testify that both of these are people I am glad to know. Their comments, on
this list and in person, have been valuable to me.

Whether San Jose has relocated to Boulder I can not say, but people die

wow dodie!

you go girl!

that was an extraordinary summing up.  yes, it is EXACTLY what i am having
problems with.  even, in the territory of a novel as someone (probably david
bromige -- he writes everything anyway) pointed out, we have chosen to open
novel knowing in some measure what we will get.  in post, there was not
that same kind of agreement.

and, as you point out, more importantly, jay schwartz did not agree to this
ugly defacement of him.  i didn't agree to read someone being sexually de-
faced.  i don't like sexual harrassment as weaponry to begin with, and if
someone, anyone, had asked me to participate or accept same put into play
against anyone i probably would not go along.  now, of course, devil's A
says "what if it was against harrasser/rapist/etc" but one comes back to
what you put on your hands soils you.  and more important, jay schwartz
did not sexually harass anyone.  snapped at people, got a bit pissy, maybe
a bit insensitive and hurtful, but not that degree and kind of violence.
it reminds me of how when you ask a batterer (if you bother) why he hit
lover and he'll say something like "well she was yelling at me" or "she
was late" and you think, if you think rationally, "what, so the penalty
for yelling or being late is supposed to be getting your nose broken?"

Out of the deeps of time (i.e., 2 days ago) comes this from our Thai
correspondent, Rebecca:

<< In the case of ears and origins, one might consider Waley's
observation:

The methods of Chuang Tzu are those of the poet, and in the case of

well okay, but the esteemed Arthur Waley didn't mind an awareness of
literary reference.  What was the context of Waley's statement, I wonder?
(Waley was one of the most admirable of orientalists, in my reckoning.)

One's reading of Han Shan's line makes little sense w/o reference to the
Chuang Tse story; one's reading of Gary Snyder's line fuller  sense when
recalling those antecedents.  Your quote is charming, but not, I suppose,
an anti-reference-find argument.

Nice to note that our friend Dean B. has checked in w' more suspicious
looking Snyder lines.  (Doubtless he's aware of the grandiose & amazing
Mahayana hyperbolic rhetoric & figures of speech that Snyder was -- in
a sense -- sending up.)   Few years ago, I had some fun with that
"innumerable as grains of sand on the Ganges" simile myself, must
confess -- in a poem entitled "In the Saha World."  One could find it in an
old issue of Tamarind (easy as finding needle in a haystack -- or am I

As a fairly recent Naropa grad, I would love for you to expand on this
impression of yours, both your sense of what constituted illegitmacy and
what has changed.  Also, your sense of the timeframe in which this may
have occured.

A possibly naive question on your poem: Why do the stanzas break where
they do? I'd looked at it, shifting the breaks around, and their
positioning didn't seem to have much effect. Was there a pattern I'm
missing?

(I wonder this about a *lot* of poetry, especially those, such as this
one, in which the stanzas in a section are of uniform length in a way
that seems unrelated to the content. This is just the first chance I've
taken to actually ask someone.)

For me the most interesting reaction to Stevens at the office was an
executive who allowed as how he'd looked at Stevens' poetry and didn't think
much of it, but as an insurance lawyer he was a genius.

Taking a few more minutes away:

Thought I'd embed a little cognitive science/linguistics here since
it's spot on:

in cognitive linguistics (and for lang folks working in cog sci and

and anyone interested or having had Nabokov's experience:

Look into the neural theory of language.
In this theory, a couple of necessary basic assumptions are
1. much of syntax uses semantics
and
2. much of semantics uses embodied structures from the sensory-motor
system.
(Aha! you say. and, I knew it!)
Yes. In this view, a sensory-motor // linguistics boundary doesn't exist
(I'm speaking bio here), and also, we don't know what is present at birth.

that was a clever ploy, was it not?  the game is over, but you are clearly
on to me.  i did not *remember* that i was david bromige until a past-life
therapy session last year caused some repressed memories to surface.  i woke
up the day after the session fully in the bromige persona and was utterly
horrified to find that the hard lump under my pillow was a pistol, left
there by the paranoid kali persona.  leaping out of bed, i was further

persona's closet, and we are not even the same size.  since then i have only
been able to inhabit this body sporadically, but i'd like to take this
opportunity to apologize to the other person who thinks he's david bromige
for the kali persona's rudeness.  she is difficult to live with and takes up
far more than her fair share of room.  i'm planning a coup, and when i am
solidly in power, i promise you that there will be some changes around here.
for the moment, though, i am glad to know that even when the kali persona is
in control here, there is a supplementary david bromige around to defend our
position and state our case.

truly, i think that there is a david bromige inside everyone trying to get out.

presumably the intended sense is that a person of said kind is a person
lacking in (even the most rudimentary) attributes of human kindness --
the colorful example cited being, perhaps, more for rhetorical flourish
than for sake of descriptive clarity?

Under normal circumstances, to piss in someone's ear isn't an act
demonstrating great care & consideration.  It seems a rude gesture.  But
That Person is one so lacking in courtesy, he won't even perform a rude
gesture if it would be of benefit to his fellows.  This seems an interesting
definition of rudeness: being too essentially rude (unreesponsive to the
needs of others) to act in even a rude-seeming manner, in the event that
the underlying nature of the needful act (hidden under the semblance of
rudeness, in this case) would be of actual benefit to others.  Suggests that
real rudeness resides in the heart, rather than in the outward manner; a
rude-seeming act can be the essense of kindness; refraining from a rude
act can be the epitome of rudeness.  Interesting stuff, doc.

Critics and poets are very different animals.  The artist essentially,
as I see it, relies on mimesis to present, discover, or engage questions
of identity.  In this sense, the artist blurs those distinctions.  It's
like Keats saying that a poet is the most unpoetical of things because
he/she's constantly being incorporated into other bodies other than
their own, thus confusing that established notion of the stable, unified
individual.  The lyric moment provides release for the poet to sift
through those shifting identities.  This is nature, the way airplanes
resemble birds.

A critic, on the other hand, is usually far more rigid and uses a
language which is discursive.  The critic always preserves that stable
conception of him or herself in some authorative way.  The thought
process is more binomial and partial to the catagorical assumptions of
the mind rather than the more comprehensive and less structured
impressions mimetic art provides.  Critical thought can grasp and
explain questions of identity.  But the real work and exploration of
such questions take place in one's active life and in the isolate hours
of one's art.  Says me. There are plenty of attempts now, of course, for
critics to write poetry and vice versa.  But the emphasis seems to be on
the mental perception of identity rather than experiential patterns of
knowledge.

Sorry to take up the space on such a rather obvious subject.  But it's
my way of getting even with the overly bloated and poorly written posts
I've read re: identity of late.

Dodie brings up some interesting points, and I may have sorted out the
different sets of assumptions that lead to our disagreement.

I draw a firm line between textual or verbal attacks and physical violence.
The line blurs, for me, *only* when textual or verbal attacks imply a real
and tangible threat of physical violence.  I don't *like* abusive language
(and I realize that my idea of "abusive" is not universal), but I don't
think it's at all the same thing as walloping someone on the head.  Nor do I
consider virtual "rape" (the textual description of the rape of someone
else) to be equivalent to f2f physical rape *unless* the same power
relationship is in play in both instances.  For example, a textual
description of a rape mailed to a woman or man who is being stalked *by* the
stalker implies the threat of a physical attack, while a random description
of the rape of a female character in a MUD or MOO (while perhaps vile), is
not *violent* except inasmuch as it implies the general and quite real power
that men have in this society to rape women and get away with it.  Thus, I
saw no violence whatsoever in Kim Dawn's post to Jay Schwartz.  There was no
implication that Kim Dawn had any sort of physical, political, economic or
social power over Schwartz's fate, and so I could find no threat.

In my opinion, neither does "play" require mutual consent as long as power
over another is not exercised.  I can think of quite a few situations in
which one person is playing, and another person declines to play, and
neither are materially or psychically hurt by the fact that a game is in
progress.

When one starts categorizing unwanted *textual* intrusions into one's social
arena as "sexual violence," one risks the following: 1) watering down the
term "sexual violence" so that it is all-encompassing and winds up meaning
nothing; and, 2) creating a system of censorship and enforcement which
*does* depend upon an existing power relationship (a relationship which is
usually not weighted in favor of the very population one needs most to
protect--in this society, women and children and nonwhite people and gay men).

Personally, I've got a lot of problems with S&M/B&D play, even when it *is*
consensual, since the thrill of it seems to me to be based on existing (and
persisting) power imbalances in the real world.  Playing at Master and Slave
is only exciting if there *are* masters and slaves; otherwise there would be
no exhilaration, no sense of power, no risk.  So, though S&M relationships
are ostensibly contracts between partners, I think that there are always
exploited/appropriated silent partners in the relationship in the form of
involuntarily subjugated populations whose oppression provides the narrative
upon which S&M partners draw.

Still and all, I don't think that what Kim Dawn was engaging in *was* "S&M,"
though she employed the textual artifices that *imply* S&M.  What I mean by
this is that Kim Dawn was describing a situation which existed only in her
imagination, and the sexual imagery was generated *not* to actually partner
with Schwartz in an S&M exchange (coercive or consensual), but to point out
to Schwartz that text was uncontrollable, unrestrained in the manner that
Schwartz wished it to be restrained.  If Schwartz had complained about
frivolous baseball imagery, perhaps Kim Dawn's textual persona would have
scratched her crotch for luck, spat some virtual tobacco juice on his shoes,
and sent a pitch smoking at his head, though I imagine (and please correct
me if I'm wrong about this, Kim Dawn) that Schwartz's special distaste for
the S&M play was a particular trigger for Kim Dawn.  Remember that the
motivation for Kim Dawn's play didn't seem to be the entrance of S&M into
the conversation (she had been silent during the light S&M exchange which
provoked Schwartz's comment), but was confined to a reaction to Schwartz's
attempt to *control* the conversation.  So I took her post (and continue to
take it) as an eruption of the uncontrollable, an illustration of Schwartz's
lack of power to determine what would or would not appear on POETICS.  We
can argue about the effectiveness of the response, but that does not seem to
be the issue here.

At a reading, or on a discussion list, no one is *forced* to engage with
sexually explicit subject matter.  One can walk out the door or use the "d"
key.  There *are* situations in which unwilling listeners are forced to
endure speech that disturbs them, and there *are* situations in which
walking out on or not reading disturbing texts can have material costs for
those unwillingly exposed to such material, but I don't think that this
discussion is in that category.  A key element in violence is the *power* to
exercise it.  Again, I don't see how Kim Dawn had power of Jay Schwartz, and
so I don't see violence in the exchange.  (Of course, I *do* realize that
those without power do have the option of violently erupting toward those
who *do* have power, but such eruptions are usually quickly contained and
flattened, and I don't think that's what happened here either.)

In some ways, of course, reading *is* an act of violence, a "systematic
derangement," the icepick Kafka longed for to break open the frozen sea
inside, a catalyst which once it has entered a given frame of referents may
result in often unpredictable reactions.

But as far as reading work in public which makes people uncomfortable, I'd
say to Dodie Bellamy: they paid their money and they took their chances. As
far l'affaire Kim/Jay goes, I think there are rules even for the game of
transgression otherwise, what are you transgressing?

Yes.  Shit.  Barbaric threats employed as play are totally acceptable.
Who knows what line is drawn at any moment, or how to read the mail of
cyberville?  Irony and Play are used to defend any half thought
provacation one can offer.  It's a defense for cowardice and
artlessness.  Who one fucks or how one fucks that other or what one will
do to some one else is so boring.  It's not an offense.  It's weak,
scared, and screaming of one's lost and damaged psyche.  The real
insult, however, the only truly awful posts I have seen lately, are
those, like below, which abuse language in even more sinister ways than
playful, ironic attacks on one's cyber character.  At least KD's
language had color.  Kali's words are mud, smudged and gray.  In that
continuing necessity to BE RIGHT language is shit out of Kali's mouth to
create a heap of impenetrable clarification.  Congratulations.  Kali is
right out of sheer stamina.  KD's language can at least be read for its
impulsiveness.  Kali's is thick with thought, but little feeling.  Maybe
the critics do have an edge these days.

        So you saying that there is an EXTERNAL difference between poet and critic
(as in Sartre's example, between chair and giraffe)
        and that this natural and actually inviolable difference
                is based on a difference of perception--
                        experiential knowledge v.
                        mental perception--
                                mimetic v. metaphoric,
                                  a binary deriving from
                                  synchronic v. diachronic, perhaps?

        But the diachronic will always slip into the synchronic
        eventually --

                        did you write this as poet or critic--

                                        or am I --


good-naturedly,

The power of a threat is its menace, its implication that hostile intention
can indeed be carried out.  I still argue that there was no menace in Kim
Dawn's post. It was not a threat.  It was not even a bluff.

>Irony and Play are used to defend any half thought

This is true.  I've heard plenty of comments about how feminists and
antiracist activists have "no sense of humor." Most often the people who
make those comments are sexist or racist or both, and act in ways that--in
the real world--oppress others.   But what I'm arguing here is *not* that
Kim Dawn's post was funny, but that it was *not* violent, not a threat.

Now *this* is an interesting paragraph.  It's so full of direct insults and
attributions of motivation that it's hard to distinguish the argument from
the rabid froth, but let me make a stab at reading it...  The phrase that
strikes me as most revealing is "a heap of impenetrable clarification," by
which I assume Smith means that I continue to insist on the importance of
being clear and specific, and that I employ a critical vocabulary and
methodology in (some of) my texts.  Lumping me with "critics," (a Bad Thing,
apparently), he accuses me of "thought, but little feeling," in an attempt
to paint me as "even more sinister" than transgressors like Kim Dawn.  I'm
not at all bothered by Smith's dislike of my prose style, though I think it
strange that while he's raging against the "barbaric" texts of others, he
has no hesitation about calling my language "shit."

I'd like to point out, for the record here, that there are only two writers
about whom it has been said publicly on POETICS that their writing is
without worth, "stupid," or "shit."  Those two writers are both women, and
they were/are both (in different ways) writing against the grain.  No women,
and no men, have ever dismissed a male poster's texts in such final and
judgemental terms.  This is not a coincidence.  This is how women are dealt
with when they act "inappropriately."

One of the things that seems to bother Smith (and Weiss, who has commented
upon it previously) is the volume of my prose.  On a list where everyone can
titrate, read or not read, skim or delete as they choose, what does volume
signify?  Surely no one who disagrees with me is going to be persuaded by
the *volume* of my work?  My own conclusion is that writing long and
frequent posts is a kind of manifestation that certain hostile readers
simply can't tolerate.  In traditional settings they might be able to
disappear me and women like me--there are so many mechanisms for silencing
female voices in f2f interaction.  But on email lists, I am indisputably
present--more present, perhaps, than some of those who react so strongly to
my posts.  And perhaps it is the relative invisibility of their *own*
personae that so disturbs them, as if an email discussion forum were a
zero-sum gathering; if there's more of me, there's necessarily less of you.
One of the most disturbing conclusions I've drawn from years of email list
interaction is that the self-concept of certain people (mostly male, mostly
white) seems to be *based* on my erasure, or on the erasure of people like
me.  *If* I manifest, then they immediately start to feel strangled,
victimized, stomped upon.  Only my textual death calms them.  And since it
is my pleasure to manifest in virtual company, I find myself, all too often,
the Typhoid Mary of Flame Wars, puzzled at the strength of certain people's
reactions, and passing through unmoved by whatever it is that's driving them
wild.

Re Wallace Stevens the insurance lawyer, Delmore Schwartz used to
claim that he had met someone from Hartford Life and, thinking to
surprise him, told him about the great poet who worked there.  The
insurance executive replied that Hartford Life's management all knew
about Stevens poetry, that he was not much good as an attorney,but they
kept him around because of the prestige he brought the firm.

Delmore S is a less than reliable narrator, but I think there is some
necessary truth in the anecdote, irrespective of the particulars.

Both categories/modes of writing would be a lot more interesting if they
were reversed.  Artists don't "have" to rely on mimesis; critics can
dissolve their "authority."  We all can have more fun.

Kali --

As an exercise, I've endeavored to address -- below -- issues of reading &
misreading in your latest post responsive to Dodie's latest post.  Dare
say I consider this current msg. a bit long-winded.  But what to do?  In
my view, something has been missed, and perhaps there's no better way
to locate it than through this manner of exercise -- an exercise in careful
reading.  Frankly I'm not especially practiced at this manner of logical
refinement.  Nonetheless, in a pinch, I think I can note the difference
between a suit (clubs, spades, hearts) on the one hand, and cards within a
suit (ace, duce, jack), on the other.  That's what I'll endeavor to do here.

I adopt the theoretical tone now in evidence, as it seems to fit this sort of
textual analysis.  I trust that, god-willing, I'll be able to revert to regular
talk after I've hit the magic Send key.   So, here goes.

/ / / / /

It's good that you try to refine some semantic distinctions.  I think,
however, in your reading of Dodie's post you've made a leap that is not
warranted in the intended sense of the text under discussion.  It's an
understandable leap, but it's a leap that becomes the source of what
strikes me as a continuing misunderstanding (or misreading) of what's
really at issue here.

Dodie wrote --

<< In SM attempts are made to clarify the line between sexual play and
sexual violence.  There are contracts, there are code words to emit if one
has had too much.  But, the essential difference between play and
violence, as I understand it, is the mutual consent of the partners.  This
isn't news, I'm sure, to any of you--it's much a part of legal definitions (at
least in the U.S.). >>

Okay, let's call that "A".

Then Dodie wrote:

<< Since neither Jay Schwartz, nor other list members, had consented to
Kim Dawn's aggressive pornographic whatever that was directed towards
Jay, I do not feel it should be categorized as sexual play, but as sexual
violence.  I do not challenge her right to use sexual explicit material in her
writing, I merely challenge its non-consensual use. >>

Okay, let's call that "B".

In both A and B, there are distinctions drawn.  In A, the distinction is
between (literal) sexual play and sexual violence.  In B, the distinction
involves two categories of *writing* -- two forms of verbal / written
behavior.  Neither involves literal physical sexual behavior (obviously).
Therefore, we may understand that Dodie intends not to posit an
*equivalence* between the terms of A and the terms of B, but rather, she
wishes to draw an *ANALOGY* between those terms.

To repeat, in B, Dodie writes,
<< Since neither Jay Schwartz, nor other list members, had consented to
Kim Dawn's aggressive pornographic whatever that was directed towards
Jay, I do not feel it should be categorized as sexual play, but as sexual
violence. >>

The key term that occasions your misreading is *should be categorized
as....*  You take Dodie to task for categorizing an e-speech act as sexual
violence.  Fine.  But in fact, an e-speech act is *neither* literal sexual
play [LSP] *nor* is it literal sexual violence [LSV].  It is neither of those
two terms.  When Dodie suggests that the speech-act in question is LSV
rather than LSP, what she is doing is drawing an analogy.   What we see
here is a linguistic act of analogy, not a linguistic act of equivalence.

On the level of analogy, some email messages can, perhaps, be placed at
either pole of the bifurcation, the distinction that's at the center of the
text -- i.e., some acts of written communication can, perhaps, be
approached as analogous either to LSP or to LSV.  This is a distinction in
the realm of analogy -- and Dodie draws the analogy for the reason that it
involves moral, ethical, and courtesy resonances from the realm of A that
seem germane to analogous moral, ethical, and courtesy overtones in the
realm of B.

In the realm of B -- the realm of listserv writing, communication in a
public electronic discussion forum -- there is a distinction to be drawn
between play (which can best develop where there's a shared sense of
language, a shared enjoyment of interaction, -- some (say) preliminary
acquaintance or courtship behavior: all factors well in evidence in the
antecedent menage of B. & B. & M & (was it?) E. -- but not, I'm afraid,
present in the JS / KD encounter) on the one hand, and taunting,
assaultive, threatening verbal behavior, on the other.  You choose to read
KD's post in terms of the play side; others have tended to construe it in
terms of the taunting side.  That's the level of distinction, in any case,
that Dodie's text endeavored to address.

If you turn your gaze away from that distinction, by critiquing the term
of equivalence (the "can be categorized as" -- which was, I opine,  never
intended to be taken *literally*), then you have immediately moved away
from the intended sense of the text, into another (and tangential) issue --
an issue possibly worthy of discussion in its own terms, but not the real
focus of the text at hand.

To reiterate & clarify: when, in paragraph B, Dodie says "I do not feel it
should be categorized as. . . " this is NOT to be construed literally -- as a
casting into the (literally) same category.   Rather, looking at the text as a
whole, it appears evident (to me) that what is in progress in this text is
an act of ANALOGY rather than a drawing of EQUIVALENCE.  (The
two are by no means the same.)  You critique it on the level of
equivalence.  But suppose you were to read it on the level of analogy.
How, then, would your reading go?  Might you recognize the distinctions
that Dodie wishes to draw?

So: properly construed, we may understand that Dodie wishes to draw
an analogy between the distinction outlined in A (LSP versus LSV) and
an *analogous distinction* that she feels should be recognized in the
realm of speech acts -- the realm of B, a distinction noted in the latter as
that between "[Kim's] use of sexually explicit material in her writing"
(meaning, work for publication) and "her aggressive pornographic
whatever that was directed to Jay" (meaning, an act of symbolic taunting
& aggression in this nouveau epistolary realm of words on screens).

The remainder of your post largely concerns an elucidation of
distinctions devolving from (mis)reading the text as a language act of
equivalence rather than as a language act of analogy.  Read in the latter
fashion, the intended sense should, I think, be clear.

/ / / / /

Finally, this is mainly a matter of varying senses of manners & courtesy.
Equally, it concerns different ways of construing the MEDIUM at hand.
Is this publication?  Is it conversation?  Is it equivalent to a performance
space, where whoever performs is, ipso facto, a performer?  Or is it
better to be understood -- through analogy -- as tantamount to the bar
where folks might sit around, after performances, and  chat congenially.

If, in the course of such a chat, someone (like JS) objects to the raucous
behavior of some of his bar-mates (like B.B.M&E), someone (like KD)
might -- fresh off the stage, perhaps, and still in fine form, venture to
transform the bar arena into a stage arena.  If the bar folk happen to be in
good humor, she might be able to pull it off, working such a magic on the
assembled friends.  But if (for instance) her performance involves "what
sure sound like" assaultive words that sure seem to be directed at a chap
at the bar to whom she's not been introduced, there's the danger that said
chap (and/or others sitting at adjoining tables) may conclude that what
looks like a duck & sounds like a duck and taunts like a duck, really is a
duck.  Those who recall all of KD's delightful duck impersonations in
past stage events, will no doubt know different -- and think better.  But
in the instance, or meantime, a lot of talk might well ensue.

best,
d.i.

Perhaps I can confuse matters by recounting a story. Some years ago I was
running a reminiscence workshop with elderly Jewish people at a Y in
Brooklyn. The subject of folk-cures came up. The usual stories about the
efficacy of leeches came forth, but also one old woman told us that she
regularly cured earaches by filling her ear with urine. It is, in fact, a
pretty good antibiotic if nothing better is at hand.
But it was her own urine. I think she would have found it indecorous to ask
someone else to piss in her ear.

Thanks, George, for responding to my question about whether the NYRB was a
balanced article. I would say that my reactions are similar to yours. I am
not familiar enough with Tagore's poetry to say anything certain, but I
have enjoyed what I have read (courtesy of David Israel) on this list,
particularly the poem about sailing paper boats down the river.

On another Indian (or Bengali) note, my wife and I recently watched the
Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray which I think was suggested by either Henry or
David. The three films follow the life of Apu from a young boy to
adulthood from approximately the 1920s to the 1940s. Each is outstanding
and it is readily apparent that Ray's graphics career contributed much to
his ability to frame scenes. The technique reminded me of the Iranian film
called "The White Balloon" (??) which came out last year. Everything in
the frame "does" something. My wife also pointed out the preponderance of
shots which involve door frames or gates or windows. All in all, visually
stunning.

And to tie Ray with Tagore, Ray attended Tagore's famous school,
Santinikaten.

best,
Steven

Bob Grumman,

Your typography is my idea of a sort of perfect past-time, the litcrit
equivalent of rotisserie baseball. Generally your categories seem okay,
though I wonder how I missed out on the "school" of flow-chart poetics. What
seems infinitely more interesting is to note how "other" tendencies show up
over time in what may appear for awhile to have been a stable field. Thus,
for example, I think if you look closely at any of the larger groupings
there (whether langpo or neoformalism), you will find that the really
interesting tendencies within them are in some very real sense Other.

On the other hand, this typography doesn't Tell Us Anything--i.e., it
doesn't add to any knowledge we might have about a given poet.

Also, the idea of langpo as "acadominant" suggests that your Prozac levels
are much too high. If it were acadominant, as you put it, we'd've gotten
Andy Levy some great job by now, Lee Ann Brown wouldn't have to work at a
gazillion different schools, Tom Mandel's software would be used by every
school in the country, Bob Grenier wouldn't be proofreading in a law firm,
Steve McCaffery would be offered jobs that actually exist, UCSD would to
acknowledge Rae Armantrout as a major component of its literature program
and give her things like a real salary and health benefits and Juliana Spahr
would be allowed to teach on the same continent. Etc. Etc. Etc. To quote
Cuba Gooding, Jr., Show me the ....

As possibly the only person on this list to have ever met both David Bromige

Orville was more Pee Wee Herman without the irony.

Rebecca --

further re:

>
> The methods of Chuang Tzu are those of the poet, and in the case of

pls. pardon if there was anything a tad snappy (if that's the word)
in my (earlier) post responsive to this.  The thing is, "analysis is
useless" is a formulation which is only useful in some contexts; in
others, it is (itself) a bit useless.  Or so I suppose.  It's
interesting that Waley describes Chuang Tze in those terms -- i.e.,
his "methods being those of the poet" -- since (on a formal or
literal level) it was (rather) Lao Tze who was the poet, whereas
Chuang Tze was the prose writer & storyteller.  I guess Waley uses
the expression "the poet" in a conventional (& idealizing) sense
rather than in any literal sense.  The notion of "the method of the
poet" is interesting, and has something to it.  For that matter, the
method of Chuang Tze (which Waley calls that of "the poet") seems to
me not dissimilar from that of Rabindranath Tagore (about which
George Thompson expressed certain reservations -- reservations which
I've oftentimes heard expressed, though I don't share them myself).

Call him whatever one might, to me Chuang Tze is one of the most
delightful of writers this world has seen.  The Inner Chapters (the
basic kernel of his work, comprised of texts that are generally
considered most certainly to have been written by him) are marvels of
mysticism.  To anyone who's not taken the time to give 'em a read,
Uncle David ventures to suggest: check it out.  I rather like the
version (w/ photos) done by Gia Gen-Fu [?? spelling not sure] & Jane
English in the '70s or so -- & still in print (poss. in a smaller
no-photo version).  Burton Watson's, too, is good (hopefully still in
print) -- probably could be considered the standard translation.
Thomas Merton's early rendering is more quirky -- it's okay, but he
didn't read Chinese, and the organization leaves something to be
desired.  No doubt you know the work, Rebecca -- I'm more rattling
here for poss. interest of other parties (and/or partiers).

d.i.

p.s.: am still thinking (bit more) abt. Dean Brink's quotation from
the "healing buddha" text of Snyder.  Okay, I'll admit I had a bit
of a mixed reaction to the poem myself, when it first appeared in a
journal somewhere, don't recall where -- might've been in the
quarterly TRICYCLE (which I'd recommend to anyone interested in
American Buddhism).  It seems that Snyder plays upon -- especially --
some Tibetan texts involving a healing Buddha.  I like his updating
of the ubiquitous (indeed, characteristic & unforgettable) Mahayana
penchant for beautiful hyperbolic descriptive evocations of vastitude --

>  It would take you twelve thousand summer vacations

Sandalwood?  Nice stuff.  I got out of the habit of lighting it, but
maybe the 4th is a good occasion to resume.  (Better than sparklers.)

For some sense of antecedents in Snyder's thinking re: sacred texts &
poetry &c, his letters to Howard McCord regarding the latter's
*Gnomonology* may prove of interest.  Gnomonology is online at:
http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/7641/

(Excerpts from two letters from Snyder appear as an Afterword to that
work; here's the more direct link to the Snyder pages:
http://www.geocities.com/Paris/LeftBank/7641/index23.html )

Like many before him, Snyder is no doubt among those who've been
somewhat influenced by a view of Sanskrit as a sort of UR-sacred
language -- a view of which George Thompson has had occasion briefly
to mention.  It's certainly a language that, once you've heard a bit
of it, does seem to hold evocative power.  Not many folks will
venture to include Sanskrit slokas in their American poems, but
Snyder is one such (though very rarely doing so).  I think anyone
so enamored of & embued by Buddhist studies over the course of so
many decades as this gent, might well be apt to do the same at some
point . . .   I found Allen Ginsberg's Boddhisattva invocations (in
the "Witchita Votex Sutra") stunning / arresting, when I heard AG
recite same at PS-122 abt. 9 years ago, with Phil Glass noddling at
the keyboard.  As could be said of other languages, but in perhaps
its own peculiar way, Sanskrit is a basic at some level of human
experience; -- in some lives we study it, in some we encounter it in
passing.  Seems we keep returning to languages . . . or they to us.
It's all a long, long haul & needs more than a month of Sundays.

minor postscriptum --

two notes:

1. memory resurfaces, and I realize that the antecedent grouping
should've been identified correctly as B.B.M.& R. [rather than &E.] -- so
apologies to pertinenet personages (though I don't suppose Rachel will
find me guilty of quite such wild acts of misattribution as noted the
legendary Bowering [er, okay, I mean Bromige] case.

2.  in my discussion-just-sent, I didn't happen to note that (w/ mild
paradox) I was initially a formulator of the of the "KD as performance"
school of interpretation -- a school for which Kali has made herself an
able spokesperson.  (And there was also another gent who articulated
this view well -- pardon I don't recall his name at this point.)

In any event, in context of my discussion to which this forms a p.s., I
don't think there's special incongruity in that parenthetical micro-history;
-- that's not (for instance) out of keeping with the concluding bar-talk
metaphor.  Merely shows that when I saw her walk in the door, I
reckoned KD approached the bar arena as a legit performance space.
[Have seen fine performances tricked out as bar spaces, for that matter --
esp. among the faux- or neo-cabaret set.  E.g., was quite the thing at
LaMama, circa '90.]  To a certain degree, perhaps we all do (even those
who convene here mainly to unwind, or share news, or argue critically
abt. the day's shows, or to talk up tomorrow's set, or to get roaring
sauced).  To what degree, might be what's at issue.

A factor seems to be how attentive one is (or care to be) to little feedback
loop(s) that tell useful things, if one's at all minded to attend to them.
Like -- is someone witting the joke, or getting the point?  Do I care
(finally) to communicate? -- is this crowd too obtuse for my subtle
sophistry? . . .

and other things too . . . like, what's that bluesy music in the background?
Who's footing the bill?  Is that a pool table yonder?  What's this grain of
wood resemble?  How old was the tree?  Is the cognac from France? Are
those stars there, out the window? . . .

just a note on the ms thread: i find it offensive when students refer to
male professors as professor so and so but to me as ms/miss damon.  both ms
and miss are equally offensive in that context, where i feel i'm being
de-professorized because of my gender, the assumption being that a woman
couldn't possibly be a *real* professor. it is no less offensive --in fact
it is more so--in that the student does not intend to be insulting me. of
course, i am gentle with them, since they are nice kids and it's not their
fault that society demeans women. i don't show the extent of my
offendedness, sometimes  don't correct them at all. but it is nonetheless
offensive--md

Poetas, techno division:

Lateley a Po Listie asked me about what's up w/ the listserv silence.

Here's my "educated guess" reply, for poss. general interest . . .

> Hey David.                        . . . . I wonder what's up with
> my mail.  I'm not getting any for long stretches, and then some

As I understand it, what's up is this . . .  The listserv has a
computer-maintained limit of 50 posts per day (each "day" ends at
midnight, east coast time).  If the list hits 50 posts prior to end of
day -- or, if it exceeds 50 (not sure which), then what happens is (a)
the excess posts are put on hold, and (b) the list is sort of put on
hold till the list-owner (Charles Bernstein) manually "releases" it --
when he does that, then (a) all the held posts are distributed, and
(b) the new "day" officially begins.  So if Charles is off on vacation
or not logged on or not attentive to the fact he needs to do
something, then we'all can cool our heels till he takes note of the
situation.  I think that formerly, a chap named Joel Kuszma [sp?] was
taking care of this admin. stuff, but he's moved from Buffalo and now
presumably Charles is doing so himself, presumably not quite as
attentively as Joel -- and the situation is exacerbated [sp?] by fact
that lately, with all the fast & furious posting going on, we've been
apt to hit the 50 mark somewhat early on (e.g., mid-afternoon) . .  .

that's the techno answer according to my understanding.  I actually
posted two (! count 'em) poem-type-items during the 1st list hiatus,
dealing with same.  Now we're in the midst of another -- and it seems
possible that good Charles might not take note of this one till after
the 3-day weekend! (just a wild guess) -- last time, I sent him a
couple backchannel notes to try to bring the situation to his
attention, but I'm not sure if I want to become a list-pest & do that
each time.  In past, he's occasionally sent out backchannel notes
encouraging folks (on an individual basis) not to over-post.  But
sometimes, when dialogues are happening, some notion of rationing by
strict numbers, doesn't necessarily work well . . .

will that suffice for a long answer? -- this is my empirically-based
understanding.  (Don't really know all the techno specifics.)

does anyone recognize these lines:
ficus flower, unspeakable the bridge to thee
ficus flower, thy pardon for this tortured history
?

or this:

Part One:  Across the Southern night, and all afternoon the water calms you
softly, white and black, Mary Magdalen eves you, stumbling homeless
gardeners to grief, and bound by infant bone, we drag ourselves back to the
naked copies of your flesh

or this?

o pilots in robes of white skin, in the approach to the black rock, with
their great gouged-out eyes, and the actors in gouged-out skins, a star of
no allegiance traveling the heights of a green [century?], 'cuz all along
their seafronts tall cities flamed in the sun of the sea of Baal, in the
sea of Mamm=F3n, the sea of all ages, the sea without limits, the sea withou=

Subject:      power in language
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

As Beth Joselow said to me earlier today, "when Dodie writes something I
read it." This is certainly the only interest I can muster in the Dawn Din.

Still, I can't help commenting on it, because it seems so odd that Bellamy
and Tal and perhaps others too want to distinguish between language and
physicality and to remove violence from language. Effective violence.

Doesn't that seem sort of ridiculous? Language is altogether and immensely
physical and effective and powerful; and this need have nothing to do with
being able to translate what you say into physical fact.

Would Jay Schwartz have been justified to feel a moment (or more) of fear
when someone unknown to him offered via email to cut his nipples off? I
think so, and that's enough for me. I think what Kim Dawn -- if such a
person exists -- did is  stupid.

Actually, when I saw "her" first post, my initial reaction was to feel
afraid for her. I nearly backchanneled her an email to be careful what she
said. Expressing sexual longing (which is what her first post did) online
is an invitation to be harrassed. In language and otherwise.

For a long time people said that Jews had little horns on their heads,
vestiges of their devilish provenance and reminders of their continued
devilish connections. Those who so said had no power individually to harm
those Jews. Just ordinary people. Somewhat later, Jews were made to don
horns and march around town squares. Again by ordinary people. These two
facts are part of one another. There is no difference (and this, btw, is
why in the past I have seemed so insistant in my resistance to little
"harmless" expressions that are only a little racist).

I owe the apt analogy of horns on Jews to conversation with Beth too.

Lisa Jarnot quoted Robert Duncan here, to the effect that we need to
remember that Hitler was just another person, a human possibility perhaps
not so very different from our own. Right, and it is to the seriousness of
what we do and say that Robert was referring. (horns on us all, if you will).

It's a shame to have to be so serious. A shame not to just be able to
threaten to cut the nipples off someone one doesn't know and then call it
"art." Or whatever. Instant attention. It's a "work."

Someone somewhere right now is torturing someone whose opinions (or
whatever else) are foreign. Cutting that person's nipples off.

Obviously, these remarks don't exhaust the relationships between violence
and language in art: a relationship which extends from Homer and the Torah
to Burroughs, Genet, Fanon, Kathy Acker, and on. It may be necessary to
embed that human issue in our work, it is necessary to some. I just can't
read an uncontextualized email threat on a real person in quite that way.

Anyway, once you've done it once it's kind of a bore. I find (the sexuality
of) Kim Dawn's writing an utter bore (but, then, she may well find my work
boring. I sure hope so).

Give me George Bataille any day. Sappho. Truman Capote. Raymond Chandler.
Simone Weil. Tzvetaeva. Lyn Hejinian/Carla Harryman's "The Wide Road." Or
the work of Dodie Bellamy. When she writes something, I want to stop what
I'm doing and read  what she has written.

Was Tagore writing to throw out the British?  Did Gandhi's success make him
a poet? Have you read his autobiography?  pre-modern, yes, romantic, yes,
but bad?
I, personally, would learn Bengali before making such a statement, not only
because his fellow Bengalis think him great, but also because he translated
himself most of what is translated at all.  Poets of the sub-continent seem
to attract bad translators and I don't think they should translate (but
edit, certainly) their own work either, as so often happens.

I, personally, read much more into those bad translations than you do and
disagree with your assessment of Tagore.  He has been translated into Thai,
too; perhaps Thai is a better language for his type of poetics than English.
Of course, if you don't LIKE his writing, that's an entirely different case
altogether, but comparing Tagore to Gandhi is comparing the proverbial
apples and oranges, isn't it?  Is your orientalism showing?

Subject:      Waley reference
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

The methods of Chuang Tzu are those of the poet, and in the case of
poetry analysis is useless.

Arthur Waley, Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China, preface

He also quotes Chuang Tzu, somewhat further on:

A basket trap is for holding fish; but when one has got the fish, one thinks
no more about the basket.  A foot-trap is for holding hares; but when one
has got the hare one need think no more about the trap.  Words are for
holding ideas; but when one has got the idea, one need think no more about
the words.  If only I could find someone who has stopped thinking about
words (yen) and have him to talk (yen) to.

He then proceeds to a discussion of the trials of the translator with
respect to the words yen (both noun and verb words and talk), a dilemma
which, I imagine, would have delighted both Chuang Tzu and Han Shan.  This
contemporary application of an ancient shred of verse is a clear
illustration that the poetry of the original has become insubstantial when
thought of in words.  Think of this: if poetry is the trap, what are we
catching?

Given that I, myself, delight in the intricacies of translation (which often
inspire me), I am hardly anti-reference.  Also, I have no objection to
orientalists, only think that their findings should be carefully
scrutinized, if you please.  Fortunately, Waley held himself to the same
standards as those writers he translated, because we are much the richer for
his interest in the Orient.  As for Gary Snyder, I sincerely doubt that I
will be able to comment upon the work in question unless someone puts it on
the web, for my home is far away and my budget limits me to the internet,
the New York Review of Books and Thai litterature and poetry.

However, I do think that Buddhism needs some investigation on site by those
interested by it because assumptions are made about the Orient on this
basis.  As religion becomes less important to a new generation, the devout
have become positively fanatic and a collection of Buddhist Poetry would be
regarded by the former as to be avoided under all circumstances in order to
prevent boredom.  Contrary to popular belief, not every Thai male enters the
monkhood, but Thai social convention and superstition prevent open
disrespect.  In other words, they think the monks are full of it but are
also afraid they'll be struck down by lightning for thinking.

As example, a few months ago I participated in a ceremony performed for a
wealthy woman by nine monks who received very generous donations to their
respective temples. After the service, while being escorted home, several
were heard to be discussing using the donations to travel to the United
States to visit temples there.  And, although I do not equate this type of
behavior with Buddhism,  I can see how people would become disillusioned by
their religion when it's practitioners act in such a manner.  I do not
intend to participate at this time in a discussion of religion, belief and
practice and will not repond to anyone who does, but use the point to debunk
certain myths of the Orient.  As I said, Western Oriental Societies are
quite fascinating.

To close this off and with respect to purifying ears, I would like to point
out that the hermits et al of Chuang Tzu fame were mostly musicians running
away from Confucius.  I would imagine they ran to water (rivers, springs,
oceans, ponds) not to purify but to bring to mind the changeable nature of
water itself.

Since i get digest and then only read them every third day or so, so on a
bit of atime warp

I work with the public (state employee) and consciously refer--exept for
those occasions where i'm comfortable just going on a first name basis (my
office is in a wealthy suburb)--to all women as Ms (& men as Mr.). yes,
there will for a long time be people & institutions holding on to old
prejedicial notions, but cant let their attitudes hold back a useful tool
for change (to get to a place where Miss & Mrs are perhaps the slang terms,
and Ms is standard.)
Like in those occasions where my writing needs a 3rd person that could be
either gender, i use e (or er for pssessive.)

as to the other comment, i feel the best way to reach the bropasedest
audience is to intuitigely get inside language, get language speaking
through you. you need to do the opposite of 'try', which may be 'be.' this
does not mean leaving the self out (tho it usuals means leaving out
intentions and plans) since all music is influenced by instrument its coming
out of (& considering the musician as part of the instrument.)

REVEALING MALE BODIES

Edited by Nancy Tuana, William Cowling, Maurice Hamington, Greg Johnson,
and Terrance MacMullan

We invite submissions for an anthology of original essays exploring the
experience of male embodiment to be published by Indiana University
Press.  Revealing Male Bodies will examine how men's bodies are
physically and experientially constituted by the economic, theoretical,
and social practices in which men are immersed. This anthology will
consciously respond to the challenge raised by feminist theorists to
provide explorations of male lived experiences. Articles addressing, but
not limited to, the following topics are sought:

* Intersections of Race and Maleness
* Phenomenologies of Male Embodiment
* The Social Construction of Male Bodies and Male Lived Experience
* Relations Between Male Bodies and Power
* The Epistemological Significance of Male Bodies
* The Male Body as a Site of Resistance
* Relations Between Cultural Imagery of Maleness and Lived Male
        Experience
* The Impact of Male Lived Experience on Cognitive or Creative
        Activities

In addition to the above topics, the editors are interested in articles
that address the intersections of phenomenological and social
constructivist methodologies, as well as pieces that provide avenues for
dealing with male bodies and male embodiment in ways that avoid or
transform traditional understandings of essentialism.

We encourage works that reflect diverse approaches, methodologies, and
styles.  Given the anthology's multi-disciplinary character, we invite
papers which balance rigorous scholarship and general accessibility.

There will be a two step review process.  If you are interested in
writing for this anthology please submit an abstract of no more than 500
words and a vita by January 15, 1998.  Based upon a review of the abstracts,
potential contributors will be notified to submit a completed paper for
consideration.  The deadline for submission of the final article is July
1, 1998.

Please send two hard copies of abstracts to:

A friend sent me these lines; I'm unfamiliar with the translation,
but it seems a telling specimen of this poet's fine utterance.

   I am a mountain.
   My words, my sounds are from my beloved.
   I am a painting.
   My beloved is my painter.
   Did you think these are my words?
   They are the sounds
   Which come after the key turns in the lock.

As you know, a mortal can only be God for a day. It was curiously
refreshing, as you'll see when your turn comes around. Nothing to prove any
more. Anxiety free. But then, a little tiresome, having to watch every
sparrow fall. And knowing ahead of time that it is about to fall. Mark
Weiss, dont blame yourself, I made you post that private message, publicly.
I made Henry G post that message against further provocation that included
in qualifying what had looked like a previous apology the possibility of
provoking david bromige further. I made Alson Nielsen listen to an hour of
Bob Dylan to find phrases for his postings. Yes, and I held up the List for
my day, just to let matters cool down a bit. And I decided to have Aldon
expose the david bromige/kali tal hoax, & to let Charles Alexander confirm
it with his posting that revealed david bromige was in tucson addressing a
group of which Kali Tal is a member and yet as we some of us know Kali Tal
was _not_ present at this event. (Subtle of Charles not to mention this
last fact. I make Charles subtle).   Yes, & I found Susan Schulz a new
place to live, there on Hui Iwa. But thats the end of good deeds, I'm
stepping back into my "real""actual""true""valid" i.d. as davy b. Oh, two
final acts as God: Mike Magee, I never said I was fair, only just : as in,
"Crushed balls? No penis? Well that's *just* too bad. You cant come into
the synagogue, because thats just too bad." And Douglas Barbour : I made
you post that wonderful piece of canadian speech to show how God works.
First, he sets your brain on fire; next, he has people pissing all over you
in an attempt to get it in your ear.

Hope you-all werent too shocked when I had Kali Tal expose her role-playing
in this recent "my-brain's-on-fire" spectacle.

David Bromige, going to mop myself up now.

Interesting observations, Steven Marks, about visuality/ scene
"framing" in Satiyajit Ray's early films.  You note,

> And to tie Ray with Tagore, Ray attended Tagore's famous school,
> Santinikaten.

More than that, Ray made several films based on Tagore stories --
such as (I believe) the very lovely black & white film *Charulatta*.
This film includes an interesting scene of the "process of poetry
writing".  The heroine, Charulatta, is being taught to read and write
Bengali, and we see her in the midst of early experiences of poetry
composition.  (It seems a useful "classic" film passage, perhaps, for
considering how that process is understood & portrayed.)  The later
Ray film *The Home and the World* (Ghair / Bhair I think is the
Bengali) is based on an epistolary novel by Tagore.  I suspect there
may've been other films by Ray likewise based on Tagore's stories --
he was a novelist and a fine short story writer, as well as a poet &
composer & -- later in life -- a rather experimental painter.

I don't think I'll enter into the Tagore (and/or Gandhi) debate at
leasts until returning to the NYROB article & finishing it -- I read
some paragraphs a while ago while dining at Planet Hollywood --
learned (at least) that Tagore was evidently the source (or
popularizer) of the honorific "Mahatma" . . .  I found myself
mentally quibbling with the article's attempt to demystify Tagore, in
the sense of seeming to suggest it's a mistake to view him as a
mystic.  True, it may be a mistake to construe him as a mystic as
that term was (rather narrowly) conceived by some in the early part
of this century.  Found it interesting that Pound was an early
advocate on Tagore's behalf -- and that Yeates was (evidently) later
so strongly anti-Tagore (after having 1st been so starry-eyed an
admirer) . . .  Anyway, I think the world of Tagore and his writing,
and -- like Rebecca -- find there's a tremendous lot one can get from
(or read into) his poetry.   I can understand the reaction and how it
can be read as seeming like "sentimental romantic" stuff, but I find
it's pretty easy to get beyond such (imho) superficial response, even
with the English versions done by Tagore (which are, certainly, in
the late Victorian mold) -- and very rewarding to do so.  Interesting
that Tagore seems to have been admired by a number of Latin American
poets (as witness, for instance, Neruda's translation of at least one
of his poems).  But I wasn't going to say anything . . . .

Surely a mistake on Delmore's part. The oral history makes plain the regard
in which Stevens was held in the field--one high executive claims that
Stevens revolutionized aspects of the insurance business.

Bet you can blame Disney for that. (And what *can't* you blame Walt for?)
Disney took Felix Salton's quite potent fawn-to-buck bildungsroman and
wimped the resourceful protagonist up into a doe-eyed Steif cuddly-toy,
feminizing him so effectively that they never even considered doing Salton's
*second* Bambi book on screen, _Bambi's Children_, cause it's just too silly
to think that the high-voiced adolescent could ever get up the gumption to
*breed*.  Besides, nobody ever reads _The Yearling_ anymore, and few people
have any concept of the viciousness of a cornered deer.  Disney's Bambi
never could be the kind of King of the Forest that, say, the Lion King could
pull off--the lion's a predator, for crissake. And what chance does an
*herbivore* have to be manly anyway, especially if he ain't an elephant
(cause size *does* matter, y'know).  It's sorta like little boys get called
"Tiger" and little girls get called "Kitten."  There're both male and female
housecats, but no *real* man would ever compare himself to a housecat,
right?  So, no *real* man would ever name his boy after a deer 'cause it
gets eaten by real men (and he-man animals like wolves and mountain lions).
All this animal identity stuff gets so complicated, doesn't it?  Like Lassie
(who was supposed to be a female dog character) being portrayed by a series
of male dogs who apparently could pull off playing females better than any
of their female counterparts.  Sure, inattentiveness probably has something
to do with it (I mean, you don't expect a lot of attention from people who
name their daughters Bambi, right?), but I think animal gender stereotyping
is THE REAL ISSUE HERE.

Now me, I'm low-slung, I weigh 140, got big nasty teeth, and a helluva
snarl.  You won't catch anybody trying to get underneath me to see if I'm
male or female, and that's a good thing 'cause I'd bite their fucking face
off. World would be a better place if people started naming their daughters
after me, I think...

Here's a thought. Lots of films are shot in different language versions--a
take in English,a take in German, remember which is which when you splice
them together, and voila! Two markets without the expense of dubbing. By
analogy, maybe Disney could do two versions of films. If there's a Lion
King, why not a Lion Queen? How about Prince Charming and the Seven Dwarfs?
(Not clear what they could do with Pocahontas or Hercules)

"It's also bad karma to work at a job full-time and not go at it as
seriously as you were going at being a full-time poet. Wallace Stevens,
incidently, was not just an insurance man. He was vice-president of the
Hartford Casualty Company. I mean there's no sense fooling around; if
you're going to do something, you might as well be good at it."

Well, no, you wouldn't be.  That's the funny thing.  I mean, it's hard to
consider the male dog who played Lassie as a dog-in-drag, cause he was just
walkin around bein the dog that he is.  It's *people* who were looking at a

Actually, the tradition of boy-for-girl dog goes way back to the very first
Lassie film (perhaps analogous to the practice of all-male casts in
Shakespeare's day?). That first dog had to be trained to act female, but
none of the other males would drink with him afterwards.

Some interesting things have been written about identity and poetics, but
before I offer even a quick response, I would like to make a remark or two
about passages from some of the recent exchanges that...well, the more I
thought about them, the more they troubled me.

I'm wondering why it is necessary or even whether it is such a good idea
to make sweeping formulaic generalizations that contrast academics with
non-academics and critics with artists.  I really do not know what is
meant by these terms or even why they are being used.  Now I can
understand talking about specific texts and specific writers, but I have
to wonder what is up when people (and texts) are lumped into broad
categories. I know we like to think we're in the business of analysis on
this list (some of us even fancy ourselves historical analysts), but such
monolithic characterizations as these seem both reductive and lacking in a
certain respect for the people (and texts)  involved.  I would have hoped
that at least some of the thinking about reading and writing over the past
twenty or so years (including, say, some of Derrida's -- say his arguments
against thematism in Mallarme criticism in the second half of "The Double
Session") has at least demonstrated the dangers of such reduction (even if
it is convenient when it comes time to talk about such things to give a
sort of formula and ask everyone to plug it in ...some of my particularly
geeky science friends would love it).

Think of it... "academic" ... "critic" ... "theory" ... "artist" (and all
the writers and texts these terms include) all wrapped up in a neat
package of quick-thaw historical and philosophical assumptions and
grounds: diverse and complex writing and people reduced to single, simple
terms. Bang. It's done.  Hardly seems necessary to read...  I don't know..
I realize certain shorthands are necessary for these discussions...but it
seems to me that we are supposed to be in the business of reading and
reading implies a sensitivity to the complexity of each work in our hands
(and posts on our screen) and formulations like these elide over that
sensitivity.

To be honest, the truth is, when I read, I don't read "writers"; I read
texts. Some of these texts are signed by good people (Frank) some are
signed by bad people (Celine, Pound) ...I read for that (and the
implications of those signatures) too.  Some of these texts I read as
fascist or postcolonial or artsy fartsy or whatever ...I try and
understand that (and the operations of engaging with those texts) too.
Now, with email,it seems to me the signature is even more problematic and
I, for one, am not nearly as comfy as some people have been in drawing
conclusions from the words on my screen about the people at the keyboard.

Anyway, Celine is possibly a good signature to bring up in this context.
It has always seemed to me that despite everyone's best efforts to make
them so given what we know about the author, Celine's novels turn out to e
not fascist at all. In fact, when I read them, they actually, by some
amazing transformation of ideology and language within style, fight
against almost everything that is fascist about literature and learning in
the Western world, particularly in the 20th Century.  Just read the
brilliant and hilarious introduction to *Guignol's Band* for a dramatic
example of this...it works in the most comically absolute ways against
absolutism, including its own.  This is not an argument about
intentionality or personal politics, this is just my delighted reading of
especially the first five novels.  The pamphlets are of course the worst
sort of fascism and anti-Semitism, and should be read rigourously in these
terms; not merely to indict yet another dead author, but to detail the
workings of this sort of discourse. But the novels are so often in
precisely the opposite spirit of the boring repetitive pamphlets that they
too deserve to be read as the peculiar often perversely joyous discourses
they offer.  I find them, in many places, actually quite liberating.  I
have just finished reading the new translation of *London Bridge* (the
sequel to *Guignol's Band*) and find some of the comic scenes in there
(those in the home of the gas-masker for instance) worthy of the best 20th
Century irony and satire.  (I think there is, I should perhaps mention,
far more fascism at work in certain texts of Disney or Stallone than in
any of Louis-Ferdinand's fiction.)

This is just to say that the new Witz is out (5.2 for those keeping
track), and it features an article by Mikhail Epstein--"Some Speculations
on the Mystery of Araki Yasusada."  Epstein's piece deals with "the
construction of authorship" and places the "Yasusada" work in the Russian
literary tradition of the "multi-generic form of diaries, letters,
verses, comments, etc."  He offers two hypotheses regarding the possible
authorship of the Yasusada poems...both with a Russian connection.  It's
a fascinating essay.

Also in the new issue: an essay by William Marsh on "Memory, Hypertext &
Poetry"; a review of Joe Ross's "The Fuzzy Logic Series" from Chris
Stroffolino; and a response by Stephen Ellis to Jefferson Hansen's
"Anarchism and Culture" essay in Witz 4.3.

Witz is available only by mail from the publisher.  Individual copies are

seemed to me the point of the Schwartz anecdote about Wallace "I led two
lives" Stevens was not so much that it denigrated Stevens' insurance
skills as it highlit the way in which Stevens career, as poet, profited
immensely from the "paradox" of his day job.  There was obviously
something in our culture that was reassured that avant garde poetry could
be written by insurance executives and suburban obstreticians -- or if it
wasn't "the culture," at least Time magazine liked it.

Interesting. I wasn't aware that Time had taken up the case of Dr. Williams,
but if it did it must have been very late in his career (I don't think the
rag existed until the mid thirties). I know very little about the popular
reception of Stevens' poetry, beyond some anecdotes. When did Time discover
and embrace Stevens? Elucidation, please.
I think strong case could be and has been made for the importance of his
practice to Williams' poetry, despite his frequent irritation about it. Good
to remember that Desert Music and Asphodel got writ after his retirement.
As for the effect of the corporate millieu or the intricacies of insurance
law on The Emperor of Icecream, quien sabe? One would like to think that
there was some, but then one would have to look for the impact of the
business on Ives' music (other than to limit his production) or watercolor
painting on Ruggles, or the influence of the customs shed on Rousseau, or,
for that matter, on the Melville of Billy Budd and the Hawthorne of the
Tales and the early novels. Much as I like to believe in the unitary life
(perhaps as elusive as the unitary personality), I know that people have the
capacity to encapsulate aspects of their lives (and selves)--sometimes there
appears to be no influence from one side of the wall to the other.

Cerise and chartreuse may appear as retinal afterimages of each other.
Look at a large, brightly lit area of either color for afew minutes,
then look at a white wall lit less brilliantly. What do you see?

I'm perfectly willing to leave this as a matter of personal taste and to
let it go at that. Please note that I did hedge my judgment of T's English
poetry a little bit, though perhaps not enough for your taste. But a few
brief points:

1. I compared Tagore and Gandhi because that is what the article did which
Steven Marks inquired about. It was called "Tagore and His India" and was
much more about T's role in "his India" than about his poetry. The article
is based on a comparison of two huge icons looming over post-independence
India. In this sense both T & G are apples.

2. Actually, if anything is showing in my post it is probably the influence
of the modernism of Pound and Yeats, et al., which has permanently
determined the way in which I hear, and don't hear, poetry [permanently?
well, maybe not].

3. The damage that the British occupation of India has done to India was /
is not just economic, of course. For several centuries Indian intellectual
discourse has been dominated by British modes, and I think you can see both
T & G coming to terms with this domination [and independence from it] in
different ways. I think that most students of India [Indologists] would
agree that in many ways the very notion of "Hinduism", and the
self-designation "I am Hindu", is largely a British [& European] invention.


You would see my orientalism showing most nakedly, I suppose, if you asked
me my opinion of the the behavior of the British in India [or China, etc.]:
it was *utterly* detestable. And you would understand why I admire so much
Gandhi's quick response to a reporter's question: What do you think of
western civilization?

He said, of course: "It would be a good idea."

George Thompson

p.s. Speaking of detestable, there is a vile quote from D.H. Lawrence in
the article. Check it out!

I also deeply admire Ray's films.

The afterimage -- suggesting a neural (at least) opposite, may have a
number of correlates on other levels of psyche & perception.

The phonemic particulars (chartreuse / cerise) are no addicent.
Consider these afterimages:

  excuse /   caprise

  caboose /   valise

  abuse /   release

  noose /   lease

  goose /   niece

  use /   peace

look at any first term, then shut your eyes, and like as not, the 2nd
term will be standing there before you.  And if (for instance) the
goose were attired in chartreuse, what sort of outfit do you think
the niece will be wearing?  I rest my case (or, as my be, valise).

d.i.

p.s.: btw, what sort of "demands on the nervous system" is cerise
"known to make" I wonder?  (Does this mean that beholding the color
is a somewhat trying experience?)  Are there correlative -- or
expandable -- color responses?  A shade that produces sweet quietude.
A hue that elicits profound confusion.  A tint that evokes langour.
A color known to be rather dangerous, as its use contributes to a
level of cognitive comprehension, the results of which appear (to
those not accustomed to the color and its results) as iconoclasm,
argumentativeness, or bad listserv behavior.  A combination of shades
that instantly establishes harmonious interpersonal & interspecies
dealings.  (Like, say, azure?)

p.p.s.:  this chartuese / cerise thread calls to mind some of our
other interesting  (or slightly rarer) color terms:

  azure, kelly, taupe, ecru, crimson, scarlet, celedon --

p.p.p.s.  recalls a poem of Han Shan's (per moi):

  What birds express    my heart cannot endure
  when so I lie down    in my rustic hermitage

  the peach & cherry   turning scarlet-scarlet
  the willow & poplar   don their slender foliage

  the morning sun    o'er-saling azurite hills
  clear clouds     bathe in the kelly pond

  who know I pass    beyond the dusty world
  in swift ascent   of the south slope of Han Shan?

Bob---- ...Uh "acadominant"??? seems pretty snide...er, pretty inaccurate
too. May fit in well with the general feel of the list right now, though,
which despite individuals involved with launching it seems (rather
mindlessly)  hostile recently to langpo as a historical frame of
ref...I've never come close to being an academic (just a wage slave
scurrying around in the interstices of the machine) but langpo don't look
too dominant in academe from where I'm sitting...Nor dominated *by*
academe (the other way of unpacking this.)

Surely "jump-cut" was only a good way to think of Ashbery around Tennis
Court Oath time, with rapid montage and cutup techniques making his work
rapid and shifting..Much of it since then has had a smoother flow.
Bleed-fade transitions, maybe, but not a structure based on
jump-cutting...

Of course there's some question as to *why* do this kind of lumping..But
it brings up issues about poetry that are interesting to talk about. I
feel that the answer to your question, re no one responding to your
earlier posts, has something to do with the list becoming a space for
chatter.  All listservs go thru periods like that, unfortunately.

Simplicity, when you tie a ribbon over the middle of the word, gives you
Sim City. Someone tell me more about David Papineau. There's a sharpish
review of Huw Price's _Time's Arrow and Archimedes' Point_ by said DP in
the TLS of a month ago. Same issue has a nice if insufficiently complex
piece on middle-period Clare, with a nice suggestion that Clare's refusal
to subordinate the pastoral details to a romantic general connects him up
with a medieval way of looking, pre-perspective. What Peirce is or has
been to Henry, Fordie is to me, and rather than go Amis-wise straight back
from chaos to boom, and does this make me an impressionist? I make efforts
at being organized (leaving instructions on how to find things) but slide
from one memory to one impression to one theory. Entropy? Writing like
smoke? Theories go "sideways"?  God isn't David Bromige or crab-claws or
"the gym of serenity" (Chris Stroffolino's phrase). The MIT lab program
"Life"'s rules -- a cell bordered by cells on three sides dies? Never
having understood what Olson Dorn and Creeley meant by "outward" I go
wading; it's pretty for months. Men. Being edgy is a form of publication,
and list members remember "sideways"? God isn't bordered? Bored? Derobed
and alkaline? It agrees and makes book. Efforts at being clear are
psychological efforts. Efforts at accuracy are philosophical efforts. And
then we left the world of details, and woke up in the world of
fluid-mechanics. "You're putting me through some changes" is not something
you overhear now though. I've read theory, it's okay to watch the video
within a week of the event. Women do not accept such mush. This woman
doesn't, I'm a wife. Coincidentally, entropy is (often) peace. J

Hey Kali, I just spent a couple of days clawing at my computer and the
Poetics Archives, thinking I was responsible for the missing installments
of the continuing discussion, and wanting to keep up with it. I read every
word you & Dodie Bellamy (and even David Bromige) write. Don't assume all
of those Archie Bunker used to call "regular white guys" are trying to shut
you up. Please continue, and don't diss your readers. sp

The latest word from the poetics typology front down here in
blisteringly hot Port Charlotte, Florida, is good: so far I've
had FIVE responses to my list of Poetry Schools, and four of them
have offered constructive criticism.  The fifth was a request to
post my list at another poetry discussion site, which was fine
with me.

One of the other four, a private one from Hugh Steinberg,
suggested that I add a new school (or sub-school) to my list--and
I did.  It's the sub-school responsible for "Spoken Word/Slam
Poetry."  It's now no. 6 under "Contra-Genteel Poetry."
I'm not sure why I overlooked this kind of poetry previously but
think it was probably because I tend to consider it a form of
performance poetry.  In some cases it might be sound poetry,
too.

Then there was the brief message posted by dan featherston asking
what was "contra" about Maya Angelou.  My response: "My calling
Maya Angelou Contra-Genteel might not be accurate, I'm not sure.
I tossed her name in without much reflection, and without
rereading what I have of her work.  My impression is that she
does a lot of vernacular stuff as opposed "poetic" stuff, so,
yes, diction (is where she's contra-genteel).  But( she's) also
anti-genteel in being oppositional politically.  But so are many
genteel mainstream poets (and the contra-genteel category is
basically street rough versus the suburb polite of the mainstream
category in philosophy, diction and subject-matter), so I guess
I'd just say she was a little more directly and confrontationally
oppositional than mainstream poets (when she's contra-genteel).
But this is one of the fuzzy spots in my list that needs more
thinking."

Dan later mentioned that he's going to have "a brief essay in
next _chain_ that addresses this issue of inclusion/who's
speaking and being spoken for: her inaugural poem and the
coolidge/fagin take on it."

Third of my respondents was Robert Archambeau who wondered about
my "distinction between surrealist poetry (typified by
Robert Bly) and jump-cut poetry (typified by John Ashbery)."  As
Robert pointed out, "Edward Germain classed Ashbery as a
surrealist in _English and American Surrealist Poetry_ (Penguin,
'78), and a pretty strong case can be made that he's right.  And
Bly called his own poetry "deep-image".  Don't know where I'd
draw a line or what I'd call it. . ."

I tend to think of surrealist poetry as juxtapositioning of
incongruous images, and jump-cut (a term first used to describe
a kind of poetry by Charles Wright, I believe) as
juxtapositioning of incongruous actions.  In my formal taxonomy
the two poetries are the sole subclasses of what I call
"Idiological Poetry," so I've always recognized their similarity.
That they might be one school hadn't occurred to me, and might
make sense.  As for which, exactly, Ashbery is (if either),
that's a problem for those who know more about his work than I.
(The same is true of which school or schools to put Maya Angelou
in.)  Bly seems to me pretty certainly a surrealist poet.  His
term, "deep-image," might be used to specify what  kind  of
surrealist poet he is.

I have to admit to not knowing enough about most poets properly
to assign them to schools.  It's one of the areas I'll really
need help to make my list reasonably accurate.

Robert A. also mentioned David Kellogg's paper on the shape of the
American poetic field.  I got an outline of this paper from
David the first time I had my list of schools up.  It made a lot
of sense, particularly in mapping the tensions between the four
main poetry schools, in David's view, two of them pushing
east/west against each other, the other two north/south against
each other.  So he's not just listing schools, like I am, but
analyzing their relations to each other.  He left my two favorite
schools out of his scheme, though, so I could only give him an A-
for his effort.

My harshest critic so far has been Ron Silliman.  He was right, I
have to confess, in chiding me for putting "flow-chart poetry" on
my list.  I think I've seen only one specimen from that "school"
in my life.  I tend to try to bulk up the Pluraesthetic School
because it's one of my two specialties as a critic.  On the other
hand, listing ersatz schools like the flowchart school--and semi-
ersatz ones like the mathematical poetry school which probably
has less than half-a-dozen serious practitioners worldwide--might
inspire others to make viable schools of them.  Then, too, it's
better to list too many schools than too few.

I agree with Ron that the tendencies toward otherness in many of
the major schools are interesting--but they have nothing to do
with the purpose of my list, which is simply to chart what kinds
of poetries are being composed in this country--to try to keep
any from being overlooked.  That my typology "doesn't Tell Us
Anything," meaning, "it doesn't add to any knowledge we might
have about a given poet," is similarly irrelevant.  My typology
isn't about individual poets, it's about groups.  It is
particularly not about any poet whose work we already know, but
about poets whose work we don't know, and might like an extremely
general idea of.  It's about introductory knowledge about unknown
poets, not about insights into known poets.

As for my description of langpo as "acadominant," I was hoping
it'd get enough of a rise out of some langpoer to make him
respond to my list.  Whether it was the only reason Ron said
anything about my list, I don't know, but it did seem to get a
rise out of him.

Actually, I don't know enough about the academy or about the
socio-economic aspects of poetry in America to use the term in
any philosophically responsible way.  On the other hand, my
impression, from way outside the hub, is that language poetry has
been the dominant serious poetry in the academy in this country
since the beginning of this decade or earlier.  It seems to me
that SUNY, Buffalo, has become the academic center of poetry in
America.  This might only be due to my having friendships mainly
with people in language poetry or sympathetic to it, and who thus
see it as Very Large--and to friendships with people in visual
poetry who are NOT sympathetic to langpo, because they consider
it, hang on to your hat, The Establishment, and who thus also see
it as Very Large.

In any case, the trouble many people in lang po might be having
getting decent positions in academia doesn't prove langpo is not
acadominant.  Acadominance cannot be expected to translate into
IMMEDIATE distribution of academic jobs.  I have very little
knowledge of all this, but my impression is that, due to tenure
agreements and all kinds of other details (like the simple fact
that ANY poet is going to have trouble getting an academic
position, particularly a GOOD poet), a school of poetry might
hang onto most of the academic jobs in the field for as many as
two generations after it's lost its dominance.  (By langpo's
acadominance, I mean more how seriously it's taken as a kind of
poetry than its socio-economic status, anyway.)

Yow, after spending over an hour working on the preceding, I checked my
Inbox and found TWO MORE RESPONSES!  One was from Mark Prejsnar.  He
(properly) got on me for my snideness in using "acadominant" to describe
langpo.  I'm still not sure it's entirely inaccurate (see above) in its
meaning of "dominant in the academy."  He, and Luigi-Bob Drake in a
private follow-up letter, are on to something interesting in considering
the term as possibly meaning "dominated by the academy," or some such.
I think I did mean that to a degree, too, if not too consciously.
Overstated, of course, but langpo certainly has had the most critical
(and thus academic-seeming) accompaniment of any poetry school I know
of.  Which is no fault at all, from my point of view.  But it raises a
number of intriguing questions that Luigi-Bob brings up such as whether
providing a critical apparatus for langpo from the beginning was a
conscious choice, the aim being to "undermind the academy's stranglehold
on th cannon, and if so to what extant that project is successful..."
And also whether aesthcipients need a critical apparatus to appreciate
langpo, or whether any poetry should require such an apparatus for
appreciation.

I agree with Mark P. that "'jump-cut' was only a good way to think of
Ashbery around Tennis Court Oath time, with rapid montage and cutup
techniques making his work rapid and shifting."  Since then he's become
more of a mainstream poet--so like so many poets, fits more than one
school.

I was just about to post this when I saw Mark's second posting of the
morning, about whether an aesthcipient needs to have a critical
apparatus to appreciate a poet.  Not necessarily, I would say--but I
suspect that most of the best art of this century DID, at some point,
need criticism (mostly now absorbed and not recognized) to get off the
ground.  I certainly have been helped to appreciate certain poetry, like
Pound's, even Eliot's (even my own!), by good criticism.  Perhaps all
appreciation is simply a matter of exposure to the work to be
appreciated.  That's how I seem to have gone from annoyed contempt for
Pollack the Great Admiration, for instance.  But it seems to me the
right critical insight at the right time can save a lot of work.

Gotta stop now.  (Looks like I'm getting too MANY responses now!  But
keep 'em coming!)                                         --Bob G.

Dear Poetics,

Are we all multi-cellular organisms here?
Good. I wasn't worried, only,

in through side-knots, damping
the last dry map of the sandbox,
no, more that the doyen and the debutante
(us) had narrowed their names to words (swells)

A bit disconcerting around mid-day on the fourth of July to be abrubtly
returned to myself -- Now that David Bromige has shrugged of the deific
duties and allowed "you know who" to reassume the throne of heaven, we'll
all have to go back to writing our own words -- but here are a few odds
and ends of possible interest:

After all too long, there is at last another actual book of poems by
Lorenzo Thomas.  Problem is, it's not being distributed in the U.S. -- If
you have contacts in Germany, you might ask them to get you a copy.  The
book (and a beauty it is) is a bilingual (English/German) edition titled
"There are witnesses" -- with art work by Cecilio Thomas --
The book is number fourteen in the series Osnabrucker Bilinguale Editionen
Marginalisierter AutorInnen [you'll have to imagine an umlaut over the "u"
in "Osnabrucker"] -- address of the publisher is

O.B.E.M.A.--Redaktion
Universitat Osnabruck/FB 7
Postfach 4469. D-49069 Osnabruck

[I'm at the Boulder uncorrectable keyboard, as you can see from the above]

-------

the legend that Stevens's work as a poet was unknown to his colleagues at
the office persists in many quarters -- but the bios. indicate that he
sometimes had staff members type his poems for him --
-------
Ronald Johnson appears at the Fox Theater in Boulder this Thursday
evening, along with Anne Wadman, Ed Sanders and many others -- contact
Naropa for details

Harold Rosenberg once told me a story about interviewing Stevens at his
Hartford Life office for some magazine or other. Rosenberg asked Stevens
whether his being a poet had any effect on his job or on the way his
co-workers viewed him. "Oh, noone here has the slightest idea that I'm a
poet," he replied.

On the way out, Rosenberg fell into conversation with some people on the
elevator. "What are you here for?" one of them asked him. "I'm interviewing
Wallace Stevens," Harold responded. "Oh, the poet," returned his
interlocutor. The rest of the folks on the elevator just nodded.

        Many thanks to Bob Grumman for continuing to send his evolving
list.  I think the key word is evolving--what makes Bob's work
interesting is that is continually in progress.  That makes for an
intriguing pradox that's refreshing:  an attempt to make a list, a set of
definitions and terms that is continually extending, keeping open ended,
while also being intensive in its focusing on areas overlooked. Bob's
list
always opens "thingks" (a neologism born of a typo that's useful)  up for
me, unlike many lists which close things down in a grid.
        For those following the list as it evolves. it's useful and
interesting to look at it in  the context of some of Bob Grumann's other
essays which work with definitions and categories.  I'd espcially
recommend one called "MNMLST POETRY:  Unacclaimed but Flourishing"
at Light and Dust webiste
        http://www/thing/net/~grist/homekarl.htm

        and also an essay Bob Grumman did for the Eyerhymes Conference
which is concerned with taxonomies using work from the Canadian journal
Industrial Sabotage as examples.  Both these essays show the ways in
which Grumman puts taxonomies to use to open areas of work for the
reader/viewer.

        Establishing taxonomies and categories, yet remaining as open
ended as Grumman is, I find intriguing and useful in that it raises many
questions usually glossed over.  I know for myself I have blithely
skipped over many of the issues Grumman raises and I appreciate his
making me "thingk"  about them. It made me wonder why I have never cared
much for lists--out of laziness? Contrariness? General anarchism? It's
always a quick
associative leap to think of Bouvard and Pecuchet and some of Borges'
stories about classifactory undertakings. But the very suspicion of
taxonomies and categories--(what! back to Aristole!--you can hear Charles
Olson groan) is an interesting issue.  Do they represent control or
present simply tools? (Deleuze and Guattari would argue for the tools as
Grumman does in his last post.)
         One of my favorite statements on glossaries
is in the little glossary supplied by William S. Burroughs in his book
Junkie.  WSB points out that what he is dealing with is a fugitive
language, whose terms must by neccesity continually evolve and shift.
The elusive aspect of poetic language is similar--there is a continual
tension going on when trying to make things which are both elusive to
control and presenting them in a way which is not so elsuive as to be
completely invisible. I.E. someone will "get the message"--but always a
tension in who and to what uses they will put it. I think Bob Grumman's
lists, his taxonomies and definitions, open up this area and its
questions in a way other lists don't.
        The main thingk is, whether one likes th names or the categories
or not, the lists make for discussion and a reexamining of one's own
approach to naming and categories.  I.E. they do provide some tools for
further work--and that's the main thingk!
        One area of work I am not sure is addresed--and not being much at
making categories myself I wouldn't know what to call it!--is that done
by writers like John Clarke in his books From Feathers to Iron and In the
Analogy.  There's a wide range of work that is involved with many aspects
of Clarke's thought, his poetics.  I'm thinking of work by Ken Warren,
Stephen Ellis, Joe Napora--many many others--work that appears in
Warren's journal House Organ and Napora's BULLHEAD and Ellis and Stephen
Dignazio's :that: and that appeared in Clarke's journal INTENT.

        The issue of naming is intriguing--when Grumman gives an area a
name--does it open up an area overlooked?  Or does naming things fix
them--the intellect delighting in boundary to paraphrase Emerson in "The
Poet".  Or does Grumman's approach, by playing among the tensions
involved in naming, does it not perhaps open up one's own desire for
naming and fear of it? Language as vehicular (Emerson again) or fugitive
is ever in movement, so the best one can hope for is some kind of
indication of directions.  Whether or not one even keeps and uses the
name Grumman provides, his main work is done in indicating those directions.
        & for that my thanks

Mime-Version: 1.0

David Erben is

"...wondering why it is necessary ...to make sweeping formulaic
generalizations that contrast ...critics with artists.  I really do not
know what is
meant by these terms or even why they are being used."

Equally difficult is the contrast between baseball players and umpires or
baseball writers.

"such monolithic characterizations as these (he goes on) seem both
reductive and lacking in a certain respect for the people (and texts)
involved."

Oy. Here's something to work with, David: a poet is someone who writes
poetry -- regularly and to some effect.

Reading Derrida or any other philosopher on thematism or not in Mallarme or
elsewhere in French or any other language provides no new light on the
subject, although it certainly helps clarify why poets distinguish
*themselves* from academics. Poets seem to experience fewer constraints on
thought. I can't imagine, for example, a poet wanting to "contrast
academics with non-academics" to use another of David's phrases, as if the
world divided that way on any real view whatever.

To continue my metaphor from above, perhaps David wants to think of
"literature" as all one big activity, and poets and critics are different
the way slugging center fielders and utility second basemen are different.
This would be incorrect, akin to the view of nature as one vast equilibrium
in which the animal killed by a predator and the scavenger bird that cleans
its bones later need not be distinguished in the round of dust to dust. Not
true either.

am reminded of a satirical poem on this very topic by Robert Graves,
entitled (I think) "Titans and Midgets" --

Perhaps you can imagine which is which?  (the final lines are graphic &
memorable (tho I fear I'd err in trying to paraphrase from memory).

Arguably, Graves himself played both teams, -- but it's clear where his
heart was.  Was his *White Goddess* the sort of poet-writing-criticism
[hmm -- more like Ur-literary / relgious history] that Erbin, anyway, was
maybe sort of thinking toward . . . ? . . .

Subject:      stanza breaks
In-Reply-To:  <Kali.Tal.1218348880E@pop-fs1.cis.yale.edu>

This morning I saw among the long list of Independence Weekend Postings
(now unavailable to me, as I move computer to computer through the day) a
note encouraging the list to reply to a question Joseph Zitt asked about
the line breaks in a poem I had posted:

        Why do the stanzas break where
        they do? I'd looked at it, shifting the breaks around, and their
        positioning didn't seem to have much effect.

        I sent an individual response on Thursday to JZ; a large chunk I
send again here to the entire list for sake of (potential) discussion:


        . . . one reason for the (mostly) unrhymed tercets and couplets is that
they act a reminders of specific historical codes: of all the available
ways to break a stanza I've chosen two sequences that have long histories
in English literature, and by demonstrating that affinity I can work off
it--or inside it would be a better spatial metaphor.
        Someone--maybe it is Lacan--it has escaped me for the moment--writes about
the ability, given an understanding of a "surplus of signifiers" to mean
one thing inside the language of another thing (just as the actual action
of the superstructure can be read inside the specific event--but equally
the specific event can radically rewrite itself inside the superstructure).
So I want my words, which I think are formed of fairly contemporary and
traditionally "unpoetic" speech genres to function inside the older forms.
Hence the traditional stanzas and varying but consistent metrical work of
the lines (syllabics--I'm not too strict); probably this also accounts for
my desire to sandwich a chunk of prose between the stanzas (I wrote the
stanzas first): again an action "inside" and "between," parenthetical.
        Also that formal process helps me edit when I write. So it is less that I
have put the stanzas there for a reason and more that I settled on the
stanzas fairly early one (not immediately but soon thereafter) and then
rewrote until I liked how the breaks sounded (it is all in the sound, the
tension of a kind of temporal pause, the emphasis on certain words--to
produce both speech patterns and something more "musical" (that is the flaw
that remains, in another point of view, as a result of my failure to more
fully detach from the Structuralist project): so from the first to the
second and from the second to the third the syntactical or synchronic
meaning runs right over the stanza breaks -  the guy is talking fast and
furiously, abruptly; then there is a full stop at the end of the stanza so
that break is the pause between his utterance ending and hers beginning.
The next two stanza breaks are somewhere between: at grammatical pauses but
not full stops. . .

In something like retrospect, I find myself half agreeing on Monday with
the answer I wrote on Thursday.

Yeah.  My responses, in e-mail, are definitely not poetry.  But my
sympathies and affinities are with poets more than critics.  Although, a
writer like Benjamin beautifully incorporates poetic sympathies into his
writing, I think it is less successful for a poet to bring criticism
into a piece of art.  Not that it can't be critical, like Dorn's
Abhorrences, but that it is not wrought as criticism.  Juxtaposition and
implication guide that kind of stuff.  It's not directing and obvious,
like the critic.  But this is quick.  My thoughts aren't all with me.
I've a meeting to attend.

Mark Prejsnar replied, backchannel, that "language poetry, CAN and indeed
SHOULD be read without 'critical apparatus..'"; that the source of the
critical threads in th LangPo corpus was pressure by outside academics &
workshop poets; and cited Coolidge in particular as a language poet who
did not produce concurrent theory to support his work...  i understand
him to be saying that LangPo should only be read w/out the critical apparatus,
and that the work succeeds despite, rather than because of, the theoretical
constructs that the Language Poets built for their works...

Seems rather confusing to use that title 11 months after Daphne Marlatt's
book _Taken_ comes out. I highly recommend the latter, by the way.

two things trouble me here.  first, kim never "offered" to cut jay's
nipples off fer chrissakes; searching the june poetics archive for the
word "nipples" (isn't technology teriffic?), one finds hoa nguyen's 13
june post, reproduced in part below, to be the first mention of such an
(hypothetical!) act.

second, "if such a person exists": why is this questioned?  why is kim
dawn's existence so much more dubious than anyone else's here? does such a
person as tom mandel exist?  does such a person as tom orange exist?

 GB notes how as "taken"'s been taken by _Taken_
 & adds that he was taken by the original _Taken_
 Now others might equally be taken by the new _Taken_
 But is it likely that one'll be for the other mistaken?

 What's your take?  (Or rather, Who's on the take?)
 What do you take me for?  (Take 35, cameras . . .  )
 May we take it from your tears you grasp the situation
 and will henceforth be sure to take care -- more care?

 I can see by your hat that you're not a real cowboy

These are exactly the sorts of things which trouble me.

David Israel charges me with "continuing misunderstanding (or misreading) of
what's really at issue" in the discussion of play vs. violence.  But I think
that he reads too much *into* Dodie Bellamy's response and that Bellamy
quite clearly and distinctly says that Kim Dawn's post falls into the
cagegory of sexual violence because it involved a nonconsensual use of
sexually explicit material.  I draw this conclusion--again--directly from
Bellamy's writings, which David was kind enough to repost with his own message.

><< Since neither Jay Schwartz, nor other list members, had consented to
>Kim Dawn's aggressive pornographic whatever that was directed towards
>Jay, I do not feel it should be categorized as sexual play, but as sexual
>violence.  I do not challenge her right to use sexual explicit material in her

I do *not* think that Bellamy's text urges the reader to draw the conclusion
that Bellamy is making an "analogy" nor that she is being metaphorical.
When you say something should be categorized as sexual violence, you are not
saying that something should be distinguished from something else "as if it
were" sexual violence, nor are you saying that it "is sexual violence" as
one might metaphorically state, "Kali is a pit bull," meaning "Kali has the
characteristics of a pit bull."  If this is what Bellamy means, then I hope
she will come forward and say so, but it is not present--as far as I can
detect--in the text.

If you want to talk about what is happening when/if posters to POETICS
generate sexually explicit and provocative textual eruptions, I'm game to do
that.  I'm happy to talk about what different definitions of sexual violence
might be, about metaphorical uses of violent sexual imagery, etc.

But, to bring this back around to Tom Orange's complaint, it seems to me
that Kim Dawn wrote one thing (and, like Tom, I find no sexual violence in
her posts). Then her text was revised through a sort of POETICS list
mythologization/magnification process into totally other thing (the
nonexistent "nipples" "threat" which Hoa Nguyen/Dale Smith and others now
refer to as if it were penned by Kim Dawn)  In the process the Kim-Dawnness
of Kim Dawn has been cast into doubt, even though it is other POETICS
listmembers who are drafting the imaginary texts of the Kim Dawn of their
desires.  This process of erosion/erasure/petrifaction/replacement is indeed
troubling, particularly among a group of people who think of themselves as
readers.

David's bar metaphor resonates in an interesting way with my charges of the
underlying sexism of the POETICS forum.  Heterosexual bars are generally
places in which sexist behavior is distilled and concentrated, and in which
very little attention is paid to changing the social order.  The bar
metaphor crops up on *many* lists, and it's no accident that it does; we
carry our conceptions of and our actions in the physical social spaces we
inhabit to our virtual hangouts.  The intrusion of the performance space
(far more congenial to feminist efforts) into the bar is seen as an
interruption rather than a potential liberation from stereotype. In David
Israel's construction, it's the rules of the bar we ought to observe and if
Kim Dawn is taken for a duck, well, she was asking for it, wasn't she?

Allowing that the above-alluded-to Hoa (or Dale?) post was responsive
(in some wise) to the orig. KD post, shall we now look at that ancient
text?  (I believe it was the 1st of 2 or 3 such) --

agreed, Tom M. (and/or others) lost the precise line-of-origins, but he did
recollect a general mode & mood of utterance in the primary document.
So here's the KD locus classicus; -- not nipple-specific (correct), but
neither lacking in a possible sense of violence or threat (at least by a
possible reading . . .); also evident (as Eliza McG. noted) is a rhetoric of
desire, not (at least one may say) generally in fashion for messages to be
sent to an unfamiliar via public broadcast.

[this is now David I.] . . . About to post this, I note Kali's response to
my 7/3/97 note --

<< David Israel charges me with "continuing misunderstanding (or
misreading) of what's really at issue" in the discussion of play vs.

response and that Bellamy quite clearly and distinctly says that Kim
Dawn's post falls into the cagegory of sexual violence . . . >>

Well, as I noted, she says that it falls into category B rather than category
A.  But allowiing that logically it can fall in to NEITHER B NOR A,
therefore, if we wish to understand the rhetorical structure of the text,
and thus approach its intended meanin, we must -- I believe -- understand
the way in which an *implicit* (rather than explicit)  language analogy is
very well established.  My wish was to read for the intended meaning.
Why do such a thing?  Becuase it's precisely that which I felt was being
missed and overlooked.

Again: my reading of the Bellamy text -- somewhat painstaking as to a
simple trope -- was an attempt to catch & bring into focus the underlying
use of analogy which obtains not on the level of the sentence, but rather
on a meta-level, that of the rhetorical logic at work -- which seems to be,
in that text, presiely where the real thought and sense and purpose and
intended meaning are to be found.  We differ in our readings, then.  The
question remains, Kali, if you were to read the passage as allegorical,
would it seem less inflammatory, more persuasive, or what?

As for my bar metaphor, that was mainly drawn from what I've observed
among many a poet: after readings, they repair to bars.  Kali writes,

<< ... The intrusion of the performance space (far more congenial to
feminist efforts) into the bar is seen as an interruption rather than a
potential liberation from stereotype. In David Israel's construction, it's
the rules of the bar we ought to observe and if Kim Dawn is taken for a
duck, well, she was asking for it, wasn't she? >>

I don't believe I was proposing that the rules of the bar should reign and
the conventions of the performance space ought be banished.  Was it not
clear that my intention was descriptive rather than perscriptive?  In
drawing that particular metaphor, I hoped to describe what we've
observed here -- i.e., a divergence of conceptions as to the nature of the
listserv forum, on a manners & customs sort of level.  To recognize that
divergency seems basic to our understanding both of where Kim may
have been coming from, and where the responses to her may have been
coming from.  Yes, there's the suggestion of in eruption or interruption of
one conception in the midst of another.  This being so, it seems of some
use to try to approach an understanding as to why the denizens of one
conception might misunderstand or disvavor the conduct of one who
perhaps holds to a differeng conception.

Now, all conversation, I think, needs some degree of mutual deference.
Some on the list may even slightly favor what amounts to (or somewhat
approaches) polite conversation.  Me, I'm just listening -- & making the
occasional (feeble) attempt toward sorting out what I've seen, how it
works, what it looks like.

If the sensibility of another has been bruised by that person's misreading
of my attempt at art, I think it should not be beyond me to offer a word
of apology for such a regrettable misunderstanding.  Others may behave
as they wish, but this seems to me an easy principle, and a good one.

yours truly,

Dear Listers and Listees,

I have been watching this discussion about Ginsberg and particularly that
attack on George Will whose argument is clearly wrong and self-serving.  But,
I am also sort of startled by the rather uncritical view of Mr. Ginsberg.  I
suppose it is a matter of timing and decorum, I myself, many people I know
like me (under 30) have to give Allen Ginsberg a lot of credit for his
turning us on to poetry (books in general).
But I think this question about his politics is interesting.  It seems to me
that there is a lack of reflection within his work.  That he is, pardon me,
spouting a party line.  Now, it happens to be my favorite line, but it is a
line.  It seems to me that a case could be made that Mr. Ginsberg has,
perhaps inadvertently, limited our conception of what a political poem is.
 Perhaps, his persona contributes.  I wonder whether ohming in congress is
much of answer.  It is dissent, sure, but is it also avoidance.  Some of the
buddahist stance could appear as escapism. How does this seduce someone into
a position.  Are political poems suppose to seduce or are they to be as blunt
and coercive as Einsenhower himself was.

"Heterosexual bars are generally places in which sexist behavior is
distilled and concentrated, and in which very little attention is paid to
changing the social order."

My gay friends tell me that the habitues of gay bars often try to change the
social order by forming couples, and that's what I've observed when I've
gone with them. I have no idea what's distilled and concentrated in women's
bars because on the couple of occasions when women friends have invited me
along I've been denied admission.

I rarely go to bars of any kind these days, but in the bars of my youth
certain tables did pay attention to changing the social order politically,
and occasionally we managed to gain control of the jukebox.

It might be possible to establish a bar dedicated to changing the social
order. Call it "The Bar with a Mission." But it probably wouldn't work.
Heterosexual males are such jackasses by nature and nurture that they would
revert to the manufacture of Distillate of Sexist Behavior (what would that
taste like? would it be cerise or chartreuse in color?) in short order and
take the bar down with them.
It is fun to imagine, however, what kind of drinks would be served at "The
Bar with a Mission." Any suggestions?

Kali,

I only brought up the violence issue because I was accused of rhetorical
violence, which is bizarre given the acceptance of KD's behavior.  I don't
care to comment on your interpretations of my text except to say--go ahead
and deny the psychological power of language.  When people here are capable
of seeing the poignancy and power of breaking a line at a certain point as
opposed to breaking it at another point, I'm sure they too can see that
attacks made by KD have far more of an impact than you credit them with in
your theory games.  So play on.

"Rhetorical violence?"  How so?  And I do *not* deny the psychological power
of language; I simply say that "violence" in language is possible only when
the reader perceives the author has some sort of power over him/her.

I don't know who the Oppression Women are, but I assume that they share a
house with the Politically Correct--backlash figments of male imagination, a
rhetoric adopted by women who are afraid of being seen as members of those
imaginary categories by reactionary men.

To mention women's oppression is taboo these days, as it is to mention the
oppression of people of color.  It's so... so... *unfair* to all those poor
oppressed white men out there who've been victimized by having to live their
lives without any ethnicity or gender identity.  And it makes decent white
guys who are *trying* to Do The Right Thing so... uncomfortable.  Sheesh.

How is it demeaning to women to point out that women are the targets of the
basest attacks on POETICS?  How is it demeaning to women to examine sexist
structures in rhetoric or in f2f encounter? I am a feminist and I
can't/won't/doanwanna move through the world without recognizing and
describing the sexist and racist power structures I see in play.  What is it
to me if certain folks on POETICS don't like what I have to say or how I say
it?  I don't like what they say or how they have to say it.

A rhetorical move which tries to depict me as playing some sort of victim or
promoting that man-made invention "victimology" (Oppression Women???) will
surely backfire. And surely it is Dodie Bellamy who is promoting victims
here--victims of Kim Dawn's allegedly vicious assaults, poor wilting
creatures walking around traumatized (big red "V"s painted on their
foreheads) because her texts had "far more of an impact" than I "credited
them with."

What's extreme?  This is language.  We're writers. What's the big deal?  As
far as this being "safe," well, yeah, it is.  Can't have it both ways, Mark.
If this place *is* safe, then, Kim Dawn's writing--like my writing--was
*just* writing and no threat.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I'd like to add the following comments to the growing list of responses to
Bob Grumman's list of poetic schools:

(1) I don't think you have to know a lot about the academy or about the
socio-economic aspects of poetry in America to define Langpo as
"acadominant".  Nor should you feel guilty or embarassed about it, Bob.  It
seems obvious to me the main theoretical premises practiced and/or advocated
by many Language poets correlate with a number of key tenets of contemporary
academic theory, including the post-structuralist attack on the "unified"
subject, its distrust of the neutral "transparency" of expository discourse,
Marxist literary theory, Derrida's critique of Western metaphysics, not to
speak of the current interest in genre studies as a tool for a critical
investigation of the interaction between literary artefacts and prevailing
socio-cultural practices.  The list could go on and on forever . . .  To
pretend that this has nothing to do with the entrance of U.S. colleges into
the intellectual life and creative pratices of poets is simply absurd.
     That the collusion between Langpo and dominant academic DISCOURSE is
not automatically translated into a cornucopia of academic jobs for ALL
Language poets and scholars working in the field (cf. Ron Silliman's
message) does not in any way invalidate Bob Grumman's characterization of
the movement as "acadominant".  Right now, I can think of at least 20
scholars and poets who are desperately looking for jobs both here (in
Belgium) and there (in the U.S.) despite the fact that their work plays
right into the current fashion in terms of preferred academic topics and
discourse.  It's the job situation that is to blame, and it has nothing to
do with anybody's alleged position as outsiders or revolutionary-scholars.
As for me, I hasten to add, this kind of contamination is still preferable
to that which informs the so-called "workshop poem" as practiced in the
theoryphobic climate of Creative Writing programs . . .  =20

(2) The term "Deep Image" was not coined by Bly but by Jerome Rothenberg --
I'm not sure where and when he first used the term but I think it was
originally related to his analysis of Spanish Surrealist poetry.

The idea of the poet as a univ. professor is an historically recent (and, it
would seem, short-lived) phenomenon. None of the high modernists before
Zukofsky jabbered at teenagers in front of a black board for a living.
People like Stanley Kunitz and Genevieve Taggard were among the very first
to get jobs in universities *as poets* under any terms. We tend to forget
that American literature has been a "legit" topic on campus for less than
100 years. So it was no big deal that Stevens worked at Hartford. It *was* a
big deal that he was successful at it.

Time Magazine (and its companion Life) is not a bad thumbnail index of
official culture, esp. in the 1936-70 timeframe. I don't know what they
thought of Stevens or WCW, but they did do a special issue on poetry (not a
"single author" job like the recent Robert Hughes deal on the visual arts,
which was too hokey and shallow for words, but did have some nice
illustrations) in 1964 that had Robert Lowell on the cover. It would be
worth it to look up that particular issue and report back what it said of
Verse.

Actually, the times when those kinds of publications weighed in on poetry
earlier tended to be around extra-literary news items, Pound's trial and the
controversy over the Bollingen award in the late 40s, Ginsberg's trial over
Howl in the mid-50s. Lots of humor at the expense of the beats.

When I got my first job post-college in '72 in the prison movement, I never
told any of my co-workers I wrote. One day, somebody posted a review I'd
done (a positive one at that) of Tom Clark's Neil Young that had been
published in Rolling Stone and I was "busted." Nowadays, you get a job and
your new co-workers check out Alta Vista or Hotbot to see if you have a
website on your first day. Nowadays I get more comments from co-workers
about things that have showed up on the Sixties Listserv (hosted by our own
Kali Tal).

I realize that this is off current topic (and possibly of little
interest), but have to say that such a characterization of _Life in the
Iron Mills_ is false.  Sharon Harris, author of a book on RHD, observes
that "the narrator is clearly represented as middle-class; she (or he,
since the sex is not indicated) is clearly someone *observing* the
working class."

_Life in the Iron Mills_, like all of RHD's early work, appeared
unsigned.  This was not an attempt at "fakery," but was part of a
tradition of (especially female) authorial reticence--the fear of
appearing immodest.  (Possible shades of current topic!)  This tradition
was evolving during Davis's lifetime, and her later work is signed.

I know almost nothing about the "Santiago" book, but my understanding is
that the (white) author represented himself as Chicano.  Davis did
nothing of the sort with _Life in the Iron Mills_, so I wonder how you
would support the comparison.

David Israel, in responding to my tempest in a teapot directed at David
Erben, rightly points out that some poets also write criticism.

A poet who writes criticism is *a poet* who *writes criticism.* People do
different things, yes. Some poets write criticism, some critics create
crossword puzzles, and some crossword puzzle designers write long novels
that do not employ the letter 'e' -- no point of poetic or academic or
historical or critical or theoretical or any other '-ic' or '-ical'
importance is contained in any of these facts.

***

This raises the interesting question of why anyone would mention the fact
at all. I didn't in my original post, but I *was* interested to see if
anyone was sufficiently addicted to the sound of his/her own fingers
clicking to do so. I found out.

Subject:      power in nipples
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

It was in fact, at a heterosexual bar once, where my nipples WERE
threatened, as A MEANS of changing the social order. No true revolutionary,
I declined. The threat came from a ball-scratching white man. Heterosexual
bars also distill liquor, which is usually a reason to go.

I have no faith in the bar-list metaphor. If it were anywhere near true,
what a drag the place would be.

Long before I came to this "virtual hangout," some gay bars I frequented
didn't challenge my social order as much as I had anticipated. All in
Philadelphia. The first was a motorcycle bar. Harley's hung from the
rafters. We went after a party and since most of the crowd were gay men,
they got to choose the bar. We shot some pool. Though not in leather, I was
ogled quite a bit. That was nice.

Spent many a night at Hepburn's, a virtual shrine to Katharine. My bisexual
girlfriend adored the place, and it was so close to her apartment. At the
door, a stream of very young women would pour past the bouncer into the
bar, but she stared and sneered at my id for several minutes. I smiled and
looked dumb. I was dumb, and the bar itself was beautifully done. Pads of
paper and tiny pencils were left at intervals along the bar, and although
my companion left my name and number on several of them, no one ever
called.

In another bar, on the third floor of an ancient brick rowhouse in a
cobblestone alley, we watched from the bar as 14 men dance almost in unison
on the mirrored dancefloor. As they spun in flashing pirouettes my
girlfriend kissed me. When I opened my eyes the smiling bartender winked at
me.

What a dreamy time that was.

No real point to this post. I'm just sick of talking about Kim Dawn.

Sorry but the the general arguments of your post, Michel, strike me as
somewhat more absurd....

Most of the poetic tendencies that are seen as alternative to LP (deep
image type stuff, the generlized plain-spoken "I" free-verse lyric of APR,
etc.) are **far more** anchored in the academy, and dominant there, than
is LP.  This is why most of my posts in response to Bob's list have been
a little irritable.  It's so obviously *gratuitous* to link the Lang-ists
with academe, given the siting of most U.S. poetry within academic
settings, that it seemed that the term could only be intended as a rather
heavy-handed put-down.  That still seems self-evident to me.

David Erben has provided a long and interesting list of people who write
poetry and criticism. David Israel simply mentioned the obvious point that
some do. Perhaps the Davids are cooperating in order to illustrate the
Erben distinction between "academic and non-academic."

I didn't read the whole list, just scanned it. Even that, however, yielded
some names of people I didn't know wrote poetry -- again, that's interesting.

What does this have to do with my post, I wonder?

Roberto Alomar is on the list of baseball players who bat from the left
side and bat from the right side. Does this mean that batting from the left
side and the right side cannot be distinguished? That the distinction poses
a theoretical problem?

point well taken.  The fact that (say) poets also write criticism
(& contrawise) is relevant to some questions & not to others.  The
original question (if I can somehow trace back on the road of
thought) had something to do with a difference in cognitive process.
No doubt that holds.  More particularly, the issue was -- what? --
something about the difference between how categories of idea arise
for a poet (i.e., one engaged in discovery, at the source whence the
words emerge), and how categories are applied by a critic TO the
products of that tenuous language-formation -- i.e., figuring out
which cloud looks like an apple & which like an orange, which swirl
should be considered "representation" & which "abstraction" . . .

or have I lost the ariadne thread of what we're discussing?

When I was at Johns Hopkins (class of '66) there was nary a mention of
William Carlos Williams. When I taught Williams to Freshman at Columbia as a
Preceptor it raised eyebrows--when I taught Olson it caused a minor scandal,
and my classes were the only ones taught Ginsberg. Academic criticism has
caught up with the poetry of the '60s and before, as had always been the
pattern: the poets eventually forced a change in theory. When Language
Poetry arrived at the academy it fit so well into the theoretical concerns
of some of the younger critics (Lacan was all the buzz at Hopkins by 1965,
and the Columbia French Department had begun the process of assimilating
structuralism and post-) that it seemed made to order. This need not be read
as a put-down. It is different from what came before.

"violence" if broadly construed (rather than strictly phyiscally) --
is cognate to "violation," correct?  It involves a violation of the
person (or persona? or psyche? or integrity?) of another.  I think
there have been instances of women behaving violently (in both the
the realm of body & utterance) toward men; I'm doubtful that it's a
one-way street -- if that's the question?

Certainly women-as-poets possess considerable intellectual capital,
particularly for those who are apt to read this list.

The power to shame or embarrass through language is a power, no?
The casting of doubts, the broad passionate sweep of insinuation,
the dark wave of anger, the distancing, the sense of a menacing
intention, the taunt of a faux-seductive language, the raising of the
spectre of anguish and desire and the ascription, to another, of
suppresed impulses as the putative source of the other's utterance,
the instinctual reductionism and demasking and naking and debasing
and shaming and the ascription of a reprehensible post-Freudian id
as the secret life to be broadcast and amplified, turning up the
volume of presumed inner chaos -- I think such things were achieved
(or certainly attempted) in the locus classicus post, no?

gotta run,

if posts are "so very bizarre," then doubt identity.  if i produce
interpretation/value judgment "p", then i can place identity of person "q"
under question. take an unknown something so very bizarre, relate it
through recollection to a thing known to be odious, so that the unknown
now too becomes odious and the identity of the person behind that unknown
becomes suspended. this variety of logic really troubles me.

i guess my efforts to be straightforward, patient, forthright in my
partiality, have failed, and are instead, sadly, grotesque beyond irony.

eliza, i discussed extensively off-list with you why i am in no position
to engage with kim's absolutely inexcusable misreadings of you.  i
simply can't speak for someone else.  above all i respect the fact that
you feel you have been violenced.  but what if i found your reaction to be
"so very bizarre"? (which i don't)  by the very logic your post outlines
above, i would be well within my rights to doubt *your* identity.  "eliza
mcgrand -- if such a person exists."  *to me*, that little "if" carries a
subtler and therefore more dangerous kind of violence in this kind of
electronic space than "let me lick yr orifices cut off yr nipples" etc.

no, say more, because it's quite amazing what this cute little gem does.
it says tom orange is one of "them," true for convenience's sake b/c altho
i have been on this list for a long time and have posted on many other
topics my posts of late have had a more or less singular focus.  next it
says that tom orange misreads, leaving open the question of whether i
misread locally or globally (and better to leave it nice and open, simply
put: he, as one of them misreads).  finally, it invites, nay, commands the
readers of poetics to know me by my misreadings.  to wit i say:

"and when the seventh seal was opened i saw another sign, great and
marvelous, which proclaimed the mighty legions of the defenders of kim
dawn, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days,
clothed in sackcloth, and they shall carry the mark by which you shall
know them, they shall carry the mark of misreading..."

know me as my reading-writing. gnosthi s'auton by yr reading of others.
dont know me. at least not by "my" misreadings.

Sorry, you're right about this.  I should have included the Davis book lower
down in my list, along with Gaines' _Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman_ and
other books whose *authors* did not intend the book to be taken as personal
experience, but whose audiences often naively read the book in that manner.
I do remember that when I first read the book, which was assigned in a
college course, the professor had to explicitly state that the author was
*not* working class because many students assumed that she was even after
reading the text. The author's best efforts may not be successful when faced
with an audience well-prepared to misread.

A woman threw a shot of tequila on me in a bar in NYC a couple of weeks ago.
She (the bartender) was annoyed because I declined to drink it (it was
on-the-house). "I'm driving," I told her, (which was true), before she threw
it. Under any other circumstance, I would have drank it down and ordered
another. I have witnesses who can testify that I wasn't being a jackass,
even though it comes naturally. By the way, this was in one of those
heterosexual bars.

 I just don't get this insistence on elucidating differences between poets
and critics! And the methods of analysis so far employed in answering are
backwards!=20

Lets proceed from actual lived reality, present and past. I really CAN NOT
think of any poet who I would allow NEVER wrote any criticism; and as for
paying critical attention to his or her individual work: I'm baffled!=20

Its not that I don't see lots of people who spending their lives writing
and thinking critically and are not poets =97 but what poet does not write
and think critically?

And what is the point of trying to locate the TRUTH of differences between
poets and critics in some inner or outer but either way throughly
abstracted system of thought patterns? What are poetic sympathies? Compared
to critical inferences? I'm deeply suspicious. Is this distinction supposed
to indicate a difference in cellular tissue? Are there atomic
correspondences? I thought among clear-thinking liberal types this pattern
of critical thought went out with Kant.

Some days ago, nearer the beginning of this discussion, was written:

"Although, a writer like Benjamin beautifully incorporates poetic
sympathies into his writing, I think it is less successful for a poet to
bring criticism into a piece of art.=20

        How is criticism defined? Critical thought, analysis, must exist in -- as
part of -- in the creation of -- the work of art! Unless you believe that
poetry is purely the divine breath of the Almighty Inspiration and the
author's task is mere recording and ON TOP of that believe that
manipulation of a language is also not critical, then there is NO basis for
assuming that a poet writing poetry has not thought critically about other
poetry, her own poetry, the general categories of poetry, etc., etc.

        But that is beside the point!
        I think an argument could be made for distinctions between poetry and
philosophy, as separate categories of thought and writing that have defined
themselves negatively by the other for several thousands of years.=20

        I agree with the above quoted bit at least to the degree that these days I
tend to think of critical work as more popularly being classified as
poetic, then poetry being declared critical =97 but that is true all over:
what isn't called poetic? Hell, even poetry is described as having
particularly poetic phrases inside it.

        What about Blake? Williams? Stevens? =97 to mention three names I've read i=
n
the last 3 days on here: don't each of these poets write poems which in
engage in critical work?=20

        And to draw from a closer deck: look at our own list members, today, in an
exchange that began:

  Dear Kali,

        Are your men
  and women
        too heavy
  for words?

and ended, very powerfully, I thought, quite brilliantly in fact, given the
tenor and subject of much of the proceeding dialogue, about violence in
writing, pornographic writing:

  the rest is gloss
  put your body where your mouth is


If the power of these words isn't a critical one; if their "function" can
not be said to have a critical role, why not?

tom

you DID engage with me backchannel and make a good case for why you
could not defend kim dawn's misreadings.  but you did not engage, in
public, with the fact that while complaining about how she had been
misread, misunderstood, attacked, etc. she perpetrated the same acts
ad nauseum.  a defense that ignores the offenses is perhaps the best
you can do, but it is pretty lame.  to be honest, it was the hypocrisy
that bothered me most in kim dawn's posts and posturing, i.e. the i-
don't-see-all-those-beams-in-my-eye manner.

re identity, i thought i was clear but evidently i was not clear
enough for you (nor was dodie or several others in their treatment of
the same thing) so i'll elaborate: poetics list was hit by a
spam/possible false identity/flamebait attack a number of months ago.

by "wierdness" and "bizarreness" of posts, i referred to, as i said in
post, the fact that the same sort of rhetoric were used in earlier
outbreak as in the kim dawn posts: the same multiple mailings of
disconnected, uh, prose.  the same misreadings.  the same extremes of
violence.  when investigated, the same lack of computer
identifications emerged.

it is not unique to poetics.  this kind of misrepresentation of
identity, then spam/flamebait/ worse, has happened in almost every
list in cyberspace at least once.  i have friends on longstanding
lists who've gone through multiple bouts.  there is a site, if you're
interested, run by a fellow in finland on spamming and cyber space
list attacks.  as i said in previous posts, and as dodie has
elaborated on among others, the kim dawn posts have all the hallmarks
and we are already out there in community as mark, witness earlier
bout.

finally, in that you spoke with me backchannel, i honor your efforts.
i can understand that you feel you spoke to me about this so the
situation was, in your mind, settled, and you might well feel i've
been unfair to you.

but it remains that you make apologia, defense, noises of "she's not
so bad" and yet you did not, publically, grapple with her inexcuseable
behavior to me.  i find her behavior to jay, to dodie (the bait-switch
of "i love your work" and then a really virulent attack in the next
post just after dodie, good heart, let down her defenses was
particularly beyond the pale i thought), to me, all of a piece.  thus,
before anyone sets to work on apologias and defences, ALL the aspects
of this posting nightmare should be considered.  when her behavior to
me is included, i think she is, in essence, indefensible.  but you did
at least make an effort to deal with me directly, which is the best
i've seen so far.

when writing previous post, it occurred to me that you might feel i'd
dissed you, but as i thought about it, though you were prompt and good
about trying as best you could to both admit the fault but explain
that you couldn't speak for her and defend it, you continued, in
effect, by not dealing with it in public but defending her, to defend
her behavior to me by default.  and it was, as you said, indefensible.

she is your friend, you've said, and that means you are in some sense
honor bound to stick up for her.  i can also understand that.  but she
has not apologized, publically or privately, for what she did to me
and did, i add, a NUMBER of times EVEN AFTER she was requested to
cease and desist from misreading me and spreading utterly false
rumors.  in fact, she went on to commit, after the second or third
request, the infamous false rape allegation coupled with an accusation
of hypocrisy based on the notion that i'd said (which i hadn't) that
one oughtn't post private matter or write about it then had written
about what she alleged was my rape (though i'd done no such thing!).

in one fell swoop, we have misreadings, spreading of false
information, accusations of hypocrisy (and worse) based on false
premises, and repeated disinclination to honor my requests that she
read me words carefully before paraphrasing, interpreting, or
otherwise using them.

as i've said, however, there has been no public apology, no private
apology, no owning up, no responsibility taken, no effort to discern
similar misbehavior to other people, not even an explanation of how
she came to make such a hash-up (with, perhaps, some consideration of
possible similar mistakes)... and in the defenses, no mention of a
grave misdeed in line with a number of other misdeeds.  in a word,
nothing.

i've said this to kim dawn backchannel, by the way, as well, so it is
not that she did not have the opportunity to understand both from
public post, and private post, that her behavior was excessively
offensive.

rather than upbraid me for not letting that serious group of misdeeds
slip out of the picture in a sort of kim-was-only-playing defense, i
would think it a better use of time to analyze the bad scholarship of
such misreadings, the apologies owed to people attacked wrongfully,
methodology to honorably undo some of the damage wrought, and ways to
be playful but truthful and intelligent at same time.  i know, it
isn't as sexy as calling people nasty names and writing fun little
flamebaits, but that is what landed kim where she is in the first
place, no?

final note: it was out of a sense of HONORABLE feminism, i.e. fair
play and that sort of tiresome thing, that made me protest the sexual
harassment of jay schwartz.  what, as a feminist, i find unacceptable
when done to me i am honor bound not to accept as right to do to
anyone else.  i've said this before, but consider audre lord on the
tools of the master which build the master's house.  but posts on this
foolishness has taken up much too much space on the list and i'm
ashamed to be adding to it.

Poetas,

the following surfaced via the So.Asian Lit. listserv.  I'm not acquainted

Meanwhile, if anyone might have remarks / anecdotes / whatever re: the

mea culpa for a "pretty lame" defense, eliza, but i don't know what you'd
have me do: go back through the archive, repost all the exchanges you had
w/kim and then apologize *for her*?  seriously?  i honestly cant see
how this wd constitute proper public/scholarly engagement on my part.
you feel you've been violenced, i respect that, i empathize with you, but
i can't see my engagement with the specific issue of identity/violence
arising out of this miasma as constituting a dereliction of my
argumentative or compassionate duties.

(as to her "perpetra[tion] of the same acts ad nauseum" -- such an
exaggeration perpetuates the reduction of kim's writing to "endless bad
pornography." her post today was the first in quite a while and -- gasp --
no smut!)

no, you were quite clear, so let me reiterate what i said.  i witnessed
the spam-of-old you speak of, i was subscribed to this list then as i have
been for well over a year.  i can even understand your then-fear that
poetics was being invaded by a flamethrower--a fear i tried to assuage in
a 14 june post.

let me also reiterate my primary concern here.  there is an insistance
than kim has violenced people, and what i have been trying to argue all
along -- not so much that "kim's not that bad," that she must be defended,
etc. -- is that the language that has been used to denounce kim's violence
*itself* possesses a kind of violence, a far more covert and subtle kind:
take what we find unknown, fearful and bizarre -- moving gradually from
the level of fact to *interpretation* mind you  -- and assimilate it with
something that we know to be fearful (flamethrowers) so that we can
identify it as having no identity and hence contain it, silence it, and
cast it out.

this i find to be a dangerous logic.  this is what i am saying.

>

i never assumed it was settled -- obviously it's not since we persist in
talking about it. i don't feel you've been unfair to me, unless what you
want of me is an apology on someone else's behalf; it's simply not my
place, and i don't think that delegitimizes my place of speaking, from
which i have been trying to demonstrate that there has been violence from
both sides of this battlefield and that we can all judge for ourselves
which violence is more dangerous.

Really! In the interests of historical accuracy, I must deny ever being in
a Platonic Lounge. It is true that the watering hole where i met mr
bowering was sexless, but that was because it was a canadian beer parlor.
There can be no sex in a canadian beer parlor, although plenty of hormones,
& then he hits you, eh? so you slug him right back. But thats not what i
call sex.

It is true that, later, there was a Ladies & Escorts section, next to the
Men Only section, & that mr bowering got to be practiced at slipping in
there solo (strictly against the law) & then "picking up" a woman likewise
solo or perhaps sitting with a girlfriend or two as they called one another
back then.Engaging them or her in the sort of idle badinage so familiar to
us listlings, he "pulled rank" on those of us men condemned to drink with
each other but only to gaze thru the door (only slightly ajar) at the
rhapsodies of femininity so near yet so far.

But the "Ladies & Escorts" section cannot be what he means when he says
"Platonic Lounge". He must allude, as I sd at the start, to the dingy
dungeon where we drank our lager & tomato juice until we got drunk enough
to get ourselves hurt--or in mr b's case, arrested & thrown in the slammer.
And hurt.

Thats the kind of place Plato's Lounge  w o u l d  be, dont you think? --I
know if socrates came that old game of his with me, I'd be glad to hand him
a knuckle sandwich. My trainer, by the way, is Tom Mandel.

Another of Bowering's Bubbles popped. ...& nobody  h a s  to do it. But i
had saved some message space up, & its how i have my fun.....Brahms.

PS John Ashbery  d i d  suggest once that he & I enroll in bartenders'
school. I often regret not following this advice.

The It of the Texts:


Centering texts creates a bulbous apparatus, as well as an axis, as if
there were _spew_ or ballooning pouring from/to the subject - as if
the flow revealed the invisible _form._

Random capitalization implies pastiche, pasting, crazed breath and em-
phasis, language gagging on itself - as if there were _violation-fab-
ric_ rabbit-glued to the earth.

Textual mixture and rearrangement transforms meaning into broken and
reconfigured bodies, part-objects of isolated cries, indecipherable
culture, the other: dyslexic glossolalia.

Patterning constructs representation itself garnered against the plea-
sure of the text, its life-world constructed as semantic markup. Pat-
terning symmetricizes as well, reflecting screen and dream-screen as a
return to the reading subject, suddenly glancing at her reflection,
suddenly dreaming mandala-meaning criss-crossing the desperation of
the textual interior.

Diacritical marks such as < and > embedded as unquoted symbolic tend
towards doubled meanings as language engages with the articulation of
a formal-performative. Text oozes around marks, floods _things_ with
clots, disarms.

Repetition constructs the gasping-for-breath of the textual body, de-
sire for redundancy, an urgency which ripples into sound, contradicts
the very meaning it attempts to display. The _singular repetition_ is
the site of each and every textual unit: what has been spoken or writ-
ten belongs nowhere and to no-one, is subject to the precarious infin-
ity of duplication. Thus what has been written hinges on one's dream
of eternity, one's eternal dream, the continuation of _the tongue_
past every perturbation of the body.

Substitution turns text into sound, broadening or shortening words,
consonants, vowels; what is substituted increases in frequency, glid-
ing from the tongue, reconfiguring the maternal. The sound recuperates
the stereotypicality of common words, duplicating them within stereo
visibility as well. Site splits, spreads; citations curl across the
textual domain.

Utilization of programs (doctor, snoop, dissociated-press, tac, rev,
sed, grep, awk) creates negotiations among text, body, framework -
language, breath, screen - stutter, flow, formal definition. Meaning
seeps among protocols, across bodies, throughout discursive forma-
tions, including Internet applications, hard-copies, spoken-words,
ululations...

One speaks of the body of repetition or substitution, the html-body,
the patterned or centered body, the dismemberment of the capital-
letter-punishment. One thinks of the multiplicity of bodies; bodies
seeping among sites, sights, citations; bodies as _semantic flow_ -
political economies of subjectivities across partial domains. Each
reconfiguration of the surface (such as this itself, written in emacs)
turns towards an investigation, the peripheral image caught at the
edge of the mirror, the feeling that someone, some body, is behind you
this very moment.

The _tiny or weak_ body sits, ponders, a metaphysics occasioned by the
_tools of the Net_ - by any Thing (site, formation, flow) within which
language is mobile, constrained, channeled. The Jennifer-body is close
to the ground, close to meaning. The Alan-body remains over-determined
and tending towards foreclosure, defuge; it is the Jennifer-body that
carries on this work, the Julu-body that undermines it with sexuality,
rage, and the phenomenology of the _sleazy,_ torn, half-open, gleaming
in a midnight of artificial illuminations.

(Within and without, _it_ attempts speech, continues inconclusivity.)

what on earth is in the water up in uwo canada?.  what am i asking
from you? -- i've already said a number of times: come off of that
"i'm being impartial" pose unless you are willing to extend the same
critical eye to both parties.  you've made it very clear so far that
you are not -- once again, you fulminate about the "violence" done kim
dawn as if she were some sort of wounded fawn.

wrong.  she entered this list with one of, if not the, most vicious
attacks on someone i've yet seen with little or no provocation, and
continued firing off attacks augmented by misinformation.
understandably, her bizarre, mean, and irresponsible behavior
irritated people.  overall, the list has been remarkably forebearing.
your continued talk about the "violence" of response to her takes no
account of her own far greater violence.  i think i've said that how
many times now?

and no, there is not some conspiracy of computer surveillance extended
across national borders and that you'd speak as if it were a settled
thing in that tone only points up more painfully clearly the
rhetorical technique i am beginning to fear is becoming standard issue
up in UWO.  whenever a request comes in to take self-responsibility
and acknowledge misdoing, a salvo of wild accusations against
requester is sent out.  i have not seen one single word of apology
from kim dawn about any of her misdeeds.  i have not yet seen you turn
any sort of analytic eye publically to her appalling acts.  and it
doesn't take masses of research through the computer to find them --
post after post of vicious attack and misinformation.

as more of the harrassing and confused posts came in from kim dawn i
used the standard unix command to verify addresses, "finger," and got
several conflicting results.  that was one of the early signs in the
early spam episode that things were worse than they seemed, which was
discussed several times on list -- yet you act as if you had no knowledge
of it while claiming to remember incident...  and, yes, the previous post
to me was full of rhetorical violence and accusation... and, why, you are
posting from "julian" server, and everyone knows that julian is a name used
by british who are notoriously colonial... and you have begun evoking
the extreme sexual rhetoric of your... and, yes, could it be?

you must be the one who invented the secret "julian" computer virus!
unmask yourself villian!  we've seen behind your rhetoric of mild studenthood
to the international net terrorist beneath!  yes, yes, and i bet you shot
the kennedies too, that's the ticket!  it's all a plot, it's all a vicious
front of rhetorical violence aimed at innocent bystanders to get them to...

From Atlanta this response:

The contrast between my snipe at Michel's posting, and what Mark W. says
in the bit quoted at the top here, gets at some of the reason for my
apparent disagreement with a number of folks on this issue....I'm thinking
about the **social placement, or siting** of poetry as an institution.
Others are thinking about the fact that the LangPotes were strongly shaped
by Derrida and other related theory--and that much of their practice is
consequently somewhat familiar to and congenial to academix of that
persuation.....In part, I'm just talking about something elese...But I
return to the fact that Bob's "acadominent" (or whatever it was) label is
just completely silly..It implies a mainly acadmic character for LP.  How
can this be when, as a social practice, most competing schools of US
poetry are **so much more** dominant in academe, and dominated by their
character as acadmic practices (supported by grad writing programs,
sustained by university-sponsored literary mag's etc.)??

And another thing:  it is really a problem, this hand-wringing focus on
Derrida and deconstructionist influences..At least as important in shaping
most of the articulate theory-type LangPotes is the influence of Brecht
(that musty ol' perfesser)...The idea that social reality and therefore
poetry are *unfinished* until the reader/social actor make a major
contribution, is the single most important item in the LP theoretical
toolkit.

As chance has it, I found a copy of the article I believe you're referring
to among some old papers last year; I was eleven in Minnesota and the weekly
Time was News from Outside, I recall.  It's from June 2, 1967 -- Lowell's on
the cover and is the main feature of the article, which is eight DENSE pages
long -- no author noted (does anyone know who was covering books for Time
then?).  It is also striking for its leisurely lead and pace: maybe there
really is something to the idea that Laugh-in changed everything.  It's much
too long to key in (if anyone wants a copy I'll send or fax -- let me know),
but some of what pertains here is:

. . . In that respect, the testing is proceeding at a pace never before felt
in the history of American literature.  Two generations ago, many poets were
at work in the U.S. -- probably a greater number of major poets than at
present -- but their world seemed narrower.  The literary quarterlies spent
more space and passion discussing poetry, but their audience was limited.
Slowly, poetry moved out of the parlors of overstuffed gentility into the
academy.  Now it is moving out of the academy -- out of college lit courses
and esoteric coteries -- back to where it was when minstrels sang their
verses in the marketplace.  It exists once again in an ambiance of instant
feeling.  Poets are declaiming their works before large, theater-size
audiences in the cities and on the campuses.  Government grants, foundation
funds and universities with chairs for poets-in-residence are all conspiring
to strengthen or at least amplify their voices in the world at large.  Their
poetry books trip ever more briskly off the presses, and their phonograph
recordings feed a flourishing market. . .

And this is its 3-paragraph synopsis of poets who made a dent in the U.S. in
the 20th century(!):

. . . From Pound to the Beats.  In the 20th century so far, the devotees of
the "second chance" have constituted a remarkable poetic pantheon.  The Zeus
of that lofty company is himself still alive, thought he has long since had
his say.  Erza (sic) Pound, 81, now living in Italy, fathered modern English
poetry, freed it from excessive strictures of meter, rhetoric and prosody.
One of his earliest converts was T.S. Eliot, who sensed the dilemma of
modern, urban and areligious man, and whose dry, ironic style and endless
rhythmic ways of weaving contemporary sounds are echoed in virtually every
poet's work today.
        Of Eliot's generation, Robert Frost seemed a throwback; yet, while
he adhered to established forms, he commanded a deceptively simple vision of
man's vanities, his heart and his land.  More experimental, and less
accessible, were William Carlos Williams, a true avant-garde poet and master
of the spare, stripped-down image, and Wallace Stevens, a pointillist of
light, color and all intangible things.  Marianne Moore, now 79, constructs
unique mosaics from conversations, newspaper clippings and even scientific
tracts.
        W.H. Auden and Allen Tate were both, in Auden's words, "colonizers"
of the terrain that Pound and Eliot discovered.  Theodore Roethke was
already a major poet when he died in 1963 at 55.  The late Dylan Thomas,
with his crosscountry sweep of public performances, helped carry poetry into
the floodlit arena.  So did the beats.  Of them, only Allen Ginsberg retains
any influence, perhaps less for his poems than for his relentlessly acted
role as the be-whiskered prophet of four-letter words, homosexuality, pot,
and general din.  Still, in their better moments, the beats, now fitfully
imitated by the hippies, gave poetry a startling air of spontaneity. . .

Subject:       A query for Arabists

Greetings,
      A book has just been published in Tehran which claims to be a
translation of an Arabic satirical novel entitled <al-ensan ol-hayy>
(the Living Man) by a certain Mamduh ibn Aatel Abu Nazzaal (please
forgive the transcription). The action takes place in Baghdad in the
early eighties.  The translator is a prominent Iranian novelist called
Ahmad Mahmud, and according to bookshop gossip the translator is in
fact the real author.
      So the question now is whether the alleged original work and its
purported author truly exist. According to a short biographical
sketch included in the front matter the book was clandestinely
printed in Baghdad in 1984, but it has been widely reprinted abroad
ever since. The notice says the author was born near Basra in 1931 and
he died in exile in a European country in 1991.
     Any information that our Arab friends can provide would be
appreciated. Here are the particulars of the Persian "translation":
     <aadam-e zendeh> by Mamduh ibn-e Aatel Abu Nazzaal. Translated
into Persian by Ahmad Mahmud. Tehran: Mo'in Publishers, pp.198,
1376/1997. ISBN 964-5643-14-7.

Mark P --

Yeah, I always heard more Brecht than Derrida in the Tree of Equals Signs.
This is because I take the enfranchisement of gimme a T for Theory gimme a
D for Discourse in the academy -- TouchDown! -- to be a parallel
development to the near-total hostility to/from the New York School of
Language Poetry, one of those 'asymptotic' deals you get so much in the
poetry of the non-Brechtian graduating classes of 87, 92, 97 -- when's the
movie coming out? That is -- Language Writing gets formed independently of
but sympathetically with Theory. Then Theory morphs into cultural studies,
it all gets called 'bad writing' will-I nil-I, and everybody retrenches in
a shaky self-conscious consumerism. Cool! Meanwhile (and to near-total
hostility) a few Languge Writers (poets? prose writers? critics? I don't
know much about criticism, but I know what makes me anxious) finish their
dissertations and despite a needlessly brutal job market, find work
teaching. Again, cool! _Wish them well_. An economy that is doing so well
-- we'll see them go past 8000 today -- without appreciable distribution
of those gains -- are you better off etc == can only get so far by
squishing every last grape of thought. Well that's a stupid image. But one
should rather think of them, the acadominated, as brave employees, much as
one thinks of say, Wallace Stevens dictating sonnets, savoring _privately_
any oxymoron one may care to notice.

Ron Silliman mentions Time's cover story on American poetry:

<<Time Magazine (and its companion Life) is not a bad thumbnail index of
official culture, esp. in the 1936-70 timeframe. I don't know what they
thought of Stevens or WCW, but they did do a special issue on poetry (not a
"single author" job like the recent Robert Hughes deal on the visual arts,
which was too hokey and shallow for words, but did have some nice
illustrations) in 1964 that had Robert Lowell on the cover. It would be
worth it to look up that particular issue and report back what it said of
Verse.>>

And Guy Davenport wrote a very funny, very sad, brilliant riposte, which
appears in his wonderful _The Geography of the Imagination_, in which he
points out a number of very fine, 'important' poets Time had never heard
of, as it raised Lowell to his place in the poetic heavens...

Here's the latest, and perhaps last, update from The Port Charlotte
Poetics Taxonomy and Schoolification of Poetry Center.  Responses have
been dwindling but I've gotten enough good ones, I feel, to assure an
improved model of my list, which I plan to post in a month or so.  (It's
not changed enough to make quick posting worthwhile.)

I think I've said about all I had to say about my off-handedly calling
language poetry "acadominant."  It remains my impression that it is.
I'm sympathetic to the arguments of Mark Presjnar and others against my
impression--but do wish Mark would stop calling my impression absurd or
silly or "obviously gratuitous"; it might well be wrong but it's not
absurd or silly or obviously gratuitous.

Here is my last formulation of the basis for my impression:

        To me it seems like SUNY, Buffalo, is in
poetry                         what Caltech and MIT are in science, and
the many                       other liberal arts colleges not dominated
by lang                       po are like engineering schools.  Ergo,
lang po is
        acadominant in cultural prestige though not numerically
        or economically (probably the Romantic Poetry School
        is economically better off than either the lang po or
        APR school).  I consider this a compliment to lang po.

        My impression, too, is that the critical accompaniment
        to lang po is to the critical accompaniment to APR poetry
        as calculus to arithmetic.  It thus necessarily makes
        lang po seem more academic than APR poetry--again, a
        compliment, because I'm really saying that lang po is
        more seriously discussed than APR poetry,

Now to the main issue, my list of schools.  What follows is an excerpt
from a reply I just made, pretty much offhand, to a back-channeler's
wondering why I bothered with a "boringly academic" list of schools.

1) If I were you, I'd feel rather good about the specialness of what I
was doing if there were a list of the kinds of poetry being done out
there, and my poetry wasn't on it.  The list, in other words, could
be used to confirm innovation.

(2) For me, another poet, finding out that you're doing something not on
the list, would to be very exciting.  Maybe you've invented some
technique, or found some subject, that I could use in my own poetry.

(3) As a critic, too, I'd want to know what you were doing
"off-the-list" because it might illuminate what other poets are doing
that are either similar or in contrast, and because--as a critic--I
would want to feel I was covering everything extant.  A standard List of
Poetry Schools would make unlist poetries stand out, and would encourage
people to call those poetries to the attention of critics, English
professors, etc.  Just like a bird-watchers guide.

(4) If it turned out your poetry DOES fall into some school, I should
think you'd want to get in touch with others doing the same kind of
poetry.  Maybe they're doing things you aren't that could help you.
Maybe they have publishers who'd publish you if they knew about you.
Identifying poets by school would certainly make this easier.

(5) Similarly, as just a reader coming across work by a poet you
expecially liked, your being able to identify poets by school would
facilitate your finding others doing the same kind of thing.

(6) Any way of defining a kind of poetry such as assigning it to a
school inspires debate on the concrete attributes of the poetry under
consideration.  That leads to knowledge, which is a Good Thing.   I know
there are many who claim to believe that knowing anything more about a
poem than that you like it is a terrible kind of decadent scientism or
something, but that's rubbish--and they don't really believe it, for
they can all be caught using reductionist terminology like "rhythm,"
"imagery" and even "poem" in speaking of their favorite poems.

Along those lines (but not nearly as foolishly) you argue that no
categorization of a poem can be as vital as the poem.  Answer: of course
not; but categorization's function is not to replace poetry but to lead
to it, and to help make it discussable.

Any classificatory system of poetry (or anything else) will no doubt
have flaws, as you point out, but that is no argument against it, just
an argument never to accept any classificatory system as final, and to
continually point out its flaws and work to improve it.

A classificatory system will also be abused, but that's the fault of the
abusers, and those who let the abusers get away with their abuse, not
the system.  That someone might compose poetry that fits no school on my
list, and thus get left out of the catholic anthology I dream of, is
inevitable.  But it'd be much less likely, in my opinion, if a concerted
effort were always underway to keep a well-known list up to date than it
is now, with no such list extant.  And certainly such a poet would be no
worse off if a list were extant than he would be now.

****So much for my Informal Defense of Poetics Classification****

                     Thanks again to all who have helped with my list,
                                                               Bob G.

In this exchange about KimDawn that Tom Orange & Eliza McGrand, it remains
true that said KD has not entered into any of the discussion *about* her
behavior. I know, it's very Canadian to say this (although, then again,
it's not, as David Israel, I think, first made the suggestion), but why
couldnt KD make a small apology & then carry on with her posts of whatever
various of us want to call her writing (about/of/on) the body? Would it be
such a terrible thing to have done?

mark--

as i was relating th recent discussion to my partner last night, it
came out this way:  Bob's focus, as a critic, is primarily on visual
poetry & other "experimental" forms that are, generally, even less
accepted into "academic" discussions than are LangPo...  so it may
be that, from his perspective, LangPo has been wildly successful
at making inroads into the acadamy; while folks (such as yrself?
or ron) closer to th movement are more aware of the lack of such
inroads, especially in face of the merits ov th work.  so if it's
the case, that's interesting to me...
                                       & again, my comments have
been aimed, or intended, at sussing out th genesis of these
various perspectives, not defending their "objective" accuracy...
i'm  sceptical ov objectivity in general, but thats a different
thang altogether...
                                so i suppose one's view of the
"place in society" of a particular poetic practice is dependent
on your own placement, and as such is variable?  (& praps "community",
ov which there are many, wd be a more useful term than "society"?..
certainly those hoping for a monopoly on culture [--let's drop
Helen Vendelar's name again as th Wicked Witch--] wd rather posit
a singular society, w/ themselves controlling th gates...  oh, no,
there i go again, a whole new kettle of worms...)



but to take up th social placement thang just a bit: it still seems
to me that the examples you cite (deep image, the plain-spoken "I"
free-verse lyric of APR, aswellas LangPo & others) are all "situated" (or
situate themselves?) in relation to th same cultural context--accepted
into, or assailing, the traditions that get taught as Offical Verse
Culture...  obviously, some have been more successful
at gaining acceptance; and, as sed, i think Bob overestimates the
success of LangPo at making inroads.  but that still seems to be
the aim--as evidinced, among otherthings, by complaints by LangPo
partisans about th lack of official acceptance...   (this _is not_
a criticism, btw, and let me restate that i'm trying to describe
an extant situation, not prescribe a desirable one.)
                                                       and that's
in contrast to, (to some extent at least, or fr some participants) the
MailArt movement, and relatedly some ov th work that most engages my
& bob g's attentions--John M Bennett's _Lost & Found Times_, as one
example/locus--stuff that either despairs of or rejects the prospect
of integration into th mainstream of academically accepted "literature"...

relatedly, i'd point to a difference in social placement around (inside
or outside, but defined in relation to) the Official Verse Culture of
the (capital-L) Literary canon; and the Spoken Word "movement" exampled
in Slams, the NuYoRican Cafe, and MTV-targeting poets...  these later
seem to be defined/define themselves more in relation to Mass Culture,
rather than High Culture... & despite various overlaps amongst practitioners
& practice, i think that's a significantly different arena...


(i was glad fr rons comments, re the impetus behind the theory aspects of
his project, & it reinforces my sense that such praxis is/was integral,
and not just a tactic)

enuf fr now, more later
lbd

Here's the latest report from The Port Charlotte, Florida, Poetic
Taxonomy and Schoolification of Poetry Center.

The acadominance discussion that's developed as a side-thread seems to
continue to generate buzz.  While I sympathize with Mark Presjnar's
protest of my impression that language poetry is acadominant, I wish he
wouldn't call my impression "absurd" or "completely silly" or "obviously
gratuitous."  My impression might be wrong, but it's not absurd, silly
or obviously gratuitous.

I haven't anything new to say on the subject, but want to repeat what I
think I've been saying in one final formulation:

   To me it seems that in poetry SUNY, Buffalo, is to
the                  APR-dominant liberal arts universities what MIT and
Caltech
   are in science to the engineering schools--not dominant in
   number or even in money but in prestige.  Who really takes
APR          poetry seriously?

   I also believe that the critical accompaniment to language
   poetry is to the critical accompaniment to APR poetry
what              calculus is to arithmetic--which, for better or worse,
makes            language poetry seem more academic than APR poetry.
Again, it
   is simply taken more seriously (as, in more than a few
cases,           it ought to be.)

Now to an excerpt from a letter I wrote a few hours ago to someone on
the list who'd asked me back-channel why I was bothering with so
boringly academic a matter as my list.  It summarizes why I think the
list a good idea.

(1) A would-be innovator could check such a list to see if any of the
schools on it covered his work.  The list, in other words, could
confirm innovation--or keep one from making a fool of himself by
erroneously claiming to have invented something he hadn't.

(2) A standard List of Poetry Schools would make off-list poetries stand
out, and would encourage people to call those poetries to the attention
of critics, English professors, etc.  Just like a bird-watchers guide.

(3) The list would help on-list poets find others in their school, which
would have to be helpful.

(4) Similarly, a reader's being able to identify poets by school would
facilitate his finding others doing the same kind of thing as some poet
he particularly liked.

(5) A thorough list would keep tenth-rate anthologists or critics from
incorrectly claiming to have covered the full range of poetry--or even
the full range of some large category of poetry like "post-modernist
poetry."  And it would help responsible anthologists and critics keep
up-to-date.

(6) Any way of defining a kind of poetry such as assigning it to a
school inspires debate on the concrete attributes of the poetry under
consideration.  That leads to knowledge, which is a Good Thing.   I know
there are many who claim to believe that knowing anything more about a
poem than that you like it is a terrible kind of decadent scientism or
something, but that's rubbish--and they don't really believe it, for
they can all be caught using reductionist terminology like "rhythm,"
"imagery" and even "poem" in speaking of their favorite poems.

It is of course true that any poem is more vital than any category it
could be put into; but categorization's function is not to replace
poetry but to lead to it, and to help make it discussable.

Any classificatory system of poetry (or anything else) will no doubt
have flaws, but that is no argument against it, just an argument never
to accept any classificatory system as final, and to continually point
out its flaws and work to improve it.

A classificatory system will also be abused, but that's the fault of the
abusers, and those who let the abusers get away with their abuse, not
the system.

That someone might compose poetry that fits no school on my list, and
thus get left out of the catholic anthology I dream of, is inevitable.
But it'd be much less likely if a concerted effort were always under way
to keep a well-known list up to date than it is now, with no such list
extant.  And certainly such a poet would be no worse off if a list were
extant than he would be now.

I have no more to say right now, and--interesting in the list apparently
ebbing rapidly--I'll probably not add anything to this thread until I
post the next version of my list, which won't be for a while.
  My thanks to all who sent me comments.

Mark: I was referring to a number of **discourses** that are dominant in the
academe at large and, more particularly, in the U.S., which is undoubtedly
the biggest world-wide consumer of so-called French or Continental theory .

It still seems obvious to me that theory came first and forced a change in
the practice of many poets associated with Langpo.  Of course, most creative
writing programs have not quite adjusted to the age of theory but then again
their concerns are not really representative of what's hot in the Humanities
today . . .  Also, it would be misleading to see this debate over Langpo's
collusion with theory and/or the academy exclusively in terms of how many
jobs have been offered to Language poets.=20

Carumba, my revisit to my list of poetry schools took so long to get
posted, and I had had so much trouble keeping track of letters I was
referring to in writing it, I was sure I'd accidentally trashed it.  I
couldn't find it in my Sent Box, either.)  So I rewrote the whole stupid

for the second posting.  (On the other hand, you Grummanologists out
there now have a terrific opportunity to see how my outlook changed
between the first version and the second.)

This nicely brings into focus a basic issue of taxonomy: is such a
list intended as a description of the poetry qua poetry, or is it
descriptive of the status of the writing / writers within social
groupings (etc.)? -- to think of an analogy from natural sciences, is
a school (species) defined by its evolutionary origins (here, the
nature of the thought & expression that it expresses), or by its
environmental placement (here, how it's received, and what evolves
from that reception or non-reception)?

Are we considering (a) what's included (what culture) within the
text?, or (b) how the text has happened to flow into the stream
of culture?

This issue of the basis of taxonomy is relevant not only to the
LangPo facet of Bob's list.  It is relevant -- probably to nearly
every category.  I've had some questions or quibbles w/ other parts
of that draft list for reasons related to this.  For instance, is
John Ashbery really mainstream?  When exactly did he become so?  Does
calling his work mainstream reflect on the nature of the writing qua
writing, or merely on the fact that he has managed to make a good
name for himself and to become accepted in (the perceived)
establishment?  So: how important is the transitory phenomenon of an
illusory (from one vantage) establishment in our understanding of the
nature of the writing (on, as they say, its own merits)?

One other thing: what about historical change? -- for instance, once
upon a time Gary Snyder would have been squarely placed in with the
Beats (if you'll allow that turn of phrase).  When did the Ecology
School (or whatever it was called) get defined?  Does this reflect a
change in his writing, or is it more related to his extra-poetic
activities?  etc. etc. -- I'm not looking at the Bob G. flowchart in
any detail right now, but merely mentioning a couple of points -- I
think kindred questions are applicable to most of the categories.

That said, it's an interesting procedure to try to sort out . . .

I didn't think I was wringing hands. Perhaps those who do think that
awareness of the reader's contribution to the poem is hardly peculiar to
Language Poets, although it may be beyond most AWP types.

I've been out of the office for a few days (painting the kitchen of yet
another apartment I do not own - a great way to test the torquing power of
one's marriage and yes we are still in love), so in the process of scrolling
through the umpteen messages from the list I missed who the original poster
of the message was which Jay excerpts below. Got no problem with anyone's
quibbles - these reports of mine from Naropa try to occupy the narrow,
politic and uneasy ground between mere reportage and critical description -
with the net result of making me appear something of a Naropa cheerleader. I
don't attend the school, though, nor am I a grad. I had a definite
anti-Naropa chip on my shoulder when I first moved here, formed in part -
mistakenly - by Tom Clark's infamous but very entertaining little book about
the school of scandal run here by Trungpa. But I would agree that Naropa
seems to have gone the route from being a school for the marginal to
something more institutionalized, as must be inevitably the case when a
school has been around for 20 years. Though, of course this is mere
suppostion - I wasn't around in its woolier days. Still, it's a great place
to hang out and one of the very few things of its kind in the country. I no
longer take it for granted.

I hope to send the List reports on some of the readings I made it to, incld.
Lorenzo Thomas's and Lisa Jarnot's (wow). Tomorrow, the show closes with a
reading by (among others) Ronald Johnson.

A P.S. to Henry Gould, if this issue is still of interest. The idea that
"art is to hide art" is best addressed for me by this Beckett quote (from a
Paris Review piece in 1977):

"The confusion... is all around us  and our only chance is to let it in. The
only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess... There will
be new form, and... this  form will be of such a type that it  admits the
chaos and does not try to say that it is really something else."

This would seem to include much of what's been happening on the innovative
front.

As a fairly recent Naropa grad, I would love for you to expand on this
impression of yours, both your sense of what constituted illegitmacy and
what has changed.  Also, your sense of the timeframe in which this may

Pat, thanks for your reports from naropa & particular thanks for posting
these 4 lines from the Beckett statement. I know they had wide currency
among a number of the poets I've hung out with, & many I havent, but read &
continue to read. (I think Coolidge cites the statement with approval
someplace : "Finding a form for the mess" (?)) Somewhere i wrote in a poem
"Finding a mess for the mess." Yes, it makes sense to read much
contemporary writing by this light. Not that sd writing stems necessarily
from the Beckett statement, but that--as so often--Beckett articulates
what's "in the air", shows us "where we're coming from." Looking for &
headed towards,, likewise. David

i have been very up front all along abt my inability to be impartial.  i
have also acknowledged your position as a recipient of unfair/unwarranted
attacks.  short of reposting and analyzing all of the eliza/kim exchanges
-- i dont see where this would be beneficial to anyone -- i have entended
my critical eye to both parties.  i think kim's reading of and responses
to your posts -- have i not said this? -- was wrong.  plain enough.

we disagree over how wrong: i say wrong, you say wrongest most heinous
most insidious bizarre ruthless most vicious to date and on and on and on.

further, we disagree over who is more judiciuosly extending their critical
eye to both parties.  i think i have been, and i also think you refuse to
even consider let alone address my suggestion that your language contains
potentially dangerous logic as well.  if you dont wish to, fine, we can
disagree over this too.

first, when have i not taken *self*-responsibility? i've already said that
while i acknowledge kim's misdoings i'm not in a position to take
responsibility for them, analyze them or apologize for them b/c they're
hers not mine. second, when have i spoken of this as a settled thing?
it's clearly not settled, therefore i continue to speak.

and third, conspiracy theories are hardly my hobby horse, but let me try
to make sense of this.  i don't know who this kim dawn person is, she
attacks hurts and frightens, she may be a flamethrower.  i use the
unix 'finger' command and see what that tells me.  i get "several
conflicting results" (what does this mean eliza?).  ok then, i do an
altavista search, and what do i find?  the very first hit produces:

CyberKinky WebSite - Kim And Dawn
     Kim And Dawn. 30 Minutes. These two are best friends who decided to
     do a video together. This is real amateur video shot in a bedroom
     with a handheld...
     http://www.graphicad.com/pubsampl/hfront/rev/rev02.htm - size 3K -
     23.Feb.97 - English

hmm.  kim dawn, kim and dawn.  coincidence?  naw, can't be.  no, no, it's
in fact the best evidence for identity i can find!  and it's the best
evidence because it fits in so perfectly with all my doubts and fears. so
i post the filmtext from this site in an effort to identify, contain and
with any luck silence and eliminate that which i perceive to be a threat.

nope, no dangerous logic there.  i guess we disagree on this too.

Tom Orange --

First off -- I will apologize for the effort to be clear in this post, even
as I acknowledge first that I am only occasionally capable of effort and
second that I know neither what people imagine they're not ignoring when
they claim that they're being clear nor what people mean when they say they
don't know what clarity is -- first, Tom -- this is an Olsonist list. I
seem to remember conflation of identities to be a big trope for Olson,
especially in the first volume of Maximus. As every single post should have
begun, "Who is Frank Moore?" or for that matter "Who is Nancy Daum?"

To paraphrase (that is, to pretend to be the Marshall) -- Damon, Loden,
Bowering and Bromige were posting their apparently benign parodies of the
staid in-clubbishness of this let's say it nebbishy list. It's my
understanding that of the sex-toy/innuendo posting poets, very few have met
f2f. So what! Jay Schwartz posted a note to the effect of: less of this
arch sex writing please. At the same time, a private note thanking Charles
(B. one assumes) for a recommendation was posted to the list. Kim Dawn
posted her note -- addressed to Jay -- to the list.  Doug Barbour and I
both cleared our throats. Hoa / Dale defended Jay. Dodie spoke up, defended
Jay / Hoa / Dale. Kim replied (defending herself and citing Acker). Stephen
Elwood, alias Emily Vey Duke, arrived, ostensibly to support Kim. Tom
Orange stepped in. Somewhere in all this, Eliza posted a note, ending with
a June Jordan poem. Kim responded, attributing the Jordan poem to Eliza.
Misattribution, though -- can we call that misreading? Throughout, David
Israel, Aldon Nielsen, David Bromige, Tom Mandel, Mark Weiss and Henry
Gould were posting.

This is all, if I remember correctly (and I'm going to admit that I'm not
peeking at the archives) before Kali and Joe intervened.

Meantime, both Kim and Jay have preferred to talk about other things, I think.

Identity, Deleuze/Guattari wrote in Anti-Oedipus, is something like a point
travelling over the surface of an egg (!). Once again, I'd like to clear my
throat along with Doug Barbour and ask that the 'virtual offence' be
acknowledged here. At first I thought that it was Jay (whom I've never met)
who would be offended, but the offense has been taken by Eliza. When Kim
attributed June Jordan's poem to Eliza, she made her seem not as though she
(Eliza) were citing a text, but as if she were presenting her own narrative
-- narrative, identity, ugh. If Kim has already apologized for the error,
then shouldn't the matter be dropped? Claims to objectivity (or their
doppelgangers, the recusancies) are mythological claims. I like Rilke as
much as the next cat-shaped eraser climbing out of the shotglass, but I
also know what to do when among people who refuse to acknowledge right and
wrong as categories -- I cut them off. So in that way, I see it as being
like a bar -- but in that way only.

Good luck,
Jordan

        Thank you for the clever & insightful post (below)! Well wrote!
        I have about 2 questions:
           what would be the next level of details (magnification x10) in your
description of Langpo forming "independently of but sympathetically with
Theory" Who in your conception are the major players at this time? What
forms parallel to what?
          What gets called "bad writing"? Who's levelling this against whom?

        I would also like to point out the sheer brilliance of

                the non-Brechtian graduating classes of 87, 92, 97

Being On Line is now the feature on the Lusitania (publishers) Web Site -
you can find this at http://www.thing.net/lusitania

The site is a bit awkward, but I take no responsibility :-)

It will give you a taste of what the book's about. You can also order it,
of course, with the information provided.

For those who don't know, I edited Being On Line, which includes material
from the Cybermind, Fop-l, Design-l, and Future Culture lists, as well as
a lot of other cultural/art materials.

(Honestly, I can write better copy than this... if you only knew...
alas...)

        I tend to agree, or would like to. So I will ask the same question I asked
Jordan a moment ago:
        as you see it, who is reading what? When, exactly?
        There are the Marxists and structuralists and feminists and existenialists
        post-structuralists, post-colonialists, etc, etc.

        What schools followed what schools?

As a white male misogynists of the hegemonic order I'd lioke to protest the
constant insult and inuendo hurled at those of my kind. We're an easy target

I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starting to feel a lot of
displeasure, pain might be a better word, in reading the list.

I think it's obvious that Kali Tal's POV is significant, that Kim Dawn's
writing has merit, that Mark Weiss is attacking nobody, that David Bromige
speaks with large intelligence and generous wit, that Dodie Bellamy writes
with a gravity and grace unmistakeable, that... I don't want to leave
anyone out, but I'm sure my point must be clear.

Communities are much easier to tear apart than to build. This one has
tottered long enough that noone should expect it to be become a stable and
founded thing, that probably wouldn't be appropriate. But I think it's
about to fall apart altogether, and I wouldn't like that. This is a selfish
post, iow.

I hope each of you will think about the most extreme things you want to
say, or the most dismissive, or even the most profound, and consider
whether they are true or necessary or a contribution. If you are posting
long messages three times daily, perhaps you'll even think about cutting
down to one every day or so. Can you really have that much to say?

I know the tone of this note is avuncular, but I hope it won't be taken as
patronizing. It's not intended that way. And, I'm no fuddy-duddy (except
perhaps in using that term!), I've made my points aggressively when I
thought I had to or just when I was in a mood to or whatever. I'm not done
either, and I don't ask any of you to be done.

Just, right now, lets think about the list in a larger sense and see
whether we can find some more productive areas for dialogue. I hope we can.

Its worst than  t h a t , Elliza Doesplenty!  Daniel Bouchard's Canadian
speech impediment, reflected in his writing "worth" instead of "worse",
prompts me to tell the list that Bowering, too, has the same impairment, &
pronounces his own name "Dorge", giving us a further D B. The upper west
side accent of the Listmaster, which substitutes "D" for "Ch", Gives us one
further D B . Jacques Derrida's folks used to call him "Derrida-garcon,"
which we translate as Derrida Boy. Then there is, of course, [Kim] D awn  B

Curses.  A terrible fate has befallen my copy of Sparrow #67 (April
1978), the Black Sparrow Press single-author pamphlet, this one
containing Nathaniel Tarn's "Birdscapes, With Seaside".  I lent it to a
student, who managed either to lose it, or destroy it and pretend to
have lost it.  So -- does anyone out there know where I can get a copy?
Failing that, is anyone willing to help me violate copyright law and
photocopy one for me?

I dont know, but I don't much like it. I was glad to find out later, as an
adult, that it was perfectly fine as a child using crayons to color
through, over, and all about the lines. I know this isn't what you mean,
but the phrase you suggest raises all kinds of questions: what lines, why
between, etc.

Unnnh, George, you *may* have misconstrued the title "Platonic" on that
lounge?

And, re: David letting the training cat out of the weight bag, *my* trainer
is named Talal, and his father was the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.
("before," as Talal says, "it was fashionable"). This kind of thing can
happen only in DC.

Talal himself works out 17 minutes a week. Yet he ripples head to foot.
When he sits next to a weight machine he gets stronger.

On the other hand, that bruiser Ron Silliman and I used to work out at the
same gym on Valencia street in SF, the Sports Palace, also where the US
Olympic lifting team trained. The artist Doug Hall, Lyn Hejinian's brother,
also worked out there -- to better effect I thought than either Ron or I --
and he did an interesting video about the place.

How many drinks have I had, does anyone know?

Because I wasn't there, you can bet I'm speculating my head off. I don't
know who was reading what -- except insofar as I can go back to the
articles, give dates of key articles and note the writers quoted/stolen
from/inspired by there. As I said earlier today, you can count on me for
lazy assertions. If it seems clear to Michel that Theory -- which I'm
taking as a link, an oppenische metonymy for Derrida -- precedes language
writing, then I would feel more comfortable retracting my hunch (can you
retract a hunch?) if there were cites, dates, etc. Delmore Schwartz (ever
the list's favorite gossip) claims that when he went to T.S. Eliot's
place, the pages of Jessie Weston's _Ritual to Romance_ were mainly uncut.
Ain't the influence of Reagan great? Anecdotes for everybody! Where was I!
Oh! I was saying that "which came first, langpo or theory" would be a
great interview question to put to Charles Bernstein, Bruce Andrews, Bob
Perelman, Ron Silliman, Susan Howe, Michael Palmer, Clark Coolidge,
Jackson Mac Low, Barrett Watten, Carla Harryman, Bernadette Mayer,
Haryette Mullen, and the New York Times' favorite language poet, Ann
Lauterbach (hi Ann!). (Note well: I am not saying that any of the above
listed people are "language poets". I am merely saying that I enjoy
reading interviews with these people. You could ask Tom Clark or David
Shapiro or John Yau too, of course. Whose interviews are also enjoyable.)
I suspect that the answers will vary regionally in tone if not in meaning
by the three coasts -- NY, SF, and Detroit.

Again, I am only speculating. Steve Reich, when asked if "Come Out" was
the first thing he wrote, said no, of course not, he wrote lots of
academic exercises and music-of-a-young-composer pieces that nobody was
interested in, but when he wrote "Come Out" people paid attention to him.
It may be that Michel is thinking that the proliferation in America of
Derrida's work predates significantly the publication of the major works
of the language poets. I dunno. I still see the language poets as pretty
clearly influenced by the New York School, Black Mountain and (yes) the
Beats -- that is, as a post-New American Poetry movement. It's a facile
reading, to be sure, and it entirely avoids the issue of language poetry
quiddity (thank god).

DB is a type of beer down this side of the world. Tends to be avoided by
Ladies, Poseurs, Urban Gentry et al. A real bloke drink really.  You can
still buy it by the big bottle in wooden crates - which also function fine
upside down as seats. They have a fairly anti-hegemonic function really
-symbols of rural motorbike gang, local pissartist types, and unfortunately
make a hell of a lot of money for one prime WMHM (see subject)

So what does this mean?

In light of recent "discussions' I thought I would post a query about
Graham (see latest "New Yorker) as a forestallment to see if I get
any bites:

Richard Howard is quoted on her:

>I find the recent work exceeds my capacity
to
relate
it to experience.

Verbally she has gond beyond my
grasp.<

I'm uncsure what he is talking about.  It might concern the rhythms
of her recent poetry, but any enlightenment would be appreciated.

I tried. I really did. But when I got to the part about her poems being

I don't draw these distinctions, or rather let them turn into border-
line/ing (or they turn me out); elsewhere I use _inscription_ to repre-

send _one_ through matrix/mater tendrils.

I'm sorry you feel I was too harsh.  You sure are right to emphasize the
question of valuation, too....This just goes to show how
suspicious/hostile I am to poetry academe, I guess!  (Sour grapes?...
Various constraints kept me from ever getting a post-grad degree, and a
career as an academic would sure beat the day job I actually have!)  Since
to you the acadominant label was not primarily a term of abuse, or a
sneer, I retract most of what I said...and all of the tone, which I never
wanted to seem abusive...(I say *most* since I think we agree to disagree
on whether LP and similar tendencies are more academically-oriented than
others..)

Anyway, little that I said could comment as well (in my opinion) as the
couple of posts from Silliman.  I thought they said a lot of what needed
to be said about LP in this context.

I'm sorry though not surprised many berated you for your taxonomic
interests, Bob.  In theory, I share a little of this suspicion toward
poetry systematics....But in practice you've opened up one of the better
discussions the list has seen for some time.  A tip of the hat

Thanks, David. I like "finding a mess for the mess." Actually, now that I
think on it more, I believe that Review piece is from 1987 - oops! I'll
double check tonight when I get home. And to think I tried how many times to
sell that issue to used bookstores. I'd never come across it anywhere else
but it certainly sums up "the case" for me and with Beckett's ("sunlight is
much overrated, I think") characteristic unfussiness.

Perhaps on a somewhat related note, Aldon Nielsen writes in the most recent
River City that "the most exciting poetry today is not a poetry effacing
itself before a non-linguistic truth, but a verse in which we read and write
the truth *of* poetry." To admit to a certain kind of poverty, if you will,
can be, oddly enough, very enriching.

Pat, thanks for your reports from naropa & particular thanks for posting
these 4 lines from the Beckett statement. I know they had wide currency
among a number of the poets I've hung out with, & many I havent, but read &
continue to read. (I think Coolidge cites the statement with approval
someplace : "Finding a form for the mess" (?)) Somewhere i wrote in a poem
"Finding a mess for the mess." Yes, it makes sense to read much
contemporary writing by this light. Not that sd writing stems necessarily
from the Beckett statement, but that--as so often--Beckett articulates
what's "in the air", shows us "where we're coming from." Looking for &
headed towards,, likewise. David

That seems to me a very sharp and helpful observation.  Yep, POV is indeed
at the root of much of this debate.  To so many of us, it's *that other
poet (or grouping)* that seems to be *inside* getting goodies.  But that
other poet feels she's on the outside, and we're inside.

Interesting dynamic, a sort of identity politix of poetry (..as I'm not
the first to suggest)  Like the tensions between social groups who feel
(and are) oppressed, and become polarized and mutually suspicious, rather
than uniting.  Bob has suggested I misunderstood his meaning, and that the
LP/academe identification was never meant to be a put-down; so I guess
the whole exchange was partly a demonstartion of this polarizing
dynamic...(Tho as I've just posted, he and I still disagree as to whether
LP should be identified as having much to do with academe..and if I recall
rightly Ron S's post was very good at articulating why I think it doesn't)

Fair enough....
As has been pointed out, much of this has a

To an extent, we disagree 'cause we're looking at slightly different (tho'

Yep, ...what's interesting (to put your point slightly differently) is how
a discussion like this very rapidly gets to a point where the sociology
and the nature of the work qua poetry become hopelessly (or rather,
hopefully) entangled...

Your Ashbery mention is very apposite.  As plenty of people have mentioned
in print before this, he is historical monstrosity.  **What** are the NY
Times and various middlebrow venues, and academe as well, and all the
big-name poetry mags and establishment anthologies, doing lionizing this
guy??  They'd sooner lose a foot to amputation than give support to any
other poet that writes like him!  (And while I certainly concur that after
Tennis Court Oath he developed in somewhat less paratactic and
hypermodernist directions, I don't subscribe to the idea of a major break
in his work--His work ought to be a lot of people's *worst nightmare*...
but somehow he's been *disinfected* and accepted by those people as the
one token representative of his kind...) So the placement of poetic work
and careers, within social space, is very hard to disentangle from the
experience of reading (and writing) the poetry itself...

That's a large part of the reason that Bob G's postings have been so
interesting and fecund for the list.. they bring those entanglements
forward as a subject for discussion..

For the severalth time, I'll recommend Jed Rasula's American Poetry Wax
Museum as a fascinating treatment of these issues.

I am reminded by the discussion of LangPo & the academy, & Jordan Davis's
last post, of a visit to the U of A some years ago by that great
interpreter of deconstruction, Jonathan Culler, who was giving lectures on
poetry, but only poetry of the Romantic period, with an occasional
reference to TS Eliot. They were brilliant lectures except for the fact
that they seemed totally unaware of the contemporary & recent poetry that
seemed to me most open to his thinking. So I asked him why he (& others of
his ilk in the Eastern US universities deep into Derrida et.al.) had
nothing to say about those poets (I said then) whose work so fitted into
their theorizing such as Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, etc (I wasnt then
all that aware of the LangPoets by name, & also thought he would at least
know the names I mentioned -- but he did not!). He had no answer for me,
then, & I'm not sure he would now. So perhaps the question is which *parts*
of the academy, or even which academies, are paying attention to the new
(recently so) poetics. I do know this: more big publishers publish books on
contemporary theory than publish books of contemporary poetry...

Mark P. --

To what extent is the influence of the New Yorker "responsible for"
(used advisedly) the "Ashbery is okay" phenomenon, I wonder?

The number of poets whose work appears in the New Yorker is (I think)
pretty small -- and of those whom that magazine publishes, there are a
select handful whose poems tend to appear again & again thru the
years (including several I like a lot -- e.g., Ashbery, Mewin, Simic).

The New Yorker's role / status in broad American culture is, it could
be argued, unique.  For one thing, it has (if I'm not mistaken) far and
away the vastest circulation of ANY "serious literary" publication in
the country (or -- heck -- the world);  & it's a weekly = Ubiquitous.

Acceptance by that mag as one of a few dozen whose poems they'll
oftentimes carry upwards of half a dozen times per year, seems a seal
of approval for a fairly broad & influential hub of the culture.

There are (naturally) *many* other elements in the Ashbery-in-America
phenom -- one being (simply) the long tenure of his contribution.
Heck, even Ginsberg gets flower petals, eventually.  As I understand
it (I wasn't around in those days), for a long time, Ashbery was
severely criticized & ridiculed & deemed something of a laughingstock
(rather as John Cage was -- or for that matter, Phillip Glass till
at least the mid-'80s) in highbrow circles.  Eventually, the court
jester gets a cabinet post, natch: the stone that's rejected (but
establishes a strong name), becomes the corner stone.  If you're part
of the dialogue, doesn't matter too much if the press is good or bad.

As said, just a thought (or thought & a half).

Last Friday, if memory serves:

Keith Abbott opened the evening with several short stories. These were
straightforward realistic narratives, frequently funny, somewhat ribald, and
tinged with a careful attitude of pathos toward the inevitability of aging
and the lot of the working class. "Three things my Irish father instilled in
me: a fear of the dark, an eternal mistrust of politicians, and a deep
respect for the fishy things in the ocean." The best of these pieces was
"Sayonara, Adios, Goodnight:" a seemingly biographical account of Abbott's
glory days as a high school football player in Washington and his singular
encounter with "the man who put death inside me," Clarence Clancy Williams,
a freight train of a running back who later went pro and who for sixty
minutes on an autumn night more than 20 years ago pounded the knowledge of
mortality painfully deep into Abbott's bones.

A very pregnant Wang Ping read next. Her coolly enamelled accounts of life
as a child in China during the Cultural Revolution only served to increase
the strange horror of hearing how her mother, for instance, was driven
through the city streets by teenage Red Guards in a humiliating show of
public punishment. "We are nothing but grains and yet all we think of is to
crush one another - what is the matter with us?" In another story - the
theme again revolving around heartbreak, loss and exile - she demonstrated
how the imagination has the power to reshape reality simply by the writing
of stories. I don't do it justice - it was both funnier and more poignant
than I get across. Her last piece was the somewhat too long "8000 Miles of
Clouds & Rain" - an elegy for Allen Ginsberg centering on her work as a
translator for Allen at a conference of Chinese poets. A paean to New York
City as the exile's paradise, it recounted how AG flew into a rage when the
Chinese poets opined that things were getting better in Tibet and his
subsequent apology : "Sorry to yell for Buddha."

Lorenzo Thomas closed the evening with a marvellously warm and expansive
reading of new poems - I hope to be collected somewhere soon. From "Morning
Raga:" "while you were sleeping undoubtedly some tragedy occured - but
somewhere someone is singing." The best title of the night: "The Sadness of
Space Exploration," which Lorenzo confessed to having stolen from a
student's essay. Though brimming with easy humor, Thomas's reading of life
is a deeply moral and compassionate one. One poem, "An Education," described
listening to Mingus through the ajar back entrance of the Five Spot.
"Hollandaise Salsa" recalled a trip to Amsterdam with fellow poet Ricardo
Sanchez. Typical of his generous range of thought and emotion, it was both a
critique of colonialism and a postcard of nostalgic wanderlust familiar to
anyone who's ever been homesick while abroad: "salsa leaking out the windows
of the lost lost in their dreaming - feels like home." A smattering of other
lines scribbled in haste: "the heart a speedbag for emotions." "You're not
alone as you think. That would be impossible. But God is not a pinch
hitter." (Recalls Delmore Schwartz's famous line: "existentialism means
nobody else can take a bath for you"). "We have decided everyone has a
problem - that's our idea of equality."

My problem with "acadmoninant" is unrelated to whether it is thought to be
a compliment or a pejorative -- Seemed to me such a term should either
mean a poetry dominated by academics (or by the academic) -- or a poetry
that is dominant in the academy -- Clearly neither is true of any
iteration of LANPO one might care to describe ("My favorite definition
still the one offered nearly a deacde ago by Ron Silliman, to the effect
that a language poet is anyone who has evern been accused of being a
language poet) --

The MIT is to whatever as Buffalo is to the rest won't work for anybody
familiar with academic pecking orders --

and it certainly does make a difference which vantage point one chooses
from which to view the academy -- I suppose LANPO might appear
acadmoninant to anybody visiting Buffalo for a weekend (though it didn't
to me) -- but out where the vast majority of teaching is done in this
country things couldn't look more different --

____
as to how the pcking order maintains itself impeccably, I here reproduce a
letter recently received from a West Coast academy -- since I already have
a good job I am able to find this amusing:

Dear Dr. Nielsen:

I am sorry to have taken so long to inform you about the status of our
search for a full professor.  The search continues, and I am writing to
ask whether you still wish to be considered for the position.  You are one
of a dozen applicants remaining on our list, so I hope you are still
interested.  In the Fall MLA Job Information List we will advertise the
position again, but we are opening the search to associate professors.  We
hope to compile a short list by the end of the calendar year.


___
I told them that, while it would certainly be interesting to be part of
such an unusual process, I would decline.

______

part of the problem I've seen in the recent discussions of "which came
first" regarding "theory" and certain theoreticllay inclined poetries has
been the foreshortened perspective -- take a gander at this:

"there is no world of objects which antedates the experiences of any
individual.  All perceptual objects . . . are integrations of contact and
distance experience, achieved through a process which began as practical
or organic and became theoretical when the practical act was inhibited."

This is not a Francophone academic writing -- It was published in 1945,
and today's whiz kid award goes to the first listomaniac to identify the
American philospher whose position is here described --

I don't know about the hypothesis that the Nyer has "mainstreamed" or
"ok'd" Ashbery, mainly because, with a few exceptions, Ashbery being one,
the Nyer's poetry editor sucks.  I don't know of a repectable magazine
that publishes a higher percentage of truly vapid poems - somehow Tina
Brown has managed to update/upgrade the rest of the mag without bringing
the poetry along for the ride.  I'd rather see a years worth of poems by
Tupac in there than what they're currently dishing out.  So, yeah, I
suppose it lends a certain respectability to Ashbery among a certain
constituency, but not among many poets or serious poetry readers.   -m.

I hope some people on the list can provide more info about publishing.  It
is my understanding that print runs of academic texts are "typically" 500
copies and that those runs almost never sell out.  If a theoreticl text
does "take off" it usually means it is being adopted for classroom use at
a goodly number of schools - that's the market, yes, for theoretical texts
(and for most "literary" texts as well)?  This is, perhaps, why you see
all sorts of theoretical collections coming out all the time, including
texts of "primary" works with secondary criticism (I'm thinking here of
the series that's out that provides different theoretical readings of
literary works, e.g. *Heart of Darkness* collected with feminist, New
Historical, Decon, Psych readings of it) - as authors and publishers try
and keep current and sell books for class adoption. Now contemporary
poetry - I don't know who the target audience would be for a "big
publisher"??  Sheesh, don't Romance Novels, self-help books, New Age
books, horror books ...  sell a zillion times more than than contemporary
poetry and contemporary theory combined?

I guess the big question is what do we learn when we compare publishing
trends?  What does it mean that Stephen King sells so many books and has
so many films made from his books - btw, I use the phrase "so many books"
with caution.  To be a best seller in this country how many books do you
have to sell?  It's a very small number, compared to the population, yes?

Of course Language writing is as much an argument against (de Man) as it is a
collusion with poststructuralism (say, in the work of Althusser).  Moreover,
it strikes me that the term "academic poetry" as an implied or explicit
description of Language writing is  pejorative and/or confusing given its
already strong association with New Critical poetry. Nor does the prevalance
of certain aspects of critical theory on American campuses necessarily
translate into the dominance - or even the acceptance - of a specific
poststructuralist aestheic practice - either that explored in various ways by
the Language school, or any other.

I was settling into the vast expanse of my customary brown leather couch
in the White Male Hegemonist's Club yesterday, looking forward to a
night of port wine and cigars with some of the regulars (George Bush,
Donald Trump, John Hollander, Seamus Heaney, George Bowering, Charles
Bernstein, Iggy Pop, Gore Vidal, Robert Bork, and others of that ilk and
kidney), and I happened to glance up at the gilt-framed oil portraits of
past members of our club, all fine chaps, really "our sort" -- Nelson
Rockefeller, George Orwell, Jack Kerouac, General Patton, Elvis, Charlie
Chaplain, Sir Stephen Spender, Ringo Starr -- and I thought to myself
(just as the butler showed up with the evening papers and lit my cigar)
I thought wistfully to myself, you know, Archambeau old bean, maybe we
are all a bit too much alike, maybe, just maybe, we ought to let a few
others join, for a change.  And just then the door burst down and the
angry crowds were upon us.

Subject:      Hank Lazer's OPPOSING POETRIES and "academic ideas"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Seeing Hank Lazer's name appear on the poetics list several times
yesterday reminds me that I've been curious about the fact that though
there's been a lot of recent discussion about Bob Perelman's THE
MARGINALIZATION OF POETRY, I haven't seen much talk about Hank's double
volume of criticism on language poetry and related matters, OPPOSING
POETRIES. It makes, I think, for a crucial read on the subject that's come
up recently about the relation between language poetry and the academy,
and language poetry and theory. I've read no recent volume of criticism
that seems to me as SPECIFIC as Hank's book about the differences between
the academic "network" (if you will) and the "network" (loosely and not)
of poets associated with language poetry. While it is fairly
clearly targeted towards an academic context, OPPOSING POETRIES insists on
the DIFFERENCES that are at stake in making a place for language poetry
inside the academic world (and not solely there, of course). I think he
also delineates pretty carefully where language poetry is related to
literary theory, and where it differs from it--he shows why language
poetry can by no means be reduced to "literary theory by some other
means."

        In any case, I don't think one ought to be too quick to collapse
distinctions between terms such as "academic discourse," "literary
theory," "language poetry" and the like. There are many types of discourse
that are not literary theory. There are many types of literary theory
which are not academic discourse. Neither one of them refers to a single
kind of activity anyway, and all of them produce some
interesting books, and perhaps more often less interesting ones. "Language
poetry" itself intersects with both these possibilities--there are some
academic books about it, there are some "language poets" who took a lot
from French literary theory, and others who took less from it. Actually
I've seen some "language poets" be rather xenophobically American, at
least in conversation, far more likely to put forward Stein or Williams
than Derrida.

        I find myself fairly skeptical about claims that this
or that theory, this or that school of poetry, can be called in any simple
sense "dominant in the academy." My own sense is that the disciplinary
strategies by which academic departments and careers are shaped, ALWAYS
these days takes precedence over any particular "literary" or
"theoretical" approach--most approaches sooner or later get some piece of
the bureaucratic distribution of the department, and that's where it
stops. What's dominant is MONEY and BUREAUCRATIC organization,
and while there are many fine theorists and poets who work in academic
contexts, the specifics of what they think are much less important to
university organization than the fact that the organization can seem to
"cover" and "have an expert in" as many "relevant" areas as possible. The
traditional Milton scholar may have disdain for the new scholar of
subaltern studies, and the new scholar of subaltern studies may find the
old Milton scholar intolerably hegemonic. But they are both still dealing
with IDEAS, whereas the bureaucracy that they are a part of has only a
secondary concern (if that) with IDEAS. What a university bureaucracy
cares about is the organization of those ideas in ways that make financial
"sense" as they see it. Ideas are the commodity that the university sells.
It is the SELLING that is dominant. When something no longer appears to
sell to enough people, it will disappear sooner or later from the academic
marketplace. How many universities no longer have a classics department,
for instance, or teach even a single class in how to read ancient Greek?
And if you think you're sticking around because your own discourse is more
crucial than those, I'm not sure you don't have a big surprise coming.

        In short, I'm not sure I don't find this stuff about "dominant
academic ideas" almost to be a kind of whimsical nostalgia for a world
that never existed in the first place. The only dominant ideas I'm aware
of have very little to do with literature at all.

Jealous of other theory, of the difficulty with theory, I proceed with
fear, with care, delineating/inscribing a territory I can call my own.
This is the only work I do comfortably; my life _elsewhere_ is a matter
of confusion, and anxiety that leaves me sleepless. I am well aware of
the fragility of theory, its past-anterior ex-formation which slots it
back into the death                                 constituted as a

Hi, (sorry about cross-posting, that's part of it)

I'm thinking about writing something extended on 'neologism'

in which respect a few leading questions:

-   anybody have any references they can point me to?

-   what political / social imperatives and ideologies drive 'neologism' today?

-   what would you cite as examples of contemporary 'neologism'?

grateful for anything on this

Stop me if you heard this one before...

Tuesday at Naropa:

Cassandra Terman began the evening by reading from her work and I have to
confess that I was not as drawn to her poetry as much as I've been to that
of others in this series. Her poems worked in the vein of personal
observation of the world - that is to say, they tended to *be about*
something, rather than *being* something in themselves. Given that, they
offered some nuanced attentions to both the natural world and the quotidian
moods of the psyche. "What a blessing to be stripped of the burden of
meaning..." "We travel in a language of syllables and antelopes..."

Kristen Prevallet (who gets my vote for coolest shoes of the Summer Writing
Program) read next from _Perturbation, My Sister_, a re-collaging of a Max
Ernst collage the title of which unfortunately escapes me now. "Magnificent
parrots that will die at the sight of light..." Though I'm unfamiliar with
the original, what impressed me about these poems was the way in which
Prevallet stood Ernst's obviously wild surreal collages on their head to
effect sleights-of-hand that were not only playful and fecund, but full of
sly amusements. Ernst's obessions became Prevallet's comedies (and perhaps
vice-versa as well). "To connect the project of building to the possibility
of touching the sky." "Lead, Glass, Poppy" was her take on the apocalypse as
a media event, recombining images of news stories that ranged from warfare,
archeaology, cult suicide, suburban child murders and the history of
displacement - "Pick this up and explode."

Lisa Jarnot closed the evening and may be fairly said, I think, to have
caused a real stir, at least judging from various comments overheard
afterwards. (Could Naropa be the Cannes of the poetry circuit? O Marcello, O
papparazi, where are you?) Jarnot read from _Some Other Kind of Mission_ and
from newer work. Her poems defy easy excerpting since their procedures are
so concerned with repetition, overlap and a kind of echolalia. The method is
both encyclopedic (seemingly) and precise, which is to say, exclusionary. A
poetry of disjunction, cagey wit, and circular rhythms, in which perception
is a conjoining of disruptions and clarity is conferred through a series of
confusions.  (That's what I scribbled in my notebook anyway...) All of this
delivered in a lowkey, unemphatic, sometimes deadpan pitch that at times
took on the characteristics, the hue (and rue) of a litany of the obtuse and
recalcitrant *things* (read: words) with which we stock our lives. Dazzling.

I am sorting through these various postings about theory and language
poetry and wishing I could respond at greater length and also more
specifically.

Jordan: thank you for your response, I wish I had in front of me. I think
your solution -- to ask one or more poets from a list of excellent ones is
the way to go. Ideally I'd ask all those poets and then ask a bunch of
theorists as well and see where their answers overlap.
        I'm not surprised Jonathan Culler hasn't read Olsen, Creeley, if only
because such study of contemporary  poets must itself be symptomatic of
postmodern tendencies in thought. Is it a response to a "surplus of
signifiers" that we (I, at least) feel compelled to scurry about
investigating the work of contemporary (or very near contemporary) writers?
Has post-industrial capitalism encouraged us to forget the past to such a
degree? Perhaps not: I don't know! Right from the start I was always most
interested in contemporary writers.
        Its interesting to me that people keep bringing up Derrida (Douglas B.
mentions him, and others have in postings earlier this week--is he being
used as a signifier for a larger group of theorists or are people referring
specifically to his work, and if so which essays, which books? (I confess,
I've read relatively little by Derrida, which might be why I am about to
potentially undervalue his influence on Langpo.)
        I would guess that for many of the US poets of the 50's - 70's (Black
Mountain School, New York School, da Beats) much of the critical work got
into the bloodstream through a previous generation (half generation) of
poets (Williams, Pound, who get their theory direct from the novelists and
poets who generated the historical conditions from which Tel Qel (sp?)
sprang) and painters (I'm thinking of the O'hara connection, Motherwell et
al.).
        Then in the 70's - 90's, I'd reckon, but I'm guessing, you start to get a
lot more poets with PhD's and much more directly influenced by literary
theory. Most of the influence was no doubt pretty reactionary, but that
seems to have been a peculiarity of US academics at least since 1913, if
not since the Adams & Jefferson tapes.

Jacques Debrot writes:

"Of course Language writing is as much an argument against (de Man) as it is a
collusion with poststructuralism (say, in the work of Althusser).... Nor
does the prevalence of certain aspects of critical theory on American
campuses necessarily translate into the dominance - or even the acceptance
- of a specific
poststructuralist aestheic practice - either that explored in various ways by
the Language school, or any other."

        Totally true. And perhaps a case can be made for de Man being more
influential--though probably less directly than poststructuralists--on
contemporary poets in general...?
        I have focused on poststructuralism because at the heart of my query is a
desire to see how and where structuralist linguistic theory translates into
poetry--is adopted by the poets themselves.
        Nor does the predominance of some theory necessarily translate into a
certain practice--but does it translate into any practice at all? And whose
practice? And how directly thought-out is it?

The appearance of the acceptance of the marginal (i.e. the threatening) by
the mainstream often falls under the heading of "neutralization by
assimilation" or as James Agee put it "the emasculation of acceptance" but
since Dodie Bellamy rightly pointed out the gender bias of that term, call
it instead "the defanging of acceptance."

Tina Brown has certainly affected a turnaround at The New Yorker, mainly by
pumping up the number of fashion ads and filling its pages with English
writers, but as I understand it, the magazine still operates at an annual
deficit of $10 million. Charles Bernstein addresses some of the economic
dynamics at work in America's various poetry cultures in his essay "How
Poetry Works." (May be where I got that ten mill figure...).  I agree with
Michael Magee about the egregiousness of poetry Alice Quinn publishes,
though I remain a shamelessly devoted reader of the mag. We can't look to
Tina Brown to push the poetic envelope.  I don't see the New Yorker
occupying any position of cultural centrality - those days are closing fast
 - except in its editors minds.  And I don't think "broadness" can be equated
with "influential," David - just the opposite. Only look at the cartoons -
they're rife with "mene, mene, tekel, uparshin" (sic) -  this is urban East
Coast culture, ironically and anxiously aware of its impending dissolution.

To what extent is the influence of the New Yorker "responsible for"
(used advisedly) the "Ashbery is okay" phenomenon, I wonder?

The number of poets whose work appears in the New Yorker is (I think)
pretty small -- and of those whom that magazine publishes, there are a
select handful whose poems tend to appear again & again thru the
years (including several I like a lot -- e.g., Ashbery, Mewin, Simic).

The New Yorker's role / status in broad American culture is, it could
be argued, unique.  For one thing, it has (if I'm not mistaken) far and
away the vastest circulation of ANY "serious literary" publication in
the country (or -- heck -- the world);  & it's a weekly = Ubiquitous.

Acceptance by that mag as one of a few dozen whose poems they'll
oftentimes carry upwards of half a dozen times per year, seems a seal
of approval for a fairly broad & influential hub of the culture.

There are (naturally) *many* other elements in the Ashbery-in-America
phenom -- one being (simply) the long tenure of his contribution.
Heck, even Ginsberg gets flower petals, eventually.  As I understand
it (I wasn't around in those days), for a long time, Ashbery was
severely criticized & ridiculed & deemed something of a laughingstock
(rather as John Cage was -- or for that matter, Phillip Glass till
at least the mid-'80s) in highbrow circles.  Eventually, the court
jester gets a cabinet post, natch: the stone that's rejected (but
establishes a strong name), becomes the corner stone.  If you're part
of the dialogue, doesn't matter too much if the press is good or bad.

As said, just a thought (or thought & a half).

best,
d.i.

I mean, he's not turned out to be, from work to work, one of my favorite
composers, but there are some works by him I like, and I do think he merits
respect -- does he really not get it?

Dear Dr. Nielsen:

I think Whitehead is British, not American, but if he's not, I vote for
him. Unless it was Dewey. Henry would know.

I certainly applaud the notion of "perceptual objects" (and thereby the
external world) only "[becoming] theoretical when the practical act was
inhibited."

It's the tendency of certain aspects of "Cultural Studies" to deny the
existence of an external world in toto that troubles my sleep.

Now, who said this?

"We all talk about poetry so abstractly because we all tend to be
indifferent poets. At bottom the esthetic phenomenon is quite simple: all
one needs in order to be a poet is the ability to have a lively action
going on before one continually, to live surrounded by hosts of spirits."

Also a philosopher, not American. Prizes in the eye of the beholder.

What is the antecedent of the pronoun "its" in this sentence?

Are you saying that the "already strong association" is, in fact, valid?

The question are tangle. What is at stake in pursuing the
"language"/"theory" rapport? Is this a historical probing? Have we moved
so far after the fact of the moment that we can now begin tracing
influences, genealogies, royalties? I don't know (everything always feels
like its just beginning when you're late, until you realize the
reconnaisance (spp) your doing is really only archive work --then you fix
a cold juice drink). Is it important to set in stone, ink, eggwhite, the
exact dates, matches and teams? Was Sartre responsible for Action
Painting? Did Wittgenstein cause Joseph Kosuth? James, Stein? Maybe I'm
muddling it here, but the notion that language writing is indebted to or
engendered by French philosophy feels restrictive, -ted, -ting. Everybody
is around
         by the same tray of books. Everybody

is on the clock. Why are similarities, preoccupations (and not to diminish
the intent of the authors involved, WHAT ABOUT ZEITGEIST, oh) triggers,
paper tigers, and not                       time shares (I admit, I'm apt
to reduce distintions to friviolity, perks, where is raul ruiz?? we're on
to re-runs.)
 Theory is important.
  Poetry is more important (to me).
Sometimes they meet and hold hands
for a movie.

What kinds of questions are asking? ANd for what reasons?

jittery,

Bennett.

The Newyorker has never been urban eastcoast culture. Founded by a guy who
was insecure about being from Kansas, it's always been centered in the
fantasy culture of similar immigrants from points west with deprived
childhoods. For many years its standards of selection have been whatever
fits neatly between ads for stores on Madison Avenue without distracting
attention too much from those ads.
New York has always been about clamorous ethnic cultures. When the fleet of
the future James II appropriated it from the Dutch there were already 18
languages in daily use. This reality rarely gets the attention of the
Newyorker, except, perhaps, in snotty little pieces in The Talk of the Town;
it certainly has little influence on the rag's own cultural attitudes.
Ashberry's acceptance I think stems from two things: his Hamptons style,
subject-matter and diffidence and his currency in the higher-priced
precincts of the art world. Another way of saying he walks the walk and goes
to the right parties. None of which takes away one iota from his often
splendid poetry.

Presently, I'm doing my PHD on contemporary poetry here in Brazil and
focusing on the works of laura riding, lorine niedecker, and mina loy. I
would like to know how can I get information about these poets. Is there any
discussion groups on these names? Essays, commentaries, any help will be
welcome. I also would like to know how can I participate in the poetics

        There's a new anthology of brazilian poetry that was recently

Thank you very much for the help

Music survives because musicians enjoy playing it, find it challenging, and
pass it on to their students in the conservatories. We have Bach's music
because Brahms and his friends, against popular opposition, played it, and
it never stopped being taught. Glass has made no inroads into the
conservatories and virtually no one plays his music except his own ensemble.
I have it in confidence from members of same who must remain nameless that
they only play it because it's a gig.
Non-minimalist composers (I hung out with a lot of composers in NY) speak of
Riley and Reich with respect; I've never heard the same in regard to Glass.
Most consider him a pious fraud. Admittedly this is anecdotal.
Myself, I always assume that there's value out there until I'm flattened
with boredom--maybe I have to learn an idiom before I can hear its virtues.
So I sat through, in person and on disk, Einstein, Satyagraha, The
Photographer, and Koyanasquatchi (only partially intentional misspelling)
before I decided to stop punishing myself. It was harmonically and
rhythmically uninteresting, consistently mannered, formulaic and predictable.
On this last (I'll refrain from another attempt at creative spelling) an
interesting story. My kid saw the film when he was about twenty, loved it,
loved the music. So he got the album. He was genuinely mystified that when
he listened without the visuals none of what he had thought was there was.
He realized that it was background music. Try the experiment with any of the
above-named efforts.
Also interesting--when the music is performed in concert (non-dramatic
settings) one recognizes few members of the audience from concerts of
non-minimalist non-top 40 western music. I would guess that few would have
any idea who Elliot Carter is.
The world is full of wallpaper music, even among "classics"--lots of 19th
century ballet music, for instance, that survives only because dancers and
audiences like the choreography. Myself, I like wallpaper music at noisy
parties or in elevators. If I plunk down the cost of concert-hall tickets
and what I get is likeable noise I feel like I've been had.
I don't like "likeable" poetry, either. If there's no challenge, nothing new
to be learned, I don't go back for more.
Is it clear that I don't like his music?

When he was feted by the Academy of American Poets and such
like organizations he became mainstream. The writing itself lags
behind and is certainly not mainstream per se. But Ashberyesque
has certainly been adopted by enuf younger writers, adapted to
their own purposes, to have become part of the flow rather than an
obscure eddy. And when a poet publishes with a certain press,
with a certain initial print run, he/she becomes mainstream like it
or not. Success causes the cache of avant-garde to fade very quickly.
If everybody's reading him/her, how can he she expect to hold much
interest for the serious few.

Guess I have to post one more message about my list of schools, and
acadominance.  All I'll say about the latter is that I never did not
claim that my impression of language poetry's acadominance was more than
an impression.  It now looks to me like whether the impression's valid
or not will have to await the judgement of posterity.  I suspect no one
knows enough now to say for sure.  And there are so many angles of view
on the question.  Lang po certainly has SOME kind of cultural status
that APR poetry doesn't have--sorta like art films versus Hollywood
fare.

Oh, and I want to thank Mark Presjnar for his good friendly letter about
his possible harshness about my take on acadominance.  As I back-
channeled him, it's impossible to avoid occasionally saying things
not-quite-exactly-as-intended, or worse (and, yow, have we seen examples
of that on this list!)  I, for instance, am now annoyed with MYSELF for
denigrating APR poetry in my effort to defend myself from the charge of
denigrating language poetry.  This when I asked, "Who takes APR poetry
seriously?"  Well, actually, *I* do--that is, I take the best poetry of
that sort seriously as poetry--since it's as good as ANY poetry.  I do
look down on APR, the magazine, though, not for the poetry it publishes
so much as for the poetry it ignores.

As for my list of poetry schools, David Israel made some interesting
points about it.  He's about convinced me that linking individual poets
to particular schools is too tricky to be practical (though I made a
point of stating that many poets belong to two or more schools).  About
Ashbery, here's another of my very unsupported impressions (because I
don't know either poet's work that well): Ashbery and Graham are
modernists in the jump-cut poetry school founded mainly by Pound and
Eliot, particularly with Eliot's "Wasteland."  They are thus very
mainstream.  Or maybe they've pushed jump-cut poetry sufficiently to
merit being called "neo-jump-cut" poets.  Or "hyper-jump-cut."  I would
include in their school many poets called language poets who collage
texts, which is a way of jump-cutting as opposed to doing what language
poetry does (in my view--see below).  Although the textual collagists
seem much more craft-extending than Ashbery--and, certianly, than
Graham.

Anyhow, I think David put his finger on many of the difficulties of
trying to work up an effective list of poetry schools.  In naming
schools, my criteria were scattered and unsystematic--because the list
is a typology, not a taxonomy--and more to generate discussion than to
attain definitiveness of any sort.  A school on my list might be based
on status and other extra-literary qualities but in my formal taxonomy I
try to be objective (which I'm still backward enough to believe
possible) and work out my kinds of poetries based on what they
concretely are and/or do as words on paper (or in speech).  Language
poetry, by my definition, then is simply poetry that significantly
breaks conventional grammatical norms--to significant expressive effect.
I couldn't care less how Marxist, for example, a given lang poet is or
not provided he messes around with grammar.  And considerations of
what's mainstream or not are outside my taxonomy, as well as what's
good/bad.

So, maybe in a month--if I have the courage--instead of posting an
updated version of my schools of poetry, I'll try my taxonomy on the
group.  I'll bet you can't wait.

As I understand it, he hasn't published his scores for performance
(except a very few) so that if people want to hear his material live
(as, is obvious from his touring grosses, many do), they have to
bring in his ensemble to do it. A smart financial move.

That's their problem.

The ones with whom I hung out in New York (granted this was a decade
age) were, indeed, quite bitter at Glass. It usually boiled down to
his having figured out how to make a living at it.

I have heard the convincing theory that one finds most interesting
the music whose changes that person can predict, at the level at
which the person chooses to listen, about half the time. If you're
listening to Glass expecting it to move harmonically and rhythmically
as much other music does, you will be disappointed. Much of Glass's
early work moves most interestingly on the note-to-note level and
at the level of changes of rhythmic pattern.

If trying to sing along with the quick vocal patterns in "Einstein on
the Beach" doesn't cure one of finding it rhythmically uninteresting,
I would be surprised to hear that person claim to find rhythmic
interest in anything.

I honestly don't know what you mean by this. To the extent that I do,
it does not correlate at all with my own experience.

Yup. And there's little crossover between fans of Metallica and Roberta
Flack. You point is...?

Some of us don't demand that every experience slap us upside the
head. I've done music that confused and bored everyone, poetry
that inspired audiences to run away in tears, and theatre that
terrified the viewers. Been there, done that. I now like having
audiences who find what I do pleasant.

Your attitude is that of someone who would send a restaurant
dinner back because nothing tasted odd.

Gee, I woulda never guessed!

I don't usually post my poems to the list, but this one seemed apposite
to the Ashbery / New Yorker discussion. Attribution: it first appeared
in print late last year in the Times Literary Supplement (UK).

John Tranter :  The Green Buick

          'You remained for me a green Buick of sighs, o Gladstone!'
                                                              - Frank
O'Hara, 'Second Avenue'

I'm off, he said. He shrugged on a soft dark
overcoat, and wrapped a check scarf around his neck.
He stuffed his sighs into the Buick
ignoring the way the late afternoon cloud-light
glittered along the strips of chrome and gold trim.
A few spots of rain glistened on the metallic
lemon-green paint shine but somehow not on the
actual paint. "What is it with the New Yorker," he said,
as he heaved his old suitcase into the back seat -
he had the white canvas top down,
the car was full of junk - "that the writing
has to agree with the faux-naïf cover art,
as well as the advertisements for English raincoats
and cruises to the Bahamas? You'd think
one humiliation would be enough! Look at it,"
he said. He looked around for the last time.
We're talking New York circa 1960,
the Apple just beginning to go
bad at the core. "As for the San Fran-fucking-
Cisco Renaissance," he grunted,
"the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit - "
he thumped the flank of the car with his hand,
and it was like jolting a slide projector:
in his brain a magazine clunked to the right, then
slithered left, and dropped a fresh splash of colour
in the slot - he could see the Buick already swaying
over the wooden planks above the swollen river
and then down the track to his childhood home -
"ah, the blue gloom under the trees," he said,
"the neon burning outside the motel
in a halo of rain sparks - ecstasy!"

This brings to mind the truncated Derrida quotation toward the beginning of

Great story--Which I think could be told many times over about lots of
people like Culler, who I encountered a bit when I was working in the
Cornell libraries in the early '80s....He is indeed a perfect (but highly
representative) example of this ghettoization.  Pick up most publications
that reflect what the Academy thinks is going on in literchur, and you
really won't find any awareness of contemporary poetry..(..some awareness
of rather bland workshop verse, of course, but none of *contemporary*
poetry in Stein's sense..)

While we're distinguishing -- Ashbery's style isn't Hamptons, it's upstate
New York -- 'deep suburban' as Bill Berkson put it. Tho Ashbery has done
his time on Long Island, he (I hear) prefers Hudson.

One guy responsible for the New Yorker's literary stuff in the recent
past, Chip McGrath, is now at the New York Times Book Review, which come
to think of it, is a pretty ghoulish read as well --

I think you're right about the New Yorker, altho' to some extent it's
integrated with other institutions (anthologies, etc.) in determining What
Is Acceptable..It is certainly a major cultural presence; I remember a
co-worker many years ago; before working with me in a Michigan library she
had been a proof-reader at Encyclopedia Britannica in Chicgo.  She
recounted how her supervisor there worked passionately on poems....And
never sent them anywhere except the New Yorker.  His only goal in his life
as a poet was to be published in the New Yorker!  That suggests that this
is a publication with an interesting and resonant role in our culture!

I'm sure you must be right about there being *some* dismissal and ridicule
for Ashbery early on...How much I wonder?  Still, I don't think the elder
statesman, if-you-hang-around-long-enough factor is that strong in his
case...Larry Eigner hasn't gotten that kind of broad endorsement and
anthologization; Coolidge, Palmer and S. Howe all began publishing in the
last few years of the '60s, right?  That's 27 years at a minimum, and the
mainstream isn't throwing too many roses...

Aldon--
Excellent post, and I agree with everything therein...

I hope I made it clear in my previous posts that my main objection to
"acado-dominant" is that it's *inaccurate* and not that it's pejorative.
(Tho' it still has that ring to me, and that seems more significant to me
I guess than to you..)

I think your comments about academic pecking-orders, are right on, and I'm
glad to have 'em posted by a real live academic!  Put together with
Douglas Barbour's story about Jonathan Culler, I believe they make a very
telling point about how things really are in most of the university
scene..Truly contemporary poetry isn't usually given the time of day..

Plenty of people have been influenced by Ashbery, but except for Ann
Lauterbach (and more power to her, and I think she's a little
under-appreciated by the way) very few are swimming  or sinking or doing
anything else in the murky mainstream.

I can't agree enough with Mark Wallace here. To speak from my
experience, as it were, UVa (both open and closed to both "theory" and
"experimental poetry" --mainly closed, actually) allows a certain amount
of showroom exposure to a wide variety of idea-baubles, but even the
university's best efforts to ingratiate its students and faculty with a
range of "discursive possibilities" winds up feeling like a buffet-table
at the MLA. I know this sounds snide, possibly too reactive, but the
extreme pluralism (or mask thereof) necessitated by state funding and
stodgy boards of visitors is almost enough, enough almost to push me into
a soft-collar career in data analysis. THe shouts of "dominant" this and
"entrenched" that make for loopy cocktail games, but are they more than
diversions? It all passes soon, it's a matter of juggling, navigation,
profit margins, blind-buying, commerce servers --The musak and prosac of
customer relations. Know your markets. Locution, locution, locution. This
is not to say that some ideas aren't "better" than others, or more useful,
or more accepted, or more suffered (I am not so tipsy yet Jordan), but,
you know,                    When
                                Rorty

Pat, I think you're confusing me with somebody else.  I can't remember ever
talking about "emasculation" or James Agee--even in private conversation.

Another who might be esteemed in the Ashbery stream is John Yau, who's
doing okay lit-world-wise, I think.  I second Mark's hat-tip to Ann
Lauterbach, & agree she seems of post-Ashberian ilk.

Also: (re: nomenclature & generalization):  Much mention has been
made of so-called "APR style" or the "APR school."  Said journal
does, incidentally, publish the likes of Ann Lauterbach, John Yau,
Leslie Scalapino, Robert Creeley, Michael Palmer (I think?), Carol
Maso (if memory serves), Armand Schwerner, and a good number of
others whose writing likely isn't exactly of the sort intended by the
perhaps (all-too-)handy perjorative.  There may be some bias in
evidence, but if I'm not mistaken, the journal is a bit more catholic
in its inclusions than recent references might lead one to suppose.

the idea that Ashbery's influence is everywhere is one I come across a
lot, and am befuddled by, as well. You have to extend the idea of Ashbery
out far enough to include J Graham, J Tate, and who else? to give it any
credence. The language of influence is crowded with hard hard c's. If
Ashbery really has that much influence, why aren't things (why
isn't the influenced poetry) _better_?

I think some people see Ashbery's influence in any poem that "doesn't make
sense."  But I agree that when you get down to specifics -- in whose work
is the direct influence of Ashbery's strategems (indicated I suppose by
things like receding antecedents, shifting subject matter, falsely amicable
diction, or non-referential syntax) directly and consciously assimilated --
you probably wouldn't come up with a very long list of names.  Maybe John
Yau?  Maybe Dean Young or Donald Revell? More than one poet has told me
that when they look to their bookshelves for poetry that will drive/inspire
them to hit the keyboard or legal pad, Ashbery's are the last ones they'd
select, regardless of how much they might otherwise like and appreciate his
work.

We may choose to disagree without assuming that the other is incapable of
understanding.  I go to music with open ears. For the record, I don't assume
that people who like Glass' music are shallow or stupid. I do wonder how
well-informed they are. For instance, Glass' rhythms are not particularly
difficult or complex and it's hard to imagine how anyone could think so who
knew 20th century music.
It's possible that my composer-friends are consumed by bitterness. Maybe I
just haven't noticed.
Yup, I like art that surprises and challenges me--I prefer Pollock to his
teacher Benton (but check out the latter's surprising early abstractions),
Rothenberg (Susan) to Alex Katz (but check out the small early collages),
Zukofsky to Edgar Lee Masters. Maybe that's like preferring rotten food. I
apply to music the same criteria I apply to the other arts--it's what comes
naturally to me.
But I tire of talking about myself. I expected the brickbats. Let it be
known that one member of the list is not a Glass fan, and let it rest at that.

Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN

... was the last night of the Summer Writing Program's reading series, held
in true showbiz tradition within the "friendly confines" of the Fox Theater
on University Hill.

Unfortunately, I arrived late (didn't check my ticket for the starting time)
and so missed both Bobbie Louise Hawkins and Anselm Hollo reading from their
work and entered in the midst of a fierce oratorical performance by Michelle
Clinton, whom I'd last heard at the now defunct Chatterton's on Vermont in
LA.  The vivid sense of anger and the flamboyant embattled rhetoric against
persecution and violence to women were still there, but I felt a certain
tendentiousness at work also, and a failure to engage language to its
fullest extent - a decision, clearly, on Clinton's part, to eschew the
stilletto for an instrument with heavier impact. It led to me to think of
several things, among them, Camus' line "To be classic is to repeat oneself.
 And to know how to repeat oneself." Was Clinton doing the latter? Also, how
is her poetry more political (or less) than say, Bernstein's "The Kiwi Bird
in the Kiwi Tree?" I'm not sure - but I found myself agonizing over the
problematized interface between protest and poetry. This turned out to be
something of a leitmotif for the evening.

Next, Anne Waldman and Andrew Schelling performed a spirited and engaging
duet, accompanied by Mark Miller on flute and Steven Taylor on one of Allen
Ginsberg's harmoniums, of some poem-tales from their translations from the
Pali Canon, _Songs of the Sons and Daughters of the Buddha_.  Rendered in a
fresh, contemporary idiom, these pieces were nevertheless curious, to say
the least, as they mainly concerned themselves with exhortations against the
wiles of the flesh and grim repudiations of the body. A strange grafting of
newer Buddhistic teaching with obviously older material that derived from a
tradition of moralizing folktales.

Steven Taylor took the stage and sang in dulcet voice a stunning setting of
Blake's "London."

Stan Brakhage -  looking something like a Mennonite - fairly hopped onto the
stage in a delightful display of joie de vivre following this, and gave a
wonderful homage to the 20th Century American epic poem - Williams, Pound,
Zukofsky, Stein, Dorn and HD - how their works provided an essential fuel
for his own work, all by way of introducing Ronald Johnson.

In a hoarse voice, Johnson read from _Ark_: Spire for LZ, describing how he
had already written it when he heard the news of Zukofsky's death and how
that then changed the poem, made it more serious. He also read one of the
Ramparts, and closed with Arches for Stan Brakhage.  To say more than this
would be gilding the lily, I'm afraid. Suffice it to say, it was great to
see and hear one of the greatest poets in the land. Johnson closed real
trouper-style, saying his book was on sale in the lobby (I hope he sold them
all!) then raised his bottle of Bud in salute.

Diane di Prima read next. First, "Gestapo Poem." Then two elegies for
Ginsberg - funny and moving - "no more unlooked for and unused poetry
advice." She closed with a long reading of section from her work in progress
_Lola_.  It was difficult to get from these snippets a clear sense of this
book-length poem, whose main concerns were with the epic scale of prehistory
and the mythic evocation of the feminine.

Ed Sanders closed the evening, his reading prefaced by some fidgeting with
gizmos. He read the closing portion of *his* book-length poem _1968_. This
narrative work was long on prose-like exposition and short on the lyrical,
but fascinating as an anecdotal document (The Fugs on tour in Chicago, Ed
calling Daley a motherfucker to a pissed off crowd who expected to see
Wilson Pickett instead, the suicide of DA Levy, manning the trenches in
Chicago with Ginsberg) The work carries - and tries to expunge - a deep
anger from that time over government betrayal, government-issued death. As
with Clinton's work, but in a different way of course, I felt a sharp
disparity between the effort to engage political awareness and the cost this
affected on the poem's engagement with language. Not good or bad - but
differing greatly from my own concerns. Ed then led us in a corny, good

Pat, I think you're confusing me with somebody else.  I can't remember ever
talking about "emasculation" or James Agee--even in private conversation.

Mark, I like what you say here. Though I venture to add that it's only
someone from Kansas longing to escape his Kansas-ness who could be more New
Yorker than thou. The New York of the New Yorker is a metropolitan cultural
wish-fulfillment, much in the same way that the Hollywood created by Jewish
immigrants was more American than America (see Neal Gabler's fine book _An
Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood_).

The Newyorker has never been urban eastcoast culture. Founded by a guy who
was insecure about being from Kansas, it's always been centered in the
fantasy culture of similar immigrants from points west with deprived
childhoods. For many years its standards of selection have been whatever
fits neatly between ads for stores on Madison Avenue without distracting
attention too much from those ads.
New York has always been about clamorous ethnic cultures. When the fleet of
the future James II appropriated it from the Dutch there were already 18
languages in daily use. This reality rarely gets the attention of the
Newyorker, except, perhaps, in snotty little pieces in The Talk of the Town;
it certainly has little influence on the rag's own cultural attitudes.
Ashberry's acceptance I think stems from two things: his Hamptons style,
subject-matter and diffidence and his currency in the higher-priced
precincts of the art world. Another way of saying he walks the walk and goes
to the right parties. None of which takes away one iota from his often
splendid poetry.

Absolutely. For native New Yorkers like me (as opposed to a lot of other
native New Yorkers, I guess), and perhaps especially for those of us living
in exile, the fantasy New York has always been an issue--a lot of folks come
in with little or no committment to the lived place of the vast majority.
Even O'Hara, whose work I love, gets to me this way (few of the New York
School poets were in fact New Yorkers).

Well--yes, this has always been an interesting issue.  Years ago I was
puzzled as to why the classic founder/polemicists of LangPo and other
counterstream tendencies made APR their whipping-entity, and not say the
venerable Poetry.  One reason is that Poetry seems to've been in decline
in influence since I was a wee lad in the 1960s, and another is the
specific history of APR, which was founded in a way that linked it
historically to the MFA-granting poetry workshop/writing program movement.
It specifically marketed itself to the writing-workshop milieu, and so
many feel that it has helped to perpetuate the blandest free-verse
stylings, which often come out of that milieu.  I'd readily agree about
the counterstream poets they've published over the years.  I haven't
bothered to pick it up for about three years, but before that saw it
pretty regularly for eons--and your list of interesting poets could be
extended;  I remember fine if small bits of Barbara Guest and Susan Howe.
But many folks just feel that the counterstream appearances are pretty
infrequent and minor compared to the overwhelming volume of mediocre
dreck.

The other point, which I've never seen mentioned, but which I suspect is
important, is that APR is just *so* visible and widely available, and so
much *intends* to be a popular/populist tabloid presence, that it's bound
to be a primarily target, if you have criticisms of the poetry
establishment.  Its very character makes it a potent influence, capable of
perpetuating dominant (ahem) trends; and I believe it *has* functioned to
perpetuate dominant trends, most of 'em pretty bad...But yes for most of
us it isn't an black-and-white issue.  I've always publicly praised them
for what openings and support they've given otherstreams...

Hi, (apologies again for cross-posting)

i've had a couple of requests to cite examples of what i'm getting at under

-  or the language of 'marks' and versions of 'marks' intended to be
sounded in Bob Cobbing and Lawrence Upton's 'Domestic Ambient Noise' series
(which there's no possibility of including a quotation from here  -
hmmmm).

I'm also thinking of instances of nation - language and dialect spellings
as also 'new' turns of phrase or words taking on 'new' functions.

Yes, we know about transrational 'traditions' and the romance of 'coining'
a word or a term. Many neologisms develop out of social interaction  -  I'm
thinking of how inflection turned 'bad' or 'wicked' into 'good' and so on.

Such instances pepper our poetries in these times. Why? What drives them?
What are the political and cultural imperatives at work?

Your posting is thoughtful and provacative...

Clearly you're right to ask, what are the cultural and political
imperatives at work (in neologic word/sound creation)?  I think there are
probably almost as many answers as there are examples which cd. extend
your list.  And most of 'em (the examples and the answers) interesting and
important...

As a strongly sound-oriented poet myself, for whom meaning and weight
arise out of musical verbalization, I believe that (usually coexistent in
any given instance with more focused motives) there is the following
rather basic imperative:

In our moment a shaking up or loosening up of language-use is a good (or
rather, an urgently needed) thing. We're confronted with a literary world
most of which still has problems reading a little Gertrude Stein.  And
they've had long enough to assimilate her!  Shaking up the very identity
of words shocks the language. It wounds complacency and linguistic
transparency.  It (among other things) suggests to a reader: you can do
these things to language!  Neither the police nor god strike you dead if
you do 'em!  Language is an ocean with an almost endless number of
directions in which you can swim (till voices wake you, and....)

New York is anybody's who wants to fight for it. Wanna fight? That the New
York School came from Boston, Cincinnati, Tulsa, Rochester (NY),
Providence, Chicago, Passaic, Bolinas, Needles, Lynn, says _this_ -- New
York is (was) a place where people felt comfortable enough to pursue
anonymity with all their might. Some of the early ones fleeing fame were
too slow to get away from it -- O'Hara (the stars of track and field are
beautiful people) became a legend even -- but now the New York school moves
quickly enough to ensure that no one will ever hear of it again.

I think I agree with the several people who have said that 'acadominant' is
an inappropriate term for Langpo, given that other 'schools' have more
academic capital and will continue to for some time.  (Do you have any idea
how -strange- it was when Jed Rasula showed up to teach in my senior year?)
I think a better case might be made for 'acadominated,' if you buy the line
that the practice 'fits' well with the kinds of theory that have come to
prominence in humanities departments in the last two decades.  I myself
-don't- buy this line, as it supposes that the antecedents for Langpo are
mostly European theorists rather than a line of (largely) American
poet/critics (i.e. Stein, Coolidge, Creeley).
But maybe 'acadominated,' though equally contestable, is closer to what
Grunman was getting at in the first place.

I was gonna guess Dewey on that quote too, but '45 seems a little late...
'No objects' seems an overly easy line to take--saying there aren't any
still requires (at least for a philosopher) an account of why we all seem to
see them.

It might be interesting to know when JA's first -New Yorker- publications were;
before "Self-Portrait In a Convex Mirror" and the forthcoming awards, or after?
As for walking the walk, going to the right parties, and having currency in
the non-lit artworld, it might be argued that Ashbery's been in it for the
long haul and probably had a quiet hand (quieter than O'Hara's) in -making-
that the walk, and those the right parties.  Lastly, Kenneth Koch
hypothesized somewhere (APR?) recently that Ashbery 'got away with' a lot of
things because of his tone (and elevated syntax), which fools people on
first reading into thinking they're reading something a lot more traditional
than it is.  Koch was specifically talking about humor, but the same might
be said about several aspects of Ashbery's work (shifting pronouns and
difficulty of establishing a referent, for example).

And the worst thing about the initials DB are how phallic they look in
lowercase.

due to repeated attempts to eliminate sign language among deaf people in
Ireland, to take only one country, the language is in a huge state of flux.
Dialects can be grouped in terms of age: youth, middle-aged, elderly people
may use different ones.  There are men's signs, women's signs, Catholic
signs, Protestant signs.  In many cases there is no consensus as to the
"correct" sign for say some new gadget or trend.  One response to this is a
form of neologism in which a sign is introduced at the start of a section of
articulation and its denotation is fingerspelled.  After this introduction
the sign is used without the spelling support.  The life of such neologisms
may be only as long as the interaction.

        As a chief question-asker I have to say the more I've considered it these
last few days the more I find myself sharing your feeling of suspicion. I
guess the way I would phrase my initial question, to make it less
suspcious, would be: "There seems to be a general assumption (is there such
an assumption?) that many of those poets "accused" of language poetry have
been strongly influenced, compared to their non-langpo brethren, by
linguistic, social, political --philosophy. There appear many
correspondences, to use THAT word. To what degree can this be said to be
true?"
        One of the consequences of some of the theoretical work in question is an
understanding that perhaps both the poets and the theorists should be
viewed primarily as responding to the same social circumstances--rather
than directly to each other. Well, I agree with this. BUT I'm looking for
names because I've often heard assumed this affinity, poets and theories,
but have very rarely seen--I say rarely, by no means never--a poet
acknowledge specific insight into any of these theories, let alone describe
how her poetry was in response to theoretical work. Knowing this would help
suggest possible avenues of study, if only because at the least it would be
reassuring to know that so-&-so hand't read such-&-such and so the apparent
association must come with reactions to cultural climes.        At best would be
an instance where a poet or theorist could report how she CHANGED this or
that work by interpreting it.
        As for studying the present, that is difficult.

I imagine these imperatives are as multiple as the people doing such work.
When such creep or storm into my own work, they are sometimes in part the
attempt to say the unsayable. They are sometimes a protest against
normative language restrictions, they are sometimes a barbarian yawp, they
are sometimes based on existing words, either breaking down into component
sounds/parts, or in process of forming such sounds/parts, on their way to
becoming whole and recognizable words. Sometimes they are simply there for
the physical joy of throat and lips and tongue and cheeks and mind of
pronouncing the unfamiliar -- related to the pleasure I get in reading Old
English aloud. Sometimes the intention is much more specific and musical --
precise consonants and vowels to move the music. And in most instances the
motivations are quite mixed.

why is this the worst?

I can vouch for the truth that lower-case "d" and "b" are often confused by
hand typesetters. They are close to each other in the conventional type
drawer (called "California job case"), and they are reversed from right to
left. I was told, when I first learned letterpress printing, that the
phrase "Mind your p's and q's" came from typesetters, and that it was
originally "Mind your p's and q's and b's and d's."

But the b's and d's of this list obviously aren't minding anyone. Well,
nevermind.

When I was missing New York a friend said to me, Why be nostalgic when you

what's called a life in books? One hears of such things like back roads,
but is that in turn what's called a city?

All of these have been discussed on this list at one time or another during
the past couple of years, although perhaps not at great length. Still, I
should think that if you post thoughts or questions or issues concerning
them here, you will definitely get responses.

http://www2.cruzio.com/~williamr/   is a site which gives information
about, including the complete introduction from, Carolyn Burke's bio of Loy.

http://shc.stanford.edu/sed/Mina.Loy.html  is a kind of Mina Loy home page,
but it's not exactly full of critical information.

There are some other bits on Loy on the web, too. I haven't searched the
web for Niedecker and Riding.

Thanks, Pat Pritchett, for yet another reading-report from the Buddhist Big
Top. When I read these reports, I feel as though I _am_ you. I am sure my
response to these various readers would be almost identical--if only that
they _have_ been, in former years of reading-going. I am puzzled about one
thing, tho, & that is Ed Sanders' gizmos that he fiddled with before
reading. Are these Whi.He.My.Ma Gizmos, or Tibetan Buddhist Gizmos, or
Gizmos fetched from Woodstock? More on the Gizmos, please.  David

Ever since I read that, during Clinton's visit to Tony Blair, the pair
agreed that class war was an out-of-date concern for today's voters, I have
wanted only to wage it. Even though I can create the maker of a poem out of
my own head (& gizmos) simply by reading his/her poem, perversely I would
like to see a lot more analysis or leastwise good gossip on the class (not
the 'class') of our poets, starting with, since he's been so much in our
news lately, the highly 'classy' John Ashbery. Did he, for isntance, attend
a one-gender boarding school? Did he go there on a scholarship? Did he play
rugger, or soccer, while there? Stuff like that. (I havent yet read  a l l
the posts with his name in the header; if this has begun to be covered
already, so much the better.)

I agree with someone who remarked that the poetry in the New Yorker has
gotten "better" of late. I just wonder, given the world those ads speak
of/to, how far this improvement can possibly go?

It almost goes without saying that the origins of Language writing are
over-determined:  Stein, Zukofsky, theory, minimalist/conceptual art, the
Peace movement, etc, etc.  But now that Language writing's phase as an active
literary movement has passed (as Mark Wallace, Mark Du Charme and others have
recently pointed out in various magazines), the more interesting question
seems to me, what next?  Or rather, in what context (and for what purposes)
are experimentalist poets now using the disjunctive and non-self-expressivist
techniques innovated by Language writing?  These are forms I myself prefer,
but given that no technique is inherently radical, what motivates their use
today?

chris,
    you might want to conside thhe range poems where i think it appears
in a pure form for me.  there is no intent here (i hope) to do much more
than play - which seems simple but has tremendous philosophical and
psychological import.

'neologism' seems like only a small part of the larger ?neolanguagism?
trend

lp yes but lp made the mistake of trying to make 'play' important -
pr, reputation, being known, etc. and then leading to a 'better order'.
This list might be the wrong place to say this?  I find the same
tendencies and probelms sometimes I when respond to a range (trying to
be self-important) at it is always disasterous to what comes out.

Here's a strange autobiographical fact about Mr Ashbery.

As a teenager he made a lot of money and became quite famous as a "quiz
kid" on radio, answering questions about art history. Apparently he
made a lot of money, got to travel back and forth across the US in a
luxury Pullman, famous gallery directors and art connoisseurs would tip
their hats to him in hotel lobbies (well, I'm embroidering a little
..) and so forth.

How about that?

Hey, this aint a war, or even a serious disagreement. I think what I said
was that "the upper middle class arrivistes from other parts of the US via
elite schools," as you call them, often don't seriously engage with the city
as understood by the rest of the population--it remains an escape and a
playground, and all those ethnics a form of exotic stage-dressing. I think
this is often true of O'Hara, whose work, let me repeat, I love. But it, and
the work of other voluntary internal migrants, often has the feel of
expatriate literature--breathlessly excited, but not fully grounded in
place. This can be a virtue, but something is also lost.
It's not, of course, always the case. I think it matters with what social
class the newcomer identifies. Literally graphic examples--two superb
etchers, both New Yorkers by adoption, one , John Sloan, depicts the life of
early 20th century New York workers and lower middle class with profound
sympathy, zero condescension, and apparently total identification, the
other, Martin Lewis, focuses on flappers. Sloan's line is as unkempt as his
subjects, who visibly have to deal with such things as New York's stifling
summers in the days before air conditioning. Lewis' golden girls float above
all that, and the elegance of his line mirrors the immunity to everyday
burdens of his subjects. His few explorations of Sloan's New York are
unconvincing.
"But who makes the art?  Who consumes the art?  Who cares about the art?"
Well, me, for one, and a lot of other natives, and a lot of denizens of
ethnic neighborhoods. I can supply a list if you need it.
Melville, by the way, spent his childhood, until his father's death, in New
York city, if I'm not mistaken. But early 19th century migrations in and out
of New York were considerably less formative, or liberating, for writers
than they became at the end of the century, after New York had grown
several-fold and become a world-city, thus radically differentiating itself
from a lot of other American locales.

You're absolutely correct with regards APR's focus on the writing workshop
as a central location. In an important fashion, APR is a creation of the
literary engines of the 1960s, which of course was the context in which
Langpo (or, as Al would have it, Lanpo, which I rather like) first grew up.
Poetry, the mag, is a phenomenon from an entirely different era. I don't
know what the current numbers are, but throughout much of the 1970s and
'80s, APR had a distribution in the 25,000 range in comparison with
Poetry's 12,000. Actually, Poetry's circulation climbed substantially once
Henry Rago died and they stopped publishing the likes of Olson, Zukofsky,
Duncan and Ronald Johnson. The journal has never been "stronger," but it's
still an expression of an earlier era.

(Spicer's poems "For Poetry" in Book of Magazine Verse are aimed at Rago's
liberalism, not the neovictorian aesthetic that came later. Spicer seems to
have dismissed aesthetic/cultural reactionaries out of hand, saving his
wrath for those who attempted to build bridges. Viz the poem to Ginsberg.)

The token inclusion of a Charles Bernstein or Ann Lauterbach in APR has
always seemed to me exactly that--a mechanism by which a highly partisan
publication can then pretend to be "representative."  Another major
irritant in APR, during its early years at least, was its appropriation of
that name, AMERICAN Poetry Review, rather than say, Open Poetry (or
whatever). In the aftermath of Vietnam, people where hypersensitive to the
implications of naming (Vietnamization, after all, had involved genocide of
Vietnamese people). To use the national adjective both manipulatively and
uncritically in the way that APR does is an index of thinking that is as
sloppy as it is cynical.

[When I first got here to Philadelphia, I interviewed a young woman for a
job at my company who had previously worked as a "screener" for APR. She
had not read contemporary poetry of any sort before she obtained the work
study position, nor did she intend to once she left it. ]

Interestingly, neither Berg nor Vogelsang have used APR as a foundation for
any larger socio-aesthetic moves. They're as marginalized as anyone.

Afterthough on Ashbery (example of the non-marginal). I've always read
Self-Portrait and the books that immediately followed that as being the
most unrelievedly vicious satires on Establishment Verse (with a conscious
model in mind, what used to be the typical "Wesleyan" book of the 1960s,
one long poem and 12-20 short pieces). I've always been amazed that these
were taken up by the very people he was satirizing, almost as if they
couldn't see the parody. In this sense, Ashbery is our own Ern Malley.

Well--yes, this has always been an interesting issue.  Years ago I was
puzzled as to why the classic founder/polemicists of LangPo and other
counterstream tendencies made APR their whipping-entity, and not say the
venerable Poetry.  One reason is that Poetry seems to've been in decline
in influence since I was a wee lad in the 1960s, and another is the
specific history of APR, which was founded in a way that linked it
historically to the MFA-granting poetry workshop/writing program movement.
It specifically marketed itself to the writing-workshop milieu, and so
many feel that it has helped to perpetuate the blandest free-verse
stylings, which often come out of that milieu.  I'd readily agree about
the counterstream poets they've published over the years.  I haven't
bothered to pick it up for about three years, but before that saw it
pretty regularly for eons--and your list of interesting poets could be
extended;  I remember fine if small bits of Barbara Guest and Susan Howe.
But many folks just feel that the counterstream appearances are pretty
infrequent and minor compared to the overwhelming volume of mediocre
dreck.

The other point, which I've never seen mentioned, but which I suspect is
important, is that APR is just *so* visible and widely available, and so
much *intends* to be a popular/populist tabloid presence, that it's bound
to be a primarily target, if you have criticisms of the poetry
establishment.  Its very character makes it a potent influence, capable of
perpetuating dominant (ahem) trends; and I believe it *has* functioned to
perpetuate dominant trends, most of 'em pretty bad...But yes for most of
us it isn't an black-and-white issue.  I've always publicly praised them
for what openings and support they've given otherstreams...

that would be much of my own experience. Of course there are the seemingly
'accurate' word compounds forged by editing fudges and cut paste on the
processor and the fumble finger inventions that jerk a line onwards. I need
to gut into my bath, I'll be book. Such are the nuts and bolts of facture
in our workshops. Then there's the moment at which a decision is taken to
leave these neologisms in the writing that is sent out of the house. At
those moments are the political and cultural imperatives at play. An
'attempt to say the unsayable' or / an expression of 'protest at normative
language restrictions' might simply generate an expletive or reach for a
conventionalising expression of it - instead the same generates a word that
others might recognise the impulse behind but which has specificities. It
only takes one other to begin to employ such specificities for Saussure's
brow to begin sweating mighty strange.
Yes, such specificities are often context-specific within the music of a
ludic phrase.

Aren't such instances of the 'unsayable' highly revealing? What would we
want to discuss that we don't have the words for? What do they tell us
about our cultural parameters as pre-scribed and inscribed by language?

As Randolph points out in may cases the 'neologism' may only be a long as
the interaction (as true for 'reading' as 'signing'). Some constructions
though in contemporary poetry, 'if not them, how come?', are in themselves
signs, active indexical components within the artifice we speak and ride.
Many of the stumbling blocks we cruise present questions that require
applications of 'similar' navigational devices. Lang - po has period
trademarks that are integral both to its community formations and their
applications  -  as witness much of the discussion on this list.

There was a sereies of exchanges recently on british poets about words for
silence and of how the subtle varieties of silence in other cultures and
older regional dialects has become represented in contemporary usage by
'silence'. There are many many examples of similar vernacular
impoverishments within English(es) that moderarate our 'conversations'.
What lies behind my raising of this 'neologistical' issue is a need to   -
go the other way. To, as Mark Prejsnar put it, 'wound(s) complacency and
linguistic transparency'. Mechanisms for generating this skaning (?) sorry
shaking up are a nub we wittle at, poetry is often that residue.
Contemporary poetries often seem to offer markers as to the lack of
language. That's their sheen.

>chris,
I'm sure what it means that we've been collaborating on the 'ranges' for a
couple of years now and when you type my name you still conventionalise it,
but that's the flip side of what of what i'm raising, yuo're being ironic

Hi Tom, of course i would and nearly posted a bit of the newest candidates
yesterday. I've made reading one of the 'ranges' an integral part of any
public sharing of work over the past eighteen months. That's partly because
of the mediated collaborative exploration they promote and partly because
they often contain aspects of potential term negotiation  -  as you rightly
say in a playful way  -  but then i'd value play highly.

Here's the very latest 'range' i've received, under subject - 'like a
summer with a thousand julys'  -  should say that Tom, Maria Damon,
Gabrielle Welford and Jorge Guitart are all currently active:

Ed Sanders had but one gizmo on stage in Boulder (not counting the VCR he
was using to record himself for replay on his cable access show back
home), so we didn't get to hear him play his musical tie, or his
electronic fingers, or any of his other other gizmatic wonders.  What he
did have with him was a small sampler which alloewd him to use prerecorded
accompaniment for one of his songs -- I think experts in the filed refer
to this sampler as an Ashbery --

When I heard of the joint Clinton/Blair declaration of the end of the
class war, I couldn't help thinking of Stalin! -- Once Stalin had
consolidated his regime, the "Soviet" government declared that the
classes no longer existed and hence the class war had come to an end (and,
hence no further need for workers to create their own organizations, like,
say, Soviets and unions) -- The oft repeated claim than everyone in
America IS middle-class serves a similar, though admittedly a tad less
deadly, function --

July 17: Cinematic Masters of Science and Math

Imagine a school in which: the woodshop teacher turns the shop into his
own private furniture store, trading passing grades for student "slave
labor" in the manufacture of pieces which he takes away for home use or
sale; the metal shop instructor issues an 'F' grade to a student for a
project in which he had worked for months, saying "you couldn't have
done this"; an English teacher is arrested for selling dope to her
students; the head of boys Physical Education pulls out a camera and
snaps dozens of boys in the shower; a science instructor angrily hurls
part of a science experiment at the head of a student seated at the rear
of the classroom. This, my friends, is not the plot of some wacky summer
film. Nope, it's the school I attended, Dartmouth Jr. High, which still
sits staring blankly at the traffic on Blossom Hill Road. And right, you
guessed it, I'm the kid who nearly got nailed by the ballistic science
experiment gone wrong. Perhaps it was the unintentionally errant arms of
science teachers like Mr. Hays that caused thousands of kids to turn off
to the sciences, aided and abetted by perhaps the lack of a proper
background in child learning theory, by uninspired teaching materials,
and the use of boring, really awful science films.=20

You know the type: the didactic black and white Coronets, the terribly
narrated Moody Institute films with the religious message --- ("them
bugs ain't as smart as the creator") --- at the end of every film, and
all the others with their paste-and-glue graphical representations of
mitosis, amoebae, and paramecia. I'm telling you this story as an
introduction to tonight's program, which features science and math films
that are so phenomenally good that anyone could be enchanted. There may
be no way to adequately count the number of young minds saved by Bruce
Russell, Thomas Stanton, Norman & Marjorie Bean, David & Peter Boulton,
and Bruce & Katherine Cornwell, who made science and math films
engaging, fun, intellectually stimulating, and artistically beautiful.
These films truly created an educational revolution, are magnificent
films for people of any age, and will be a real eye-opener for cine16
viewers who graduated from high school prior to 1980.=20

Tonight's films include:

'Imaging the Hidden World: the Light Microscope' 1984, d. Bruce Russell.
It's difficult to pick a Russell film, because they're all good. This
film shows how the filmmaker sets up the 'scope, light, and filters to
make his visually arresting films.

'Crystals: Flowers of the Mineral Kingdom' 1983, d. Thomas Stanton.
Stanton's film of rapidly expanding colorful crystalline growths is
reminiscent of a quote attributed to Salvador Dali', who once said "I
don't take acid, I am acid"

'Carnivorous Plants 1979, d. Thomas Stanton. A Blue Ribbon award winner
at the American Film Festival. Insidious.

'Fungi' 1983, p. David & Peter Boulton. Neat slo-mo shots of slowly
spreading destructive growths. Boulton-Hawker Films were made in
Britain, distributed by Benchmark. Exceptional.

'Spiders -- Backyard Science' 1978', p. Norman & Marjorie Bean. OK, a
film for elementary kids, complete with friendly narrator... except that
these horrifying images will scare the bejesus out of them! Extreme
color close-ups of nightmarish clarity.=20

'Congruent Triangles' 1976, d. Bruce & Katharine Cornwell. Abstract
design, post-bop jazz , and Klee-like animation make a showpiece out of
a seemingly mundane subject.=20

'Insect Parasitism: the Alder Woodwasp' 1968, p. Gerald Thompson & E.R.
Skinner. The wasp drills a hole in a log, deposits its eggs, then four
different kinds of bugs use its developing offspring for all sorts of
things. Incredible cinematography, docs in labcoats. A fascinating film.

hard for me to speak re new contexts techniques motivations, but i'm sure
that the real work of movements perists long after any passing of said
movement's active phase.  even the work of those over-determined origins
of language writing that jacques debrot lists below still has yet to be
fully considered.  we're still a long way from getting at the how of, say,
zukofsky's question of whether the fugue can be transferred to poetry.

fwd movement pushing further into disjunctive terrains opened by langpo,
into verbo-visual electronic icongraphic texts.  and a back-questioning
into those texts that got us here in the first place ..

Losing Track


At the age of 25 I decided I want to write philosophy. To write a text
implies working through domains without guideposts, recuperating older
strata, looking up through the dissemination of the wide world's in-
formation. Part of me believed that I was writing the world itself,
that a secret would manifest its bones, and with that would come pow-
er.

Never earthly, the power would equate knowledge with interstitial
longings, and hence with a triumphant mastery of death. Space and time
were not far behind.

I could never listen to music with pleasure because of textual ab-
sence; instead, music became a dialog I abandoned after a furious
wager with high-speed sound. Music took far too much for granted,
lending itself to pure jouissance. I would head towards video, film,
writing, and always writing - writing which could describe the world
in a singularity, the compression of everything into - not only the
symbolic, but also a token such as V, a set-theoretical universe.

Once V was announced, it was criss-crossed by rules which in fact
exhausted V: V was nothing but the domain of those rules, Godel not-
withstanding. The rules of the real of course prove much more intract-
able; in fact, they may not be rules (which are top-down) at all, so
much as part-objects, bottom-up operations with superstructural mani-
festations that take on the appearance of relative simplicity. The
unsolvable n-body problems are good examples.

Eventually, I became certain I had nothing to contribute on this level
- that is, to the concrete progress produced by science and technology
- for example, solutions or heuristics for fundamental particle the-
ory. I was too undisciplined, too resistant, for that.

Instead, I became concerned with the interrelationship among these
abstract systems and consciousness, the interstices of structures,
bodies, minds, and the symbolic, plateaued throughout by an imagin-
ary. Such was the case that _muck_ necessarily surfaced in this in-
vestigation, a muck that created _discomfort_ among those workers on
the surface who took the mines for granted.

My work has been in the mines, in the shafts, across the occasional
surface irruption. It explores the depths, not recursively, but with a
sense of ennui, longing, and the depths are not infinite, just as the
symbolic is not an infinite concatenation of broken strings.

More like a Sierpinski Sponge imagined without the recursion, depths
are unfounded, unfounding, and as I am fond of saying, unaccountable,
and unaccounted-for: hence, an other. And more than or to this, I am
also fond of saying that they generate and reflect _the neurotic style
of the world,_ a style necessarily repetitive, obsessive, scarred and
sutured, a style which has always already effaced itself, just as
language as the appearance of each and every determination.

Thus the neurotic, not schizz, may have a hold or grasp on the world,
just as the paranoid comprehends sociobiology in its entirety.

In relation to everything here, there is institutionalization, the
conundrum of institutions. Wild theory is incomprehensible in the face
of the propriety of regulated reference, footnotes, and a dedication
to reasoned argument. I would argue, wildly and unsuccessfully, that
this reasoned argument always already precludes, firewalls, forecloses
the _muck,_ which is not just a matter of a psychoanalytical and/or
rational approach, but also a seeping, oozing, within and without the
discomfort of the (borderlined) reader. In this regard, the muck-text
is as much performative, process, as it is discursive formation. And
in this regard, it remains difficult to translate, suitcase.

On the other hand, it is easy to descend or ascent to a superstruct-
ural surface that purports, through skimming (surfing) to present a
laissez-faire chaotic mapping of nomadic chains, in lieu of comprehen-
sion. And it is easy for me to fool myself that something has been
accomplished, beyond the demonstration of a new command, application,
or Net phenomenon: And if anything salvages these texts, it's the
embarrassment, shame, dirtiness, muck, psychotic flirtations, that
refuse to let go, after the command, application, or Net phenomenon
has been deciphered.

When I began years ago, I developed the notion of two regimes, the
construct and the experiential. The former was external to temporal
systems, and an idealized graph of equivalences or transforms; the
latter was messy, carried motility within it, and problematized the
very nodes and vectors that created the appearances of entities and
processes. The two modes intersected in what I later called state or
process-oriented graphs. Within this scheme, wild theory is, of
course, experiential; traditional discursive formations, on the other
hand, appear as-if-grounded in the construct. Thus an ideal academic
discourse might be considered a database, allowing the recuperation of
argument, revisitation rights/rites, and footnoting allowing the dis-
course to partake of others observing the same protocols. While this
constructs a language-practice ultimately based on the Enlightenment
(or for that matter Euclid), it also precludes both the problematic of
reception (beyond reception-theory) and those very cognitive proces-
ses that grant the text its semantics in the first place.

So that, by harboring texts within the experiential as primary (as my
texts attempt), grounds and reasoned discourse are instead problemati-
zed - not in favor of anarchic feeling - but in terms of those tradi-
tionally analytic part-objects (such as this text to some extent) that
appear within them.

This certainly reduces the necessity of grounds for 'em. *

* And also unfortunately reduces the community of readers, who are no
longer guided by those tokens of footnote/reference/etc. that I have
referenced here, and that provide the ability to cross-translate, as
well as reaffirm a foreclosed but relatively friendly academe. _This_
work, instead, is wounded, refusing to heal, apparently establishing
no discourse, critique; and in this sense, it is a corpse of work, not
corpus. Later, a corpse will give birth to new forms of life; now, it
is an uncomfortable object in the room, leaking onto the table, spil-
ling onto the floor.

Ashbery's winning the Yale Younger Poets over O'Hara is in some ways
proleptic of his later, and strangely wide, appeal, isn't it?  It's
interesting, by the way, to read Harold Bloom on Ashbery.  Bloom dismisses
the New York School connection as well as the obvious European influences:
Apollinaire, Reverdy, Roussel, Michaux, Cendars, and de Chirico, and reads
Ashbery instead (not altogether falsely) as a direct descendant of the line:
Emerson-Stevens. It's Bloom's reading of Ashbery that's been the decisive one
in terms of Ashbery's legitimation by the academy.

Of course your right to say that disjunction is not itself a langpo
innovation.  However I was refering to specific disjunctive techniques (such
as the new sentence) and not to disjunction itself.  Still, langpo does seem
to have mined disjunction to greater effect than earlier poetries.

Jorie Graham's new poem -

mark strand - "I think she's carved out such a powerful oevre that it's
unignorable.

Discuss? OHNO In response to Jorie's New Yorker poem.

"That which..." initially said to me:  "Pay attention to how you are
living!" and "Examine the other, the alterity, our culture in nice
end-of-decade middle class umerica to see how it's effecting you and you are
affecting it"

Kind of a popgoesthe newYorkerbubble philosophy. But there must be more.
Tell me so, Jorie. "They are intended to be clear...where the poems are
difficult is in how they move...so let's let go and see what else we can
read with."

Or is it only too imaginable?

Sorry to do thios in three posts. A long day, too much sun: gelled, they
call it here. And the beer, too, didn't help. Anyway: how about Schwitters
and Breton? I think it wouldn't be real hard, in a different mood, to
compile a long list of pretty effective disjunction-miners.
Big claims open themselves to a lot of small potshots. The poems of whatever
school or coterie of friends will probably have to stand on their own
regardless of claims to innovativeness.

David, thanks for the references.

I've been on vacation with the kids and returned yesterday to 283 messages!
It took me awhile to plow through.  By the way, your message was listed
around 24 hours before mine.  Interesting phenomenon, that, the response
arriving first.

Gus Blaisdell made the statement in the letter attached to Gnomonology that
there is no archaeology of the spirit, yet, poetry is exactly that.  It is a
science of language which reveals the assemblage of life (to quote McCord).
What little understanding I have of the intricacies of translating from the
Chinese suggests that Lao Tse / Chuang Tzu used the language to the same
effect, that is to plumb the spirit in an active way, ie. to make us think
about ourselves from inside in contrast to a strictly social perspective.

The dynamic interaction of personal poetics with the social interface of
life has characterised human thought since who knows when.  It is
responsible for the arts as well as the sciences or, perhaps we might say,
the science of art and the art of science.  Both are products of process,
it's just that methods of the former are rather poorly understood by the
latter. (By the way, McCord's list brought Cassirer to mind and his
discussion of Plato, Poetics and the State is very interesting, when read
with Chuang Tzu, Confucius and the Empire in mind. See:Cassirer, The Myth of
the State).

I agree that Tagore falls into the same special category, mystic or not.
There is something so very the essence of the sub-continent in his work.
The lyric form can be a means of cognition, to paraphrase Cassirer via
McCord and, in this sense, the evocative power of mantras, sutras, etc. have
a place.  But then, anything can have a place in poetry if it's what makes
up the poet; the quibbling comes when the reader gets involved: silent
flowers could not possibly speak, much less in color. But there it is; they
did speak to the poet, although one could ask whether the poetry spoke to
anyone else (Wittgenstein's observations on conscious and unconscious
thought in the Blue book are interesting in this respect).

The notes concerning Sanscrit took me back to the books, ie. Snyder's use of
the word "ayang" (which does not seem to be Sanscrit, someone please correct
me if I am wrong, I did my studies in French and sometimes have trouble with
transcriptions).  Perhaps because the alphabet fully represented all the
sounds of the language, it was used successfully to translitterate many
Asian languages and a concept is sometimes pronounced several ways, ex:
ahimsa, ahingsa.  Thai owes a particular debt to it, since it enriched the
language with words for cultural and religious concepts and activities not
previously known and gave it an alphabet, through the medium of Pali (our
equivalents being Greek and Latin).  However, it does not deal with tone
based poetics which are an unusual feature of the Thai language.  While
Sanscrit may be translitterated, it is difficult to do so with Thai, Chinese
or other tonal languages. The effect would be ludicrous. One wouldn't know
if the word meant dog, horse or come/come dog be my horse/horse come be my
dog.  Of course, if that's the intention...

I'm getting long here.  Human languages have been going through process and
synthesis through time with poets and poetry at the cutting edge, to say
nothing of their effects from translation.  When there is something
important to say/show/observe about human beings, poets express it before
and better than anyone else precisely because they are archaeologists of the
spirit. It doesn't surprise me that some of us are well remembered.
Finally, in reference to the tenor of recent exchanges, a day of thought (or
three months) before response might clarify, distill and enrich.

It's a talk I gave sometime around 1980 (Bob Perelman, who hosted it, could
date it more exactly--he & Francie brought their newborn son Max to the
event, age 7 days, same son who is now about to head off to Yale). I was
trying to distinguish all the prose that was sprouting up among the langpo
from what little had been done previously by way of the prose poem. It cited
Williams' Kora in Hell as a precedent and spent a lot of time looking at
Stein's critical distinctions between sentences and paragraphs. At the
conclusion it listed seven characteristic qualities of the new sentence:

1) The paragraph organizes the sentences;
2) The paragraph is a unit of quantity, not logic or argument;
3) Sentence length is a unit of measure;
4) Sentence structure is altered for torque, or increased
polysemy/ambiguity;
5) Syllogistic movement is: (a) limited; (b) controlled;
6) Primary syllogistic movement is between the preceding and following
sentences;
7) Secondary syllogistic movment is toward the paragraph as a whole, or the
total work;
8) The limiting of syllogistic movement keeps the reader's attention at or
very close to the level of language, that is, most often at the sentence
level or below.

By "syllogistic movement" I was trying to show the structural underpinnings
what tends to naturalized as "reference."

The talk became the title piece for my first collection of critical writing.

All this reminds of a question that has surfaced, amid various doubts
& equivocations anent the "acadomino theory" moniker (so to say) --

namely, how might Bob (or others) view the radical tautology of
calling LangPo "LangPo"?

(This follows, more or less, in the tradition of *not* calling a spade a
"metallo-earth-reconfigurational handheld equipage moiety" -- both
possibilities [i.e., the latter, or, in the alternatives, calling it,
admittedly more prosaically, "a spade"] presumably falling within the
"what it is" school of naming, but with some diff.)

I think this question is an important one to be asking, but it may be that
there's a fallacy hidden here--that of assuming that a technique's
'radical'-ness is the source of its validity.  I think that even in the
langpo 'moment,' whenever it was and supposing it's ended, the constant
attention that its practitioners drew to its antecedents, its place in a
tradition, served the purpose of making the techniques at least -seem-
fruitful beyond their oppositional status.  As I think many would contend
they are.

Is this an art/life dichotomy we're setting up here? I understand feeling
"dumbed down" by it all but is there not a danger in devaluing substantive
debate to this degree? I suppose Mark would say of course that's the point.
It does seem to me that there is a generally conservative codification of
what should be taught-- Mark's point would probably be that there's not
enough of a coherent agenda for that characterization to be accurate--
nevertheless it seems to me to push for openings re curriculum is as
important as trying to change bureaucratic/economic idiocies, & that these
may in fact be the same thing, or at least one can approach it in that
manner.

Is this a given? I don't think we know. In any case _if_ a given technique is
only contextually radical that in itself supplies plenty motivation no?

Since I, not Bennet, characterized O'Hara's stance towards NY as above, I'll
take responsibility, altho I'm not sure what your letter as a whole is asking.
Of course their not necessarily mutually exclusive, but they are in O'Hara's
work, and this separation gives rise, I think, to some of the virtues of
same. Let me use an analogy. At a certain point in my expatriate time in
France I realized that I would never "know" the language because, while my
French had the historical depth that reading affords, the cultural referents
of daily life of my French age-mates (I hate the word "cohort"--it sounds
too much like a Roman soldier) and those of the previous generation learned
by them at the kitchen table--snatches of popular song, advertizing slogans,
the commercial history of this or that corner (what was there before the
bakery, who the baker was, how the neighborhood's changed, and the language
attached to that), obsolete slang, echoes of the spoken and body language of
popular entertainers, etc., would be forever largely beyond my reach. As
well, the personal historical past of the language--the baby talk of my
generation, the adolescent jive my agemates had spoken and forgotten--shared
language experience--were also largely unattainable. Even if I learned
enough to mimic these, the affect behind the usage would be different.
Similarly, O'Hara writes as if his New York exists in an eternal present or
near-present, and he seems to skate (and skate marvelously) on one of the
city's shinier surfaces. Which is by no means to imply that he was shallow.
In fact, we can contrast him with Blackburn, who joined his mother in
Greenwich Village, which was then a traditional Italian neighborhood with a
few artists of limited means, when he was eleven, fresh out of a childhood
in rural Vermont. As a mature poet he knows O'Hara's New York, but he's also
aware of a much more complex city. And I think he's often emotionally and
intellectually shallower than O'Hara, certainly rarely (except perhaps in
the journals) reaches the depth of the Odes.
Why is this important to American poets beyond my parochial New York sense?
Simon Schuchat is certainly right that New York has been a haven for those
whose cultural roots are none too pleasant, and not just gays from less
forgiving places, but for artists in general. The expatriate life does offer
its large compensations in personal freedom, and many, including the artists
in all media who landed there in the fifties and sixties, have exploited
that freedom to all of our benefit. But New York is also a metropolitan area
of 22 million--the largest in the English-speaking world and home to maybe
8% of Americans. Note, I speak about the metro area--Ginsberg, in Passaic,
is within that net, and the kids I worked with in Lynbrook and Perth Amboy
were not unlike the kids in white ethnic neighborhoods in the five boroughs,
and they got into Manhattan and out of their neighborhood-centered worlds
about as rarely as their city agemates.
What I'm trying to say is that New York, culturally very different from much
of the rest of the country, is the largest American environment--it's not
just an escape from another country or culture. The American mythmakers,
confusing, on purpose, I think, two words, place the "heartland" in the
"hinterland," as if we've all somehow failed to embrace our true destiny as
virtuous Iowa farmers. To the extent that America is my subject or the
ground of my work I'd better be prepared to understand, in all its
complexity, the urban heartland.
So, I love O'Hara's breathless excitement, hope that my own comes across
from time to time in my own verse, I know there's more to O'Hara than that,
and I don't think that he's particularly grounded in place in New York.

And as for Charles Bukowski: I was reading him because I had been told by

Actually I was only attempting to clean George up a little.  He had been
so overcome by his readings in Bukowski that he was quite soggy, and I
thought, oh hell, not another weeping Canadian.  So I tried to lift the
lampshade and mop him up, something I was able to do, in part, by the
light of his nose, which was maple leaf red and glowing.

Actually Rod, Bennett Simpson (me) didn't write the below phrase. Someone
did --I remember reading it-- but it wasn't me. I wrote...hmm. Excitement
and groundless places (we love you!) are definitely not mutually
exclusive. They often go hand in hand, often have little to do with each
other. To raise an old question (but one I never understand), What is
place in poetry anyway, say, the places of O'Hara's poems, or Berrigan's?
I'm not talking about "geographic" St. Mark's places, or studios, or
avenues, but a place that, when attributed by generalists, is often
metaphysical (fine) or idealized. New York. Is this a place?
Distinguishable without streetsigns?

The real v. non-real (imagined). I don't like this dichotomy either. I try
not to be a pedant. I have only figments of axes to grind. But sometimes
something seizes me, bad grad school, greener grass, and --whoa-
everything is allegory.

In a recent post, Ron Silliman mentioned Vogelsang and Ern Malley in the one
breath.

It might amuse the list to know that the policeman in Adelaide, South
Australia, who prosecuted Max Harris in 1943 for publishing the "obscene"
Ern Malley poems in his journal "Angry Penguins" was named Detective Vogelsang.

Jacques Debrot said in a recent post:

"Ashbery's winning the Yale Younger Poets over O'Hara is in some ways
proleptic of his later, and strangely wide, appeal, isn't it? "

Ashbery himself has mentioned this incident in a radio interview (with the
present writer, broadcast in Australia in 1988). W.H.Auden had been asked to
judge the prize that year (1956) and had sent back all the entries forwarded
to him by the committee with the opinion that none was worthy of the prize.

Frank O'Hara heard of this and sent his own MS directly to Auden, along with
a MS by his friend John Ashbery. Auden liked both, and gave the prize to
Ashbery. (Naturally, given that the early Ashbery was much more like Auden
than O'Hara ever was.)  John Ashbery said "Frank gave my book a good review,
which was very generous of him, under the circumstances."

John Ashbery also said the book ("Some Trees") was a terrible flop, taking
more than eight years to sell out its eight hundred copies. He said that
partly because the book was such a disaster, he felt he had no public to
speak of, and therefore might as well write whatever he liked; thus the
violent disjunctions of "The Tennis Court Oath."

So good luck follows bad.

Now, come on. I think it's time certain members of this list woke up and
started reading Bukowski with the intelligence this great Canadian poet
deserves. Also, it is about time that some scholar out there paid attention
to Mr Bukowski's sources. If you can read "Puking at the Post Office"
without recalling "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror," you have not been
reading carefully enough. I used to drink a bit with Chuck, and whenever he
reached a certain degree of poetic intoxication, brought on, as I recall,
by some very good Okanagan chablis, he would begin to recite from "The
Tennis Court Oath," except he always called it "The Race Track Oath" for
some reason.

Jacques--

I would argue that much of what LPers have pointed out in their theory,
is (for me) still a set of very active issues....How to blast apart the
congealed ice of mainstream reading practices and publishing forms, for
instance.  And that that project is bound up with a profoundly left
political set of concerns.  (Again, as so often, I return to the fact that
the *hidden secret*, at least apparently to most people, (but like most
hidden secrets it's right there out in the open) with regard to LangPo
theory is: it's huge debt to *Brecht*...but also its creative *extension*
of Brecht; for instance combining him with Stein/Zuke/Ez to begin a
synthesis involving both ideas of a public art and ideas of the
physicality of language as an active medium.)

I have sympathy with your feeling that there is much more, beyond what's
been done, for younger poets to reach toward.  But: 1. to just abstractly
shrug off what was done in the 70s and 80s could risk being just
fashion-mangering; 2. if there's any truth or utility to a given group of
theoretical insights ya gotta go *thru* them to get to your next step, and
neither go around 'em, nor retreat back from them...

I could have sworn that in some interview or other Ashbery said that (far
from "liking" it) Auden very much *disliked* Some Trees, and had to be
begged/badgered into accepting it, by the Wesleyan people...(..because for
sure he disliked it *less* than any of the other submissions)

Or maybe that was someone else's recollection?  But I have this sharp
sense I read little JA himself saying that that happened...

Am I hallucinating?

Thanks, Pat Pritchett, for yet another reading-report from the Buddhist Big
Top. When I read these reports, I feel as though I _am_ you. I am sure my
response to these various readers would be almost identical--if only that
they _have_ been, in former years of reading-going. I am puzzled about one
thing, tho, & that is Ed Sanders' gizmos that he fiddled with before
reading. Are these Whi.He.My.Ma Gizmos, or Tibetan Buddhist Gizmos, or
Gizmos fetched from Woodstock? More on the Gizmos, please.  David

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Thanks to Rod Smith for asking some clarifying questions about my
recent post. Of course I think, as Rod rightly points out, that there are
substantive differences between all sorts of poetic perspectives and
academic specialities, and that those differences are important. And I too
would like, for instance, if it was possible at the universities where I
teach to have even a single course in any kind of "postmodern" innovative
poetry, when the closest these universities get is one two-sememster
course in "American Poetry" that sometimes, but rarely, reaches Ashbery.
And it would be nice also to feel more room in creative writing courses to
introduce "experimental" techniques, however defined--and I do introduce
such techniques whenever I can.

        But the question is, matters to whom? And the answer is, well, you
and me, and other people interested in literature. But to the academic
environment at large, or to the bureaucracy of the university itself? I'm
quite sure that the president, say, of either one of these universities
really could care less WHAT points of view are taught in the English
department. Why, you can even be a communist, burn flags and stuff.
Would the bureaucracy object to a course on language poetry every year?
Not at all--they'd even let you go ahead and have several, as long as the
department itself could still cover basic "requirements" such as
composition and survey courses, etc. Try to teach ONLY language poetry and
then you might have a battle.

        So it depends on what one means by 'acdominant'--what professors
in English departments think about literature? What they are doing to meet
or change bureaucratic requirements? What books are published, and who
has the biggest literary reputation? Then yes, clearly some viewpoints
have more "dominance" than others, although that itself is not cut
and dried. In my experience, most professors in English departments aren't
even having enough conversation to agree or disagree with each other at
all--they haven't read the same texts, and don't want to waste much time
talking because they've got careers to defend, and in some cases (not
enough unfortunately), ideas that they want to pursue. Usually, the most
in-depth coversation they have is about whether there's a "field" that
they need to cover that the university will fund a teaching line for, one
that has enough social cache to now need to be "covered."

        But isn't such specialization itself an ideology? And isn't that
specialization ideology itself wedded to to the ideological limits of any
notion of coverage? Also yes. But the fact of the matter is that any
subject can be fit into the academic system that this ideology supports.
Indeed I don't think it will be too long before language poetry DOES get
taught at American universities. Already one of the schools where I teach
has a regular undergraduate course in Postcolonial Literature. Is that a
good thing? Yes. Does it change the content of what is "covered"? Again
yes, a little. Does it change the organization of the university system,
in some kind of "trickle down" phenomena in which more university
bureaucrats have awareness about issues of racism, awareness that they
act on? Well, perhaps yes, but
now I'm starting to feel skeptical. Has the ideology that states that
"coverage" is the point, and that experts "cover" fields, been changed?
Not one bit.

        So, what's at stake in an English department for "language
poetry," or any other "field" that can be delimated by a name, is whether
it gets its piece of the "coverage." And THEN
literary politics matter--and yes, there are still so many professors who
haven't even heard of Language poetry that they are unlikely to want it
taught. So there's one battle. And the other
thing at stake is whose books about literature will get published--will we
have 15 books about language poetry this year, as opposed to 7 or so last
year? At what point will those numbers crest and begin to go down?

        So yes, in one sense the debate matters. You can read Ron Silliman
in a few courses in the United States; probably you can't read Bob Grumman
in any such courses. Of course, I know that's wrong, actually--in the
graduate/undergraduate course I taught on Modern American Poetry last
fall, I DID teach Bob Grumman's VERY STRAYNGE BOOK, but did not teach Ron
at all (sorry, Ron, I'll "cover" you next time, love what you're doing,
etc). So Bob, there's 35 students for you who know more about you than
they do about Ron. And then, too, it's harder to read about Ron than it is
about T.S. Eliot, although if I had to place a bet, I would say that Ron
MIGHT be starting to give Robert Lowell a run for his money, in terms of
how many academic books/articles mention his name in 1996-7. If that's
true, great. I'm all for it. If not, let's work on it.

        I don't mean to devalue the differences between theories of poetry
(especially in terms of what gets taught in creative writing at the
present moment) but it's hard for me sometimes to get that worked up about
it. Language poets WILL get their courses, and WILL get their books. Bob
Grumman WILL be taught somewhere, some time (again). Yes, T.S. Eliot has
the drop
on both of them--that may or may not change. But even if it did, all it
would mean would be that Bob or Ron or whoever would be better read and
better known in a world that looks pretty much like it does already. And
somebody down the line might say "I'm tired of this canonical Bob Grumman"
and whoosh, down he'd go too. There's NOTHING in the academic system to
prevent that from happening. But there is a great deal in the academic
system that prevents anything MORE than that from happening.

        Perhaps, for instance, some facts about the "acodominance" of
language poetry at that bastion of poetry radicalism, UBuffalo, might
help my argument? In a department with, say, 30-40 professors, how many
language poets are there? Two, if you count Susan Howe, which many will
and many will not. Two. It's actually impressive that there's more than
one. But you can be COMPLETELY certain that there will never be five.
There probably will never be three. It's "covered" already, so who would
fund it? At the two universities where I teach,
how many poets there are specifically associated with language poetry?
Well, me, actually. Some people have taken to calling me "that
language poet Mark Wallace." Except I'm not a language poet, although I
might as well be as far as almost everyone there is concerned. Actually,
since I'm an adjunct, with the exception of maybe five or six people
there's no one at those schools who knows anything about my poetry at all.
If I keep plugging away, one day more of them might. What I'm trying to
figure out is how much that will matter.

        So I agree with Rod Smith that the substance of these issues
matters. I
especially feel it in terms of creative writing where, yes, as Ron
Silliman points
out, a "conservative" approach to poetic form receives the most resources
and highest profile. But I also think that too much concentration on these
issues avoids the fact that literature has very little significance
elsewhere in this
society. We can argue about who should be "covered" in classes, but I
think that equal focus needs to be placed on the discplinary practices of
university bureaucracies, and the way we can tie into those bureaucracies,
often without even being conscious of it. And it's hard for me not to
think that there, the idea of "dominant" LITERARY ideas would be at best a
mystery, and at worst laughable, unless we were talking about Stephen
King, who makes enough cash that he might actually donate some.

THAT'S an interesting question, isn't it? Not "what poets do you like?" or
even "what poets do you read?" but what poets actually DRIVE you to the
notebook, word processor, etc?

An old friend once told me that when he felt blocked, he would read Rilke
and Frank O'Hara -- simultaneously (or nearly) -- and that he hadn't known
it to fail yet.

Or perhaps there's not such an easy transference from anyone. Anyone have
any thoughts about this?

I can report having been (at least once) driven directly to pen & paper by
reading Ashbery (following, in that case, my occasional custom of
inscribing my jottings in the blank pages that one handily finds at the end
of books; -- this is a custom I think I might even venture to suggest  to
others -- at least to those not scandalized by the idea; at some point I
could even go thru my books & note which volumes are so adorned -- a
case study . . . but for not, I'll stick w/ Ashbery.  Well one other: some
DC (?) poet has a little volume entitled *Asbestos*, in which I inscribed
a poem that became the nucleus of a book of poems.  In this case, I can't
say I was enraptured by *Asbestos*, but somehow it did drive me to
writ my own stuff).  As for the Ashbery, was one of his early volumes --
prob. *The Double Dream of Spring*.  I've also been sent, if not directly
to pen or keyboard (?), then certainly to a sense of wanting to repair
thereto, by the opening pages of Ashbery's *Flowchart*.

I can also report being driven to brush & canvas -- by Ashbery's poem
"Hotel Latraemont" [sp?], when it appeared in . . . yup, *The New
Yorker* in 1990 (it subsequently became title poem of a book of JA's).
In those days, I was doing paintings in which I'd inscribe lines from
poems, and was very pleased with that memorable & remarkable one.

(Also did -- incidentally -- a very large [and very incomplete] sequence of
small canvases based on Rilke's *Notebooks of Brigge*.  And,for the
record, I did a large (& finished) canvas inspired by that paper-boat poem
of Tagore's that Steven Marks has lately mentioned liking [in my
paraphrase of it]. . . .)

Have also been driven to ink & paper by [here's a partial list]: George
Oppen, Ann Lauterbach, Tom Mandel, Jane Hirshfield, W.C. Williams,
Charles Wright, Andre Codrescu (whimsical essays, not poetry), Italo
Calvino, Eugenio Montale, *Han Shan in English* (an essay), the film *In
Custody* (abt. a fictional Urdu poet), and -- noteably? -- front pages of
the Wall Street Journal & the Washington Post (several times).

Yikes, I just don't know how to handle this revelation from Mark Wallace
about his teaching my StrayngeBook.  I never expected my off-hand
comment about acadominance to so quickly come home to roost!

One good thing about it: everyone on this list will now have to obey my
command to order a copy of *O!!Zone 97*, an anthology of visual, textual
and visio-textual art edited by Harry Burrus that's just come out.  83
pages of work from 57 artists.  $13 for individuals, $25 for
institutions.  International in scope.  Lots of good stuff by good
people including the list's own Dave Chirot.  Most of the names are new
to me, which I count a good sign, but I saw a few well-known ones (to
people in mail art and related fields, at least) like Ruggero Maggi,
Jurgen O. Olbrich, Hartmut Andrycuk and Clemente Padin.

Anyone interested in Visual Poetry ought to check out Karl Young's Light
& Dust Site, too: he's got a terrific selection of works by Alain Satie,
and has just opened (in honor of Bastille Day) a gallery of works from
KALDRON, this country's longest-running international visual poetry
periodical (to my knowledge).  Several really fine pieces by people like
Marilyn R. Rosenberg, Carol Stetser, Shohachiro Takahashi--and (speaking
of flow-chart poetry a while back) a collaboration between Miekal And,
Liz Was and Michael Helsem that is part flow-chart, part circuit
diagram, many parts who-knows-what--and all parts fascinating.  I have a
piece in the KALDRON collection, too, an acadominant one--and maybe
that's not so facetious, for it's an homage to none other than Will
Shakespeare!

True, but there are also the books I penned that appeared under George
Bowering's name : "Kerrisdale Elegies" & "Sticks & Stones". It's not all
that hard. Just speak basso profumo & keep it short. Where did the title of
this thread ("Granby...") originate?

Oddly, Ashbery's one of the poets I've always reached for on my shelves
when I need motivation to write.  I used to find bits of Ahsbery all
through my poems, because often that's who I'd been reading just before
sitting down to write.  Not so much the case anymore, though probably
because my writing habits have changed.

Mark,

Brecht is how you get from Shklovsky to Benjamin, the concepts of ostranenie
and alienation being virtually identical. I didn't really start to read him
much myself, other than the plays, until the 1978 when I was part of a
Marxist Study Group led by the Che of theory himself, Bruce Boone, in SF, in
which he introduced BB's critical work. Also involved were Steve Benson, Bob
Gluck and Kathleen Fraser.

Again, as so often, I return to the fact that the *hidden secret*, at least
apparently to most people, (but like most hidden secrets it's right there
out in the open) with regard to LangPo theory is: it's huge debt to
*Brecht*...but also its creative *extension* of Brecht; for instance
combining him with Stein/Zuke/Ez to begin a synthesis involving both ideas
of a public art and ideas of the physicality of language as an active
medium.)

I don't know if there's anyone in Harrisburg or the surrounding area on this
list, but thought I'd post the following:

The New Poetry in Reading Series is hosting a reading by C.S. Giscombe
and Kenneth A. McClane this Saturday, July 19, 8 p.m. at Svoboda's Books.
Svoboda's is at 227 W. Beaver Ave in downtown State College.  Both Giscombe
and McClane will be reading from forthcoming books.

McClane, W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of Literature at Cornell, is a poet and
essayist.  He has published 7 books of poetry, a book of essays, _Walls_,
and has another book of essays forthcoming.  His essay on James Baldwin in
_Walls_ is really marvelous, and I hear he is a great reader.

Cecil Giscombe is here at Penn State this summer as a Minority Summer
Scholar.  Giscombe is a poet with several books, most recently _Here_
(Dalkey Archive), and _Two Sections from Giscombe Road_ (Leave  Books).  He
is currently working on a prose book (although I heard some of this read a
few weeks ago, and I'd contend that it's prose poetry).  It is loosely
historical, based on the life of John Giscome, a West Indian "miner &
explorer" who settled in British Columbia in the 19th century.  Giscombe's
work is mellifluous and quite beautiful.

If anyone would like more information, directions, e-mail me at

As long as no one reveals the *real* connection (to George Bowering--

Hey, while there's talk of influences, how about of cartoonists?  I'll
bet Walt Kelly and George Herriman have influenced a LOT of poets.

& William Bronk too. Actually, from the Susan Schultz-edited book /The

influencees.

But on to what I read for inspiration: Buk, of course, and I agree with
George about the Ashbery influence, especially noticeable in "Absence of

also, the recent appearance of Raymond Carver's name (on Maria

have been able to have so happy a final decade (or thereabouts) of
life (in wake of more troublous years) -- and that indeed, he regarded

an expression that (with rather different spin) our freshman-year

also recalling Wavy Gravy of 60s fame --

also skirting around borders of the "grave" & "gravity" of gravy --

it's not inspiring, not titilllllllating, obliquely critical, kinda
nauseating and very far from my reality (does this make me a stump?). The

one grain of rice along this Influence Trail :  a poem I wrote in response
to BB's "Grosser Dankchoral"-- with which I found myself substantially in
agreement, but which, in its use of the idea of heaven in stanza 3,(though
not in stanza 4), appears in contradiction with itself...

 _After Brecht_

Be thankful it's this dark.
Nobody knows what you're up to.
What if they did--
who's to say its wrong.

Anything we want to do,
as long as we can find the energy,
we do it.  That's how come
it's getting darker all the time.

What if some dark night
they do you in.  No last moments
marred by the injustice of it all.
I don't know who to thank.


(this was in _Tight Corners_, Black Sparrow, 1974).

Yes, I recall much discussion of _ostrananie_ during the talks & workshops
of the late 70s, which Ron S is correct to hook up with BB's estrangement
of audience, which could have gone further were he not such "a man of the
people", in whom "the tree of heaven" still grew. I'm not complaining -- to
whom complain? I think Brecht is amazing. "Is the enemy still making
movements in your rear?" ( Btw, Bob Grumman's mention of the "Reverse
Bowering Initial Syndrome" puts me in mind of Bob Grenier, who did a
wonderful translation of a one-act play of BB's sometime in late 70s/early
80s which appeared where, Ron? _Jimmy & Lucy's House of K_ ? )

+++++++++++++

On a probably related subject,"How to Bower", I say to Rachel, whose fund
of what used to be called when I went to school, General Knowledge, puts
her close to the top of the class or at it, "Well, you would say that,
wouldn't you?"

That being Mandy Rice-Davies' most famous line in the Profumo Trial. (One
more grain in the Mandy Rice-Davies Trail.)

well at the moment I'm reading Dashiell Hammett's *The Thin Man* for
1st time, & much enjoying (though one does miss the Chandler similes)...

as for Lewises, C.S.'s *Till We Have Faces* was influential in my yooth

as for recent fiction, Vikram Chandra's *Red Earth / Pouring Rain* merits
mention -- though as for current So.Asian fare, really I'm looking forward
to getting Arundhati Roy's highly promoted (& much discussed in some
circles) *The God of Small Things* . . .

what about (or what has happened with) the East Village's pomo(ish),
performance(ish), feminist(ish) quick-fire voluble out-there in-your-face
comedienne Reno?

She was quite a hoot (& seemed to make quite a sensation) abt. 10 years
ago, esp. at PS 122 (for several seasons) -- & she did what seemed a
rather swift local rise-to-(some) prominence, playing (at least) such
"establishment avant garde" venues as the Serious Fun festival at Lincoln
Center.  Any word?  Any critique? . . . anything?

Bill Hicks.  Not an inspiration to write, but an inspiration nonetheless,
and the only comedy recordings I've actually purchased since, I don't
know, fifth grade.

If anyone's interested, two posthumous CDs have just been released, the
last of which (_Rant in E Minor_) has some rather disturbing
audience alienation effects.

What? No Don Rickles? Whattsamatta with you hockey pucks? But seriously,
folks - only last night as we watched him on Letterman, my wife remarked:
"I've hated that man for 40 years." Then we noticed how age had mellowed him
 - indeed, he had to make a visible effort to work himself up into what was
only a mild fit of bellicose indignation. I've always found him incredibly
obnoxious - but he's a superb  technician of the joke in matters of
delivery, timing, improvising and above all, at reading the audience's
degree of self-loathing - which wld make him an interesting case study,
perhaps. The poetics of self-degradation. Of course, this would apply to
many comics and not a few poets (Berryman, Lowell, perhaps Crane?). I
_still_ haven't read your piece on Lenny Bruce, Maria -  do you deal with
this much?

The following came to me from a friend who's always looking out for my
interests. I don't know his source. I thought I'd pass it along, as it's
damned close to poetry.



The following announcements actually appeared in various church bulletins:

 1. Thursday night - Potluck supper.  Prayer and medication to follow.

 2.  Remember in prayer the many who are sick of our church and community.

 3.  For those of you who have children and don't know it, we have a nursery
downstairs.

 4.  The rosebud on the alter this morning is to announce the birth of
David Alan Belzer, the sin of Rev. and Mrs. Julius Belzer.

 5.  This afternoon there will be a meeting in the South and North ends of
the church.  Children will be baptized at both ends.

 6.  Tuesday at 4:00 PM there will be an ice cream social.  All ladies giving
milk will please come early.

 7.  Wednesday the ladies liturgy will meet.  Mrs. Johnson will sing "Put me
in my little bed" accompanied by the pastor.

 8.  Thursday at 5:00 PM there will be a meeting of the Little Mothers Club.
All ladies wishing to be "Little Mothers" will meet with the Pastor in his
study.

 9.  This being Easter Sunday, we will ask Mrs. Lewis to come foreward and lay
an egg on the alter.

 10.  Next Sunday a special collection will be taken to defray the cost of the
new carpet.  All those wishing  to do something on the new carpet will come
foreward and do so.

 11.  The ladies of the church have cast off clothing of every kind. They can
be seen in the church basement Saturday.

 12.  A bean supper will be held on Tuesday evening in the church hall. Music
will follow.

 13.  At the evening service tonight, the sermon topic will be "What is
Hell?"  Come early and listen to our choir practice.

where Conan finds a lost leather jacket, can't decide whether to turn it
in, and the devil pops up on his shoulder ("I am your devil, Conan")
advising him to keep it -- Conan scratches his chin, says "I dunno", looks
to his other shoulder -- a bear pops up on his other shoulder ("I am your
bear") advising him to keep three limbs on the shore when he hunts
for salmon or trout --

uh...sort of, but not the extent that albert goldman does, in Ladies and
Gentlemen, Lenny Bruce!, which is a bit creepy in that regard, reveling in
Bruce's abjection and other forms of hyperbole (referring to Jews as "the
most despised race in history" etc) aiming, i guess, for a sort of
titillating voyeuristic pathos. i'm totally into the pathos i must admit,
tho i hope not the titillation, and a few folks have complained about my
paper that it's more tragic than funny. it may still be up at the
postmodern culture website.

ps i am a sucker for this sort of thing: kaufman, jonas, bruce, artaud,
etc. i was very taken with bruce boone's talk on "Queer Beat Losers" last
november, for example, where he spoke movingly about john wieners' later
appearances in san francisco.

i find this whole discussion kind of strange because the concept of, looking
for inspiration when you need to write. i either create or i dont. if i have
to force it out i dont think its worth doing (poetry that is. other writing
deadlines like reviews are another method). yes, i like a lot of writers,
but as for going to my book shelf so i can write a poem, that seems an alien
concept, forcing inspiration.

Other books are EX-LAX to me. I don't know what I'd do without someone
else's better lines and/or their examples. It's not exactly forcing
inspiration so much as conceeding the fact that inspiration isn't always
desirable, available. Tough, true poets. Often inspiration is a con
anyway, a magic wand a hare too short. And beyond this, just because a
book is "inspirational" or "compelling" or whatever doesn't mean it'll get
words flowing. These are books that make one want to write, while the
actual writing is still another thing. THen again, I've no problem with
sampling.

I approach my bookshelf more as a resource, like a refrigerator, than as
means for forcing inspiration (books as ingredients, sure; books as meals
or snacks, but of course; as laxatives? feh!).  Since I primarily work in
collage, I literally devour texts, and so long as the language is
interesting I'm not all too picky.  I got a lot of poems out of a found
text, "German Spies at Bay," a rather jingoistic book from the 1920's
extolling the heroism of British counterespionage during WWI.  Also, a lot
of bad art inspires me, as it makes me question what can be done better.

As for comfort food:  Kafka (the short stories), Borges (especially his
collaboration with Adolfo Bioy Casares as H. Bustos Domecq), Bilge Karasu,
Jabes, Barthes, Foucault, Kristeva, Cixous, this great book of essays on
music by Al Young, "Drowning in the Sea of Love," Eduardo Galeano,
Cordwainer Smith, Alison Deming, Mrabet.  Jean Cocteau's films, also Mel
Brooks and even though he's an increasingly loathsome creep, Woody Allen.

Poets who drive me to write:

Bill Corbett
Jimmy Schuyler
Rae Armantrout
Bob Perelman
Lyn Hejinian
David Bromige
Charles Bernstein

I've been reading Corbett's Selected for the past several weeks and it's a
wonderful, amazing book. Why haven't they named the English Dept at Harvard
after the man?

In a completely different vein, I go back to my parents, Whalen, Duncan,
Olson, Spicer, Ginsberg, Creeley, Eigner, Blackburn and to my grandparents,
Ez, Gertrude, Louis, and William Carlos....

Comics:
Lenny Bruce (only entertainer that both my mother and I paid to see, tho at
different times). I can still do most of Father Flotski's Triumph by memory.
Lord Buckley
Andy Kaufman
George Bowering

Novelists:
Sterne
Pynchon
Joyce
My twins and I are reading Finnegans Wake at the moment. It's the perfect
book for five year old boys, all puzzle.
Faulkner (esp. the real stuff, not the recycled versions a la Alice Walker)
Hemingway (again, prefer the original to The English Patient)
Beckett (again, prefer the original to Carole Maso's Ava)
Langston Hughes
Michael Gold's Jews without Money
Philip K Dick, Bruce Sterling, Chip Delaney

looking for inspiration when you need to write. i either create or i dont. if
i have to force it out i dont think its worth doing (poetry that is. other
writing deadlines like reviews are another method). yes, i like a lot of
writers, but as for going to my book shelf so i can write a poem, that
seems an alien concept, forcing inspiration. >>

Actually, I think that many of us were describing a relationship between
reading & writing a bit more loosely than that of repairing to books for
the "purpose" of "causing" ourselves to be "interested" or "inspired" in
writing ourselves.  For exaample, when I said that I had written some
things in the wake of reading Ashbery (et al.), this is an after-the-fact
observation -- i.e., that while in the act of reading his words, I found
(willy-nilly!) myself inclined to write -- and the impulse / impetus to
write happened to be of sufficient strength that I actually dragged the pen
across the page.

I.e., the question can sound like "where do you turn, when you want to
cause yourself to feel like writing?" -- but I think many of us translated
this into "under what circumstances [of having read things] have you
retrospectively noted that you have felt more inclined to write something
[presumably under the "influence" of the thing(s) you were reading]?"

Walt Kelly, yes!  A book of Pogo songs of my dad's was the object I coveted
most as a kid.  Sitcoms rather than individual comedians do it for me,
especially one about a British health club occasionally aired here called
The Brittas Empire.  As for novelists:

Thomas Mann
Tomasso Landolfi
Thomas Pynchon
Willa Cather

You should, if they ever run them anymore, check out the few episodes of a
program called "The State" which ran alternately on Comedy Central and MTV
over the last couple years - some of it is brilliant sketch comedy, the
first to truly move beyond both Monty Python & SNL in its conceptions - my
personal favorite: an idiotic piece called "Froggy Jamboree," where to
members come on screen and tell the story about how the rest of the
ensemble wouldn't let them air their sketch idea during the show but were
gracious enough to let them play it over the credits, at which point the
scene cuts to the two of them in full body frog suits splashing
spasmodically in a kiddy pool while playing banjos: that's it.

Ron Silliman cites:

> Michael Gold's Jews without Money

a book I might have mentioned myself.  Last week, though--speaking of
writing that amuses us--I stumbled on something else by Michael Gold
which I first thought to pass on to you-all, as a curiosity, then
thought not (since opinions expressed are not necessarily, as they say,
those of your correspondent, and who knows, in this pixel-bath, whether
people can keep things straight).  But in light of this mention.  .  .
why the hell not.  (An interesting sidebar might be the recent _Slate_
piece on Stein's finances and Republicanism.)

Love to hear takes on this, from any angle--Ron?

Rachel

"Gertrude Stein: A Literary Idiot"

by Michael Gold

first published in _The New Masses_

Gertrude Stein recently returned to America after an absence of many
years. In Paris, where she lived as a forbidding priestess of a
strange literary cult, Gertrude Stein accumulated a salon frequented by
some of the outstanding names of the modern art world and
acquired the reputation of a literary freak. People either gaped at her
published writings, or laughed at her incomprehensible literary
epigrams- "a rose is a rose is a rose."

She was looked upon by those who believed in her as the greatest
revolutionist in the history of contemporary literature, and by
those who scoffed as the perpetrator of a gigantic literary hoax.

As it happens, neither of the two opinions is wholly correct. Her
"revolution" resembles a literary putsch, and if her writing is "a
hoax" nevertheless she earnestly believes in it.

In essence, what Gertrude Stein's work represents is an example of the
most extreme subjectivism of the contemporary bourgeois
artist, and a reflection of the ideological anarchy into which the whole
of bourgeois literature has fallen.

What was it that Gertrude Stein set out to do with literature? When one
reads her work it appears to resemble the monotonous
gibberings of paranoiacs in the private wards of asylums. It appears to
be a deliberate irrationality, a deliberate infantilism.
However, the woman's not insane, but possessed of a strong, clear,
shrewd mind. She was an excellent medical student, a brilliant
psychologist, and in her more "popular" writings one sees evidence of
wit and some wisdom.

And yet her works read like the literature of the students of padded
cells in Matteawan.

Example: "I see the moon and the moon sees me. God bless the moon and
God bless me and this you see remember me. In this
way one fifth of the bananas were bought."

The above is supposed to be a description of how Gertrude Stein feels
when she sees Matisse, the French modernist painter. It
doesn't make sense. But this is precisely what it is supposed to do- not
"make sense" in the normal meaning of the term.

.. The generation of artists of which Gertrude Stein is the most erratic
figure arduously set out not to "make sense" in their literature.
They believed that the instincts of man were superior to the reasonings
of the rational mind. They believed in intuition as a higher
form of learning and knowledge. Therefore, many of them wrote only about
what they dreamed, dream literature. Others practised
a kind of "automatic writing" where they would sit for hours scribbling
the random, subconscious itchings of their souls. They
abandoned themselves to the mystic irrationalities of their spirits in
order to create works of art which would be expressions of the
timeless soul of man, etc. The result unfortunately revealed their souls
as astonishingly childish or imbecile.

The literary insanity of Gertrude Stein is a deliberate insanity which
arises out of a false conception of the nature of art and of the
function of language.

A leisure class, which exists on the labor of others, which has no
function to perform in society except the clipping of investment
coupons, develops ills and neuroses. It suffers perpetually from
boredom. Their life is stale to them. Tasteless, inane, because it has
no meaning. They seek new sensations, new adventures constantly in order
to give themselves feelings.

The same process took place with the artists of the leisure class.
Literature also bored them. They tried to suck out of it new
sensations, new adventures.

They destroyed the common use of language. Normal ways of using words
bored them. They wished to use words in a new,
sensational fashion. They twisted grammar, syntax. They went in for
primitive emotions, primitive art. Blood, violent death, dope
dreams, soul-writhings, became the themes of their works.

In Gertrude Stein, art became a personal pleasure, a private hobby, a
vice. She did not care to communicate because essentially
there was nothing to communicate. She had no responsibility except to
her own inordinate cravings. She became the priestess of a
cult with strange literary rites, with mystical secrets.

In this light, one can see that to Gertrude Stein and to the other
artists like her, art exists in the vacuum of a private income. In order
to pursue the kind of art, in order to be the kind of artist Gertrude
Stein is, it is necessary to live in that kind of society which will
permit one to have a private income from wealthy parents or sound
investments. With this as a basis, you can write as you please.
You can destroy language, mutilate grammar, rave or rant in the name of
the higher knowledge. Nobody will disturb you. And in
time perhaps you can impress or intimidate a certain number of critics
and win a kind of reputation.

Gertrude Stein has won the reputation. She returns home to America after
an absence of thirty-one years to find herself an object of
curious respect by book clubs and lecture societies, and front page news
for the newspapers.

Which seems to me to be proof that with enough money and enough
persistence a madman can convince a world of his sanity.
Gertrude Stein appears to have convinced America that she is a genius.

But Marxists refuse to be impressed with her own opinion of herself.
They see in the work of Gertrude Stein extreme symptoms of
the decay of capitalist culture. They view her work as the complete
attempt to annihilate all relations between the artist and the
society in which he lives.

They see in her work the same kind of orgy and spiritual abandon that
marks the life of the whole leisure class.

What else does her work resemble more than the midnight revels of a
stockbroker throwing a pent-house party for a few intimate
friends? Would it be possible to have either of these symptoms of
degeneration except in a society divided into classes? Is there not
an "idle art" just as there is an "idle rich"? Both do nothing but
cultivate the insanity of their own desires, both cultivate strange
indulgences. The literary idiocy of Gertrude Stein only reflects the
madness of the whole system of capitalist values. It is part of the
signs of doom that are written largely everywhere on the walls of
bourgeois society.

Again--
as the poster of the "ashbery influence" post everyone is responding to--
(I think)....

..everyone's cutting off the only part in my post that allows it to make
any sense: I was questioning the implication someone'd made that JA was
influential on *mainstream* writing practices.

Bronk like all the others mentioned by sundry, is still a *bit* outside
the major rewards and kudos the academic mainstream confers, to be a
counter-example to what I was saying...I think

When my daughter was about eight, she confided in me, somewhat shyly,
that for years she had thought Richard Nixon was a comedian, because
"whenever he came on TV, everyone laughed."

Any list of people who have deeply amused me would have to include:
Jessica Mitford (esp. in _Daughters and Rebels_ and in person, talking
about the funeral industry); J. Edgar Hoover (esp. in drag); Mel Brooks
(esp. "The Producers"); Rip Torn (on Larry Sanders); Kafka; Woody Allen
as Kafka in _Without Feathers_ (not the movies though); early live Steve
Martin; Richard Pryor live and at the top of his form; Walt Kelly;
Madeline Kahn (esp. as Lili von Shtupp); Monty Python (chapel scene in
"The Meaning of Life": "Forgive us, O Lord, for this our dreadful
toadying. And barefaced flattery. But you are so strong and, well, just
so super"); Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie; Mike Myers as Dieter, host of
"Sprockets"; Dan Aykroyd as Bob Dole; George Bowering as dominatrix;
David Bromige as God; Jane Curtin as Pat Nixon. . .

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  Still reeling from the assassination of
Gianni Versace and now the newscasters are saying it might be Andrew
Cunanan who killed him.

Anyway yesterday I was reading "USA Today" and saw the article about the UK
poet Murray Lachlan Young with the "face of Daniel Day Lewis" and the "hair
of Jim Morrison" and how his various poetic contracts amount to
$2,000,000.00 (translated to US money).  Is anyone on the Poetics List
familiar with this man's work?  Please fill me in.

Also was drawn to USA Today's coverage of the new memoir by Erik Estrada,
"My Road from Harlem to Hollywood."  I guess in the book Erik Estrada is
kind of tough on his former partner on "CHiPs," Larry Wilcox.  "Asked about
Erik Estrada's recollections of their 'CHiPs' days in "My Road from Harlem
to Hollywood," former castmate Larry Wilcox, now head of a TV production
company and a software company called MediaCore, replied via electronic
mail.  Here is an excerpt:

"To respond to Erik's perceptions would be a litany of material on
philosophy and morals combined with what Jacques Derrida refers to as the
malady of subjective perception."  Only those perhaps who ever saw an
episode of "CHiPs" will understand my shock, the way my eyes bugged out of
my head while reading this.  And it goes on and on.

I've been out of touch with the Poetics List lately and in an awful slump
but did want to second Bennett Simpson's recommendation of Dennis Cooper's
new novel "Guide" which I enjoyed no end.  Actually Bennett Simpson feels
less enthusiastic about this book than I do: "I started it this week and
it's not inspiring, not titilllllllating, obliquely critical, kinda
nauseating and very far from my reality (does this make me a stump?). The
dustjacket is calling him the new Genet. Well, huh. The characters are
boring (but maybe not as much as they're supposed to be). I do like some
of the stylistic tics however. Flatness going places."  Some other books I
have liked lately are biographies, Helen Sheehy's book on Eva Le Gallienne,
Margot Peters' life of May Sarton, John Felstiner's "Paul Celan: Poet,
Survivor, Jew," and Hertzel Weinstat & Bert Wechsler's book "Dear Rogue,"
the life of the US baritone Lawrence Tibbett.  (Although it has a dreadful
opening line: "Most of us, when our course is run, deserve the anonymity of
the grave.  Not so Lawrence Tibbett . . .")  Jackson Benson's life of
Wallace Stegner is horrible.  One other book I read at Naropa was Mary
Butts' novel "Armed with Madness."  This one I give 5 stars.  I meant to
post here my diary of what it was like to spend a week at Naropa but every
sentence I wrote sounded just like Mary Butts.  So there's influence for
you!  Or, maybe, the "malady of subjective perception."

Thanks, everyone.

i'll put in the name of Jean Shepherd--a man who anticiapted much. As a kid
listened to his 10:15-11pm radio show on WOR/NYC-- 45 minutes of free-form
talking, kazoo playing and general nuttiness. his books of short stories
are still in print and his "xmas story"movie based on his stories is now a
xmas perenial. in 50's was ur-hipster, called his audience the night people
and they answered john cassavettes on air appeal for monet, which financed

The yoking of Bronk to Ashbery I find odd. I think their
sensibilities are worlds apart. First there is the simple matter
of length. Bronk’s poems are shorter, quirky & pithy.
Ashbery's longwinded, multi-layered, digressive. Bronk has an
oblique and perverse approach to his subject; often his work
seems to be an argument with the world. (I’m reminded here
of a recorded interview in which I don’t think Bronk agreed
with a single assertion the interviewer made about his poetry.)
The Ashbery poem is often evasive, opaque--the poem is much
less an explanation than an desultory exploration. Anyway,
these are just a few of my random musings on their poetries.

George: that's unfair. Canucks have their comedians too: still alive (we
think): Lucien Bouchard, Jean Chretien, Mike Harris, Preston Manning (who
sat at the feet of another great comedian in the US [I realize this list
really confuses most of the poetics readers] -- then House Majority leader,
oops, but I cant think of his name only his appearance as a small bomb in
doonesbury), my own provincial premier Ralph Klein, GB's own provincial
premier, Glenn Clark.

Prose writers: Oh I'm so happy kali tal mentioned delany, russ, & such
like, as I have a whole bunch of sf writers I'd mention: a few include
those two, Ursula K Le Guin, Brian Aldiss, Iain M Banks, Alfred Bester,
John Crowley, Gwyneth Jones, & many others, but not all as 'influences,'
since some are fairly recent discoveries; rather, as with George again,
that I read them for pleasure.

I have certainly been indebted on some level or other to many of those
already named, but again the canuck connection comes to bear: gosh, George
Bowering is there; Leonard Cohen, Timothy Findlay, Robert Kroetsch, Daphne
Marlatt, bpNichol (for everything), Michael Ondaatje, Audrey Thomas, + the
famous ones. Just for beginners.

Guy Davenport as both critic & fiction writer ever since i first discovered him.

This is an impossible question, of course. What do we mean 'influenced'? I
pick the hearts & brains of every new interesting text I read.... Dont you?

Sun & Moon Press once again has several new
titles just published, which we are willing to
offer members of the Poetics List for a 20%
discount.

DRA-- by Stacey Levine.

Levine won the PEN-West Award for fiction for
her first book, the 1993 collection of stories,
MY HORSE AND OTHER STORIES. She's a young and
very talented writer, living in Seattle, but soon
be teaching at Illinois State University in Normal
next year (she's a temporary replacement for David
Foster Wallace). This new work, her first longer
fiction, is an incredible dystopia, in which the
title character inhabits a drab and reary world of
utter dread. Through a Kafka-like lens Levine
explores how the meek and sane are made mad in a
society that demands choices that only lead to less
and less individual choice and control.  Paperback
$11.95.

EVERYTHING THAT RISES MUST CONVERGE, by John Jesurun

Influenced by Hitchock, Gertrude Stein, The Wooster
Group, and Richard Foreman, John Jesurun began to
produce his own theatrical pieces in the early 1980s
His legendary, fifty-episode theater piece, CHANG IN A
VOID MOON, began performances in 1982-1983 as 36 half-
hour installments. CHANG was followed by other pieces,
DOG'S EYE VIEW at La Mama, and NUMBER MINUS ONE at the
Performing Garage, as well as several others.
   EVERYTHING THAT RISES MUST CONVERGE was first performed
at the Walker Arts Center in minneapolis and then at the
Kitchen in New York, and his one of his major theater
pieces.
   Jesurun was awarded a MacArthur grant in 1996 for his
dramatic writings.  Paperback $11.95


THE CAPTAIN OF THE BUTTERFLIES, by Cees Nooteboom

Nooteboom is currently one of the major fiction writers
and poets in Europe, and has been suggested several times
for a Nobel Prize. His fictions, published by Harcourt,
Brace, have received great attention in the US. And he
recently published a personal travel book about Spain to
great review attention
   THE CAPTAIN OF THE BUTTERFLIES is the first publication
in English of a large selection of his poetry. The result
is a wonderful writing of enery and wit, in which surrealist-
like images are presented in dialogue in precise, realistic
language.  Paperback $11.95


THE LIBRARY OF THOMAS RIVKA, by Martin Nakell

Well known in the Los Angeles poetry scene, Martin Nakell
has toured the US several times, and is now touring Europe.
THE LIBRARY OF THOMAS RIVKA is a short fiction exploring
various ideas, philosophical and pratical, about an entire
library of books--how to classify them, how to order them,
their bindings, their markings, and what their being within
the same library means, how they "communicate" with one
another. Suggesting other such fictions by figures from
JK Huysmans to Jorge Luis Borges, this book is an absurdly
humorous work.  Paperback $11.95

THE BOOK OF WHO ARE WAS, by Benjamin Hollander

San Francisco poet Bejamin Holland negotiates a past and
present with poets such as Paul Celan, Edmond Jabes, and
Anne-Marie Albiach in the projection of "memory on stage."
Recognizing poetry as a theatrical field, a performance
so to speak, THE BOOK OF WHO ARE WAS contemplates the
process of poetic creation in which it is actually the
reader's or spectator's memory that is projected upon the
stage or text. A must for anyone interested in contemporary
poetry.  Paperback $10.95

inspiring?What comedians do people find inspiring?What comedians do people

        I all honesty & innocence I protest: Inspiration is one thing--& I
don't doubt the urge to take pen in hand might come from a particularly good
comedy routine--but do you really find all the comedians mentioned so far
*funny*? JESUS!! I mean I like to think I have at least a LIVELY if not KEEN
sense of humor, but none of that standup mainstream hollywood culture crap
makes me laugh!
        OKOK I can see Chaplin & Keaton, for the intellectual elegance, but
that televised slapshhtk just doesn't come off. And those interminable
"sarcastic" gambling-hall clowns--O they tick me off! Standup latenite
talkshowhost reactionary crap!

        Bob & Ray - yes I remember them from one quiet season on public
radio in New Hampshire -- I guess I thought that was sorta funny.
        And I confess the friendship between Lamont & Sanford can inspire a
chuckle. And Carol O'Connor, who, by the by, is quite a Joyce scholar, &
friendly, so I've heard, with Richard Ellman...

        I worked on a production by the Trinity Players in Dublin, doing
"Endgame" & have never laughed so consitently, loudly, at such length, with
such spirit, or so honestly in my life, night after night. Guts split. Every
*single* line of "Endgame", "Waiting for Godot" and the novels of the
Trilogy can get a laugh.

Fictionalists: Cervantes, Sterne, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Poe, Crane, Woolfe, my
great granduncle Allan Paton, Cather,  O'Connor (Flannery this time),
Baldwin, Banks (_Affliction_, _Hamilton Stark_)...

Allegorists: Bunyan, McCarthy (_Suttree_ & before), Antin

When writing poems & I need a break & to spark new words I inevitably turn
to: Milton, Rimbaud, Creeley, Walcott, Jordan or Brusenbrugge (spelled from
a poor memory)


When writing, I always listen to: McCoy Tyner, particularly "African
Village," "The Greeting," "Song for My Lady," "Ebony Queen," "Sahara,"
"Smitty's Place"...

Often inspired by Werner Herzog's movies. I can't watch any of those without
writing about them for days afterward. "Before the Rain" was very
inspirational as well; and Cassavettes' (spelled from a poor memory) "Shadows"

Thoughts on the Gold piece on Stein: it would be interesting to hear what
Gold might say about William James - just another bored capitilist?
Probably not b/c Gold seems to have that love historically common in
Marxists, the love of science & scientific method, of technology, almost
in spite of themselves - Gold shows it in his incredulity toward Stein's
past: what? she was a physician, a psychologist, and she's come to this?
In fact, Stein, it seems to me, always considered her work highly
applicable, highly "pragmatic" in the Jamesian fashion; believed in its
ability to influence and stretch the social fabric, which is to say,
believed in the connection  btwn linguistic and social flexibility.  Of
course Gold's having none of it:

"But Marxists refuse to be impressed with her own opinion of herself.
They see in the work of Gertrude Stein extreme symptoms of
the decay of capitalist culture. They view her work as the complete
attempt to annihilate all relations between the artist and the
society in which he lives."

This is the crossroads at which Jameson sits himself down, right?  Except
he has to be a good deal more sophisticated than Gold, post
post-structuralism, in dealing w/ the function of language-games in
culture.  Anyway, thanks for posting this, very interesting.  -m.

See me nodding and nodding in agreement.  This week's writing for me:  it
started with a response to the Jorie Graham article in the New Yorker,
trying to examine a close observation of the physical world and the impulse
to take that to preciousness, now to undercut the preciousness, then
there's AMC's playing of the Johnny Weismuller Tarzan movies which excite
me to no end, in particular this week _Tarzan and His Mate_ and _Tarzan
Finds a Child_, and then there's this marvelous book I got out of the
Naropa library which I just mailed back yesterday:  _Autobiography of a
Schizophrenic Girl_, one of those books that's so great you want to
memorize it.

When Dennis Cooper briefly taught private writing workshops in Los Angeles,
one of his students told me that Dennis' workshop was very much about
influence and his take on it was to go with what really strikes *you* (be
it your favorite rock album, whatever) rather than what is held to be
Acceptable influences.  This is one area in which Kevin K. has been most
influencial on me--the spirit of adventure in which Doris Day is just as
valid an influence as Walter Benjamin.

Matthias --

I sympathize with your apprehension vis a vis comedians. But I think
really very funny comedy (Jarry? at least some of the comics listed here
over the past couple days?) is as strong a solvent of one's grimy limits
as any poetry -- which is not to propose that poetry isn't allowed to be
funny; on the contrary, it seems something like a tenet of the poetry in
this list's collective consciousness that _laughter indicates perception_.
Of course once you recognize _that_, it's even more of a battle to keep
from being _jokey_, which is as far from funny as you can get, though the
two are in practice usually undistinguished.

But I think a disdain for "mainstream" humor may safely be assumed here?

I mean indistinguishable, or maybe I mean that the distinction goes
unremarked.

Speaking of the New Yorker -- what's with Anthony Lane? Is it a nom de
plume of Martin Amis or what?

Are there critics -- NOT theorists -- the readers of the list trust more?
Geoffrey O'Brien's essays are always welcome in my book bag.. and I wish
Frank Rich would go back to writing about plays -- he's
uncomfortable-seeming on the op-ed pages. Can't say enough good things
about Neil Strauss.

Dickens, Conrad, and Beckett usually divert me to write poetry.  The great
variety of their sentence-shapes and their impeccable timing can get me going
for a piece of scrap paper and something to write with.  I wish Stein's prose
would do same.  Sometimes Joyce does.

As for the comics, I'm afraid that I was a sucker for the brilliant marketing
idea of the Marvel Universe elaborated by Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and their
descendents in the superhero genre, like John Byrne.  Tie-ins, cameos,
cross-overs, origin stories, serial plots, operatic mythology, graphical and
typographical stylistics: it all kept me buying, collecting, assembling the
ephemera into my own hand-picked coherence.  It later sent me looking to George
Herriman, Walt Kelly, and Winsor McCay in reproduction, which set me wondering
in earnest about the difference between a comic strip and a comic book.  My
most intense experience of language as a kid during the 1970s was provided by the
lay-out of words in the boxes, polygons, and ellipses of comics.  No wonder
pomo seems so strangely familiar.  Buy on!

Yup. Often, I think, we write in a sort of oblique dialogue with the poetry,
the language, what-have-you, that's already out there. Sometimes Chaucer
talks to me, sometimes I talk to him.

well there's turning the question around a bit

possibly James Tate (in an exceedingly deadpan manner)?

likely Rod Smith (under some circumstances) . . .

there's just two, but the possibilities are large

I remember him!  I was at SFU in 69-70 studying dance (after
English/poetry degree in CA).  I didn't have classes from him but was

You may have heard this before: the situation is still pretty dire,
however, and I'm forwarding this on behalf of "Friends of the Grolier";
purely on principle, I hate to see any independent close--especially
after losing several fine ones in New York. I'm sure other suggestions
would be welcomed.

---------------------

        You must know The Grolier Bookstore in Cambridge, MA--the ONLY
bookstore in the English speaking world devoted exclusively to poetry
and prose by poets.  Luisa's been the proprietor since 1973, and she is
in urgent need of help, or the Grolier will close in September.  She
must raise $50,000.  Thusfar $40,000 has been raised.  She's not a
non-profit, so as yet, this is not a tax write-off.  If you can help,
here's what we propose:  call Luisa at 1-800-234-POEM and open an account
with her, paying whatever you can in now, and then buying books from that
account after six months or a year.  This means she would benefit from an
advance from you of $100, $200 or whatever amount, large or small, and
you'll get books eventually (unless she goes out of business).  We're
trying to prevent that.  Please call her if you can.  Any amount would be
helpful.  Forward this message to any poets, writers, readers or poetry
supporters you might know...

And thank you so much!

The essay, "Fossilized Fish and the World of Unknowing: John Ashbery and
William Bronk," by John Ernest (to be found in _The Tribe of John_, edited
by yours truly), is actually about the non-influence of Ashbery on Bronk.
It's a good essay, one with a sense of humor about it.

this isnt going to be comprehensive. I keep remembering more names as i
continue reading your postings. and yes what is mainstream humor, an
oxymoron? Is it Dana Gioia reading his poem about a kitty in heat, "Come
into the garden, Fred"? Another line I recall : "I'm wearing nothing but my
flea-collar". The slight shock of "Fred" for those oldfashioned enough to
expect "Maud" made me laugh, the first time. The wit of analogy abt
nakedness was okay, too. I guess it is what we are calling "jokey"?  But
it's easy to make me laugh. I even laugh at my own work sometimes. I spent
an evening with John Ashbery taking turns at reading aloud the works of
William MacGonnigal, touted as "the worst poet who ever wrote." It's bathos
at its best.

Evelyn Waugh is funny in a way no one else is (In the earlier novels). I am
a sucker for British humor. Dudley Moore & Peter Cook in "Bedazzled"--the
scene where Cook plays God (atop a pillarbox) to show Moore (who has to run
around the box praising Cooke) just why he (Cooke) got so bored with being
an angel in heaven & chose to become the devil instead. Peter Sellers in
"The Party", in a probably P.I. role as a person from the subcontinent
(India/Pakistan) saying "birdy num-nums" inadvertently over the intercom, &
otherwise making gaffes; or in the Pink Panther movie where he disguises
himself as the Swiss dentist (actually, as Einstein) in order to pull
Herbert Lom's tooth : the nitrous oxide is inhaled by both of them, with
(to me) hilarious result. But is this brit or american humor? it was made
in the usa. So was chaplin.

 American humor is terrific, & I agree with Rachel, early live Steve
Martin--it doesnt get any funnier than that, though it doesnt always hold
up today, probably because Martin's humor was transgressive in a
meta-comedy way, & that has now (thanks in part to Sm's pomo sensibility
showing the way) been caught up with. As for Woody Allen, I know he is
loathed for going "uptown" & for non-applicable-to-comedy reasons, but it
was pretty funny to see him attempt to rob a bank with a misspelled note.

 Has anyone named Mark Twain yet? With a stance like that, he cd come back
today & continue his deconstructions.

Stephen Wright's "it's a small world.........But I wouldn't want to paint
it" shows, like so much of his work, a sound grasp of the use of silence.
Such education in the laconic can readily spill over into poetry.

We Canadians are proud of our comedians--maybe being in yet not of the
American thing makes for good funny commentary. And of course, they had to
move south of the 49th to make it big. (Except for George Bowering).
Perhaps not everyone on this list knows the work of Stephen Leacock.
Sometimes it's a bit arch & labored, but in the classic _Sunshine Sketches
of a Little Town__ you find his (like they say) unique brand of humor in
spades. I'd be interested in backchanneling with anyone who'll attempt an
analysis of its workings. It works in part, I think, by puffing up then
deflating pretensions of the provincial sort (& hey, what arent?)

Henry James is a master of the shaggy dog punchline. Recall in _The
Ambassadors__ when the Pococks are coming, that we are told of Lambert
Strether, who hAd checked for a wire from them the day before only to find
none, that today when he checks there is one, to the effect that they will
shortly be in Paris where he is, "So, if yesterday he had occasion for a
small disappointment, today he had occasion for its opposite" ? (I'm
paraphrasing here). Hmm. Had he been living in england a while when he
wrote that?

Creeley is pretty damn funny--a story (in _The Gold Diggers_ ) that begins
"To work was to pray. He worked" -- or the poem "My wife & I lived all
alone. Contention was our only bone. I fought with her, she fought with me,
& things went on right merrily"...are xtreme instances of the yankee p-o-v
that informs much of his work. But its not only yankee, isnt RC close to
being Irish?

And there's none like the Irish for a good laugh, & I second Matthias
Regan's nomination of Beckett as the funniest author available. His people
are crippled or dying, in incredibly straitened circumstance, echoes
(pre-echoes, uncannily, sometimes) of the displaced persons wandering
europe for years during/after ww 2, & it is always side-splittingly funny.
There's a perpetual undercutting-- witness _Malone Dies__ . And yet never a
feeling that such persons/conditions are being laughed at in a patronizing
way.

Peter Quartermain's paper delivered at the Blaser Conference, on how
laughter returns us to our bodies, has been with me ever since I heard it,
as explanation (& a justification) of & for humor's place in "serious"
literature. I _think_ it's called "Out of the Frying Pan". I dont know if
its been published anywhere yet.

Well thats enough of that. David

No, wrong. It's a 500-sheet book about Main St. that is printed backwards.

Rachel Loden wrote of several great comic moments, including:

>Rachel L.

Perhaps the greatest skit in the history of poetry took place on this SNL
setpiece: Dieter introduced "the Great American Poet of the Abyss, Jimmy
Stewart." Dana Carvey came out and read some of those "my loyal dog" poems
that the now-defunct Stewart read on the tonight show (sorry, I can't quote
them from memory, and my copy is not at hand), and then explained to the
rapt Dieter that "I wrote that poem while hitchhiking through South America
with a 14 year old Mexican whore. One morning I woke up in a pool of my own
sick and found out she robbed me. . ."  Suggestions of a darker side to
Jimmy Stewart's poetic persona.

Ah, TV time... I've had moments when I thought "Seinfeld" was the greatest
thing on TV. But the show's clearly in a slump and they ought to just pack
it in. The Simpsons rule, of course, and yet - their once subversive edge is
playing more and more into the regular sitcom formula of jokes rounded off
by some pious moral.

Those Conan bits do sound good, Jordan. But that's way past my bedtime. And

        I think we mostly agree: as I hope the anecdote about "Endgame" suggests,
I am not trying to make any kind of hi-brow/lo-brow distinction or to
suggest that poetry or any other art form should be hilarious as hell when
desired/required.
        But at the same time I'm not sure the metaphor of poetry as solvent works
for me, except possibly in as much as a solvent allows substances (colors
of paint maybe) to mix--and I suppose that mixture IS a vital aspect of
many jokes. Still I guess I don't think of poetry as providing relief in
specifically that way.

        How are you distinguishing them?
        Intention?
        Need? Circumstance?

        On my part, O absolutely. Mainstream at least as it describes Letterman
and George Carlin and "2nd City" and "The Captial Steps". Of course jokes
are mainstream in a different sense--they strike me as one of the few
pervasive & widespread (popular) original bits of "folk culture" left. For
example, I have almost never actually heard people not termed "specialists"
invent songs in response to current events, but I have first-hand heard
jokes materialize "on the street" in response to the same.

Friends,

I want to add my two or three cents to Mr. Prejsnar's very interesting post
of the other day about the position of younger poets in respect to the
mainstream and the experimental.  In his post Mr. Prejsnar closes with:

I have sympathy with your feeling that there is much more, beyond what's been
done, for younger poets to reach toward.  But: 1. to just abstractly shrug
off what was done in the 70s and 80s could risk being just fashion-mangering;
2. if there's any truth or utility to a given group of theoretical insights
ya gotta go *thru* them to get to your next step, and neither go around 'em,
nor retreat back from them...

Please forgive me if some of this territory has already been tread upon.
 I've been out of the loop for a few months and only just recently began to
read these posts again.  At any rate, thinking about Mr. Prejsnar's post, I
was re-reading Richard Silberg's article in the June/July 1997 issue of
Poetry Flash in which he suggests that "the center itself is starting to
break up, to shift and slide."  Then he examines some recent work by three
poets-Brenda Hillman, Jane Miller, and Jorie Graham-whom he considers to more
or less represent "the American mainline," using these three as examples of
this supposed shift from center.  Then he ends his essay with this:

As I'm sure you've noticed, all three of these poets are women.  I wanted to
pull in some experimental, mainline-based men to balance this review out, but
I couldn't come up with any.  I was talking it over with Joyce Jenkins,
editor and publisher of these pages [Poetry Flash], and she felt that it's
women today who are doing the feelingful poetic experimenting, that male
experimental poets, whether mainline-based, Language-based, or postmodernists
somewhere 'in between', tend more to be what we could call head poets or
maybe poets of power.  I'm resisting that idea, for obvious reasons, but I'm
having trouble refuting it.  What do you think?

Well, I think that I am a 33 year old male writer who is, I guess, "somewhere
'in between'."  (I'm not really sure though.)  One time, about three or four
years ago, after a reading here in Berkeley I was at a bar with Lyn Hejinian
and some other folks of my generation and I asked to no one in particular,
"Am I a 'language' poet?"  Then, interestingly, Lyn shot back, "Am I?"

At any rate, these many years later, I can decidedly say that I am not a
"laguage" writer.  That would be an impossibility.  I'm too young.  But, I do
come at poetry from the margins, and for as long as I've been writing
experimentally, practically all of my writing career-after doing a stint in
graduate school at UCSD and becoming a member of what Ron Silliman calls "the
San Diego Mafia"-I've been concerned with the issue of audience.  That is,
though I think of myself as an experimental writer, one who cut his writing
teeth on the likes of Barrett Watten, Ron Silliman, and Charles Bernstein, I
want to write poems that, say, my gramma can read and not simply respond to
them by saying either, "That's nice, honey" or worse, "I can't read this.  It
doesn't make sense."

Of late I've been increasingly concerned with this problem of audience,
especially in one particular way that it manifests itself:  the inability of
the mainstream to converse with the experimental.  I've even embarked on a
project of writing a series of volumes of occasional poems, poems written for
particular individuals (mostly non-poets who, I'd guess, would politically
represent the mainstream) on particular occasions (weddings, birthdays,
deaths etc.).  I hope not only that the people for whom I've written these
poems can read them with pleasure, I also hope that poets and editors and
teachers from the center would also be able to.  Some few of you on this list
have, I know, seen or heard some of these poems.  While I think of these
poems as experimental in that they, for the most part, fragment narrative,
eschew representation, mess with conventional syntax, they're written for
real people out there, so there's something in them that makes them, I think,
really mainstream and therefore, I hope, infinitely readable. That is, I hope
the poems, at once, embrace difficulty while also seducing the lazy reader.
Since I'm pretty darn shy and hardly ever post, and since most of you have
never heard of me, never seen my work (I've got an O Book and a chapbook from
Pasquale Verdicchio's The Parenthesis Writing Series), I'll post for you here
one of these occasional poems to which I'm referring, so you can see what I
mean.  (Forgive me for tooting my own horn here.)  Okay, here goes:

   Still and All

-for Marta, a valentine

Outside, the streaked kitchen window
beyond our wrought iron
grill work, detachable

in case of earthquake, fire
events, cataclysmic
by law required avenues of escape;

branchlets of willow confused and menacing
in winter seeming dead, crumpled
impossible even to imagine, ever

quickening; now
again, doused by early spring rain
against the torn and soggy pages

of some Sunday morning read-out
of the sky's hard fact littered with slate and steel

banks of cloud and breaths, drawn

anew, small
and tender

trembled, buds in gusts
pinking;

and I think of such mornings when empty pavement meant
a parking lot, the aroma of coffee and sweet jam
permeated the margins, emerging

from night's draped coma, the cold sheets
rose around your soft figure, if it please

you may, shouldering
the idea recorded of a late winter dawn-

that voice, mouth
and kisses

when you used to call me, baby.


As this poem demonstrates (I hope...), if I were to place myself and my work
on a poetics numberline, with -10 being stridently conventional and +10 being
wildly experimental, I think I'd say that my poetics are up at 10 but my
work, increasingly, hovers at around 5 or so (this poem, for example, is
quite lyrical, indulges in a romantic appostrophe, utilizes various phonic
techniques, treats the line in a fairly conventional manner and on and on).
But it's still experimental or avant garde or whatever, influenced by "L"
writing, right?

Now, I wonder, where would you all place yourselves on my -10 to +10
continuum? (I'm serious. I want to know.)  Is a discrepancy between one's
poetics and one's actual poems an unforgivable problem, a selling out of the
politics of the great "L" project?  Am I doing a Clinton and, evil critter
that I am, trying with my work to centralize the radical left?  Is there
something wrong if you, like me, find yourself interested in writing poems
that gramma can read and enjoy?  And what if you're a man and find yourself
interested in what Richard Silberg describes as "a feelingful poetic
experimenting"?  Does that mean that you're, as Mr. Prejsnar describes, going
"around" the theoretical insights of the 'language' writers  rather than
going "thru" them?  Or worse, "retreat[ing] back from them"?  What role does
gender play in all this anyway?  I look forward to your responses.

Thanks for your time,

Scott Bentley

Andy Kaufman was wonderful. Some years ago there was piece in Esquire
detailing, among other things, how he created his own weird private comic
universe in his room as a child.

And I still think often on Buckley on the Bard: "the bad jazz a cat blows
wails on long after he's been cut out"

You should, if they ever run them anymore, check out the few episodes of a
program called "The State" which ran alternately on Comedy Central and MTV
over the last couple years - some of it is brilliant sketch comedy, the
first to truly move beyond both Monty Python & SNL in its conceptions - my
personal favorite: an idiotic piece called "Froggy Jamboree," where to
members come on screen and tell the story about how the rest of the
ensemble wouldn't let them air their sketch idea during the show but were
gracious enough to let them play it over the credits, at which point the
scene cuts to the two of them in full body frog suits splashing
spasmodically in a kiddy pool while playing banjos: that's it.

I dunno. One day in Toronto I took him to my favourite bar and i cracked 22
jokes, and he didnt crack one.
Then I took him to the Longhouse bookstore to show him some typical
Canadian poetry. I made him look at a few pages of a book by Steve
McCaffery. When I wasnt looking (he thought) he put the book back and wiped
his wingers on his shirt.
I thought that was funny, but he wasnt cracking a joke.

Douglas, why don't you reprint

BEAN SPASMS by Berrigan, Padgett & Brainard -- my copy disappeared many
moves ago and I have always wanted to replace it, not possible.

also, why not reprint

ALL MEN ARE BROTHERS, translation of classic Chinese novel by Pearl Buck,
which Kenneth Rexroth described as "a classic of American prose" which it
is, despite problems with the text she used for translation and other
factors, still it is a great American version of a very great Chinese
original,

and also, why not reprint the first three Harry Mathews novels, namely,

TLOOTH
The Conversions
The Sinking of the Odrachek Stadium


& for the list, what else that's out of print that should be back in print?

some related points to the gold piece:

gold strikes a similar pose to the one struck by various artists and
writers who published their rebuttals to stein's portrayal of them in the
*Autobiography*.  in a special supplement to *transition*, a little
magazine which often published stein's work in the 1920s, stein and her
*Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas* were the subject of derision,
chastisement, correction, and ridicule.  in one rant, the author (i can't
remember who) accused her of never really knowing what the
artistic/social/political ferment around her was really about it.  the
general feeling expressed was that stein had unfairly profited from her
association with them.

gold's accusations that stein is a "literary idiot" by the exploitation of
a so-called "primitive" or childlike language echoes, oddly enough, ts
eliot's review (among others) of stein's work.

what's also interesting about gold's presentation of stein is that he's
the only one i've ever encountered who claimed that stein was an
"excellent medical student" or "a brilliant psychologist."  a look at her
transcripts shows that she struggled after her first year in med school,
and the record of her career as a "psychologist" is, i believe, best shown
in the literary works gold eschews.  michael magee is right to note the
petulance of gold's complaint that her literary work falls short of the
promise that her scientific start hinted at.

despite my general disagreement with much of gold's article, i do think
he's on to something in terms of noting what is often missing in much
stein criticism.  to focus exclusively on the linguistic play of stein's
writing is, i think, to make of her work a bourgeois parlor game.  (jeremy
green has written of needing to recover the dialectic of her writing.)

Dear Dodie Belamy + Kevin Killian, et al.

Okay, Dennis Cooper does deserve more than I gave him in another post. I
agree with Dodie that his ability to cull influence from the "everyday" is
pretty great. Rock bands, specific porn titles, carpet burns --all are
used fluidly, an abject object world parallel to metaphysics (not allegory
though, in that objecta and idea both merit equal over-exposure). I think
my reluctance to Cooper comes from the aura of "transgressiveness" foisted
on him by publishing/media machines. Need to get through the hype. On
their own (is there such a thing as "on their own" with material like
this?), passages like the following *are* fairly powerful if the reader is
willing to dance around a mess of cultural baggage and false difficulties:

"In Chris' fantasy, he's a ten year-old lost in some forest. He sees a
cabin with sweetly lit windows, and knocks. A monster of some sort invites
him inside. As soon as the door shuts, the monster tears Chris's clothes
off, ties him down on a bed, and tortures him for hours and hours. Then
they fuck, and as the monster comes, he brings out a machete and hacks
Chris's head off. That's making a long story short." (_Guide_ 41-42)

Or maybe passages like this are powerful exactly becasue of messy cultural
baggage and false difficulties. Cooper is a great acrobat, regardless of
how his writing makes the reader feel ("nauseated," put-out,
de-sexualized, over-mediated). I don't want to think aobut Cooper's
"intent" or if "shock" is purposed specifically by him. That's a rut to
get in.

un-seem-ly,

Bennett

no, seriously. i think over the last coupla years i've grasped the
difference bwteen "mainstream" and "alternative" poetries, but in the realm
of humor, i gotta say, i don't know what it is, but i know what i like, and
it's lenny and the marxes,etc.  and i still remember listening to firesign
theatre's "beat the reaper" routine on boston's "underground station" as a
high school kid, alone in my room with only my latin homework to keep me
company, and loving it.  what's an example of mainstream humor?

"Are there other poets out there who've done their tv time?"

Oh yeah, i've definitely done my time.  Current fave sitcoms are
3rd Rock from the Sun (amazing surreal space theatre) and Frasier.  I've
especially loved all those shows over the years with great large, ensemble
casts like Taxi (all-time fave), Cheers (only the early ones, w/ Diane),
and M=A=S=H (early ones, pre-Colonel Potter).  Also Mary Tyler Moore,
Rhoda, Bob Newhart, All in the Family etc.--all the stuff i grew up
watching with my family--you know, back when there were only 3 networks,
and everybody watched the same thing, and prime-time really *was*
family time.  I used to like those big comedy variety shows too, like
Carol Burnett, and Flip Wilson, and Sonny and Cher--of course i was only
about 8 years old i guess.  I'm still waiting for Flip to come back in
reruns (any of you potes doing programming at Nik?) so i can see if i
still think he's funny.

The Mike Gold piece on Gertrude Stein that Rachel L. posted really caught
my eye. How does a piece really catch your eye, you ask, without a bloody
result?  Observe the following: I admire much of Stein's writing. On the
other hand, much of it I find innovatively dull. This is my opinion for
which I carry an entitlement in my breast pocket.

Gold makes himself out to sound like party apparatchik condemning the
artist who is not towing the line for the Revolution. At first, anyway. I
wonder what people make of his comment on "idle art."

LVNG's third supplemental (to the magazine, which is free)
is a lovely and affordable gem by one Marton Koppany, a Hungarian concrete
poet. The title:

        "It is the Same"

Mr. Koppany has created a serial poem, which we here laboring
in the belly of the LVNG industrial machine have produced in a
pristine edition of postcards. The result produced many rounds
of hearty back-clapping: is in not glorious the manner in which
black ink appears on white stock?

Mr Koppany's "It is the Same" will not fail to produce a smile
no matter how often it is flipped and read.  I find myself
thumbing thru it with the rapidity of a jaded 10 year-old snapping
thru a pack of baseball cards looking for all-stars.  Such
rapidity with Mr Koppany's text may be said to evoke east-european
animation of the soviet era. But that is a matter for the exegisists.

You all are invited to visit, and contribute to, the new Virtual
Anthlogy Project, now online at:

     http://www.ims.csuohio.edu/VA/VAintro.html

A number of listmembers & fellowtravelers have work featured in the
various magazines indexed there, including: Mike Basinski, Steve Carll,
Chris Daniels, Jacques Debrot, Dan Featherson, Peter Ganick, Los Glazier,
David Golumbia, Hank Lazer, Sheila Murphy, Dan Raphael, Ken Sherwood,
Alan Sondheim...  ohdear, who did i miss?..

The site and the project might be particularly interesting in light
of recent discussions around "acadominance", criticism, and "schools"
of poetry (that last reminding me of schools ov fish).  At any rate,
wd appreciate any feedback.

lbd

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here's from the introductory page:


Welcome to the second stage of the *CybpherAnthology of Discontiguous
Literature*. This project is spurred by the recognition that a number
of online experimental lit zines seem to draw from an overlapping
community of contributors, and praps aesthetics: Jake Berry's *The
Experioddicist*; *Juxta Online* edited by Ken Harris & Jim Leftwich;
and Tom Taylor's *Anabasis* for a start. During the first stage, we
collected and indexed these publications. So far, the following
indexes have been completed:

     * Juxta Electronic, issues #1 thru #21;
     * Experioddi(cyber)cist, issues #1 thru 16,
       plus a number of online chapbooks;
     * Anabasis/Vision Project;
     * an Authors Index; all works in the above zines, alphabetically by
author.
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These indexes (and the archives that they link to) are now online,
enabling quick access to individual works searchable by author or
publication. Additional indices are under construction (for instance,
to all the single-author chapbooks, and to the collaborations);
suggestions for additional indexing are welcome.

You're Invited to contribute to the second stage of this project. The goal
is to generate a body of critical work, based on this corpus of texts
(and related), using the linkages made available in this format for
hypercitations. That work, in the form or essays, close readings, commentary
and critique, will be presented as an online issue of TapRoot Reviews,
tentatively scheduled for the end of 1997. The overall aim is to put this
body of work into a context of community and discussion, and ultimately to
help readers find a way in to that community of writers/texts.

Creative Uses of the media and message are encouraged. I'd particularly
encourage folks to push the bounds of traditional critical "norms", as befits
the non-traditional nature of many of these texts. Additionally, significant
print-only zines such as Ficus Strangulensis' *Transmog* and John M.
Bennett's *Lost and Found Times* seem relevant; energies that would enable
us to engage those (and others) online would be helpful. Any feedback at
this stage is most appreciated. Email me:

Subject:      What comes next?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        I want to take up Jacques Debrot's important question, from about
a week ago now, about the question of "what comes next" after language
poetry.

        The first thing to say, I think, is that language poetry is in no
sense "over." While the initial impact of much of the work associated with
this term now certainly has a history, many language poets are continuing
to write wonderful poetry and criticism, with greater or lesser relation
to what might be seen as the originary impulses of their context. So in
speaking of "what comes next," I don't think one is talking about what
will REPLACE language poetry. This is especially true as one of the things
I love about poetry generally is that it cannot be "replaced"--history
continues to roll, yes, and Emily Dickinson's world is not so simply our
own, yet in what significant sense is her work "replaceable"?

        So the question, if not what will replace language poetry, seems
to me more what contexts, approaches, and concerns will be the crucial
ones for a generation of poets influenced (to various degrees, and with
various levels of antagonism) but not delimited by the concerns of
language poetry?

        I think, in response to Jacques' question, that a great deal of
work has already been done on this subject, both in terms of poetry and
poetics. I can't provide a complete list of writers here, but they include
poets, poet-critics, and critical writers like Lee Ann Brown, Juliana
Spahr, Harryette Mullen, Rod Smith, Jefferson Hansen, Tan Lin, Rodrigo
Toscano, Charles Borkhuis and many many more.

        Nor can I, here, summarize a very complex area of activity.
Certainly one of the main things that I see among these writers, is that,
perhaps to a greater degree than language poetry (if only, at the very
least, because there are so many more of these younger writers), there is
no simple consensus about what concerns are important--the area involves
as much lack of agreement as it does a shared sense of what matters. Even
the two people that Jacques mentions, Mark Ducharme and myself, have
different significances in focus, although we share a great deal. If I
understand properly an article by
Mark forthcoming in the next (I think) issue of TALISMAN, he wants to
characterize these writers as being marked by a kind of DIVERSITY of
poetic approaches, and Mark urges an openness to diversity. While his
description has some truth, my own concerns in essays like "Towards A Free
Multiplicity of Form" have perhaps been more polemical. I'm not in favor
so much in some generalized diversity of forms ("any way you do it, that's
okay with me!") as I have been calling for a CONSCIOUS exploration of
multiple formal approaches, even in the case of a single writer. Not
"acceptance of diversity" so much as "consciousness of the implications of
choices of form" and an attempt to NOT settle for singular traditions or
approaches. "Diversity" in poetry seems to me fine ONLY as long it
contains awareness about the implications of form, and conscious attempts
to find those forms which might reveal untapped potentials in given areas.
A more generalized "diversity" that suggests "we're all individuals, and
we're all okay" runs to my mind the risk of avoiding the key question of
the relation between forms of poetry and forms of culture--if you're not
paying attention to how the forms you choose to use tie into the context
of the world around you, then I think that's probably NOT okay. But mine,
of course, as Mark rightly points out, is only one take of many.

        Interesting to me also, on the subject of how one's thoughts about
form tie into the world beyond, is the dynamics revealed in a question
like Jacques' important one "What comes next?," a question key to the
whole
history of modernism. Steve Evans' essay THE DYNAMICS OF LITERARY CHANGE
does
a profound job of putting the question "what comes next?" into context.
For haunting that question is the question of the NEW, and Jacques might
easily have said "What's NEW?" What Evans has done, I think (as have some
others like Jefferson Hansen), among much else, is to problematize the
very notion of looking for the NEW. This is not the same as accepting
"tradition" unproblematically. Rather, I think this particular generation
of poets find themselves at a moment when one must be as ironic about the
NEW as one must about the "tradition," without giving up on the
possibility of innovation, integrity, and concern with what has been left
unexplored.

        The irony of the NEW I think may best be expressed by a closing
quotation here. Thankfully, this quotation does NOT sum up the value of
the new in the work of those poets who have begun appearing in the 90s.
But it does express how EASILY that value might be missed, and why irony
is necessary these days whenever you or I ask "what's next?". I hope
you'll read this closing quote closely, because it's BRILLIANT, it really
is, especially considering what it is.

        It's from the book BEER BLAST; TWENTY YEARS OF FADS AND FOLLIES IN
THE BATTLE OF THE BREWS, written by Phillip Van Munching, whose company
handled the international distribution of Heineken until being forced out
several years ago:

        "I recently asked the public relations guy at Heineken USA why
Amstel Light's packaging had been changed so dramatically BEFORE any
decisions had been made about the direction of the brand's marketing. 'You
know how people like to look busy,' he replied. I relate that story for
two reasons... The second reason is that it gives insight into WHY new
marketers change everything; marketers feel the overwhelming need to
criticize what has come before them, so they can make a name for
themselves by spearheading some NEW direction. This is because there seems
to be less and less job longevity among marketers; the guy selling soda
pop this year might be selling beer next year and feminine hygiene
products the year after that. I suspect that the marketer of today is
afraid to go to an interview for the next job and say, 'Well, I've spent
the last few years as a caretaker for a brand image created before I
arrived on the scene.'"

James Tate is the only poet I've ever heard read who laughed extensively
(*extensively*, I mean like over & over) at the jokes in his poems.
Surprisingly, it was kind of endearing.  My favorite joke: the end of his
poem "I Left My Couch in Tatamagouche": "I left my couch in Tatamagouche,
/ and that has made a big difference."

Wish it hadn't become necessary to say this, but backchannels prove
otherwise: NO, I don't agree with Michael Gold on Gertrude Stein; I
would have thought this obvious.  Stein's important to me, to the point
of doing star-turns in my dreams (for decades).  I DO think the piece is
provocative and worth reading.  Thanks to the few and the brave who've
ventured a comment.

And NO, I am not a fan of Charles Bukowski!  Good grief.

Being a tummler on this list is exhausting.

And Michael McGee remarked:

thanks for that -- maybe Tate-as-comic's not so deadpan after all
(laughing uproariously at his own wit) . . .

as for "and that has made a big difference," -- I hear the original line ("and
that has made all the difference") echoing in memory, but quite can't seem
to place it.  Can somebody help? (Robert Frost or something?) -- a
"wisdom" poem as 'twere . . . ??

I saw Tate read in NYC (circa 90) -- he shared the bill (Academy of Am.
Poets) with Michael Palmer.

Aboard subway after the reading, my late friend Lynne Beyer remarked
she liked Tate's humor & wasn't as wild abt. Palmer's seriousness.  (How
would Palmer do as a comedian?  Surely he could pull it off -- if he
wanted . . .)

/ / / /

Mark Twain found mention in the humor thread.  I just picked up a copy
of *Mark Twain on Writing and Publishing* (remaindered, from Book of
the Month Club, New York, imprint 1994) -- it includes an essay entitled
"Post-Mortem Poetry."  The latter is hereby reproduced (in large part) --
in interst of historical poetics or suchlike:


Mark Twain:
"Post Mortem Poetry"

IN Philadelphia they have a custom which it would be pleasant to see
adopted throughout the land.  It is that of appending to published
death-notices a little verse or two of comforting poetry.  Any one who is
in the habit of reading the daily Philadelphia *Ledger* must frequently be
touched by these plaintive tributes to extinguished worth.  In
Philadelphia, the departure of a child is a circumstance which is not more
surely followed by a burial than by the accustomed solacing poesy in the
*Public Ledger*.  In that city death loses half its terror because the
knowledge of its presence comes thus disguised in the sweet drapery of
verse.  For instance, in a late *Ledger* I find the following (I change the
surname):

                      DIED
  HAWKS.--On the 17th inst., Clara, the daughter of Ephraim and Laura
  Hawks, aged 21 months and 2 days.

    That merry shout no more I hear
        No laughing child I see,
    No little arms are round my neck,
        No feet upon my knee;

    No kisses drop upon my cheek,
        These lips are sealed to me.
    Dear Lord, how could I give Clara up
        To any but to Thee?

  A child thus mourned could not die wholly discontented.  From the
*Ledger* of the same date I make the following extract, merely changing
the surname, as before:

  BECKET.--On Sunday morning, 19th inst., John P., infant son of
  George and John Becket, aged 1 year 6 months, and 15 days.

    That merry shout no more I hear
        No laughing child I see,
    No little arms are round my neck,
        No feet upon my knee;

    No kisses drop upon my cheek,
        These lips are sealed to me.
    Dear Lord, how could I give Johnnie up
        To any but to Thee?

  The similarity of the emotions as produced in the mourners in these two
instances is remarkably evidenced by the singular similarity of thought
which they experienced, and the surprising coincidence of language used
by them to give it expression.
  In the same journal, of the same date, I find the following (surname
suppressed, as before):

  WAGNER.--On the 10th inst., Ferguson G., the son of William L. and
  Martha Theresa Wagner, aged 4 weeks and 1 day.

    That merry shout no more I hear
        No laughing child I see,
    No little arms are round my neck,
        No feet upon my knee;

    No kisses drop upon my cheek,
        These lips are sealed to me.
    Dear Lord, how could I give Ferguson up
        To any but to Thee?

  It is strange what power the reiteration of an essentially poetical
thought has upon one's feelings.  When we take up the *Ledger* and read
the poetry about little Clara, we feel an unaccountable depression of the
spirits.  When we drift further down the column and read the poetry
about little Johnnie, the depression of spirits acquires an added emphasis,
and we experience tangible suffering.  When we saunter along down the
column further still and read the poetry about little Ferguson, the word
torture but vaguely suggests the anguish that rends us.
  In the *Ledger* (same copy referred to above) I find the following (I
alter surname, as usual):

  WELCH.--on the 5th inst., Mary C. Welch, wife of William B. Welch,
  and daughter of Catherine and George W. Markland, in the 29th year of
  her age.

       A mother dear, a mother kind,
       Has gone and left us all behind:
       Cease to weep for tears are vain,
       Mother dear is out of pain.

       Farewell, husband, children dear,
       Serve thy God with filial fear,
       And meet me in the land above,
       Where all is peace, and joy, and love.

  What could be sweeter than that?  No collection of salient facts
(without reduction to tabular form) could be more succinctly stated than
is done in the first stanza by the surviving relatives, and no more concise
and comprehensive program of farewells, post-mortuary general orders,
etc., could be framed in any form than is done in verse by deceased in the
last stanza.  These things inestimably make us wiser and tenderer, and
better.  Another extract:

  BALL.--On the morning of the 15th inst., Mary E., daughter of John
  and Sarah F. Ball.

    'Tis sweet to rest in lively hope
        That when my change shall come
    Angels will hover round my bed,
        To waft my spirit home.

  The following is apparently the customary form for heads of families:

  BURNS.--On the 20th inst., Michael Burns, aged 40 years.

    Dearest father, thou has left us,
        Here thy loss we deeply feel;
    But 'tis God that has bereft us,
        He can all our sorrows heal.

  Funeral at 2 o'clock sharp.

  There is something very simple and pleasant about the following,
which, in Philadelphia, seems to be the usual form for consumptives of
long standing.  (It deplores four distint cases in the single copy of the
*Ledger* which lies on the Memoranda editorial table):

  BROMLEY.--On the 29th inst., of consumption, Phillip Bromley, in
  the 50th year of his age.

    Affliction sore long time he bore,
        Physicians were in vain --
    Till God at last did hear him mourn,
        And eased him of his pain.

    The friend whom death from us has torn,
        We did not think so soon to part;
    An anxious care now sinks the thorn
        Still deeper in our bleeding heart.

  This beautiful creation loses nothing by repetition.  On the contrary, the
oftener one sees it in the *Ledger*, the more grand and awe-inspiring it
seems.  With one more extract I will close:

  DOBLE.--On the 4th inst., Samuel Peveril Worthington Doble, aged
 4 days.

    Our little Sammy's gone,
        His tiny spirit's fled;
    Out little boy we loved so dear
        Lies sleeping with the dead.

    A tear within a father's eye,
        A mother's aching heart,
    Can only tell the agony
        How hard it is to part.

 Could anything be more plaintive than that, without requiring further
concessions of grammar?  Could anything be likely to do more toward
reconciling the deceased to circumstances, and making him willing to go?
Perhaps not.  The power of song can hardly be estimated.  There is an
element about some poetry which is able to make even physical suffering
and death cheerful things to contemplate and consummations to be
desired.  The element is present in the mortuary poetry of Philadelphia
[in a high] degree of development.
  The custom I have been treating of is one that should be adopted in all
the cities of this land.

I'm not even sure when Bukowski came up, and i wldn't really call myself
a fan--i get the sense he's probably published a lot more stuff than was
absolutely necessary.  BUT he's got a short story called something like
"All the Assholes in the World and Mine" that is tremendous.  steve

calling for a CONSCIOUS exploration of multiple formal approaches, even in the
case of a single writer.  Not "acceptance of diversity" so much as
"consciousness of the implications of choices of form" and an attempt to NOT
settle for singular traditions or approaches. "Diversity" in poetry seems to me
fine ONLY as long it contains awareness about the implications of form, and
conscious attempts to find those forms which might reveal untapped potentials in
given areas."


Mark,

It seems to me you're only really talking about multiplicities of "discursive"
form here.  Literary forms that are more presentational in character, hypertexts
and other electronic forms, performance and sound poetry, visual poetry, etc.
don't offer themselves up to consciousness in the ways you describe.  If a "Free
Multiplicity of Form" is the goal these forms would probably have to be
considered too, unless of course some categorical reason were used to exclude
them.

              <mdw@GWIS2.CIRC.GWU.EDU>

Just a couple of early-morning squibs attached to Mark Wallace's post.

re: the new - wasn't it Pound who wrote, Poetry is news that stays new?
In this sense, as Mark said, E. Dickinson is "the new" or irreplaceable.
This relates to something one of those german guys (Schelling? Adorno?)
said:  the modern is a relational term which has to do with what
infiltrates our present concerns.  I.e. the ancients still have
"modern" impact in many ways - as well as remaining the antithetical
"ancient".

Nothing will replace language poetry or exactly "come after" it.  But
the whole event of langpo has created sort of a model for counter-counter-
poetics.  & some of those counter-counters might counter language
poetry on the level of a "poetics".  This shouldn't detract from the value
of any of it...(at least "in theory"...)

I don't like the "generational" approach that MW has repeatedly used, mainly
cause I'm an old guy starting a young.po movement - if you want to join,
see Jack Spandrift's website at www.deadend.wyo.edu (not really).

If you look at US poetry as a kind of closed, solipsistic system, langpo
came along and disrupted the "echo effect" (the narcissus effect) of
the stylized "discourse" of mainstream semi-academicized poetry.  But it
did so by means of a different closed system - see Ron Silliman's startling
equation of New Criticism & langpo in the Perelman conference thing
(Impercipient) - equated except on the level of politics.  Now seems to
me the new crits & langpo together - along with people like Zukofsky - did
invaluable service to poetry by concentrating on the MICROSTRUCTURE - the
architecture on a micro level of syllable & word.  But in a way, everything
turns on mathematics - on the one & the many - on solipsism & reference -
on the relation of word & thing. To me the langpos haven't gone FAR ENOUGH
in the direction of the microstructure, and an interesting development
in the future will be toward Saussure's ideas about anagrams & paranomasia.
Hart Crane was into this: "anagrammatize your Name", etc.  Saussure
found a pervasive subtext underneath a lot of classic latin poetry -
the whole poem would be the scattered (Osiris) fragments of a thematic
single WORD.  Thematic - & referential.  Build on it.   The poem as
architecture.  Mandelstam again.  & Yeats, too.  heck yeah.  - Henry Gould

p.s. another interesting thing about Saussure was that the anagrams were
sets of phonemes.  He wasn't interested in shuffling around written letters.
a phoneme-syllable was always a double-letter unity usually linked to a
THIRD letter.  Individual letters were irrelevant.  It was the sound effect
of the syllables he was listening to.  See Starobinski's little book
WORDS UPON WORDS about what Saussure was doing.

this sounds terrific; are the old SNLs available on video anywhere?
and, i must say, the sight of kevin kline reading nietzsche in bed with a
large automatic weapon, in A Fish Called Wanda,, as well as the "Springtime
for Hitler" production number in The PRoducers (already mentioned by
rloden) are priceless.  i guess i get a big kick out of the lampooning of
"high culture" (like the nebbishy accountant in The PRoducers being named
Leo Bloom). also the line (paraphrased) from the producers: "are you a
singing hitler or a dancing hitler? dancing hitlers in the next room!" or
whatever.

thanks for sending it; i just had the opportunity to read passages from it
at a little post-screening discussion of the film Paris Was a Woman, and
guess what, a lot of those avant garde ladies really *were* politically
naive, a point the movie's romanticization of the era completely evades.
btw, the homophobic and misogynistic subtext of Gold's review is
fascinating.  I still hear stuff like this in my classes, just this past
quarter a student claimed that when she read on the back cover of My Life
that Lyn Hejinian had gone to Harvard, she realized  1)why  she couldn't
"understand" the book and b) why it wasn't worth understanding, as it was
all a bunch of insider private stuff by rich people.

this is a helpful note; thanks. after much consideration, i think, in fact,
that stein *was* politically naive, tho to my mind that doesn't mitigate
her significance; in fact, i think that her sidestepping some of the
crucial politics of her time enabled her to have certain insights about
language and experience that may end up being more radical than the
politically progressive thinkers of her time. in a way it makes her very
interesting. i remember being similarly touched on reading that james brown
supported nixon; when someone said, later, "that wasn't very smart,", he
retorted, "I didn't do it to be smart."

I'm surprised to hear Frost's "Road Not Taken" described as "a too-simple
homage to going your own way."  In my reading everything in the poem, from
the title's negative to the deliberate ambiguity of "all the difference"
(good?  bad?  bit of both?) works against seeing in it any such simple
homage.  Also check out the verb tenses:  speaker's ringing declaration of
nonconformity, if that's what it is, is projected into the future.  In the
present tense of the poem, he admits that both roads look about the same.

The biography tells us that Frost wrote the poem as a satiric jab at his
friend Edward Thomas, who could never make a decision.

This poem is persistently misread, I believe, through the lens of Frost's
folksy public persona. Frost wrote many truly bad poems, I'd say, but this
isn't one of them.

Subject:      twain -- first deconstructionist?

does anyone remember twain's peice on james fennimore cooper?  twain takes
apart, bit by bit, the feats of derring do and forest cunning in the natty
bumpo/leatherstocking series, as well as anything cooper writes having to
do with rivers.  bit by bit, the innaccuracies pile up, the hyperbole, the
exagerations, till i was laughing out loud.

but after that, i was never able to read j.f. cooper with the attention and
suspension of disbelief necessary (for me anyway) to really disappear into
the book...

now, twain on the old masters ... fortunately, i had been looking at old
paintings before i read twain, not that i didn't enjoy it every bit as much.
and twain on the infamous "chamois" of switzerland (which he translates
as "flea," leading to all kinds of speculation on the nature of chamois
gloves, bags, etc.) as well as the wild "chamois" exchange at the opera!!!
now THAT is a sendup of high culture!

the delightful obituary poem send up excerpted (thanks david i!) ws so
typical of twain -- in its vein does anyone remember his series of stories
(which seem slightly autiobiographical) on the young married couple -- whose
baby is sick, and who weather a thunderstorm?

i was given a complete set of twain when i was nine or so, after i'd been
borrowing the books from the neighbors for months (they were moving).  my
mother got rid of all of my books (w/o forewarning or permission) and i still
have dreams of that wall of mark twain books waiting to be cracked.  speaking
of sci fi, philip jose farmer, in his riverworld series, reset twain into
a future "experimental" world where all of humanity has been resurrected.
i'm not sure i'm crazy about the series, but it was an interesting
interpretation of twain.

how do you all feel about writers who take on the task of "extending" the
series of another writer?  has anyone read the sequel to "gone with the
wind"?  and there is, of course, jean rhys' _Wide Sargasso Sea_ meant to
extend bronte's _Jane Eyre_.  there have been a couple of others on jane
eyre, and on bronte books...

i've generally found sequels unreadable, with the exception of sargasso,
which is problematic in its own way (rhys is an extraordinary writer, but
i can only take so much of her bleakness and painful vision before i am
about ready to lie down under a truck).  one feels, painfully, the differences
in skill between the original and the copy.  i think, as technical point,
that perhaps when one subdues one's own internal writing rhythms and clocks
for that long to another person's the muting flattens the prose and breaks
it down.  parodies work (as we know from our resident parodists, but then,
bromige is everyone, bromige is all-scrivent, so he doesn't really count)
perhaps as a sort of pentimento?  one sees the original, and the parody
at the same time?  but more extended serious endeavors, where one writer
tries to disappear into another, don't seem to come off usually.  maybe
sargasso works because rhys writes AS rhys, with her own rhythms and viewpoints.

the first continuation of nancy drew worked i thought, but the later
carolyn keene imitators began slipping into a sort of computer simulation.
i picked up one of the latest ones, adn it reminded me of barbara cartland
books, where characters are given slightly different physical characteristics,
times and scenarios are switched, but the basic dance remains the same.  they
say she has a master-plot/book on disk, and just plugs in slightly different
details...

wickedly funny in class--and just plain wicked, i might add!  he was
always dropping in these little tit-bits about affairs and acid trips and

actually, this used to be one of my favorite "let's make fun of frost"
poems, until i reread it and realized that what it says is: two roads were
exactly the same, i don't know why i picked one over the other, but in the
future, when i tell the story, i'll *say* that it was because one was less
traveled by, and that has made all the difference. that makes the poem
quite a bit more interesting --it's about narrative and
self-aggrandizement, and the retroactive assignation of meaning to a random
act.

Twain's piece on mourning poems (all-bads?) sounds like a send up of
Wordsworth's essays on epitaphs, but it could also be a response to the cult of
sentimental death washing over middle-class Americans in the nineteenth
century.
This trend produced its greatest monument in the world's first cemetery park,
Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Mass.  Intended as a place of comfort and
leisure, the cemetery today is shared by bird watchers and roller bladers.  It
also has a truly spectacular collection of trees, which shade sundry
Longfellows
and Lowells.  I haven't memorized any of the verse on the grave markers, but
it's closer to Twain's quotations than anything by Robert Lowell.  My
great-grandfather, Benjamin Franklin Roberts, a Tennessee farmer and Union vet,
has on the back of his grave marker a list of the battles he fought in and on
the front a different kind of cliche, which is lineated strangley:

        Remember when passing
        By you have to die and
        Lay as low as I

He now lies in the middle of the Oak Ridge atomic compound, and his grave
cannot
be visited without a special escort.

Last year I started reading Beckett's Watt, for me his funniest, on an
airplane,
and I had to stifle myself so as not to disturb fellow passengers. I got a kind
of morbid thrill from imagining myself, in the minds of people around me, as a
slightly demented giggler who also snorted and sighed now and then.  Laughing
to
oneself in a public place is a fun and harmless enough form of abjection.  I
followed Watt with Flann O'Brien's At Two-Swim-Birds, also pretty damn funny,
though in places a little too like the catechism chapter in Ulysses.  The first
sentece gives you a taste:

Having placed in my mouth sufficient bread for three minutes' chewing, I
withdrew my powers of sensual perception and retired into the privacy of my
mind, my eyes and face assuming a vacant and preoccupied expression.

I saw Tate read a few years ago in Cambridge. by about
15 minutes, in, I was laughing so hard I couldn't see (for
the tears) & looked (I was later told) as if I were verging
on respiratory arrest. quite a compliment, you'll say. I

Eliza, I know what you mean about Rhys, one can't hate her but there is
definitely that ickiness to her.  I think you might make a clearer
distinction between sequels and retellings, Rhys' book being a retelling
and those Nancy Drew books being sequels.  In the retelling you're
basically following the original, but putting in "secret" origins,
perspectives, motives.  There's this element of cleverness that is
seductive.  Sequels are much more create-your-own-thing from these elements.

In reading your post I thought of Mary Reilly, which is so much better than
the Julia Roberts movie based on the book.  This retelling of Dr. Jekyl and
Mr. Hyde went way beyond the schlock that I was expecting--particularly in
the author's dealings with issues of class, which is an important subtext
to the original.

Even though my own book is, in a broad sense, a sequel to Dracula, I'm not
so hot on them as a form.  Sequels to me are like clones in Sci-Fi movies,
there's always something just not right about them.

I have had similar responses to John Yau. I couldn't even mouth the words
to some of the poems in _Forbidden Entries_ they were so funny,
unexpected, exacting, incisive. Yau's humor is sometimes like Tate's,
completely deadpan, even slapstick, but the explicit political elements in
Yau's poems supercharge things beyond cleverness or irony. Is something
any less funny for its criticality? Or any less critical for its jokes?

well, of course these things are often mass-market fiction, &
so much the worse. "one feels, painfully, the differences
in skill between the original & the copy"=97something like movie
sequels shot by successively less talented directors, that degrade
as one moves down the line. ["& how"]. reliance on "special effects":
"one subdues one's own internal writing rhythms...to another
person's". I think the problem can be just that=97trying to extend the
work seamlessly, an impossible labor (& to what end?). other
people are=97well, we won't go there again so soon. whereas I find a
more liberal ["forgive me"] interpretation of "extend", something
more on the order of "treat" ["mmmmm"] or "treatment of" the extant
work a considerably more interesting proposition. (wondering
about the announced relation of Kevin Killian's Santa to the=97
oh, forgive me, dammit, I've just forgotten his name=97to a story
called "Satan", by another writer). highly visible, unwitting,
unwilling (?) collaboration (not necessarily an appropriation)=97on the
order, really, of the commonest use of language=97with the exception
that, in this case, the rhizomatic aspect is deliberate=97not so much
planned, as willful. de-liberated: not "subdues one's own" so much as
the stricture (structure) imposed by the extant work. or "liberated":
working at the seams, re-situation, re-evaluation=97on the order of
production, & not reverence. (of course, I've left out liber-ated:
text arrested in the moment as book, which, yes, can be at least as
much production as commodity. cf. Blake, Drucker, others).
sometimes we forget, whatever theoretical lip-service we might pay
to intertextuality, that there are no sacred ["discreet"] texts (or
is it that all texts are sacred? nah...). all insertion ["immersion"]
in the text is necessarily a re-writing from a new subject-position.
(of course to say this here is an instance of what, in my loosely
protestant up-bringing, was termed "preaching to the choir").
"influence" =3D confluence. it's physical. love it.

exactly the same, i don't know why i picked one over the other, but in the
future, when i tell the story, i'll *say* that it was because one was less
traveled by, and that has made all the difference. that makes the poem
quite a bit more interesting --it's about narrative and
self-aggrandizement, and the retroactive assignation of meaning to a
random act."

Thanks for this, I'll reread it.  -m.

Just so you folks know, Senator Roth's office is not in fact conducting
any poll re: Section 117(d) of the tax code (graduate student tax credit).
I called immediately when I heard this (it's important to me, since I'm
about to become a graduate student again; it's easy to do because I work
on the Hill), and I was informed by the (very nice) office assistant that
they were never conducting any poll but were receiving calls from all over
the country because of Internet postings that said they were.  They're
good sports about it, but I wouldn't suggest calling them unless you're
one of Mr. Roth's constituents, in which case, knock yourself out.

Nobody'd mentioned Kenneth Koch: his baseball epic "Ko: A Season on Earth,"
and small pieces like "Mending Sump," which sends up Frost and contains the
line "Something there is that does not hump a sump."

Nor a word about Ed Dorn--despite last Winter's flap, one of our best and
funniest poets (and the incredible cadences of the opening of Gunslinger I
took up permanent residence in this poet's body the first time I read it aloud).

Here's one that no one will take me up on. Dryden coauthored a revised
version of the Tempest which abjures all profundity but becomes great
slapstick sex comedy. He added a female Caliban and a male Miranda, who
somehow had never met their counterparts, and some female castaways. So,
four horny virgins and a bunch of lecherous sailors and aristocrats trapped
on an island. Hilarious in itself, plus the subversive pleasure of
snickering at a parody of Shakespeare (albeit intended respectfully!).

As long as we're in the Restoration, the poet and playwright Thomas Otway,
best known as a tragedian, wrote two great forgotten comedies, Friendship in
Fashion and The Atheist, which bills itself as a sequel to the former. F in
F: the last three acts are an endless society party. The Atheist: a lovelorn
woman dresses as a man to seduce her rival for her beau's affections. You
hadda be there. Great. And the women change the rules of the game and win.

Great post, Mark Wallace. And thanks to Jacques Debrot for first posting
this very intriguing question. The quote Mark uses at the end sums up the
issue very succinctly, namely, that the concern with the New is basically
the expression of an _anxiety_ about what's come before - the acute anxiety
every writer feels, in some sense, whenver he or she "sets down to write" (I
don't mean this lasy literally...). I'm still reading Steve Evans' essay, so
can't add anything gleaned from there. I would just say though that the
issue of literary change vis-a-vis LangPo seems to me not so much a question
of "replacement" but of mutation.

Aldon Nielsen recently mentioned to me in passing the "manifestos" on
post-Language Poetry by John Noto and perhaps others that have appeared
recently in Talisman. Can anyone comment on what is meant by the idea of
post-Language poetry? Judging by the name alone, it doesn't seem to be
oppositional to LangPo, but operating in more or less "friendly" relation to
it.

But this desire to classify and sum up ideas about the New is also an
expression of the anxiety we feel about change, i.e. the urge to name and
identify what appears presently to be amorphous, to pin it down somehow.

        The irony of the NEW I think may best be expressed by a closing
quotation here. Thankfully, this quotation does NOT sum up the value of
the new in the work of those poets who have begun appearing in the 90s.
But it does express how EASILY that value might be missed, and why irony
is necessary these days whenever you or I ask "what's next?". I hope
you'll read this closing quote closely, because it's BRILLIANT, it really
is, especially considering what it is.

        It's from the book BEER BLAST; TWENTY YEARS OF FADS AND FOLLIES IN
THE BATTLE OF THE BREWS, written by Phillip Van Munching, whose company
handled the international distribution of Heineken until being forced out
several years ago:

        "I recently asked the public relations guy at Heineken USA why
Amstel Light's packaging had been changed so dramatically BEFORE any
decisions had been made about the direction of the brand's marketing. 'You
know how people like to look busy,' he replied. I relate that story for
two reasons... The second reason is that it gives insight into WHY new
marketers change everything; marketers feel the overwhelming need to
criticize what has come before them, so they can make a name for
themselves by spearheading some NEW direction. This is because there seems
to be less and less job longevity among marketers; the guy selling soda
pop this year might be selling beer next year and feminine hygiene
products the year after that. I suspect that the marketer of today is
afraid to go to an interview for the next job and say, 'Well, I've spent
the last few years as a caretaker for a brand image created before I
arrived on the scene.'"

Calling attention to the means of production makes sense. However, terms
such as "diversity" and "multiplicity" are only useful for politicizing the
matter.

Poetries that are non-discursive (more "presentational) are often
market-driven, entertainment economies and are processed that way by the
spectator. Performance poetry is usually (and quite literally) "judged" or
measured according to its entertainment value. These poetries are rendered
economic by virtue of the fact that they are perceived to be more material
in some sense -- they are framed in some kind of context that is not
concerned with consciousness of form. They are thought to take up the space
and time of the individual as other forms of entertainment do and are
effected by fluctuating rules of consumption that are essentially
market-driven. Though there is no recognizable market for, let's say,
"hypertexts," readers/spectators who seek-out such non-discursive forms
often do so for the same reasons that they would seek out a particular product.

Wasn't anyone going to remark on what I thought was the truly exemplary
behavior of Adrienne Rich last week in refusing whatever poetry prize
it was she was awarded? I only saw a brief newspaper column about it, but
she made some highly critical remarks about Clinton's policies and said
she couldn't accept such an award given that context.

I mean, the last book of poems of hers I remember liking is at least 20
years old, maybe 25 ( *The Will to Change*, from the Olson lin), and I'm
fairly sure I wouldn't be able to appreciate her recent work, but this
is a political gesture I can applaud.

But given the anxiety expressed by many about being locked out of the
prize circuit a few months back, perhaps not many share this view.

Yes, Joe, glad you mentioned it. Though as I recall, in the article from the
NY Times - very small, prob. the one you read - Rich not only objected to
Clinton but to the general state of politics as such in the country.

It would be nice if the Poet Laureate made the same gesture - either by
using the appointment, for instance, to bring to broader attention the
disgraceful way language is used by politicians to dress up their lies
(seems like a not unreasonable way for a poet to marshall his or her
expertise) - or by simply resigning. Instead the post functions as a mere
diadem in the king's crown, flattering the official state culture's image of
itself as "standing for the good things in life" - the poet rendering
sensitive observations of nature (or Frost's charming little paean for
imperialism, "The Gift Outright") from the stage of the Kennedy Center while
white papers are drafted for the subversion of this foreign country or that
social welfare program. Strange bedfellows indeed - but who's getting
screwed?

I only read about 3 sentences or something, in the gossip-section of the
Washington Post -- I'd really have to have a more full report (e.g., to hear
what she said, or what the nature of her objections were, etc.) before I
might be able to form much of an impression of it.

One of my favourites (though not a sequel, is it? What would you call it?
An extention of some sort)

is Sorrentino's _Mulligan Stew_, which is (as the title perhaps says) an
oleo of Flann O'Brien's _At Swim-Two-Birds_.

I have seldom read such a nice way of getting the damned spirit of the
forerunner.

I think this is a limited view of "performance poetry." It may be true of
many slam scenes, but I don't think it's true of the performance works of
bpNichol, Jackson Mac Low, Charlie Morrow, and others. Such works and
performers are acutely conscious of form. Still, depending on how you
define product and market, all of our poetries function as part of an
economy.

I remember reading in the height anti-similism their complete dismissal via
the single sentence "Comparisons are odious".  I don=92t really like=
 dismissal
and was unhappy at the summary nature of their dispatch.  However =85

Perhaps one step towards their rehabilitation is to start very small with,
say, animal similes.  As strong as an ox doesn=92t mean much to those who
don=92t often rub shoulders with said bovines. Better stick to native=
 species.
On a recent radio quiz program the contestant was asked to complete the
sentence "as happy as" which he obliged with "as happy as a pig in shit".
Astonishingly, the presenter refused to concede the point,  failing to win
my  confidence since the only Larry I know suffers from depression.  Back to
the animals. One comparison conspicuous by its absence concerns the common
rat.  Its testicle/penis ratio is of such an extraordinary dimension that,
well if human proportions were on anything like the same scale the
wheelbarrow would have been invented much earlier in history.  Hung like a
rat.  You never hear it.

Oh on another radio quiz the contestant was asked "What rock is so light
that it can float?"  His answer, "the moon", while beating pumice any day,
fell on stony soil.

Cheers,

Randolph Healy,

another answer:  Jefferson Airplane?

However, as for similies, another trope of comparable antiquity is
the collocation of an image with implied metaphorical correlate(s) --
without connecting the dots, just suggesting 'em.  Speaking of rock,
here's a very fine example:

   Bright are the stars that shine
   Dark is the sky
   I know this love of mine
   Will never die

A kazillion times more effective & affective than something like "my
love is as long-lasting as the bright stars . . " or any such.  Just the
image, and the mind can draw that implied subtext or not -- because
anyway there's more to it than that.

Of course, those Beatles lines mirror the same method in the Shih
Ching ("Book of Songs* -- or Odes I think Pound called 'em?) of
Chinese antiquity.

Hi, it's Kevin Killian.  In an interview here in San Francisco, Adrienne
Rich spoke more fully and linked her decision to decline this award (the
National Medal for the Arts, not specifically for poetry) to a number of
previous examples.  Leonard Bernstein  declined the award, refusing to go
to the White House while nothing was being done about AIDS.  Stephen
Sondheim ditto, while Wallace Stegner declined to protest "political
censorship."  Rich is an extraordinary woman with an extraordinary career,
tho Dodie (Bellamy) tells me that Gigi Bradford and Donald Hall, both of
whom apparently lobbied for years and years to get this recognition for
Rich, are both a bit hurt about her decision.  Must have been some wires
crossed somewhere, for Rich said in the interview that she was surprised by
her selection. ``Given the kind of work I do, the kind of poetry I write,
it never seemed a likelihood that I would be proposed for it."

``I have a strong belief in the inseparability of art from society as a
whole," Rich said July 10th. ``Where growing numbers of people are being
marginalized, impoverished, scapegoated and beleaguered, I don't feel I can
accept an award from the government that is pursuing these policies.''
She wrote to Clinton, ``The radical disparities of wealth and power in
America are widening at a devastating rate.  A president cannot
meaningfully honor certain token artists while the people at large are so
dishonored.''

Dear David:

Because you seem to be interested in EVERYTHING, I thought you might
like to know that I have a name for that trope you mention that "is the
collocation of an image with implied metaphorical correlate(s) --
without connecting the dots, just suggesting 'em": "juxtaphor."  It's an
especially useful term for describing those visual poems where one is
supposed to understand but is not told that the visual appearance of the
text acts as a metaphor for the denotation of the text.  I wonder if the
term has a standard name (besides "implicit metaphor").  Does anyone
know?

After this week's reading by John Olson & Christine Stewart, I realized
there were several months worth of Subtext readings that hadn't been
announced here yet.  So:

August:  Matthew Stadler & Dodie Bellamy
September:  Robin Blaser & David Bromige
October:  Ezra Mark & Jeff Derksen

This listing includes the tail end of Bryant Mason's curation and the start
of Robert Mittenthal's.

All readings take place on the 3rd Thursday of the month, beginning at 7:30
pm in the back room of the Speakeasy in Seattle's upscale Belltown
district.  We ask for a $5 donation.

Hope to see you there, then.

There are also several recent publications by Seattle-area writers that
should interest Poetics list folks:

John Olson's Swarm of Edges, bcc editions
Nico Vassilakis' Orange: a Manual, Sub Rosa press
Laynie Browne also has a book from Kelsey Street, the name of which has
disappeared from my desk (sorry)

& the next Talisman, due out in a month or so, has a big chunk of work by
Seattle poets.

performance poetry and performance poetry
there are many _performance poets_ who fit into the category that doesnt
interest me greatly which pay attention to form - and timing and you name=

it

but the aim may be primarily to entertain - any number of comedians on
first hearing come over as left radical because of the things they attack=

and then you find theyll attack anything if it gets a laugh... any kind o=
f
laugh... it is the atempt to to elicit response bringing money regardless=

of what it is

i have sat through too many formless poetry performances - and what i
notice too is the shallowness of the analysis apparently underlying what
they say - 18 years of _get the tories out_ and it is all a bit confused
now that the labour party is in with tory policies

or there is the deeply self-expressionistic - i am in love so this is a
poem

as to the economy - there is the older fuller meaning, going back before
the cash necklace and still relevant - how you manage things properly, ho=
w
you achieve civilisation through that

What's going on here? Heat stroke?
Look, I use this list as a convenient meeting place to exchange ideas,
words, wit. It helps fertilize this cultural semi-desert. Provocation for
its own sake merely disrupts that process. It also doesn't say much for the
cojones of the perpetrator--I mean, what bad thing do you risk in this
venue. I suggest, instead, if you really want to provoke reactions, that you
have your post printed on a t-shirt and walk into a leather bar. Or maybe
just go up to a cop, or your boss, or your parents, and shout it.

having quite as much artistic integrity as the most admirable of
poet-poets whose name one might wish to invoke.

yes, but there are performance poets who do not seem to have this
sort of standard, or level -- (and there are at least a few comedians
who are more consistent in their p.o.v.) --

the same line could be applied against "writers" or "poets" -- they
only write to be read; they'll write anything to have an affect; they
don't care what they say really, just messing around with words . . .
all they care about is being published & famous . . . making a name
for themselves . . . if they were really wise, they'd be silent . . .

You're probably describing (with some accuracy) the general tenor of
a phenomenon in your surround.  But -- as noted above -- I'd question
whether it should be applied broadbrush to the whole category of
"performance (poetry)" per se.

I think it's grossly oversimplifying performance poetry, especially the
slam/spoken word variety, as primarily market driven and formless.  Many of
the slam poets I know are quite concerned with form, particularly as to how
form and sound interrelate.  Bland free verse or simple, obvious rhymes and
meters don't cut it in performance poetry (at the Green Mill one of the
favorite audience heckling tactics is "guess the rhyme" in which audience
members will end the poet's lines before he or she does:  it's quite
rattling).  The work that is performed in these venues can be quite
political and/or experimental.

The thing to keep in mind is that this genre pretty much evolved
independently from the performance poetry that emerged in the sixties and
seventies (such as Nichol or Mac Low).  Most have never heard of, let alone
been influenced by, these people, even though occasionally there are some
remarkable parallels going on.

I agree with Charles on all poetry being affected by and taking part in the
market economy.  As for market economies and entertainment values, I'd like
to point out that the institutions of this poetry are much better situated
to thrive in the coming grant-free world than much of the mainstream.  And
I think it's ludicrous, if not downright hypocritical, to single out this
poetry as being driven strictly by entertainment.  What poetry (discursive
or not) isn't entertaining (and do you -- be honest -- want to spend your
limited time resources on the kind that isn't)?

Slam poetics are quite explicit in the connection between poetry, pleasure
and the presence of audience:  their emergence was in reaction to the
perceived notion that poetry was a dull, dutiful thing (like truly bad
church), to be attended to by people in college.  It is populist and
popular.  It is not, however, strictly hedonistic.  One development worth
looking at is the split that occured last summer in the Chicago slam team,
where several more explicitly political writers (Daniel Ferri, Monica
Copeland, Reggie Gibbons, and a fourth who's name I can't remember to save
my life) splintered off from the Green Mill to participate in the national
slam as Team Berwyn.  I think they took third.

Went to another arts administration symposium--this one on the state of
poetry in the West (meaning western U.S.).  The keynote speaker was Kim
Stafford, Bill's son, so that will give you all a sense of the
tone/aesthetic.  He didn't mention any dead deers but he did recite by
heart (and with *much* feeling) a poem a woman wrote for the occasion of
scattering the ashes of her friend's dead seeing-eye dog.  This was an
example of the riches that were out there if we arts administrators would
only look.

Another speaker was the director of Poets House in New York.  She was
likeable, and like Kim Stafford, was a fan of cowboy poetry.  I'm curious
that I've never heard any of my NYC friends mention Poets House.  What's
the word on the street about it?  Backchannel if what you have to say is
too juicy for public consumption.

I don't have anything juicy -- & prob. am not in touch w/ the real
word on the street -- but do have a few brief impressions, for what
worth.  A late NYC poet-friend used to mention the place favorably,
saying she'd taken some sort of workshops or seminars there -- Poet's
House, as you likely know, was established by Stanley Kunitz (using
money he'd gotten from some big poetry prize, I think) -- they have
an *amazing* library (books & periodicals) which I've not yet taken
time to really take advantage of, but the place is open regular hours
and is well worth a visit, if one is in New York, on that ground
alone; -- once a year, they have a sort of festival for new po books
& publications, and I think they display many hundreds of such -- but
I've never made that event --

one thing I did get to, though, was a little several-hour seminar
thing (in a series of such); -- the one I managed to attend (timing a
visit to NYC so as to be able to do this) was led by our list's own
Michael Heller, on topic of the poetry of Wallace Stevens.  Slightly
pricy ($25) by some standards, but I much enjoyed the combination of
Heller's lecturing (more or less) combined w/ some discussion from
the group of half-a-dozen-or-so seminarians . . .

I know the xerox-zine *Talisman* is / was regularly dropped off at
Poet's House for their library (someone there seemingly knew my
almost-unknowable name from that, seemed) -- & many, many other
little (or otherwise) periodicals are likewise assembled.  I haven't
paid a lot of attention to their reading series (I think they have
one), but the folks have always seemed non-stuffy & friendly . . .

those are my own scant impressions, for what worth . . . I'll leave
it to the real cognoscenti to give you more serious low-down ...

theres a differnce between poetry written for performance and poetry that is
(or can be) performed.
you can write something with the intent of a live performance either along
the lines of theatre (which itself has several lines, from brechtian to
realistic transport, with several places in between), all of which imply
some intent for aesthetic experience. then there are less artistic/literary
intent, such as to win a slam or to be a successful stand-up perfomer.
there's also the realm of performance art, but im going to limit this to
performance poetry. i think a good poem can exist at several levels,
including when heard and when read on a page. and that some of the elements
and imporessions communciated ont he page or in a reading/performance are
different, and that several levels of experience may be needed to find the
full richness of a work.
sound is part of the words and part of the poem. the visual images evoked by
the words, the individual memories evoked by the words are also part of the
experience of the poem. what you see in the poems arrangment, visual puns in
spelling, other elements that can only be communicated on the page,a re also
part of the experience.
some poets write more for/from the intellect, some more for/from the
emotions, and other realms/channels that are reached to various extents.
add to this the poedts themselves, their comfort in audiences, in public.
their voices. their relatioships with their bodies.
a poet who is comofrtable performing will usually write work more conducive
to live presentation; other poets may have work that can be presented by others.
my feeling is that the sond, teh communciaton should be there; that if the
poem is too reliant on the page, on solitary cogitation, then it is not a
fully realized work.
my first exposures to poetry (other than grade and high school) were at a
coffeehouse where people read ferlinghetti, ginsberg, patchem, yevtushenko &
others. people with limited experience with contemporary poetry often find
it easier to read my poems on the page once theyve heard me perform it.

i agree w/ hugh steinberg that performance/slam style poetry is not to be
reduced to commercialism and written off.  in fact, one could argue that it
is far less commercially driven than other types of poetry.  the fact that
it is popular and populist is not a bad thing. we've had this discussion b4.

Re. Dodie's query.  Everyone on the list ought to be looking into and
joining Poets House (which with fund cutting everywhere badly needs
support).  Beautiful space, one of the largest poetry libraries in NYC,
resource center and many presentations, seminars and panels (by many members
on this list) on everyone and everything including--and of special interest
in terms of recently dicussed topics-- HD, Neidecker, Oppen, Zukofsky,
buddhist influence on Amer. poetry, performance and sound poetries, the
enumerations go on and on.  Their annual showcase display of newly published
books is by itself worth the price of your support.

I know Poets House tries to acquire every poetry book published in each
year since the house's inception -- tries to acquire via donation from the
publishers, that is. I visited there and will attest to its rather
comprehensive library, particularly of books published in the last few years.

If anyone goes to the building, try to visit Pace Edition's Spring Street
Workshop, also in the same building (I don't remember the floor). Great
printmaking studios, other arts assembly studios. Once I got out of the
elevator on one floor and was right in the middle of Jim Dine working on a
new show. I don't know if the Spring Street Workshop is officially open to
the public, but the people there are usually very friendly.

i didn't even think there was an audience for concrete and sound
poetry (but i'm reading those into the word _performance_). xcept
for the poet. but that doesn't count. i'm not so sure there is such
a thing as a public art. or maybe i don't believe in one. and maybe
i'm over - interpreting a gain.

Amen, Maria and Hugh!  I get frustrated with the kind of approach to
poetry that needs to maintain this page/stage dichotomy and cannot, for
the life of me, figure out why this list keeps having this discussion over
and over again. I've been working on a dissertation on community poetics
(slam, words-n-music, etc.)  for a good while now.  What drew me to the
project was both my own experience with performing poetry and the fact
that many of the poets I heard at the Green Mill and at the Guild Complex
and other venues around Chicago were explicitly political.  However, poets
like Patricia Smith, Michael Brown, or Reggie Gibson (on of my favorites!)
also have very good ears and work that slippery intersection of sound and
meaning very deftly.  I would also like to go on record as saying that
much of this work IS incredibly powerful on the page as well.  The way
that a poet like Smith works with alliteration, assonance, internal rhyme,
as well as voice is truly remarkable, both on the page and in performance.

 As far as commericalism goes--give me a break! I know of very few
performance poets who have big contracts with major publishing houses or
recording labels.  Nor do I know of any teaching in academic workshops or
doing the University reading circuit.  I have problem with the idea that
ANY commercialism is somehow a sellout or that it cheapens ones work.
Personally, I find that as an academic in this
publish-or-perish-Routledge-book-of-the-month environment, I am much more
driven by commercialism than most slam poets and to argue otherwise would
be disingenuous.

back from europe and watching the words whiz by, lagging... good to be

yeah, the performance vs. _____ poetry thread is annoying... but hey, it's
a tv culture in the u.s. of a. and it's difficult sometimes to know how to
conduct a criteek of (any aspect of) same while avoiding the old high vs.
low culture distinctions... yeah, sure, i've had a good time at slams, seen
some stuff performed that was as bad as anything gurgling through the
hallowed halls of academe... which is to say, one can be as bad as the
other...

on the academic front, i lament the sheer sobriety of technique...

on the slam front, i lament the public relations strategies i've seen
employed to secure audience rapport, if not support...

ok, so my french is killing me... the peaches in paris were as sweet as my
childhood... most of the time, i mean... hey, humor-wise, how bout anybody

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

At first I thought little of it, being some one thing and no other in life
appearing the natural course of events. But as time passed & I became
imbued, godknows how, with knowledge of other ways, & I learned that my
ancestors were trees, I felt a great yearning to be a tree in a forest.
Well, this was not to be. But I couldn't help but bewail my lot, that I had
not at least been made into a tallboy, or a set of diningroom furniture, or
the headboard of a bed, where the activities open to my view should have
proven more various.

I even upbraided myself, that there had been at some point a choice open to
me, and that i had, godknows how, stayed unaware of this choice. And that
now, affixed to the wall of a lavatory, it was too late. Still, I am
nothing if not consistent, and continued to have regrets even while proving
adjustable to my present circumstance. Perhaps this says nothing more than
that I had a mind of my own, and at least the choice to speak out or to
stay quiet about the conditions society had imposed upon me at the very
moment of my creation. My cry may well be a muffled one, but if you listen
hard enough, you will hear it.

Monotony,apprehensiveness, surprise & shock, you will suppose, make up my
lot -- the waiting & then the sudden ripping off from the whole, the
violent application to an asshole, then the rejection, dropped into water
to drown in a maelstrom. But I am more than the sum of my parts. I remember
those pieces of myself now apparently lost to me; aye, and I recall every
ass I've ever cleaned. And for some, although the acquaintance was brief, I
treasure to this day, tender feelings. Not all assholes are alike. Some
through their mere appearance aroused a passion in me, a longing that I
still feel, although the moment of physical intimacy was so brief. And even
today, hanging here, I hope that the next hole I see close up, will stir
this tender passion in me.

My regrets for the "roads not taken" (to quote one of my peers) have lately
yielded to a more pressing concern, however.  I observe that I am growing
thinner every day, and fear that shortly nothing shall be left of me but
the cardboard tube that is my heart, and that this shall be quickly
despatched into the garbage, just as so much of me has already been
flushed, in what condition I leave to the reader's imagination. Therefore
through a great effort of will I am self-perforating my tissue to leave
this message behind--some trace that I lived where people moved and had
their being. Please examine me carefully sheet by sheet so that my cri de
coeur not go unremarked. Like Kilroy, I was here, & like Kilroy, I had no
real means to be other than what I am. Do not send to see for whom the bowl
flushes. It flushes for thee.    T.P.

For what it's worth, when I was performing in Dallas with the sound
poetry group "Question Authority, the", we got a good-sized audience,
primarily of people who probably had never hear the term "sound poetry".
They just knew that the people onstage were doing something that
appeared to be fun.

the Muse, the Muse, the languid droop of her thin coughing fingers...

You're the one who's using the shitty language, feeling shitty.  The sex

And now for something completely different...

(spot the Chaplin reference in the subject line)

Has anybody seen the new Isaac Julien - Franz Fanon doco?

I saw it last night - realising during that yesterday was his birthday - &
other numerological epiphanies

Anyway this isn't really poetics but it is nicer than all this bickering as
Fanon never said (But Mr Burn's did on the Mulder/Scully Simpsons) "Can't we
just all get along."

Anyway this was a fascinating & resonant if slightly overblown study of
Fanon which attempted all sorts of psychoanalytical quote-y visual tricks
(or maybe the director just liked the actor playing Fanon's body). Not
really a discussion of the poetics of poetry - but the poetics of cinema -
sure. And the poetics of documentary - absolutely.
The Fanon readings themselves were delivered poetically - a device strangley
appropriate considering the didactics of his writings (and there is a
hate-mongerer for you - other peoples words not mine - don't think he is so
much when you really read him). Interviewees included Homi Bhabha, Stuart
Hall  & other 'cultural theorists'. Whether people's cups of tea/coffee or
not - bloody nice to see something so thoughtful in this age of popular
thoughtlessness.

Wasn't sure about directorial efforts to represent 'unveiling etc' but any
criticism is a complement to a film attempting something so ambitious.
Anyway - a whole lot further on from Julien's homphobia and reggae doco of a
couple of years ago.

Anyway that's enough for now - anyone else?

Look Fanon is simply more relevant to a poetics discussion than a lot of
these bickerings. Flirtings and teasings... keep em up - there are no good
soaps on telly at the moment.

So lets get this train (of thought) back on track, and start pushing my
barrow cos these slivered linings of your cumulo-nimbus are dragging their
ol' butts hereabouts.

POoH-etics anybody?

Dematerializing The Poisoned Pastoral



With the time-lapse, the upturned echidna writhes,
        ants and maggots consuming its sponge-like
        flesh beneath the spreading International Klein Blue sky--
just a component part of an heroic Blaues Schwammrelief--
the residue of its life flashing by, as sun-eaten locals
        stare uncomprehendingly at the skins of their

finest sheep strung out over rusty fences, all veined
        and varicosed with ordnance despite
        tableaux of monochromatic sameness,
as if each were a small centre, a source of density--
the sky, the dam water, the raddled paddocks and graded roads,
        those soft diggings around fallen trees multiplying

each night, writ in mystical latin: Tachyglossus aculeatus.
        Beneath the picture subterranean streams overflow,
        underwriting patches of poison bush that'd see
the whole flock stone dead on the spread, blue as blue venus
in a deeply blue light, blue as the International Klein Blue sea
        beside which the locals spend their holidays.

Thanks for the added information, Luigi.

I also forgot to mention Jeanne Heuving's Offering, also from bcc.

I've received a request or two for more info on some of these publications.
I'll see what I can do, though some of the principals of both bcc & SubRosa
receive poetics list & are (obviously) being remiss in their contractual
obligation to announce publications, etc. here; so maybe I won't have to do
so.

(& I just today found a message sent to the list from someone involved with
Kelsey Street about Laynie's book while I was reading/deleting the last
month & a half's messages that had accumulated in this mail box while I
paid attention to other things - this is quite a weird array of posts to go
through in a few compressed sittings.  Hoo-hah, you folks have been, uh,

Tonight David Bromige was interviewed on "Inkwell," an hour-long FM PBS
radio show out of Santa Rosa, CA.  Layne, yours truly, was on the show
two Sundays ago.

This next Friday evening at 7:30, July 25th, Layne-that's-me is reading
in the Gallery at the Sebastopol Center for the Arts with Sacramento
poet Luke Breit.  Layne and Luke will also be reading in Petaluma, CA,
at Copperfield's Cafe September 18.

David and Layne were among about seven poets who read in Sonoma this
last Wednesday as part of the two week Sonoma Valley Poetry Festival.
David, btw, was his witty, charming self and read beautifully.

A very provisional reply to parts of Scott Bentley's post---

(..maybe belated: have been ill and away from my day-job, where I can
access the list..)

..What the heck is a poet of power??

If the implication is of (a kind of Bloomian) will-to-power thru one's
writing, I'd say this is about equally accurate a claim regarding
mainstreamers...For the most part, the tendency associated with Stein and
the LangPotes (..I consider that the label is best used only for the
members of that loose circle, not to characterized the work of others
that's in the mod/pomo stream), that tendency is very largely about
**relinquishing** control, inviting the collaboration of the reader..

it's about time somebody brought someone like fanon into the discussion.
thanks. now, cd u elaborate on the usefulness of fanon to discussions of
poetry and poetics? for my part,  i've been disappointed by previous isaac
julien attempts (looking for langston, young soul rebels,etc) but maybe
he's growing into his reputation.

Poets House
72 Spring St.
NY NY 10012
212-431-7920

I'm not a New Yorker, but travel there often on
business and for me its great sanctuary: quiet,
well lit, a few comfortable chairs, chockful of
poetry books and litmags. In the afternoons
after my appointments are over I like to sit there
and read. (Located on Spring St., it's a stone's
throw from the SoHo galleries.)

I've been to some of the Poet House programs;
mostly the panel discussions, symposia & lectures.
These events by & large have been very worthwhile.

The Poetry Publication Showcase is an annual event
displaying most, if not all, of the new poetry titles
released during the past year. In conjunction with this
project, they publish an annual catalog that I've
found useful in terms of keeping track of new poetry
titles, and useful for ordering books directly from the
presses. I'm sure this catalog would be helpful to
acquisition librarians as well.

Basic tax-deductible membership is $40. Membership
benefits include discounts on the fees charged for their
special programs/events and a copy of the above-mentioned
catalog. One can avail oneself of the Poets House without
being a member--it's free & open to the public as they say.

Interesting this talk on 'performance poetry.' Paul Dutton, one of the
finest sound poets i know, & once a member of The Four Horsemen, performed
at eyerhymes & after wards (along with the great Bob Cobbing) at some other
venues in Alberta. We were talking at one point & he discussed his
difficulties in writing an encylopedia entry on "Sound Poetry/Performance
Poetry": since we (that is stephen Scobie & I as Re:Sounding) were
performing with a 'performance poet the next evening, we were interested.
He had decided to define sound poetry in terms of what he & Bob & some of
the others mentioned already on the list (Charles Morrow, Jackson Maclow) &
to leave out the kind of performance poetry we heard the next evening: a
good bit of comedy, too many obvious rhymes (& all hit hard by the voie for
some reason), & always a strong narrative (at least from this performer0,
yet done with he flair of a standup comic. I would, for the moment, tend to
agree with him. His amazing "Stereo Head" is certainly an awesome
'performance' but it is so within extremely strict & demanding *formal*
limits, as were the varied pieces of the horsemen. And Cobbing's chants are
too. Or any of the others i've already named & many others.

On the other hand, I have to think a lot of poets can't read too well if
perforance poets are supposed to be so much better or more 'entertaining'
than they are, because this performance poet wasn't really doing anything
much beyond what I've heard good readers of their own work do in terms of
'expression': well a George Bowering for example (when not cowering under a
lampshade [it's bowering not cowering he opined]), certainly Charles
Bernstein, definitely Robert Creeley the one time i was lucky enough to
hear him . . . you probabaly get the idea...

of Jews without Money (still sounds like a description of my friendship
network) when Michael Harrington basically said, this dude can't write, but
he has something to say. In fact, Gold was a precise and even delicate
stylist. But his official position of "anti-style" gets taken at face value
too often.

Unpacking the Stein comment would take a whole history of the relation of
the CP's stalinized politics vis a vis modernism and in particular its
attraction to the Trots, first, and then to Stein's very obvious gender
transgressiveness as a secondary text. Frankly, no American writers other
than Sherwood Anderson and Hemingway seem to have had any idea what she was
doing until well after her death. She did better with musicians and visual
artists, who were generally less anxious about figuring out how to fit her
into any model of what writing "should be."

Consider the difficulty that modernist writers of a stalinist nature had:
specifically the objectivists. The Trots reviled them because of their CP
leaning politics (Zukofsky's college roommate was Whitaker Chambers, Oppen
took off for Mexico the minute that the Rosenbergs were arrested, Carl
Rakosi was "around" the CP for years and in fact his name is a nom de plume
from the real Calman Rawley partly for that reason), other modernists
thought they were nuts, poltically speaking, and the CP thought they were
nuts aesthetically. Consider, how an intelligent but "well-placed" red like
Gold had to negotiate social space. Add misogyny and homophobia to the mix
and I think you get what he wrote.

No?

All best,

You don't understand.  Which is a little hard to swallow, this shit about
you telling me to raise my conciousness and what, maybe my self esteem?
After you, Ms. Dodie, chose to A) not communicate with me privately, then
B) Make the news of your your brief and somewhat dismissive private
correspondance with me as a testimony to your, what was it, Radicalism?
Non bourgeoisness?  Or was it Avante Gardeism?  I can't remember.
But here, let me try to clarify:  I am using"The Personal Voice" (you're
familliar, I'm sure)  to write about a Public Institution (language) and
the damage it does--yes, to me, to my heart, to me!  But obviously I am
not submerged.  Jesus Christ, there's bad.  There's bad and good feelings
and there's poison and oppression and no, for fuck's sake, it's not "cool"
to be a prostitute.  Its lucrative!  It affords dignity to me, but I'm a
middle class college kid.  The word whore hasn't ruined me.  But it has
power, it corrupts all of our sexual/political/romantic landscapes.  It
is not cool.  The word faggot hasn't ruined the man I love, but it has
given him pause.  If you don't want to talk about this, fine.  There are
people who do, and I thank god for them, cause I am a lonely type.  Fuck,
why are you, Mark Weiss, and you Dodie Bellamy, so nasty about it?  I
will happily say it again, and please, this time listen to, or speculate on,
the inflection:

I am a whore and I am in love with a faggot.

See, no self loathing.  Just an acknowledgement of suffering.
Just a tear shed against injustice.  Just a poem, a short one.

I didn't actually backchannel this to Mark Weiss.  I don't know why it
reached him that way, but it wasn't duplicity on my part.

He told me, privately, that "there are people and agencies in [my] area
to help [me]". Glad to hear that even in this forum people still are doing
their bit to maintain the boundary between the mentally ill and the
sane.  Keep it up, Mark.  I'll learn to behave myself in no time, not
ackowledge suffering or injustice in art or life. First, Mark Weiss, you
said to me that I should try to shock people who would be shocked--cops
or parents.  That its innapropriate to tell you cause you I guess, were not
the opressor.  But now you charge me
with being mentally ill, in need of proffessional help!  Telling a person
that struggling is mental illness is wrong.  You said something to me
that's wrong, and I am really mad at you.

Yours Sincerely, Emily Vey Duke

I agree with the other correspondent; the Tonight Show is a solid example
of mainstream comedy -- as is Late Show -- as is Saturday Night Live after
(choose your own bracket-date).

To sum up -- mainstream comedy is someone telling you jokes or acting in
skits on a major American television network (i.e. not Fox or UPN) between
11:30 PM and 1 AM.

One of the list members was kind enough to explain to me how the backchannel

i was thinking of dante's inferno, the canto w/ brunetto latini.  judy
grahn suggests a few nice ones: men who walk backwards is one i remember.
i was hoping someone out there cd let loose with a more flamboyant and
insiderish list, there must be lots of wonderful, affirmative, wild,
imaginative etc terms for both whore and faggot.

actually now that i check it in my singleton edition, it sez: "they [the
sodomites] looked at us as men look at one another under a new moon at
dusk; and they knit their brows at us as the old tailor does at the eye of
his needle." sinclair sez essentially the same except he sez "puckered"
instead of "knit," which is more suggestive, but drops the needle-arts
metaphor.

I've just read this past week, with pleasure and obvious sadness, a book
just out from Zasterle Press, Allen Ginsberg's LUMINOUS DREAMS, a
collection of prose dream sequences written over a number of years.
They're all very intriguing; my favorite was the first, a dream sequence
called "History of the Jewish Socialist Party in America":

"... in fact we are completely unconcerned with the US Govt, and far from
spying on it we welcome spies in our midst in the hope they be converted
and learn something about us."

        It was both amazing and strange to hear, even in these relatively
casual pieces, the voice of Ginsberg come alive again in new work; reading
it I felt how powerful and present his work and life remain.

I'm sorry, Maria.  I really appreciate your responses to me, and it may
be true that you sent your response before Mark Weiss, but I got his
first, plus yours was nice, and his was mean, so I responded (probably
wrongly, but from the heart) to the galling one, to defend myself, first.
Thanks, though.  More stupid computer confusion, like the backchannel

She seems to think that a discussion group on the net is an opportunity to

Dodie and Kevin,

Been meaning to drop you a line to try to scratch some Naropa gossip out
of you.  Sounds like you had fun, judging from brief comments on the
List.  I'm dying to know your impressions of the curious institution that
Lauren Mary and I dealt with.  A litany of gossipy questions follows
which may come off like a fly buzzing in your ear.  If so, please
delete it and just enjoy your day.

Litany:

Was there that strange mix of anti-intellectualism and reverence for
"Outriders?"  How dominant was Andrew this year in determining
programming and stuff?  How cheesy was he?  What were the students like
this year?  How much exposure to coontemporary experimental writing did
students bring this time around?  Usually there was a very small minority
who had no more than a slight exposure to the Beats.  What did you think
of Boulder and its New Ageyness?  The Townhouses?

Also, I have a strange bit of info about the weird Emily Vey Duke/Kim
Dawn Poetics List headache.  I havce been correpsonding briefly with
Emily Vey Duke about Naropa, and in the course of this I asked her how
she came onto the list.  She says she joined because her friend Kim Dawn
asked her to sign up to help stick up for her.  Seems they went to art
school together- I knew some students at CAL ARTS who were taking a
creative writing class and produced "Transgressive Writing" that was
highly informed by Kathy Acker but lacking in much thought towards
considerations of form or linguistic play.  I was wondering if this
scenario jived with your (Dodie's) experience teaching art students at
the Art Institute.  I don't mean to generalize too much about this kind
of situation, it just seems to be a possible context for placing both KD
and EVD.

Anyhow, I don't mean to blab too much.  Hope you are both doing well.

Jay

Performance of the spectacle of belligerent, principled,
truculent insistence at "being heard" at whatever cost to the
community at large, must end!

Having been off-line for a period greater than a month but less
than two, I've been lagging behind in my poetics reading, by
about a week or so, following up on the digests only as I am
able to get them on disk and then back home from my telnet
station on this foreign campus. Yesterday or the day before, I
returned to regular mail delivery from the poetics listserv back
on my home planet of Buffalo New York. If it is not too late,
and if there has not been too much written about this, please let
me jump in on a couple items that have been going on here.

It is astonishing to me the way that certain discussions, events,
or situations are repeated on this list, seemingly every few
months. The list itself isn't that old--wuzzit Charles B. said? --
went public Dec 1993?--and so perhaps the high volume of
verbiage and the nature of the way listservs "conduct
themselves" has led to a kind of chronocompression that, when
viewed against historical "reality" seems absurd. I'm not
personally opposing the repetition of any of the topics
discussed, from the criticism vs. poetry debates, to the
performance discussions to the continual struggle of the
"emerging writers" to define themselves in relation to
language poetry. Often, however, it seems that the same
problems are discovered and repeated anew without any
consideration for the fact that many "in the audience" have
seen much better actors in the very same roles.

I read somewhere that if nothing else, the "lumpen-slackers" of
the C.O. movement showed that the "system" was fallible in
that it wasn't able to garner the allegiance of "subjects."

Just as in the "subjective irrelevant" (an inverse of Eliot's
"objective correlative") real world, the lack of historical
awareness on the list is due to the huge volume of material to
read and comprehend and the unlikely prospect that someone
would read the whole list from beginning to current. How
many words is that? How many posts? On the other hand, if
I'm going to write to the Mammals List about my love and
knowledge of Otters, I certainly would do a search on "Otters"
first to stake out the field. I might even learn something about
Otters that I didn't know. But hey, I'm into Otters.

I'm not arguing that everyone should read everything before
participating, but I am thinking of the nebulous netiquette
unwritten rule of thumb, that one should read and see what's
happening on the list before starting any bonfires. I hadn't felt
that way before, but after my storm of reading of the last week
or so, I am convinced of it.

I'm not sure how many have been around since January 1994,
but us old-timers will tell you that the "identity-evasion" issues
of recent spam-artists and their often attendant personal
attacks have happened before, and is not the first time such a
drama has been perpetrated on this list. Obviously "y'all can do
wuchawant." It doesn't, finally, matter much to me. Like Maria
Damon, the diminishing returns have alarmed me and often I
have thought of unsubbing. But then it seems like things pick
up. More often than not it happens that on one of the other
poetics channels there is something meaningful in the
exchanges (and I like to think of this list as a kind of satellite
receiver with a delete-key filter, facilitating many
conversations on a wide-open spectrum, some of which, yes,
are dumb, boring, or painful to read).

Despite the valiant attempts of many to make something of
this space, this list, perhaps like many in cyberspace, is a list
where the glorious and ephemeral nature of the discussion is
matched only by the participants who keep up with it; or if not,
keep changing seats to give the impression of a cohesive set of
performers and a stable, if not cotten-eared audience. The
shifting nature of the list is now counter-balanced by a firm set
of people who've been on the list for more than a couple
months and who've stuck it out to have the conversation. List
Elders will remember that most of the instigators of Listserv
Drama have all moved on to more exciting internet venues,
I'm sure.

Any how, I am not sure why I am speaking out on this set of
issues except that I was disturbed by the tenor of the list when I
hooked back into it and the apparent bad faith by some of the
people writing here. I was disappointed by the unbridled
yelling, the fingers plugging the ears, the "I cant hear you I cant
hear you" of "you're not reading me your're not reading me,"
that god-awful mantra of the moment.

Much of the complaint surrounding the list is this careless
involvement of the public sphere in the quotidian exchanges by
exhibitionists seemingly lonely for any other kind of real life.
Why do we want to introduce anger and petit bourgeois
violence into the mix? It isn't so much to ask that people
consider their posts before sending them; keep private chatter
backchannel; reduce the amount of "noise," which finally
inhibits the intended function of this list.

On that note, on the matter of the literary chalice of poetic
inheritance, anxiety, and its attendant mores, I would argue it
isn't the value of any particular device that is the point, but the
relation of that device to our action and practice in the world.
There isn't anything inherently intrinsicly radical about
language poetry; isn't it the commonest thing in the world? But
the language movement was not *a* response but a series of
responses to a set of perceived institutional perceptions. I
confuses me, therefore that *naive* language poetry,
denouced on this list recently, would be held in disrepute, when
it alone can offer a critique from the vacuum of ignorance, the
place in which those literary devices of "advanced" poetic
technologies have a "value" that isn't "polluted" or
"committed" either. I'm being somewhat facetious here, but
really, I want to know what are the "committed" "ideological"
values of different formal practices. I asked my peers in Buffalo
last Fall what the inherent or tactical value was of doing work
in "homophonic translation." This led to a debate on our local
listserv there, and yet, I was never satisfied with the answers
which ranged in the vicinity of "homophonic translation
disrupts normative reading methods," as if such disruption
were somehow self-evident. I'm not saying that such work is
not valuable, but I want to know what is the significance (or
value) of doing this work *now.*

Insofar as there has been explanation of some of the rhetorical
devices used in recent list behavior, let us have a look at one of
them. The evasion of identity, the evacuation of specificity and
even the emptying of pronouns to malleable shifters--are these
really characteristics representative of the *current*
generation?  Why is identity play a valuable device in writing? I
can imagine a number of reasons myself, but wonder what
people "out there" think, as it has been something that has been
said of much of the current writing out there. It seems that the
cynical doubt of the possibility of sincerity (in some kind of
absolutist way?) has returned to us with a sort of sinister
vengeance. Why not follow out the natural results of some of
our theories? Tom Metzger was tried in Portland on charges
that he "suggested" the skinhead boys kill Mr. Seraw. A close
reading of Mr. Metzger would have one believe that he was
not responsible for his death, as he did not kill nor did he give
the explicit instruction to kill. I am not saying that we should
suspend Mr. Metzger's civil liberties, far from it. However,
close reading of the text often doesn't work in conspiracy cases.
When people say to those offended by the attacks on this list,
"lighten up," I am reminded of the woman at U-Mich in Ann
Arbor who was terrorized by a violent story published on the
internet in which the victim was *named* after her. While
there are crucial free speech issues every day, is the defense of
such a violent realization of these rhetorical technologies the
best way to use our energies? What is there to prove? Seriously,
I want to know? What *is* at stake here?

The danger lies, I think, mostly in the desire for anonymity as a
cover, or in the desire for an effaced or "slippery" identity, by
which one is allowed to conduct violent attacks. What is to be
gained from remaining anonymous? Certainly we're not
Weather Underground people, are we? (I wish we were
meeting in a warehouse and not in ineffectual cyberspace) The
rationalizing of this behavior among "friendly peers" (is that a
fair assumption, that the list should be a safe place to converse
without being attacked?) demeans other uses these devices can
have, and often those uses are revolutionary or subversive in
nature. Certainly, subversion and revolution are often valued
methods of valuing rhetorical technics.

All of this reminds me the "missent letter" (which we still see
occasionally, as the sender apologizes for having transgressed
their own--if no other--social order) in that being "attacks"
both the "spam" and the missent letter are often accompanied
by a kind of plausible deniability. Often missent letters are
marked only by this apology, with much of the discourse list
"missent"--in the sense that it has been reduced to a kind of
"could've been sent privately." Or, "should have been." Missent
letters are usually innocent; a few times they are embarrassing.
Once in a while they have been given an almost device-like
flavor of the intentional (and anyone who has been through the
logs knows what Im referring to).

The "misguided" spam on the other hand, offers deniability
through a misty cloud of half-baked "postmodernism" (for lack
of a better term). Utilizing the space of "plausible deniability"
may serve certain functional ideological purposes; a kind of
ends-meets-means endgame. But that space, of "willful"
misconduct seems dangerous, especially when transmissions of
violence posing as linguistic play are often linked to deniability
with concern to "identity" while at the same time serving to
advance the "cultural capital" of the speaker--and here Im
thinking how much of the capital generated by the AHP a
couple years ago was still connected to the never-revealed-
but-all-too-obvious writer-editors. The violence done to Jay
Schwartz, for instance, wasn't so much an actual nipple-
clipping real fear so much as it was a kind of jousting-like
aggressive verbal antagonism conducted on the public stage. I
personally don't see the point in that. The refusal to engage,
then, and defend one's actions, seems to me representative of a
kind of cowardice. I think of recent literary magazines which
offered up critique in manifesto-editorials but never allowed
even one letter to the editor to be published in response--so
much for the tradition of wrangling debate, as evidenced on
the left in the 30s, for instance. The fact that such an affair as
recently witnessed could lead to then a kind of community
melt-down and breaking into "sides" or positions, seemed
linked to the issue that there is "something to lose." What is it?
And if there is something to lose, why aren't we talking about
*that*?

Let me say that I really don't think were going to solve any
world or personal problems on this list. And while I certainly
don't think that there is so much at stake on this list that we
should take ourselves so seriously, finally, I do think that we
should take this space seriously. Obviously there is tons of
symbolic value to everything that is said. I guess it is better to
speak uninhibitedly and without reflection if reflection is going
to inhibit your speech.

Kind of like talking to people in a bar. Do you mean to be
saying that to me, or are you just acting out?

I have more things to post, so until next time--

I never saw 'looking for langston' and always meant to, but i remember not
being too excited about young soul rebels - can't remember the name of the
other one i refered to - but was similarly unmoved by.
The Fanon doco was flawed. Music was melodramatic and as i said it tried to
make some visual connections that were either too obvious or too obscure for
my sluggish brain. That said it looked good & provided some thoughtful
insight without attempting to provide the usual sort of limiting closure
these things often seem to do.

The same cannot be said for a recent documentary (pah) about New Zealand
'folk hero' poet James K Baxter which was a piece of complete crap & should
be avoided at all costs.

as to your question about poetics & Fanon...
I haven't thought too much about it. I guess his inextricable influence over
postcolonial writers/theorists/politicians(?) pulls him into the
poetry/poetics loop - or the loop around him. I can only guess about any
direct influence he may have had on specific writers - and would be
fascinated to know if there is an Algerian poetry connected to his time
there. Often he seems to be dismissed as a simple didact or hate-mongerer,
and it appears his actions at times may have verged on the reactionary, but
there is a thoughtfulness/perhaps a circumspect intelligence in his writing
(and i have not read it all) that is not always obvious at first browse.
(Straining here trying to think of something intelligent to say - will have
to settle for just thinking of something to say) I hazard a guess that many
members of this list would disregard Fanon in the same breath as
disregarding  cultural studies (perhaps i am wrong), but it would be
interesting to look draw up some sort of
post/anti-colonial-capitalism-imperialism whakapapa (sorry 'family tree')
that saw parallels between his strategies of resistance and those of the
left-wing lang.etc poets we know and love. I am aware that is a very tenuous
suggestion. But it would be more provocative than to limit a discussion to
his perceived connection to say  Walcott, Brathwaite, or perhaps Baraka -
along with screeds of novelists.

Blech enough guessing anyone else?

Rachel Loden's posting of the Michael Gold piece on Stein was a useful
demonstration of some positive vibes on the poetics channel. As part of an
ongoing attempt to spur debate and educate the masses, here is an
installment of POETICS FLASHBACKS. Because poetic yammering didn't begin
with the internet, with the literary magazine there is a long tradition of
partisan debate and creative juices flowing, POETICS FLASHBACKS (brought
to you by the Poetics Workers of the World) would like to present
tonight's pogrom, I mean program, the exchange between Robert Kelly and
Jerry Rothenberg in the pages of Trobar, which Kelly edited in the early
60s. The following is the initial piece by Kelly, which as he mentions, is
a response to Rothenberg's idea of the Deep Image (a concept which is now
an unrestricted free agent).

NOTES ON THE POETRY OF DEEP IMAGE

...the movement of images is rhythm.
- Nicolas Calas

These notes represent my attempt to understand and use this statement. The
climate of the notes is the atmosphere of excitement and confrontation I
am aware of in Jerome Rothenberg's working in what he calls 'deep image'.
In the second issue of his Poems from the Floating World he writes: "the
deep image rises from the shoreless gulf: here the poet reaches down among
the lost branches, till a moment of seeing: the poem." Working with deep
image is the development of a 'basic imagination.' I read FLOATING WORLD
as an attempt to plot a series of points, the poems & translations
printed, to surround an implicit definition of the powers of the deep
image. Rothenberg's first volume, WHITE SUN BLACK SUN (Hawk's Well Press)
has just been published. The poems in it are very good, very moving, very
much alive: demonstrations of the fruitfulness of the approach to the poem
via deep image. And the collection is, beyond the matter of the poems
themselves (what shall be said of them?), a happening in itself: the
appearance of a demand for a new set of concerns in poetry, the appearance
of a cogent movement in a new direction. The notes that follow are offered
as pertinent perhaps to the climate I've spoken of.

The present and necessary function of poetry is the transformation of the
perceived world. This transformation orders the known world into an
effective and coherent universe. The eye, seeing a concrete pavement for
the thousandth time but the flakes of mica embedded in it, glowing &
fiery, for the first time, sees a transformation and so is illuminated.
But poetry cannot stop with that enlightenment. Epiphany is meaningless
display outside the context of incarnation. Poetry is concerned with
things transforming and transforming things, with the whole picture in
mind. We are given: 1 world to transform, 1 language to transform it with.
        Transformation is process, involves truth as emergent from process
and not distinct from it, involves knowledge which alone redeems us from
innocence, the deadly innocence of not knowing where and what things are.
Poetry answers the questions  w h a t   w h e r e   w h e n.
        Nothing can be known unless it is known in situ, in the context of
its world. Transformation aims at the continuum of all perceptions. Poetry
is this continuum. Poetry establishes the mutual relevance of every
percept to every other percept.
        Percepts are from dreams or from waking, rise from the unconscious
or from the retina of the awakened eye. Poetry, like dream reality, is the
juncture of the experienced with the never-experienced. Like waking
reality, it is the fulfillment of the imagined and the unimagined. The
percepts, in order to be communicated, are fleshed in language. Poetry
cannot exhibit naked perception. The clothed percept is the image.
        Poetry is not the art of relating word to word, but the ACT of
relating word to percept, image to image until the continuum is achieved.

The Line:
        If the poem takes its departure from speech, a relationship of
some kind must exist between the rhythm supplied by the images and the
rhythm of the breath. What is the relationship of image to line?
        One easy answer is to say that one image equals one line. This
denies the independent existence of line, and is a quasi-solution that
produces poetry of blandness, no matter how great the initial force of the
images: the images are not being articulated, urgency is lost.
        Projective verse (for which see Charles Olson, Projective Verse)
offers a method of resolving breath and line, and my concern with it here
seeks to substitute the centrality of image for the centrality of syllable
& line as a way of access to the happening of a poem. The line as set down
on paper is an indication of the breath period, with visual & rhythmic
considerations determining the visual notation.
        The projective line ending in open juncture allows tremendous
stress on the last verbal unit in the line, a stress exploited not for key
words but for key silences, stretching out to vital & peripheral words.
'Systematic derangement' of standard speech rhythms, of the
inflexibilities of our analytic grammar, is a sharp exploratory tool, and
a means of locking images.
        When the image, prima materia, is lacking, the verbal gesture is
quickly emptied: the poem elapses instead of happening.
        The fundamental rhythm of the breath. One line represents one
breath period. The line rhythm is a product of internal (stress, morphemic
pattern) and external (weight, length) factors, relating one line to
another and to all others. Each line is rhythmically related to another
line by those same elements that relate lines formally to one another,
i.e. formal similarities beget rhythmic relationships.
        Thus a poem involves the fundamental rhythm of the images
(fundamental because more complexly present), a rhythm which is at once
intellectual and sensuous, and also the structural, more directly sensual,
rhythm of the breath expressed in line. The counterpointing of these two
rhythms is a principal sources of fullness and complexity in the poem.

Deep Image:
        Plucking things from the street or from the unconscious is
comparable to the digging of ore. Images do not necessarily proceed
directly from the pitchblende. Verbalization is of prime importance, and
on its subtlety the success of the appearance of the image, and of the
rhythm of images, depends.
        The deep image must be transferred to the paper, BUILT into the
poem, in language which gives it its fullest spatial, temporal, sonic &
kinetic properties, as conditioned by its presence in a series & in a
structure. Supplying the image in its fullest force is thus partially a
function of language.
        Basically, the fullest force is possible only by means of the
successful employment of one image's position in a context of other
images; the image, after its first appearance as dark sound, still lingers
as a resonance. This resonance must be controlled, and the effective means
of control are the acoustics of the space intervening between one image &
the next. The subsequent image is conditioned, made to work, by the image
that precedes it, and conditions, as it is finally conditioned by, the
image that follows it: through the whole poem. The first image to appear
in an Andre Breton poem will normally dominate all subsequent images and
the poem as a whole, even when the reader seems to have forgotten it.
        The whole poem is more than the sum of its parts. Very important
for this superequivalence is the ORDER of images within a poem. The final
quantum will vary with the rearrangement of the images and of the images'
fields of force. Every image has its field of force, its shadow moving
darkly through the poem, with which the poet must contend.
        The rational progression of images is only trope, whether or not
the middle terms are excluded: metaphor with a stale taste of truism. Only
the superior rationality of the dream is an effective impetus for the
movements of the deep image.
        The image is the measure of the line. The line is cut with image
in mind.

Language:
        The verbalization of the image comes out of the linguistic
patterns of the poet's native language.
        In the poem built from the deep image, the image itself bears an
enormous weight, for through it and its connection with the rhythmic
sequence of images, the flow of the image-conditioned word and music, the
meaning of the poem exists, all communication takes place.
        The American language of today provides the only reliable
linguistic patterns for the poet of images. Verbal expression of the image
demands an urgency and directness that only the spoken language of poet
and reader can supply, the language of here and now. The language of the
image must come across vividly and urgently, without cuteness or
distraction.
        Only in the native linguistic PATTERNS can the deep image
communicate at full strength.
        In the image and in the line, the poet is using a language
superficially akin to that of everyday. Atop the familiar linguistic
patterns, the images mold their own expressions. The poet charges these
expressions using the full arsenal of poetics, so that the image works in
all its urgency, at its maximal communicative force. The need for urgency,
for tension in the work itself, cannot be exaggerated. The language of
deep images restores the poetry of desperation.
                October , 1960                              [Trobar 2]




Jerome Rothenberg

WHY *DEEP* IMAGE?

When we speak about "deep image," we renew a demand that poets get at the
reality of things by turning inward: that the process of self-perception
be united as far as possible with our means for perceiving the world
around us. This sort of concern leads naturally to a reconsideration of
whether a "poem" is something other than the structure of its words, even
while being integrally connected to that structure, which gives it a shape
and name.

The question which presented itself at the start, before image in any
sense had clearly entered the picture, was where the poem took root (what
its source was) -- or, as it later developed, whether certain elements in
what, by the cut of the lines, we distinguished as a "poem," were "poetic"
in their very nature: in short, if there existed a special kind of poetic
activity. I was by then convinced that there was a long-standing confusion
between the structure of words we call a poem and the
event-of-a-poem's-happening: all more elusive because structure and event
could coincide in the same space -- and probably should, as likely in the
nature of things. But I did feel too that not all events that occur in a
poem -- and certainly not in most poems written today -- are in this sense
the happening-of-a-poem.

The event that seemed to me most clearly central to the
happening-of-a-poem was what we came to call "deep image." The word *deep*
wasn't intended to convey a sense of profundity, pseudo or otherwise, but
to show that the direction of seeing in this kind of image is into a man
rather than outside him: not a habit of the eye so much as a penetration
of the self to refocus on the world through the eyes-of-feeling. This
means that we have to try to see the world in all its natural and
contemporary detail as if no differences existed between the seer and the
things he sees. To see in this way -- through the self (emotively) --
results in certain necessary changes on the material emerging in the poem:

a heightened sense of the emotional contours of objects
(their dark qualities, or shadows);

their free re-association in a manner that would be impossible to
descriptive or logical thought, but is here almost unavoidable;

the sense of these objects (and the poem itself) being informed with a
heightened relevance, a quickened sense of life;

the recognition of the poem as a natural structure
arising at once from the act of emotive vision.

The power of the deep image is its ability to convey a sense of
two-words-in-one: directly: with no concept to come between the inner
experience and its meaning. With this comes a new attack on the mystery of
the real, in which all our habitual perceptions are continually being put
in question. The poet discovers the unknown by creating it from the vast
resources of his inner life, the savings of an experienced world still
rich in meaning: he delivers, as deep image, the life-giving vision that
he could in no other way explain.

In spite of this essential directness of communication, the recasting of
the world in the self's image will seem to some a distortion of whatever
world they habitually take for "the real one." Some such discomfort has
accompanied the introduction of deep image by other modern poets. But any
disruption of a bad habit should be welcome. The deep image brings with it
a demand for new visions of the world for new creations into thought: in
short for poetry in its *creative* aspect, in which, as Baudelaire first
had it, the poem "will contain, at one and the same time, the object and
the subject, the external world and the artist himself."

i sometimes share th impatience w/ rehashing what, to me, is
old hash...  but i think it's a mistake to see the conversations
as "only" about their ostenstible "topic"--th recurrent themes
recur because they're (still) issues that are still in process...
and the ongoing conversation often enuf isnt actually part ov
"solving" th "problem", but a public marker that it's still an
unresolved collective issue (even tho most ov the discussants
probably have resolved it individually & for themselves--probably
before the conversation begins...).
                as an example (sorry fr the rehash), my memory
of the criticism/poetry remergence: bob g. posted his taxonomy,
which contained his neologism "acadominant" to refer to LangPo;
several folks objected to the term on various grounds & w/
seemingly different interpretations of "acadominant"; i ventured
a guess as to the connection bob saw between th acadamy & LangPo
(i hypothesized it was because of the importance of critical
discourse to both); and that triggered th rehash--seemingly
just using th 2 terms in the same sentance provoked.  seemed
misplaced to me at the time, but i read it to mean that it's
still a point ov (con)tension w/in the list.  i admit i stopped
reading the individ posts; but the fact ov the recurring
event still seems notworthy...

[&&, i equally have no use fr the various cat&dog fights etc...
pretty quick w/ the delete key, tho, rather than unsubing--& while
not reading the posts hard, still noting the event, which then
colors other less flammable posts by those authors... ]

i'd be _most_ grateful for any parts ov that conversation that
you might be able to share w/ me... i think i brought up homophonic
translation here on poetics, and is still of personal interest...

th idea of a single & unitary "current generation" seems at heart
of many of th misunderstandings here on th list...  despite its
genesis in a social space where Language Poetry is "the commonest
thing in the world", i think the list is much less that sort ov
space now, and even less is the world at large...   if we havent
agreed on our terms (what subset of poetry? what poetic community?)
we're not havin a conversation, we're just talking.

anyway, glad fr yr words, hope they're responded to thoughtfully...

Thanks to our tax dollars at play (then and now), I will be in Seattle on
Friday, August 23rd & Saturday, August 24th, and would be happy to give a
reading or get together with any of the Poetics list folks thereabouts
(Herb? You still around?). Send an email or call.

The very postmodern reason I will be in Seattle is that the US Dept of
Energy wants to see if my thyroid glows in the dark and is paying to fly me
all the way there to a hospital known colloquially as The Hutch, instead of
having me check at a local clinic here. The reason that they want to see if
it glows in the dark (that is not a technical term) is that I was born in
the immediate vicinity of the Hanford nuclear facility at the far end of
the state, which is where they built "Little Man," the bomb dropped on
Nagasaki. During said same period, the good scientists at Hanford also
dumped radioactive iodine into the ground and eventually into the Columbia
River (Roll on...). So, 50 years hence the DOE is checking on 3,200 children
born over the next ten years within X number of miles of the facility. In my
case, X is literally a Roman numeral.

So I guess I will go do my Tyrone Slothrop imitation. Or maybe my Araki
Yasusada one.

But it would be nice to get something positive out of the experience. So
give me a shout if you're there,

While neither flamboyant nor insiderish, I was reminded of a passage in
Vladimir Nabokov's THE EYE (1965, written originally in Russina),
which I lately read for 1st time --

the expression there is "sexual leftie" -- don't know the Russina, but I
think it's safe to assume (notwithstanding some paradox of such
assumption) that here, "leftie" is meant as a slangy form of "left-handed
person" (rather than a slangy form of "left-winger"; this notwithstanding
the novel's set among expatriate Russians in Berlin in the 1920s) --

the narrator is fascinated with the a character known as Smurov; & more
particularly, he's obsessed with trying to form a clear idea of how various
persons in their social surround regard Smurov -- for he has come to
understand that each seems to view Smurov differently.  To further his
research, he intercepts a letter penned by the prolix (& literarily
conceited) Roman Bogdanovich (who has made it be known that he
writes regular dispatches to a distant friend w/ details of all & sundry).
Sure enough, Bagdonovich expresses a view -- and none too generous (in
context) -- anent the mysterious Smurov.

Nabokov's prose reads thus:

<< . . . I skipped several pages and suddenly, like a familiar face amid a
hazy crowd, there saw Smurov's name.  What amazing luck!
    "I propose, my dear Fyodor Robertovich, to return briefly to that
rascal.  I fear it may bore you, but in the words of the Swan of Weimar --
I refer to the illustrious Goethe -- (there followed a German phrase).
Therefore allow me to dwell on Mr. Smurov again and treat you to a little
psychological study . . ."  <snip>
    "I have the impression, dear friend, that I have already written to you
of the fact that Smurov belongs to that curious class of people I once
called 'sexual lefties.'  Smurov's entire appearance, his frailness, his
decadence, his mincing gestures, his fondness for Eu de Cologne, and, in
particular, those furtive, passionate glances that he constantly directs
toward your humble servant -- all this has long since confirmed this
conjecture of mine.  It is remarkable that these sexually unfortunate
individuals, while yearning physically for some handsome specimen of
mature virility, often choose for object of thier (perfectly platonic)
admiration -- a woman -- a woman they know well, slightly, or not at all.
And so Smurov, notwithstanding his perversion, has chosen Varvara as
his ideal. . . . " [etc.] >>

(Coincidentally, the narrator was madly in love with this same Varvara.
But much more curiously, at the very end of the novel, the narrator is
astounded to discover that evidently -- albeit quite inexplicably -- he is,
in fact, himself none other than Smurov -- the bloke whose publicly
conceived character he's been so firecely trying to figure out.)

Enjoy Seattle Ron.  My sister worked in Hanford in the late 80's or early
90's.  The place became the world's biggest requirer of scientists overnight
when a new research facility was opened to try to find out why a crust had
formed over the nuclear material in the reactors.  The occasional burp of
gases through said crust, I think Fiona, my sister, said every 15 mins,
increased the risk of the things exploding by surely it wasn't 50%?  She now
works in Italy after a minor hiccup one Thursday afternoon.  T-shirts were
on sale in Hanford bearing the mushroom cloud image under which was written:
Made in America, Tested in Japan.  It still shocks me.

Men who squint at the moon:  terrific Maria.  Am I correct in assuming that
this is a collaboration between you and Dante, not a street term, though it
surely will be.  Many years ago at a writer's workshop, a very down-at-heel
one, hey they let me in, someone was intoning piously about Jean Genet the
speaker's syrupy accents provoking the objection that G was "an inverted
snob" from the back of the room.  (I can give the objector's name backchannel)

Many thanks db for your thoughtful piece on the inner life of a toilet roll.
Though I am concerned that you are privileging the roll at the expense of
the sheet.  Or are you slyly leaving room for a sequel?

the author of that post was a friend of mine, natasha von rabbit-masher, who
happens to look a great deal like me, have many of the same verbal ticks,
and who is borrowing my account occasionally.  other than that there is
no link.  really.

but i found it extremely interesting that she, too, had seen you in pink
and pearls though our opinions on that matter differ.  given that she
regularly sports white pumps in december, however, a few sartorial
differences of opinion may not be such a bad thing...

re the coke machine, indeed, how could i ever forget.  there you were trying
to be plausible about having "dropped" your change on the floor.  then you
tried to get me to check your pockets for "more change" because, as you so
charmingly put it, you weren't sure "your arms would reach."

yes, naif that i was, dewy-eyed young cantaloupe in the fruit medley of
life, trembling boutonniere of moss rose in the lapel of a roue, i was
taken in by you.  but no more.

as far as i'm concerned we're through, and i'll be returning the teflon
wafflemaker and vacuum bags you tried to pretend you'd bought for me
(although the store tags were still on them).  by the way, when i told
tasha, she was very annoyed and asked me to tell you she wanted to know
why all she ever got was the ring from one of your cigars, a used bicycle
spoke, and a rock from brighton beach.  i smiled, soi distante, and said
there is more than one use for a vacuum bag, but you can look elsewhere
in the future, pink and pearls or no.

> I get frustrated with the kind of approach to poetry that needs to maintain
> this page/stage dichotomy and cannot,

I see "dichotomy and carrot", as in, if you accept the dichotomy, you can
have the carrot. Bob Hale's post (he used the word "often" when he made the
interesting if general statements about performance poetry) proposed the
idea that poetry need not be produced in the same time-economy as comedy.
Is Bob wrong to say that slam poetry (which is a distinct category of
performance poetry? no, but only some performance poets participated in
slams -- pace Charles Alexander) shares many trappings with stand-up
comedy.

The audience has a clearer contract with the stand up comedian, though --
you go (or you change the channel) and within say a minute, you laugh, or
you can start talking to your date (or change the channel again). What is
the audience's contract with the performance poet? Give me some crazy
words, give me a narrative describing how you had a strong and easily
identifiable emotion, talk too fast -- what?

Implicit in Bob's description of performance poetry is the idea that a poet
is better off where the contract is clearer -- i.e. where the audience
knows that they don't know the rules. (Viz Rod Smith's post -- inspiration
comes from listening to Bird -- bop ((like abstract expression)) being a
systematization of surprise ((or maybe just a few simultaneous incarnations
of Shiva in the world?)) -- the jazz audience contracting to have their
minds blown -- to know that they werent' going to know -- to be ok with
that -- the parallels between bop and serialism?)

Julie's (was it Hugh's?) account of heckling by guessing the rhyme jibes
with this -- the poet has a harder job when the audience knows the rules --
when they can collaborate. This ties back into Mark Presjnar's post about
reader-response.

At 9:01 AM -0400 7/21/97, Mark Prejsnar wrote:

I know this is the jargon -- but is it the case? Even the jargon seems a
little like _states' rights_, if you ask the individual with this reply
address. But assuming that the jargon describes something about the
relationships between writer work and reader, what would that collaboration
be? (No fair citing O'Hara's Lucky Pierre -- not all of us went to
adventurous schools) Filling in the blank spaces on the page (in a work
like Bruce Andrews' _Tizzy Boost_)? Coming up with one's own brutal
one-liners (in a work like Bruce Andrews' _I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut
Up, (or, Social Romanticism)_)?

I'm assuming, Joel Kuszai, that when you ask what the meaning is of doing
homophonic translation *now*, you're referring to a couple of things *in
the air* (or rather, in magazines and books) lately. One is Marjorie
Perloff's idea (quoted in David Kellogg's Diacritics article; thanks for
the offprint, David) that one must figure out what language game is the one
to be playing *now*. Another might be Andrews' gonzo homophonic translation
of the entirety of Dante's Paradiso.

To ask the meaning is to assume there is one, or that there's a process
going on and what set it off is interesting and what will follow it is
interesting. Maybe the meaning going on is sluggish? Maybe the critical
will to proscribe (to place bets on?) what goes on *now* is off? But if
it's not, then I'm placing my bets on what Henry's mentioned, the phonemic
shuffle -- but with this corollary -- the paraphrasable meaning has to be
as unfamiliar and overdetermined as the sound combinations are -- viz the
recent work of Ben Friedlander, the lunch poems of Tim Davis, "Eon" by Kim
Lyons, practically anything by Ange Mlinko. But I wouldn't bet
_everything_, my printing press goes too slowly for that.

Anyway, to echo Mark Wallace's call for a CONSCIOUS exploration of multiple
approaches (as opposed to what Mark characterizes as a naive "anything
goes" polymorphousness -- more about that dichotomy, Mark?) I'm more
comfortable looking at Andrews' work as a reductio ad infinitum of
Pound/Olson's idea that each poem must take its own form. Alice Notley's
work has a similar impulse -- do a different thing. Those might be some
interesting trajectories to track -- any grad schools out there with cash?
Can an exploration of multiple approaches be separated out from its
ordinary literary-historical complement, the biographical/chronological? I
do this _then_ I do that? Or does influence work backwards, in the form of
_fame_.

Ahh, who knows,
Neologism or Typo

I think the idea of filling in the blank spaces on the page is only the
simplest expression of a readers collaboration and a writers willingness
towards such collaboration.  More interesting to me at least are those
instances when a writer's willingness to collaborate with her readers is
somehow inscribed in the language itself.  Nate Mackey talks about how
Creeley "registers the impact upon the rhythms of those thoughts of his
apprehension of the other inhabitants of the field or space in which this
articulation takes place.  The allowance he makes for the sensibilities of
his audience exemplifies a decentralizing impulse, a field approach, his
admission  that not only other things but also other minds exist."  So,
that's a kind of writer/reader collaboration, one which has been very
important to me, one which I see coming down from people like Creeley, and
even O'Hara, to the present moment.

Dear List,

I'm missing a word I used to know, and would greatly appreciate getting at
least its phone number, if any of you can help.

The word is a theoretical/critical term. The words closest to it in sound
and meaning that I can think of are disjunctive, dissociative, disruptive,
but none of those is it. The missing word essentially describes the act,
in poetics, of jumping from A to Z without traversing points B, C, D, et
cetera along the way. An instantaneous flash, if you will.

I used to feel really smart when I used it, and it actually came in handy
a lot for describing some of the things I am trying to do. A handsome
reward (unless you would prefer an ugly reward) is offered for its safe
return.

Thanks

A tardy response to Henry Gould's interesting post, in particular to:

"To me the langpos haven't gone FAR ENOUGH
in the direction of the microstructure, and an interesting development
in the future will be toward Saussure's ideas about anagrams & paranomasia.
Hart Crane was into this: "anagrammatize your Name", etc.  Saussure
found a pervasive subtext underneath a lot of classic latin poetry -
the whole poem would be the scattered (Osiris) fragments of a thematic
single WORD.  Thematic - & referential.  Build on it.   The poem as
architecture.  Mandelstam again.  & Yeats, too.  heck yeah."

Saussure is a VERY interesting linguist, one who, like Jakobson, should be
of great interest to poets in general. Of course he is best known for his
"Course in General Linguistics" which triggered that language revolution
which I'm sure you're all familiar with [structuralism, semiology, etc].
But as Henry points out he did very interesting work on poetic
"microstructure" too [on an earlier thread there was discussion of
sub-lexical, sub-morphemic, and even sub-phonemic analysis: Saussure worked
very fruitfully on such things].

Although he triggered a revolution, Saussure was also a master of the
old-style  comparative linguistics [etymology, reconstruction, etc.].
Non-specialists often don't realize that Saussure pulled off one of the
most impressive stunts in the history of linguistics. In his doctoral
dissertation [he was 21 yrs old!], using the comparative method, he posited
the existence of "sonant coefficients" that *must have existed* in the
parent language, Proto-Indo-European, long-dead. This series of sounds did
not survive in any known language, but accd to S's analysis, they must once
have existed, way back in pre-history. Well, a generation or two later,
well after S's death, Hittite was discovered, and when it was deciphered,
guess what was found? The Hittite language, very archaic, preserved these
very "sonant coefficients" exactly where S predicted they would be [they
are now known as 'laryngeals']! This is an astonishing demonstration of the
fact that the theoretical constructs of historical linguistics had a
verifiable basis in reality [in real languages].

Saussure was also interesting for other, less mainstream, interests, such
as the notebooks on anagrams that Henry cites. If it is feasible to write a
book on Vedic poetics now, as I am trying to do, it is largely because
Saussure and Jakobson have opened the eyes of Vedicists to things in
"their"texts that they had not seen, in spite of 200 yrs of looking.

Then there is the matter of Martian poetics, which Saussure explored when
he was invited to examine the glossolalia of a Mdme. Helene Smith, "famous
clairvoyante". His researches are treated in Th. Flournoy's _From India to
the Planet Mars_, recently reprinted somewhere.

When I teach Jakobson in a course on linguistics & literature, I suggest
that J's conception of the poem is that it is a Rube Goldberg machine [=
Henry's 'poem as architecture'].

Try to imagine Emily Vey Duke's recent poem as a Rube Goldberg machine ["a
small one"].

just a coupla comments on the always-always posts of JD & his aliases.
I have trouble relating the poet/listener contract described(?) here with
be-bop.  Other extensions of jazz, maybe (O. Coleman? Sun-Ra?) - but in
bop I hear a lot of form, control, expectations.  Not that I'm an expert.

on Saussure's never-published years-long investigations into what he
calls "hypograms" (extended vowel-sound anagrams of a key word or words
spread THROUGH other words across the poem like a kind of thematic bass-note).
I dug this up following an essay about, yes, again, sorry, Mandelstam,
which investigated the AMAZING anagrammatic fireworks in M's 1st poem
from his 1st bk ("I am given a body - what to do with it?").  Saussure
is aware of the danger of research solipsism, given the small # of vowel
sounds, a line's undertone can be read in myriad ways - but he discovers
some remarkable symmetries.  Hart Crane was a master of this kind of thing.

The key word up there is "overdetermined".  As Jordan & Mark is saying,
multiple approaches should be looked for not only in the generational
"scene" but within individual writers' works & individual WORKS. There's
no simple formula for styles & schools.  The phonemic shuffle, for example,
can be understood not only as a "subtext" or undertone but as a method
of producing poetry (see OM's "Conversation abt Dante" on the malleability
of "poetic instruments") - which clearly is related to jazz improvization
& glossolalia too.  Words themselves become amazingly malleable under
pressure (did anyone see the article in Times science section today about
quantum "tunneling" through walls etc.?) - really very much like CLAY -
and can be molded to "mean" literally dozens of things simultaneously
(I'm mouthing the obvious for many of you out there).

Gwyn,

isn't that bthroughyaphobia? i use that all the time. it's a great word for
scrabble. pisses people off, disrupts the game unless the players are so
bored that they've disassociated themselves disjunctively from the action.

<tone change here>

actually, Gwyn, i have that problem too (missing words). except the words i
forget are simple words which makes me very frustrated ("it's a simple,
fucking word!... hand! that's it! HAND me the hammer!"). i have a similar
problem with directions, with trying to visual directions in my head from
memory. most times i can't do it at all. my mind will actually go blank --
nothing there -- like my mind is saying "don't EVEN go there!"

There's a billboard ad for Honda cars that i see every day that i drive
home from work and it shows a Honda car and above it are the words:

Slam! Slam! Slam! Slam!

but my mind at first, second and third pass tells me:

Slap! Slarn! Slam! Slarn!

I thought everyone read well. I was struck by the _physicality_ of the
readers--two dancers, an ice-skater-turned-long-distance cyclist, a
maseuse,a long-distance runner : and was wondering whether the learned
ability to objectify one's body doesnt bleed over into an awareness of the
poem as an autonomous object--an awareness so often missing in your
would-be poet, an awareness that understands poetry is something else than
"i open my mouth and the words stream out, bound for poetry!" Layne
Russell, Catherine Bowers, Cydney Chadwick, Jayne MacPherson, Karen
Eberhardt--thanks to you all.

The radio i'view Layne Russell alludes to was in fact a talk on Beckett I
gave because no-one around here reads him any more as far as I can
discover.

On another matter, I am not so much "witty and charming" as indifferent and
bewildered, by turns. WWhen I am not getting on someone's case, at which
point, nothing is too small for me. I advance these disclaimer because I
shall be traveling back east this fall, & want to avoid disappointing
people looking for noel coward. I'm a grumpy old fart, but you can still be

I'm sure it's just a matter of trying to use the site during a high-use

I like the original.  Reminds me of a dialect I learned as a wee lad in
the scandinavian wilds of upstate MN : Unfinnish.
Though the civic ambience is not easy to detect on the surface, the poem
does have a public side.  Can you find it?  Down around the 4th hypogrammatic
level, there's a key theme-word there: EUREKA.  & if you scan for anagram-
vowels in the TRANSLATION, you get the following:
GREETINGS, EARTHLINGS.  BOW DOWN BEFORE YOUR MASTERS, THE RULERS OF MARS.
(As everyone knows, the poem was recited from the pod door back in the 30s
when they landed in New Jersey.)

Eliza and everybody,

Thanks. I actually got a letter in response to my fan letter to Jack
Spandrift today, and on the envelope he had scrawled "beware parataxis!"
and below it the postmaster had scrawled "beware its opposite, hypotaxis!"
and all of a sudden this koan totally illuminated me. But "aporia" is
certainly one of the other good ones to make people's eyes glaze over at
parties.

Gwyn, remember, whatever Henry says about Jack is a lie.  This is the truth.
"Aporia" is one of those words that makes me feel queasy.  Maybe because
it is faintly recursive [is that word "dictionary" in the dictionary?].
When EA Poe was wooing SH Whitman in Providence, he wrote out a
copy of his poem "To Helen" & then FOLDED IT LIKE AN ENVELOPE & sent it
to her (pearl-lined) in the mail. They thought they were twins.  SH's
father's name was Power; one version of Poe's family name was Poer.
They weren't really related.

Just nitpicking, but if people who include URLs in email messages would
include the full address, in this case   http://www.onelook.com/index.html
 then if people have their email configured to highlight URLs, double-click

I agree with Joel that repetitions of topics within short time frames can
be frustrating. But I think web behavior is such that there's not much to
do about this. People do come onto lists all the time and have concerns
that have come up before. And if anyone did a statistical study I would
hazard a prediction that a tiny percentage of people ever go back through
archives, rather than try to get answers or conversation going immediately.
Personally, if this list was always at such a level of new ideas that it
was consistently compelling for me, then it would be nearly too much and I
wouldn't have enough time for it at all. As is, I can go through periods
where I don't participate much at all, skimming for the most part, yet
joining in again when something moves me to do so.

Compared with another list I'm on, concerned with design for the web, the
repetition on poetics is slight. But on the webdesign list, it's usually a
question of someone who needs to know some java trick, and asking for help.
Then a couple of weeks later, someone else needs to know basically the same
thing, and asks for it. Often I'm glad for the repetition, in case I failed
to note the code in the first place.

And here, I do find that the repetitions aren't usually exact, and it's
good to hear new voices.

I think there's a web-sociology list out there somewhere which discusses
how people behave on the web & why, how lists tend to work and be
repetitive, etc. I don't have the address handy, but perhaps someone else
does.

Still, for the most part I have to agree with Joel's post, and say that
it's always good to hear from you, Joel.

You can easily get to JULU-WORLD, which is a fairly slim VRML (150k).
Psychoanalysis meets cinder-block.

This works on Netscape 3.0 and other browsers with native VRML readers or
with the COSMOS reader (at least), which is clumsy to be sure. If your
browser or system can read .mus documents, you get a bit of text; go to

The other full address is:

which is standard VRML as far as I know.

Some talk of dictionaries lately, and I tried various lookups with no help.
Can anyone here help me? Mi esposa is teaching an art class to 5 to 8 year
olds and has titled it "Hot Dog Days" -- it is very hot in southern Arizona
right now. The children are making drawings of dogs, paintings of dogs, a
mural of dogs, and building and decorating dog houses.

Her question:  when did the term "hot dog" (meaning the sandwich, mostly)
come into usage, and why did it come into usage, or how? Any information is
much appreciated. I couldn't find it all in the OED, and while I found it
in some other dictionaries, I didn't find any historical information of use.

Her class is over at the end of this week, so an answer today or tomorrow
would be most helpful. I don't think I've ever used this list before as a
library resource/question desk, and if anyone thinks such use is an abuse
of the list, I apologize.

Unless anyone else is remotely interested, please email me directly at
chax@theriver.com   and not the poetics list.

thanks,

charles

I found the following under the wordwizard site:

It has the orgins of lots of fun words.

hot dog - the American version for frankfurter

Question:

What is the derivation of "hot dog" I have several students (ESL) that I am
tutoring and I con't explain this term to them.

Frederick Gilmore (Traverse City - U.S.A.)
Mar 16, 1997

Answer:

This is the enrty from my forthcoming Casell's Dictionary of Slang (pub. 1998)

hot dog n. [late 19C+] (orig. US) a spiced, heated sausage, served on a
split roll and garnished, traditionally, with 'rags and paint': sauerkraut
and mustard;

2. the penis (cf. HIDE THE HOT DOG).

Ety:

[SE since c. 1939, when it was served under that name by the Coney Island
Chamber of Commerce to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his guests, King
George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England, the hot dog started life as
slang. It probably comes from heavy-handed mid-19C humour focussing on the
supposed use of horse- and dog-meat as sausage filling, a concept that was
accentuated by the 1843 scandal concerning the use of dog-meat for human
consumption. The image was intensified by the use c. 1860 by German
immigrants of hundewurst: dog sausage to mean smoked frankfurter sausages
(larger sausages were pferdwurst: horse baloney); the dachshund, of course
was a `sausage dog']

Yep, and all this sophisticated sensitivity makes us British Columbians
feel all warm and fuzzy, because Hanford is just a few kilometers from us.
Or as a USAmerican fisher said on Canadian TV last night: "You people have
been living under our wing forever." We love things like that.

1976 OED Supplement:
1.a. -N. Amer. slang_ ...1896 W.C. Gore in _Inlander_, _Hot Dog_, good,
superior. "He has made some hot-dog drawings for---.'
1900 _Dialect Notes_ II. 1. One very proficient in certain things. 2. A hot
sausage. 3. A hard student. 4. A conceited person. (followed by several
examples of 1.)
2. A hot sausage enclosed as a sandwich in a bread roll. orig. _U.S._

Examples that follow, from O.Henry in 1908, Sinclair Lewis (Main Street, no
less) in 1920, and three others in the twenties and early thirties, suggest
that it was firmly established in its present senses by then. The guess as
to origin in Dodie's communication is as good as any; could also be that the
"hot dog" was the leader of the pack, or a good dog in the dog-fight ring,
and got applied to the sausage as an approbation.
Aldon--more on "Coney Islands?" I've never heard the usage. I would guess
that it comes from the brand-name "Coney Island Franks" from the '70s, I think.

Charles, et al:

According to my Webster's new collegiate, the use of "Hot dog" as
exclamation traces back to 1906, while the verb "to hot dog" dates from
1962.

        Yesterday re paronomasia i noted the use of this in some
contemporary Russian poetry.  not having the reference to hand was not
specific (i.e. not poetic practice which is specific) so here is an
excellent reference that may be of much use to those interested:

        Vsevolod Nekrasov, Master Paronymist

by Gerald Janecek
         in Slavic and East European Journal Volume 33 Number 2
         Summer 1989 275-292


        From Professor Janecek i understand the essay will be included as
well in a forthcoming collection of his essays.
        I would also very highly recommened to anyone interested in
Russian Futurism his most recent book from San Diego State UP
        Zaum  The Transrational Poetry of Russian Futurism
        The book is for most part focused on this writer's exemplar
Kruchonykh.  Examples of Kruchonykh's work and excerpts from Professor
Janecek's book may be found at Light and Dust Mobile Anthology of Poetry at
        http://www.thing.net/~grist/homekarl.htm

        Henry Gould noted re anagram a book by John Irwin on Borges and
Poe to which add a very high recommendation for another book of Irwin's
American Hieroglyphs which is concerned with the influence of the then
recently translated Egyptian hieroglyphs on the writers of the "American
Renaissance"--esp. Melville and Poe's Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.
        Robert Smithson in his great essay (concerns art as well as
poetry and poets writing art criticism) "A Sedimentation of the Mind:
Earth Projects" recommends Poe's book as excellent art criticism and
presentation of "proto-earthwords".

To add to DBC and MD's lists, Craig Raine is one of the more recent
self-proclaimed martianists .. in his case tho Mars is not so much a trope
of alterity as it is a chance to anthropologize and enstrange our own
strange and beautiful planet.

Jordan & Henry,

You're both right about be-bop, you're just writing about two different
moments in its life cycle.  I'll continue with the musical analogy, despite
clear differences in how things work in the performing arts, I think the
potential parallels are also clear.

There was a time when bop was the very essence of the sound of surprise (to
swipe a phrase from Whitney Bailliett), though now it's rare (though
certainly not impossible) for an improvisor to play bop with the kind of
freshness of the folks who developed the form.  More often someone playing
be-bop nowadays is someone who learned it as a set of rules, possibly in an
accredited degree program, rather than someone who's using it as a language
system to create within.  Over time, innovation calcifies into form which
in turn calcifies further into cliche. (Late SunRa performances, for
instance, were mostly sloppy versions of swing-era tunes, hardly the Magic
City or HeliocentricWorlds). Interesting sometimes, but not always inspired
or inspiring.

While I'm not advocating that more musicians (whether they play jazz or
grunge) becoming junkies, there is something dis-concerting about hearing a
bunch of very clean & very straight high school kids who have learned the
rules of playing be-bop "correctly" - in most, though not all, cases, I'd
rather hear their rock bands.

This is probably true for most (again, though, not all) post-bop forms of
improvisation, or for that matter, most performing arts.   To bring it
around (I think) to Jordan's point, though this is my take on it, not his:
one can learn the formal structures of a style at any time, but there's a
point after which one can not partake of the community of peer out of which
the style developed.

To use a non-musical example, is it possible to imagine an emerging poet
using some of the formal procedures of, say, Language poetry, to write a
work that was non-ironically supportive of, say, the views of the Christian
Right?

I'm not (just) arguing for a simple form of "authenticity" here, there are
(shudder) those who'll say one shouldn't play "free improv" unless it's
clear that one can "really" play other kinds of music, but there's often
less room for irony, sarcasm, irreverence, etc. among artists who don't
have some kind of stylistic ownership.

(On the other hand, considering Jordan's use of a parallel with serialism,
perhaps he's thinking of listeners who know the rules as a language, as the
musicians do which happens before the calcification of the forms, but after
the initial development by the originating community of artists.

(For that matter, one of the most effective definitions of new music I know
of is simply "music you haven't heard before."  So maybe you should just
forget all of the above, especially to whatever extent it may pertain to
any possible parallels with poetry or other art forms.)

Bests,

Herb

Dodie Bellamy, in the interest of completeness & apparently despite her
better judgement, quoted the following:

Guess I've lead a sheltered life or something, but when, or more likely,
where (& does anyone know if the Dictionary of American Regional English is
available online?) I was growing up, the expression wasn't "hide the hot
dog," but "hide the salami."

Anyone wanting an interesting take on Mike Gold might want to look at
Richard Hofstaetler's (sorry about the spelling, but I don't have the book
here) great book from the 60s, ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM IN AMERICA. There's a
fascinating section on the Communist Party and Gold, reading it in the
larger context of how intellectuality and anti-intellectuality have been
at odds in American labor movements. If I remember correctly, RH quotes
from one individual at the time (who was later described by people in the
party as "terminally Bohemian," or something like that) talking about Gold
as the intellectual who had MOST absorbed a sense of guilt about being
intellectual, and therefore as the MOST ready to idealize the working man
and deny his own non-working class roots. I think Ron Silliman is right to
call him a "delicate stylist," but Gold was paranoid enough about his lack
of "working class masculinity" that he probably would have been tempted to
slug anyone who called him "delicate" about anything.

A propos, a Dictionary of American Regional English (or similar title) Vol 1
A-C came out some years ago--I bought it, it's in deep storage at the
moment. It was projected for 8 or 10 thick volumes. I've seen nary a word
since. Does anybody know its fate?
It was a wonderful thing, although full of ommissions (they did project a
supplement, asked for reader input): modeled after the OED, and in addition
it plotted words and phrases for frequency of occurrence on a schematic map
of the US.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Thanks very much, Jordan, for suggesting that I might say more! What could
be more fun than elaborating!

        I think, in this case, that Henry Gould's comment is almost
exactly what I mean--a conscious multiplicity of form in a writer might
seek a radical alteration of formal perspective from book to book, from
poem to poem, or even within a single poem. It's one of the things my own
poetry has been about, frankly. My first book was very much about
shifts in perspective from line to line; I've done very lyrical work like
in my Standing Stones chapbook and in things like the Oblek anthology; I
published a book of Sonnets last year (not quite traditional ones); I've
worked with chance and "deterministic" techniques in an issue of Abacus;
and my soon to be available Edge Book might be taken for Ron Silliman-like
parataxis if I
didn't so consistently lack his intelligence. Some books I've done have
been more or less in a single structure which I then don't use again;
other things I've done shift structure within the work. I published in
AVEC, "The Necessity of Feet" a 12-page poem in which the
form of each page was consciously different, and I've done that several
other times as well. I've been pushing this structural shift within works
lately; I've got a piece I think of as a long (about 50 page) poem in
which I try to call up as many different structural shifts as I can think
of, although certain structures do repeat (I'm not so interested in
complete differences of structure as I am in the tension between
similarity and difference in structure).

So that's where I'm at. What this attempt has to do with the work of other
writers of my generation is not clear. Certainly my attempt is NOT new or
particular to this moment in time, but I'm less interested in whether it's
new as in whether it feels worthwhile at this moment, and I think it does.
By no means do I think of my own attempt as characterizing the work of
other writers of my generation--it clearly does NOT characterize them, or
at least more than some of them. But while I am sympathetic to Henry's
assertion that the matter CAN'T be considered from merely a generational
perspective, what I DO think is true is that many writers of my own
generation (which is more or less yours, Jordan, I guess, maybe) have a
different relation to the history of the poetries we've
read. And I think the difference is THIS; that because of historical
circumstances, many of us have learned about more differing traditions of
poetry than any previous generation of writers, which gives us both
increasing options as well as increasing irony about the idea that some
"new" direction in poetry is going to save or make anybody. Some of my
langauge poetry friends describe coming up in a time where repression of
poetic possibilities seemed the rule, but equally a time in which they
seem to have felt that their poetic revolution would be heard, someplace
or other. My own sense is more like I can do anything I want in poetry,
with little chance of it being heard anywhere. This is a bit of an
exaggeration, of course, but it's like what they say about freedom of
speech in the U.S.--you can say what you want because nobody's
listening. I don't, for the most part, encounter students or even
professors who are "resistant" to formally experimental poetry, or who
desire formally traditional verse. I encounter students and professors who
usually don't read any contemporary poetry at all. There are obviously a
few exceptions, but I do mean a FEW. And certainly it's true that more
formally conservative approaches still get most of whatever CASH there is
in poetry.

Non-poetry people are probably not the point, of course, so I'll get
back to the subject. In his forthcoming article, Mark Ducharme is right
that my arguments don't DESCRIBE the writers of my generation. But I never
meant them to. Still, what IS at stake in a description of such writers?
And I think there are some pretty interesting answers here. If these
writers are characterized by "diversity," then we're describing a kind of
free-for-all smorgasborg of writers borrowing from various traditions all
of which are okay. But we're not NECESSARILY describing writers with
consciousness about form, or writers working out of any more than singular
traditions. IN the worst case scenario, for my money, we all end up
seeming borrowers of earlier and more vital traditions--Jordan Davis and
Lee Ann Brown are latter-day New York School, Rod Smith and Jefferson
Hansen are latter-day language poets, Jennifer Moxley likes traditional
lyrics, Lisa Jarnot is just imitating Bernadette Mayer. And I've heard
enough arguments LIKE that to know that the risk that things will be taken
that way is real. But it would also, of course, be wrong.

So I see a number of reasons for polemically asserting the value NOT of a
free smorgasborg of traditions but of a conscious shifting, rearranging,
and perhaps violating of the various poetic frameworks which existed
before we did and which became part of our education. I'm not sure whether
Joel's post indicated some annoyance with ME that these issues keep coming
up, but as long as people keeping asking questions like "What's
next?" I see a value in trying to answer them, even if part of that answer
must be a deconstruction of the question. And the issue is NOT simply
about anxiety regarding language poetry--it's about finding poetic
structures that make SENSE as a response to the world in which we find
ourselves. And I don't think that's a question that any poet can really
avoid. My saying that, of course, won't make it so--I think where Mark D's
point about diversity has the drop on me is that MY conviction about what
matters will never be everybody else's. Thankfully, I guess, and not, I
guess.

About Sun Ra: there's an interesting new biography of him [I forget the

rolling upward in exasperation, that he was born and raised right here on
earth.... But maybe she's missed something, or has an axe to grind.

Other members of the Martian poetics lineage might include St. Paul [yes,
that's right]. He was a glossolalist too, though for some reason he
attributed his inspiration to the Holy Ghost rather than to Mars.

The Jakobson-Khlebnikov connection is very clear. I wonder if K. was
familiar with Saussure's work on Martian, published in Flournoy's book in
1900?

Many others could be mentioned, but I think esp. of Borges. Apparently he

In most sports and activities modelled on sports, a hot dog is a show off

Joe DiMaggio would. You always shout something like this at him: "Hey! You

Thank you, George, for transversing us the Borgesian "wedge extractum"
as it's called in 4th planet lingo.  While I agree that this is by far
the most accurate homophonicism of the text we have, I do hear a very
faint temblor in Borges' rendition here of "nini nini trime'ne-ni"
(transcribing his transposition, if I mighty be so bold) - the 2nd "nini"
- a repetition in miniature of an initial non-repetitive repetition -
seems drenched in a red-planet pampas atmosphere that only Borges (or
JLB, as his nemesis LBJ used to taunt him) could corral. E verde?

        one last Martian before i go/to the valley below to paraphrase
bob dylan
        Roky Erikson leadsinger/songwriter/vocalist with the legendary
Thirteenth Floor Elevators and later with his various Aliens bands in
interviews often speaks of his inspiration coming from Mars.  on a
double lp collection of work by musicians on the old International
Artists label out of Houston (run by Kenny Rogers' cousin Leland, the
label included besides the Elevators the original Red Krayola, Bubble
Puppy and Lightnin' Hopkins) Roky tells an interviewer that
the Punk classic (see Nuggets vol. one from Rhino or the old double LP on
Sire) "You're Gonna Miss Me" is about the creature from the Black Lagoon
and messages from Mars
        There are two volumes out now of Roky's writings. (Can't recall
the publisher.) He has moved from Houston to Austin--maybe too much
competition from the NASA crowd in Houston for Martian messages?
        There is a tribute CD/double cassette out for Roky and many great
covers of his work.  For "You're Gonna Miss Me" see DMZ--the lp and
various live recordings and the Nomads Stagger in the Snow collection.
Also one by Doug Sahm on Border Wave lp.
        Then there was "Flying Saucers Rock and Roll" by Billy Lee Riley
and His Little Green Men" . . .  which you can get on most Sun rockabilly
collections . . .

Well, if we're going to go /there/, i.e. popular music shedding light on a
Martian poetics, somebody better bring a copy of /Mars Hotel/ by the
Grateful Dead--an instance of Perec-like linguistic play on the cover,
which, if held up to a mirror, spells "Ugly Rumors."

I believe this is a project whose home for a long time, and perhaps still,
was at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It was under the direction of
Fred Cassady for years, perhaps decades, and the research was so thorough
that it seemed everyone knew this was a project that volumes might be
issued years apart from one another. But that was about as much as I knew
about its status about 16 or so years ago. Now? I don't know -- any
Wisconsin folk on this list who know about it?

This reminds me of a dinner my mother used to make which she called "pig
in a blanket." It was a sausage in Yorkshire pudding. For you Yanks (I'm
one, too, but the only one in my family born in the States), Yorkshire
pudding is more like a muffin than a pudding. Found out years later from a
Scottish co-worker, that his folks called the same dinner, "toad in a
hole."

It tastes better than it sounds. But then again, it is English fare.

TTFN,
Steven

In the midwest and in California, the two dialects I'm most familiar with,
hot dogs in a corn batter are called corn dogs.

Little dogs with dough wrapped around them are called pigs in the blanket,
a term I find jarring because, being raised in the Melting Pot, when we
spoke of pigs in the blanket, we meant stuffed cabbages.

I would love to lie with Julu, unfold
Her flap of skin from where it joins
This perineum, or Jennifer, unstitched
In that vast region between one nipple
And the other's vacancy and stare;
Still, somewhere bleak I recognize
These impulses as extra-current voices
Ceasing precisely at a certain temperature,
Beginning once again as world and room fall quiet
And my too comfortable bed holds all at once.
O Julu, I would cry, O Jennifer, and turning
Then from one unto the other, homeward-bound,
I'd once again be whole and hole identical,
The perfect rose within the perfect vase,
Or perfect home within a perfect vale.
But now, I wake, another scar appears
Across my bleak pleateaus of sheltered skins,
And it will take until my death reigns down
For such writing to complete, to cease -
Then, and only then, will others come
And read my body, what I could not, across
The corpse of Alan, Julu, Jennifer.
I write myself for you, and you, I think;
I cannot read these letters that I write -
They were not meant for me, what may contain
The vast appeal of great uncertain worlds,
Which I could be but vessel, channel, woman,
Of Julu, Jennifer, Alan, tribe of woman,
Not that a story would not have started forth
From half-dead lips, breath, pale exhalation;
The flap of skin, the surgery, is all
The fuel I have left, as well as memory
Of fuel, triad, scar, and conflagration.

Actually, they're the same thing, in that they both operate under an agreed
upon set of rules.  In parliamentary debate you have a loyal opposition,
who hopefully is just that:  they disagree with you, but they're not going
to overthrow the state either, and they have as much an investment in the
structures and institutions in the society as the ruling party.

I think this is a valuable concept to understand when thinking about poetry
and poetics, specifically when considering the way we all interact with
each other, and the way in which people outside of our communities interact
with us.

There's a lot of poetry I like, and there's a lot I don't, but at a
fundamental level there is just poetry and the forces trying to silence it.

To illustrate my point: a short while ago there was much discussion about
APR, both good and ill, particularly towards the type of writing it
published.  Would we be better off if it ceased publication?  How about
Poetryflash (which nearly did cease publication) or any other journal,
reading series, publisher?  Would we be better off if the Green Mill or the
Nuyorican Cafe got out of the poetry business?  If a goodly number of MFA
programs went defunct?  How 'bout this list?

From an institutional level, I don't really care about what people write
about or how well they write.  All I care about is that there will be
places where these people (and that includes us) can be heard.

yes, corndogs! and at the MN State Fair, it is de rigueur to eat them "on a
stick" --that is, impaled on a disposable, slender wooden wand.  this
obviates the need for a protective bun of dough to hold while mustard,
ketchup, sauerkraut and juice from punctured dog splatters the face and
potentially the hands.  that is, the corn dog has none of the above, just a
husk of corn batter and a stick.  other Fair food includes "wisconsin
cheese curds" (plastic bags of inch-long/wide bits of cheese),
"mini-donuts" (or "minnedonuts," heavily sugared and made right in front of
you!  and all the milk you can drink for $.25.  one of the hilites of the
fair is the array of butter sculptures of Miss Dairy 1997. (i always thot
dylan was making up the butter sculpture concept in Tarantula).

Toad In the Hole is a local English Country dance band that i sometimes

Well, my Scottish mother used to cut a hole in a piece of bread and fry an
egg in it - that's what a toad in the hole must be on the Partick side of
Glasgow...but it's a good name for your band...In Sydney at the Royal Easter
Show they used to call the NZ version of a hot dog - saveloys in batter -
"Pluto Pups" or "Dagwood Dogs" - they were on little plywood sticks and
covered in tomato sauce...urk

Very much pleased by Herb's notes on be-bop.

Maybe go as far as (or toward) sense that even recordings of great bop,
such as Bird and Diz on "salt peanuts" are never as good as hearing it
really cooking live, when the surprises even surprise the hornist.

That's what they are called everywhere I have lived, including here. Some
people like to dip 'em in something, like, say honey-Dijon or salsa.

This is difficult to manipulate; the planes must be examined from the

Re various threads:  DARE is now 3 volumes, from Harvard UP.  Random House
has a comparable project, a Historical Dictionary of American Slang, but
DARE is the standard.  Volume 3 is through O, so too early for pigs in a
blanket, but I remember clearly the picture of these items from my Betty
Crocker Boys & Girls cookbook and they were full-size dogs in biscuit dough.
Of course Chicago has red hots too.  And isn't the Sun Ra bio by John Swed?

Apropos of DARE, there is a great journal out of the University of Alabama
Press (editorial at Duke) published for the American Dialect Society,
American Speech: A Quarterly of Linguistic Usage.  At $20/year it is a slang
maven's dream for its "Among the New Words" feature at the back of the book.
Its papers are often amazing too: the winter 1996 includes "Transmission
Languages and Source Languages of Chinese Borrowings in English," "Cultural
Sensitivity and Political Correctness: The Linguistic Problem of Naming,"
and "The Development of the Strong Obligation System in American English."
Although I admit I first tracked it down for an article on regional
differences in current teenagers' slang for penis, the gamut keeps me in its
debt.

I just assumed everyone grew up with these as standard fare every couple of
weeks in their public school cafeterias. And they're still present, as my
elementary school daughter knows.

I first came upon corndogs, so yclept, as an adult at New England county
fairs. Be interesting to know what the geographic vector was. Little
cocktail franks wrapped in dough and deep-fried were a standard at Bar
Mitzvahs. I don't remember what we called them, certainly not pigs in a
blanket, a term I learned only when my world became more cosmopolitan.
My first wife used to reminisce about the round of competitive Bar Mitzvah
receptions that she went to, each more elaborate than the last. At the
penultimate one there were huge swans carved out of ice. The final Bar
Mitzvah featured a life-size sculpture of the Bar Mitzvah boy in full
regalia. He was the presumptive heir to the Joyva Halvah fortune, and that
was the medium in which the sculptor worked.
What's the phrase, "no flies on him?"

much autobiography as it is fiction).  As he later told it, he had 'no
politics. . .except hunger' until he was nineteen..."

Very odd.  Found this, from Katherine Anne Porter, which seems to
support the Hofstadter:

"Once on the picket line, I took a good look at the crowd moving slowly
forward. I wouldn't have expected to see some of them on the same
street, much less the same picket line and in the same jail. I knew very
few people in that first picket line, but I remember Lola Ridge, John
Dos Passos, Paxton Hibben, Michael Gold, Helen O'Lochlain Crowe, James
Rorty, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Willie Gropper, Grace Lumpkin, all very
well known then and mostly favorably--most of them have vanished, and I
wonder who but me is alive to remember them now? I have a strangely
tender memory of them all, as well as the faces of strangers who were
being led away by the police.

We were as miscellaneous, improbable, almost entirely unassorted a
gathering of people to one place in one cause as ever happened in this
country. I say almost because among the pickets I did not see anyone
identifiably a workingman, or 'proletarian,' as our Marxist
'dialecticians' insisted on calling everybody who worked for his living
in a factory, or as they said, 'sweatshop,' or 'slave mill,' or 'salt
mine.' It is true that these were workdays and maybe all the workingmen
were at their jobs. Suppose one of them said to his boss, 'I want a day
off, with pay, to picket for Sacco and Vanzetti.' He would be free to
picket at his leisure from then on, no doubt. There were plenty of
people of the working class there, but they had risen in the world and
had become professional paid proletarians, recruits to the
intelligentsia, dabbling in ideas as editors, lawyers, agitators,
writers who dressed and behaved and looked quite a lot like the
bourgeoisie they were out to annihilate. What a vocabulary--proletarian,
intelligentsia, bourgeoisie, dialectic--pure exotics transplanted from
the never-never-land of the theoretically classless society which could
not take root and finally withered on the stalk. Yet, they had three
classes of their own and were drawing the lines shrewdly. During that
time I went to a meeting of radicals of all kinds and shades, most of
them workers, but not all by any means; and Michael Gold made a speech
and kept repeating: 'Stick to your class, damn it, stick to your class.'
It struck me as being such good advice that I decided to take it and
tiptoed out the way one leaves church before the end."

I would guess that an internalized anti-Semitism played some role in the
Stein rant (along with the misogyny and homophobia already mentioned by
Maria D. and Ron S.), since Gold seems particularly unglued by the
notion of a Jew _with_ money.

This approach reminds me of Isaiah Berlin's(?) bit about the hedgehog
and the fox - every writer is one or the other - the fox knows a little
bit about everything, the hedgehog knows a lot about one big thing.
Eventually, I suppose, by sniffing in circles for long enough,
the fox turns into a hedgehog - and after a long while, the hedgehog
begins to think she's a lot like a fox (knowing one thing is knowing
everything).  The situation Mark describes - of a complex multiverse
of differing approaches to what poetry is - seems optimal for the poet
with the confidence to absorb it & spin it around - for the one who
isn't looking for the right group but how to reflect it all back in
the "right" way - but to avoid too much pastiche & imitation would seem
to require I say again an awareness of microstructure - I am continually
amazed by some of the ancient & renaissance poets who can make a 12-line
poem - because of the minute architectonics - comparable to a large
building or ornamental tent - architectonics of both sound & multiple
meaning - classicism is voluble lotion -oo lalala goo goo gong - Henry Geewhiz

Calling hot dogs 'Coney Islands' or, better yet, 'Coneys,' predates by
several decades the 70's brand name--they were served on the boardwalk long
before.  I think that the excellent book -Roadfood- (a state-by-state guide
to the niceties of local vernacular cuisine) sheds some light on this.
Can't recall the authors' names, I'm afraid.  Actually, now that I think of
it, the technical term is 'Coney Island Red Hots,' I think because of the
pepper flakes within.
And let's not even start on the regional variants on hot dog condiments--the
Chicago dog with its celery salt, the slimy red relish indigenous to New York,
Pink's chili (loved by Howard Hughes and also rumored to be horsemeat--see
James Ellroy's 'Hollywood Nocturnes') here in L.A.

On an equally 'pop' note--an excellent versions of You're Gonna Miss Me (R.
Erickson) have also been recorded by The Lazy Cowgirls.  But I don't believe
for a minute it's about Martians.  Now, The Rezillos' "Flying Saucer
Attack," or Twinkeez' amazing single "Aliens In Our Midst"...and that old
novelty hit "Martian Hop," there's some homophonic translation for you.

Which reminds me--is Andrews' ongoing -Paradise- really a homophonic
translation of Dante?  From what I read of his working method it -Paradise
and Praxis- it would seem otherwise.

I've been reading ~85-95% of the poetics posts since Feb. of this
year, and haven't seen the repetitions that Joel mentioned -- so I
guess these exceed a strech of 6 months anyway.  Also to note, if (as
Joel did) one sits down and pores over everything from a period of
several weeks, that's a different relationship with a listserv than
if one reads & participates on a day-to-day basis.  The way
discussion emerges *in situ* and develops, suggests the organic life
of discourse in a way that a retrospective read (transcript) of the
proceedings won't necessarily serve to illuminate.  What folks talk
about over coffee may also exhibit thematic repetition & incremental
variation, but to what extent is that a useful critique of the
discussion practice?  Also (finally) to note, Joel did seemingly get
some of the controversial / controverted facts a bit wrong, anent the
KD diatribe dialogue . . . but I think I'll let a sleeping dog lie . . .

Dear Franklin
when it comes to BA's method I'm a duffer
you're better off asking a pro
but each time I hear him read it he says
this is the first song off our new album
no
this is from my sound translation of Dante's Paradiso
is what he says (I say)
the poem's called "Lip Service" and parts of it
were in Brian Kim Stefans' excellent magazine, _Arras_
anyway what ever happened to Dale Herd?
To Curtis Faville?
To Charlie Vermont?
To Dee-dee Susan Dubelyew?
walking through Union Square last night
heard Ed Sanders and Eileen Myles read
Eileen got to say Fuck You to the Barnes & Noble marquee
it was a very pleasant evening
they both read very well I thought to a loosely assembled crowd
of young thugs in the breeze
afterwards Lisa Jarnot reintroduced me to Ed which was cool
Anselm Berrigan was there
so was Simon Pettet reclining on the pavement
Ed Friedman was a sort of cohost
Ed Sanders had read from 1968 Eileen read from School of Fish
Anyway
How are things out there?

dog to cat:
pig in the blanket reminds me of pig in the poke (they used to sell
pigs in sacks, or "pokes"), but there was a scam in which
 a cat would be substituted for the pig--unbeknownst to the buyer.
Hence "letting the cat out of the bag."

Personally, I would not eat a hot cat.

Regional hors d'oevres:   I grew up in a vaguely Jewish household in
one of the whiter sections of Washington, D.C., so I  missed out on a
 local dialect  (*).  Anyway, we did not have  pigs in blankets--just
 chopped liver and those little pieces of dense, cocktail
pumpernickel.  It isn't too hard to figure out where the term
"chopped liver" comes from; but had we HAD pigs in the blanket, I
would have been preoccupied. Think I associated "hot dog" with puppy dog
tails--purely visual, slightly you know what.  Then, the proximity of
"buns."

We said something like golumpky--I bet it's the same word.  The Polish ones
were called kaPUsta, the Hungarian (made with sauerkraut) ones called
KApusta.

and in Italy, if the meat was over 75 years old, it was called "attsa KAPUTSA".
That is, until around 1912, when they started the Milan Chuwowzi Pup races,
which involved literally thousands of lil weenie dogs from Venice running
their buns off around Piazza della Spliatza.  4 sectors of the city would
compete ferociously year after year, & this, according to Dr. Simonetta
Frankcesca-Giuliani of Torno Ospedale, was instrumental in preserving
them links for at least another ten years of active bird-doggin'.

Actually, there used to be a stand outside the Cliff House out by the ocean
here in SF where they sold the *best* corn dogs and they were called Pronto
Pups, which may be a brandname.  This was before I was a vegetarian--now I
eat Tofu Pups and Smart Dogs.  The stand may still be there, I haven't been

Yeah, I remember those.  Meanwhile back at the tofu corral, Morningstar

I want to respond to this on the list, cause I think some of the issues
raised by Henry are relevant. I'll make a few more poetical analogies to
show this, though some of them will be no more accurate than any analogy is
likely to be.  I do think that generally, though there's a parallel
reception dynamic for advanced work in virtually any creative field &
comparing how these mechanisms work in a variety of genres and styles can
be useful.

Now of course bop is little more than the music used to cue a detective on
television, or some other culturally specific referent, but early on it was
often perceived as being as weird as "free jazz" or punk rock.  Think, for
example of the early responses to Beat work in comparison to the overall
influence of this kind of writing today.

In a lot of ways, Be-bop was very different from the jazz that came before
it - the time feel & the use of greatly extended harmonies made it seem
extremely foreign to many swing-era listeners used to Glenn Miller and Duke
Ellington. & the obscure slang & costumes of post-war hipsters further
distanced the music from the general pop audience that had followed big
band jazz in the '30s. There were long-standing, well argued fights between
traditional jazzers (called moldy figs) & champions of the new music
(called boppers, etc.) that you can read in magazines like Downbeat and
Melody Maker.  This situation parallels the raw v. cooked anthology wars of
the 1960s poetry world, or, say, the more recent articles focusing on
distinctions between new formalism, language poetry, & workshop poetry.  &
there are remarkable quotes from musicians like Louis Armstrong that the
new music (bop) was no more comprehensible than Chinese music, etc., just
as, later, Miles Davis would often sound off against the late works of
Coltrane, anything by Cecil Taylor, etc.

The work of folks like Ornette Coleman or Sun Ra seemed chaotic in the
context of either the swinging groove or more formalist be-bop, but has
many parallels with the collective improvisations of early New Orleans
jazz.  Also, though its not fun (& probably not worth the time, unless
you're looking for a musicological dissertation topic in modern jazz
theory), the music of Coleman, Taylor, etc. can be analyzed in terms of
traditional harmonic structures, though the most interesting in the way the
players avoid cycles of repetitive chordal patterns (the key, so to speak,
to bop's riches & its seemingly dull repetitive structure) while moving
within a shared harmonic realm.

The analogies of the collective improvisations of Coleman, Ra, et al to the
earlier New Orleans styles seems to me to be a strong parallel to the
claims of various avant garde writers (Pound, Olson, Sanders, etc.) that
they are reclaiming formal and/or social functions of poetry lost since
ancient times, while the possibility of looking at Coleman's work as
advanced harmonic structures recalls the frequent later reception of work,
poetic or otherwise, that seems totally crazy when it first comes out, but
later turns out to be as overdetermined, if not moreso, as the more
traditional works of the time.  Remember when writers as different as
Stein, Joyce, Zukofsky, etc. were criticized as "not being about anything?"
even though, to varying degrrees they're now readable with much less, uh,
training than previously required.

If I had more time today, this could all be brought to bear on the issues
Mark Wallace raises in his "elaborating multiples" thread, but this will be
a day from hell so I'll leave it at this for now.

Thanks Herb, intrsting comments - just a couple quick bops on the head -

thinking about the "bop" speed of change in both invention/reception of
20th cent poetry - may have seemed exc ruciatingly slow to its inventors -
but to MW's "generation" - it's all suddenly available-millenial -
enlarged keyboard both energizing & dismaying (i.e. the speed-up of
hype following closely after the bop; the troubles with the ephebe-echo-
effect (called 3-cubed on Mars)) -

chaos/energy/entropy/noise

things fall together, the hold cannot center, as S.T. Aeybw once said -

or, where's East in this yeast?  to the North?  Dizzy know or not?

This is the 3rd or 4th message like this today.  No need.  All that "mail
failure" means is that Poetics  is maxed out and your message will get sent
after a (short or medium) wait, almost always within a day.

So by resending mail failure messages you're just increasing the likelihood
of someone else getting a mail failure message, and sending your message
twice.

Not that AMS/CLLBMCS/POSTMASTER makes this very clear.

            Possibly this has something to do with the list's 50-message
per diem limit having been exceeded?

In a possibly related story, the prize for the most posts since i last
checked my in-bin will be shared between george bowering & henry gould,
although since 2 of gb's were "failed mail" reruns, perhaps henry should
get the prize outright. Each of them managed 8 postings. We realize that,
if everyone posted 8 times within 24 hours, only 6 1/4 persons would be
able to get on the list in that time period. So what! This is capitalism at
its finest! First come first served.And the devil take the hindmost.

Only an old lefty like me would think of saving it up & doing a post that
covers several topics. Heck, I still let people get out of the elevator
before beginning to step into it.

George & Henry won pulling away from the race for third place. That, too,
is shared, if my calculations are correct, among  Mark Weiss,Judy Roitman,
Maria Damon and David Israel (a quiet day for David). Each posted 4 times.
At 4 times per person per diem, 12 1/2 persons would be able to get on the
list. I should note that one of Judy's, however, and one of Mark's (I
_think_), was a "failed mail", so perhaps they didn't finish as close to
the front runners as I have suggested.

Charles Alexander, Herb Levy, is it Hugh? Steinberg, Dave Chirot, Kevin &
Dodie, al;though managing 3 each, finished way out of the money. At 3 per
diem, 16 2/3 persons could post to the list per day.

I myself have more than once exceeded the 3 per diem mark, but I do try to
keep it down.

A number of these multiple postings held my interest. The problem is the
50-per-day limit, as I see it. Cant it be changed? It sounds so arbitrary
(why not 49 or 51?) Whats the reason for it? Do more than 50 messages a day
cost the listmaster more?

In a slightly related story, I wondered if George Bowering was hinting at a
pun with his "mail" failure--something up (or not up) with his salami?

I enjoy the be-bop discussion--most informative. On hot dogs, I feel that
I've eaten a whole bunch, & am maxed out, but thats probably the delicate
stomach of one who was made in england.

Well, I hope this covers the ewaterfront & that i dont feel the urge to
post again this thursday! But if I do, it will probably turn into "failed
mail". In fact, I expect that this will, too--how fitting!  David

Oh God! Now everybody is going to know that I've met Henry Trinity in
person. Well, nothing to say except that he is 85 years old, about 6'
7" and built like a linebacker. It's that good drinking water they get
out of Narragansett Bay. The same water that probably went in the beer
by the same name and the incomparable and lately lamented Heffenrefer
Private Stock Ale which had sort of greenish cast to it, especially
under a black light. But then again, it could have been the herb I was
smoking in high school.

well, since you asked,
h4ere's a c5opy of my b6ackchannel r7eply to J8udy -- [that's a typo
joke, btw (but not a very funny typo joke, just a bland type)] --

/ / / /

just a little techno note here -- I believe the message generated under the
circumstance you refer to (i.e., where the listserv has maxed out) has a
different subject heading than "mail failure."

This mail failure is a different situation -- it indicates that one particular
subscriber's address is no longer active (or something like that) -- ergo,
that particular subscriber didn't get reached, and their server is letter you
know that said server isn't serving them.

You're quite correct, though, in your observation that the REST of the
listserv population HAS successfully rec'd the particular item in
question.  I'm sure our good list-master will clear up the failure mailee
(i.e., remove a non-working address from the list -- or whatever
procedure is appropriate for such situation) --

and meanwhile, it's quite correct that there's no need to re-post in such a
situation (but this simply provides a somewhat different explicatory
background for that same general conclusion) . . .

anyway, that's how I reads it.

This may have something to do with my WAN mail server, folks, located in
College Station, TX and maintained by parent company. AMS. Oddly, I haven't
gotten any of these message - but I haven't been posting either. I'm told,
though, that the problem - a corrupted mailbag - has been fixed. Again - I
don't know if this is in fact connected to "my" AMS, but if it is -
apologies all around.

50 is the default on the listserve program we use, but yes this can be
reset to 49 or 51. There is no limit to the size of individual messages,
however, so in general it is better to send one message that responds to
several threads, if so inclined.

This issue recurs every six months or so. A few years back I posted this
comment:

All of this reminds me of my commitment to keep the scale of this list on the
smaller side, not only because I am committed to small-scale exchanges but
also because this particular list is not set up -- _I'm not set up!_ -- to
handle more volume than we've now got.  The paradox is that in an attempt
to be open and nonexcluding one can end up excluding those who are unable
to handle the volume: people are drowned out rather than kept out -- until
Dreamworks Interactive, Inc., guides us and we asphyxiate. My hope is that
we have set-up some basic alternative sites: EPC and Poetics are two
models, firmly in place. But I certainly don't have the answers and see
Poetics as only one of many possible formats for listserve poetry
discussion groups.

***
by the way, the "failed mail" messages some of you report as getting are
likely just bounced mailed from individual subscribers who did not get your
individual post. These only occasionally go out to an individual poster,
but they come by the scores to our Poetics account and this is the rather
monotonous maintenance task that Joel Kuszai has generously been doing for
the past year. When a subscriber's address stops working, we have to
manually delete them from the subscription roles. In any case, suffice it
so say, we do prefer those list "defaults" that minimize extra maintenance.
        You get a different message when the 50 limit is reached. The Buffalo
listserve generates a message to say that your message is being held until
the list is released by the list owner.

I, too, predate the brand name by several decades, a couple of which I spent
(weather permitting) getting sunburned and eating hot dogs, garnished with
mustard and sand, at Coney Island. They weren't, to the best of my
knowledge, served on that boardwalk. "Red hots" was used in some
neighborhoods of my youth, and especially at ballparks, as a synonym for an
ordinary hot dog. Could this usage pre-brand name, have been attached to the
hot dog in the provinces so that it would bask in the reflected glory of the
place? Just as there were hot dogs at Yankee Stadium long before "Yankee
Franks?"
The quintessential Coney Island hot dog was, and is, the "kosher style"
all-beef (or so it's claimed) served since before modern sanitation and
franchises a block from the boardwalk at Nathan's. The default New York hot
dogs have always been, unlike those of other places, primarily beef--witness
the Sabrett's wagons.
"Le hot dog" is now fairly common in France, but it hasn't displaced another
exotic, the far-superior merguez, a Tunisian lamb sausage served with
harissa, a red pepper concoction, and/or dijon mustard.
To those with English stomachs--this for me is more about language usage
than about food (I've already eaten lunch). There are yet mysteries to plumb
here. To add another--why is the frankfurter sometimes a wiener?
I don't see how a cummulative (aglutinative?) exchange like this could do
anything but eat up message units. The democratic spread of webtime is
preserved, it seemeth me, by the frequent descents into lurk-mode of even
the most active communicator.

in my family the preference is for "street dogs"--any kind of sausage in a
bun served by street vendors.  for example, when i liven in boston and my
dad came out to visit and i took him to a red sox game, we eschewed
anything thay might be selling inside fenway for whatever they were
selling on the street.  That night we ended up w/ polish sausage w/
peppers and onions in a sour-dough roll--awesome!

another thing my family (well: dad, bro, and i) are big fans of are Top
Dogs.  Top Dog is a sausage joint in Berkeley and truly one of a kind.
tiny, tiny place and all they serve is sausage (polish, keilbasa, brats,
etc.) (sometimes cleverly titled: a turkey dog there is a "bird dog") and
whenever we are in berkeley we have to make a pilgrimage to Top Dog.  been
there since the '50s, looks like it, and tastes like it--awesome (again)!

Hi, sorry if this crosses other recent posts, have been off-line for two
days and might have missed discussion: but

Doug Barbour's report on Paul Dutton's attempt at a form of purist
cleansing within the ranks of 'performance poets' point up a vain folly.
There are likely to be as diverse appraoches to the performance of
poetries, as to the writings of them. Dutton's deliberations mark out a
protectionist approach to parameter formation that does us all a
dis-service. I write as someone who considers performance an integral
aspect of my 'writing' practice and whose work fits neither comfortably
into the slam / rap / epiphanic identikit skools, nor is 'sound' poetry as
such conventions might be referred to in short-hand. The binary, on which
Dutton is reported to be deliberating, is appallingly false and crude. It
also bears more than a hint of old creaky 'high' 'low' blather. It's the
corrupt rump of modernist angst. No thanks.

Hi Cris - my emails to you have been bouncing so I am happy to converse v=
ia
Buffalo. I don't think I have seen / heard what Paul has said and would
rather hear what he is saying before saying things like _vain folly_... i=

did delete a couple of messages by accident but i dont think that was one=


Having said that I agree with the undertow... there are not only diverse
approaches but also changing perhaps evolving approaches so that the
diversity patterns themselves change - by evolving I dont necessarily mea=
n
getting better of course... and as with evolution approaches will come in=
to
being again and again

and as with evolution if you are doing it then you exist / it exists and =
it
deserves attention even if you dont =


all texts are created free and are everywhere in anthologies

almost any binary is likely to be wrong... the answer whatever the questi=
on
is more than likely to look as though it should be _maybe_ but with a bit=

more processing power the answer is nearly always seen to be _wrong
question_

asking the wrong question isnt a cue to ask the right question - it is an=

alarm that you have misapprehended the context

terminologies are short hand and therefore unreliable - you enlarge the
picture they appear to give and all you get is a page of dots - you have =
to
keep saying at least to yourself what you mean by each term or you start
thinking it is real

sound poetry - i _grew up_ with the term but it worries me - it isnt so
much that i dont know what _sound poetry_ is - i dont know what _poetry_ =
is

i think i know it when i hear it

but then I think i am sane

terminologies are useful to help me think and talk about i t - poetry -
they are counter productive if the terminologies take over
the work always comes first

Mmmmmm, sounds good.  I just had a Wholesome and Hearty Foods, Inc.
Garden Vegan burger myself, but when i'm back in Maryland i still
sometimes go for an Anne's Footlong.  It's a tiny, white diner-style
place w/ a long counter, an open grill, fry baskets, and those
stools you can spin around on.  It can be found in Glen Burnie, a
suburb in the vicinity of Baltimore (or Balmer, as we like to say) known
for its high redneck quotient, and it's been there "forever," even as a
giant mall has devoured the entire surrounding area.  But if
you sit on one those stools you'll have a three-deep crowd breathing down
your neck as they shout their orders.  The piece de resistance is the
"footlong with everything," everything meaning onions, mustard, and
a delightful chili-style sauce.  When i was a kid i wld always "wash

sticky-sweet milkshakes
in one of *the* three flavors--chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry (you
know the *really* pink kinda strawberry where you're never in danger
of encountering a stray seed).  But the best thing about the place is
the waitress/cooks (and tho Anne is retired, her daughters are rumored
to still work there).  They're amazing.  They're gruff, brisk and friendly
all at the same time, and no one *ever* writes down an order, no matter
how byzantine its requirements.

Well, here in Texas (I can say that until I move to Maryland on
Saturday), texas toast is a thick slab of bread, buttered lightly on
both sides then grilled.

(Somehow "egg-bread pan fry job" sounds like an obscure John Zorn
title...)

Interesting observation, David.  I think all poets/writers do "bleeds
over" into their poetry/writing.  Certainly the physicality would too,
IMO.  Another aspect...I have always seen the
similarity/correlation/overlap/etc. between music, dance, and poetry.
They definitely bleed into one another for me.  I see it as a gift, this
bleeding and the fuzzy edges.

[This reminds me that at my reading Friday night the 25th at the
Sebastopol Center for the Arts I will be reading a poem called "blood"
and also a poem of a dance performance I did years ago with Yvonne
Rainer (dance lovers will know who she is!).]

...naw, really, David _is_ witty and charming.  I will not retract my
statement.  I love the asides before the poems...kind of a mumbling
aloud about them...almost like talking to himself.  I should try this
technique.

I think you're talking about the Doggie Diner on Sloat across from the
SF Zoo. It's actually called The Carousel, but we all call it the Doggie
Diner. The dog's head is still there, and once featured in Zippy the
Pinhead.

And Dodie-
When I was in grade school, pronto pups were served in the cafeteria on
Fridays. I think they were misnamed; I think now that they were really
pups in a blanket.

The authors of Roadfood are Jane and Michael Stern.  Their new book is
called "Eat Your Way across the USA," and I cannot recommend it highly
enough, especially if you're on a roadtrip.  Along with scads of reviews of
great regional restaurants, there are fascinating sidebars exploring the
different types of regional cuisine, such as the different varieties of
barbecue, hot dogs, meal and threes, etc.

Having recently left Chicago, my stomach still periodically yearns for
Italian beef sandwiches, which are sort of like an especially sloppy french
dip (and if you're especially interested in clogging your arteries, you can
get a combo Italian beef/Polish sausage, complete with grilled onions and
peppers).

My hunch is that they were picketing over the Sacco-Vanzetti case (two
anarchists railroaded over an alledged murder of a paymaster and his guard
in 1920.  They were armed when arrested, gave contraditory evidence, and
feared deportation.  They were found guilty in 1921, and executed in 1927.
The most notorious political execution in this country prior to the
Rosenbergs).

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

First Internet Guide:


The following is the first user's guide to the Internet, ever, dated Har-
vard 30-Apr-71 ; the indenting is slightly changed, and underlining is
given as _x_.

----------------------------------------------------




        PRELIMINARY USER'S GUIDE TO THE ARPA NETWORK


1       _Overview_

The socket connection is viewed as a device and setting up a connection is
analogous to mounting a disk pack or, in the 10/50 system, to assigning a
logical name to a device. The user establishes a connection (via the UUO
given below) and performs normal I/O, including file manipulations (initi-
ally not implemented). The connection is permanent for the life of the
user's job (unless it is explicitely closed). The user interface to the
network is a pseudo-device labelled an "IMP". Each IMP is capable of a
transmit and/or a receive socket connection. The IMP has been constructed
to resemble as much as possible the device types on the PDP-10 timesharing
system. Thus existing programs can be expected to work over the network.

2       _Implementation_

2A      NCP Interface

2A1     The user interfaces with the NCP via a single UUO. The calling se-
        quence is:

        MOVE AC,[ (<FLAGS>B8) + <CODE> ,, E]
        CALLI AC,-5   OR CALL AC,[SIXBIT -IMPUUO-]
          ERROR RETURN...       ERROR CODE PLACED IN E+1
        OK RETURN...            FUNCTION COMPLETED

                ...

        E:      SIXBIT /NAME/   ;DEVICE LOGICAL NAME
                O               ;RETURN ARGUMENTS
                <SOCKET>        ;LOCAL (8 BIT) SOCKET NUMBER
                <STATE>,,<HOST> ;INITIAL STATE(BYTE SIZE,
                                ;   ETC.), REMOTE HOST
                <REMOTE SOCKET> ;REMOTE(32 BIT) SOCKET

2A2     Operation

Upon execution of the IMPUUO, the exec first identifies the requested
function and verifies that the user is privileged to use the facility. The
device identified in location E is then found and assigned by console to
the user. If the device cannot be found and the function is of the
connection type, then a free IMP is given to the user. If the specified
name is null or "IMP", then the physical name of the device (IMP1,  IMP2,
IMP3,  etc.) is written over it. Otherwise, the supplied name is given to
the IMP as a logical name.

The NCP(Network Control Program) is called to generate the proper control
messages and the current socket state (see section 2A5) is updated, as ap-
propriate. If the function is one of those that wait for a reply from the
remote host, the user's job is placed in I/O wait until that reply arrives
or a timeout occurs (timeout occurs) timeout not yet implemented). When
the operation has been completed, the skip return is taken. Whenever an
error is detected, the proper code is deposited in E+1 and the non-skip
return is taken.

2A3 Function Codes

The function codes are not yet fixed and are subject to immediate altera-
tion. The current set is:
0       Return the status of transmit socket in left half of E+1 and the
        receive socket in the right half of E+1. See 2A5 for an explana-
        tion of the state codes.
1       Start making the connection specified.
2       Start closing the connection specified.
3       Same as (1), but wait for completion.
4       Same as (2), but wait for completion.
5       Listen for external requests for connection.
6       Flush all requests.
7       Get the next external request.
8       Accept the latest request.
9       Reject the latest request.
10      Connect the user's teletype to the specified socket pair. Both
        must be open.
11      Specify a translation code. (unimplemented)
12      Send an interrupt on link.
13      Trap to specified address on receipt of an interrupt on link.
        Address is in E+!.
14      Return the version numbers of the IMP service and the NCP in the
        left and right halves of E+1, respectively.

64      Send a "RST"
65      Send an "ALL". Arguments in E+1 and E+5.
66      Send a "GVB".
67      Send a "RET".
68      Send an "ECO".
69      Send an "ERP".

2A4     Error Codes

        When the non-skip return is taken, an error code is deposited in
        E+1 as follows:

0       The function is not available (illegal or not implemented).
1       There is no such device (IMPn with n too big).
2       The device is not available.
3       The device is not an IMP.
4       The socket must be closed for this operation.
5       System error -- socket wouldn't open.
6       Socket must be open for this operation.
7       System error -- socket wouldn't close.
8       Socket must be listening for this operation.

2A5 Socket States
0       S.CLOS  Closed
1       S.LSTN  Socket is listening for incoming requests.
2       S.RFCN  An RFC has arrived on a listening socket
3       S.ABRT  A CLS was received for a socket in S.RFCN state.
                        (aborted request)
4       S.RFCW  A RFC was sent. An answer is expected.
5       S.OPEN  Open for data transfer.
6       S.CLSW  A CLS was sent. A reply is expected.
7       S.RFMW  Waiting for a RFNM before issuing a CLS.
8       S.CLRC  Awaiting a CLS for the logger
9       S.RMLW  Awaiting a RFNM for the logger.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
[This constitutes the first 3 pages. Punctuation has been preserved. The
fourth page is handwritten and contains a diagram, Module interaction for
a Telnet-logger Connection. The date on this is 12-May-71; both are from
Harvard. The diagram demonstrates the central role of the IMP, NCP, Data
Control, and Logger modules, as well as Server and User Processes.

Thanks to Peter H. Salus for the xerox. It's unclear whether the diagram
is part of the Guide. Salus states that Guide is "four pages long," but
the diagram is dated later, and is not necessary for access. The third
page ends half-way down.

I recommend Salus' Casting the Net; he is also producing two larger vol-
umes on the early history of the Net, which will include various repro-
duced documents.

        Re Paul Dutton:
                Making a "high"/"low" distinction --I don't think from
conversations with him and his essays that Paul Dutton does this.  After
all, his work has long drawn on blues forms, doo wop, early rock and roll
and Free Jazz.  Paul has written esays in Musicworks on Doo wop and as
well an excellent essay on bpNichol in which Free Jazz and country and
western are discussed. I won't pretend to speak for Paul Dutton in re the
ways in whcih he may make distinctions among performances. I can only
offer my impressions--and one  is that he is open to listening to anything and everything as
material.  From his interest in blues, doo wop and Free Jazz I gathered
that he has more of a sense of what Lorca called Duende in his response
to a work's "immediacy and force" to use Larry Eigner's criteria. That
is--Paul has a sense of what used to be called Soul involved in his
listening.  As well he did note a sense of some artists being such by
vocation and others by professionalism.  But these are not hard
"modernist" distinctions.  They are ones that may be found in any area of
work and performance.  I have heard more than my share of interviews with
baseball and football and basketball players in which such distinctions
are made.  Sometimes the two are intertwined--as they are in Paul's work
in which scholarship and discipline are used as materials in the
presentation of a work which opens up the materials as in the disciplined
exchanges involved in the spontaneity of Free Jazz.
        Bob Cobbing said he had one criteria for a work to be of interest
and use:  "robustiousness".  That may be more akin to Paul's sense than
the intellectual dialectics being imputed to him.

BA's method ["paradise"] is, I take it
not particularly methodica. methodical.
at least in so0me instances of the work.
"duffer": (used to hear this in connection
with=97was it golf?) "an incompetent,
ineffectual, or clumsy person". I highly
doubt that you cld be made to "fit that
bill". or "a peddlar, esp. of cheap flashy
articles"? hmmm, nope. I think BA's
method is something like this paragraph.

btw, I've included yr msg below: I thought
at first that it was a poem, & in fact=97I
still do. try it out.

I have this idea now, that I'm just going
to say my work is a sound translation of
the Purgatorio. it's not. but I'm going to

that spans all of my poems & books. the
trick is, it's in no particular order, i.e., not
an orderly working through the poem=97or,
rather, that it's done in order, but presented
in another order imposed by the resultant,
individual poems. wldn't that be fun? who
cld say otherwise. if I were more prolific,
sooner or later I wld have written more
lines than are available from that work, &
someone might notice that. yet still I wld
insist. people might be angered, & perhaps
I'd be reviled in the "innovative poetry"
community, & eventually die in isolation.
oh=97alright, then, the project's off.

how fortunate for you to have stumbled on
that reading. it does sound like a nice evening.

out here things are fine. Linda returned
from Oregon wednesday night, & that's
been nice. she's travelling a lot this summer.
we had mimosas last night. apparently, 24
July is a holiday here in Utah: Pioneer Day.
everybody has off work except the people
who are paid less=97retail workers & cooks,
waiters etc.=97who have to work as usual.
but the university was closed, so I had the
day off. there were fireworks last night, too,
but we didn't go. I'm much too grumpy for
"civic" events, especially as people out here
generally have 4 or more children by 35.

the afternoon trying to hurt my wrist as badly
as possible=97which fortunately was a wasted
effort as it seems fine now. at work today but
everyone seems to have taken a 4 day weekend.
seriously thinking that I'll do a bit of work, then
lock myself in my office & read Spicer or write
for the rest of the day.

listen, I want that Arras, but I'm out of checks.
do you think it's safe to wait (I expect them
next wk), or should I get a $$ order? I have
occasionally sent cash through the mail, but
not to NYC.

oh, the poem you sent, which I've taken the
liberty of titling (fondly) "Loose Lips". very
post-"NY School"=97though parts of it are
clearly influenced by Bernstein's work (so
maybe post-post-NYSchool?).

        Dear Franklin
        when it comes to BA's method I'm a duffer
        you're better off asking a pro
        but each time I hear him read it he says
        this is the first song off our new album
        no
        this is from my sound translation of Dante's Paradiso
        is what he says (I say)
        the poem's called "Lip Service" and parts of it
        were in Brian Kim Stefans' excellent magazine, _Arras_
        anyway what ever happened to Dale Herd?
        To Curtis Faville?
        To Charlie Vermont?
        To Dee-dee Susan Dubelyew?
        walking through Union Square last night
        heard Ed Sanders and Eileen Myles read
        Eileen got to say Fuck You to the Barnes & Noble marquee
        it was a very pleasant evening
        they both read very well I thought to a loosely assembled crowd
        of young thugs in the breeze
        afterwards Lisa Jarnot reintroduced me to Ed which was cool
        Anselm Berrigan was there
        so was Simon Pettet reclining on the pavement
        Ed Friedman was a sort of cohost
        Ed Sanders had read from 1968 Eileen read from School of Fish
        Anyway
        How are things out there?

I liked the democratic trappings of the Dictionary of American Regional
English, too, and I loved the bird-book quotient of the use-maps. Why am I
piping up? All this discussion of sausage has me thinking of Athenaeus's
The Philosophers at Dinner which admittedly is at times an entertaining
read, but am I glorifying an imaginary past when I say it's perhaps less
_on topic_ than that other collection of table talk, the Symposium?

What are poems about? Or rather, what are _other people's poems_ about,
what do they do, since it seems likely that are many complications
involved in speaking reasonably about what one's own poems do. Probably a
writer can say useful things about the architecture of a poem, and the
working method, and also probable is the will of the writer to confirm or
deny rumors of influence. What then are other people's poems about?

Hi Lawrence,

I would agree. Wish (perhaps he is) he were here to put my slander right.
I've great respect for his skill as a performer.

I wanted to encourage this thread to unravel further since as through the
extension of the subject heading i feel this is part of the discussion
under 'what comes next?'.

Without any intention to priveledge performance, it is that work which
explores an inter-disciplinarity between 'page' and 'stage' with some
integrity and sharp attention to detail, that excites my curiosity. Even to
the points of blur.

I'm particularly struck by the work of TRG (bp nicol and Steve McCaffery),
as documented in 'Rational Geomancy' in this respect. Also Steve Benson's
'Blue Book' and 'Reverse Order'; Fiona Templeton's 'Recognition'; the work
that you yourself are doing with Bob Cobbing in the 'Domestic Ambient
Noise' series; Caroline Bergvall's 'Eclat'; Carla Harryman's 'Memory Play';
Bernard Heidsieck's 'Poems - Partitions'; Joan Retallack's 'Errata Suite';
Antin's 'Talking at the Boundaries'; Jackson MacLow's 'The Pronouns' and
many more

>almost any binary is likely to be wrong... the answer whatever the question
>is more than likely to look as though it should be _maybe_ but with a bit

Indeed binaries, more often than not, reveal the oversimplistic results of
dull application.

>asking the wrong question isnt a cue to ask the right question - it is an
>alarm that you have misapprehended the context

Apprehension is that context. It often results in a reading for comforts of
'home'. Perhaps it's time for more strategically exploratory approaches to
'discomfort'.

Placing of the work into contexts which offer less obvious securities  -
engagements with issues of site (and 'non-site', not to forget Smithson's
hugely useful dialectics) and audience  -  that become dialogic with the
work itself, in ways that ask direct (very often positive) questions of it.

Then there were the hot dogs served between 1975 and 1985 in Warsaw, when
communism had destroyed the economy and little food was available.  If
memory serves me right, these consisted of mushrooms and cheese on a bun.

I would like to second, with great appreciation, Mark Wallace's expositions
of multi-variable poetry. Such an approach to the art was certainly given
by the poetics of the New American Poetry, & also by the poetics of Langpo.
Yet it is not often found, & it is an interesting question as to why?
Perhaps it has something to do with it being the thing, & espec. the
american thing, to build a better mousetrap & then go on using it. As
marketable product, which poetry at one point in its social life has to be,
it needs to be readily identifiable, & the kind of work Mark would advance,
does not lend itself readily to this "trademark" or "brandname" practice.

Such practice, btw, is intimately bound up with an authentic (though not
nec. intrinsic) aspect of poetry, to wit, that, just as in the sciences,
there are _problems_ & can be _solutions_ , (or better, with poetry, (non)
problems & (non) solutions), & that these often bear a "stamp" or "typos".
Diminishing returns, esthetically, arise, however, when last time's
solution becomes this time's goal. Increasing returns, though, may be
anticipated in terms of product recognition. The poet becomes to
her/him/self the poetry already written, with consequent loss of sharpness.
(Rae Armantrout writes in her poetry : "At first we loved because we
startled." For present purposes of clarification, I would add to this.,
"And then we love because we dont.")

Actually, for those who _really_ want a poetry that bears the authentic
imprint of an author, Mark's is the way to follow. The greater the variety
of practice by one author, the greater the chance that what consistencies
_can_ be traced throughout the oeuvre, are unavoidable to that poet, the
real blind spots that everybody know it or not wants to love. But that is
difficult work, locating such, & more superficial signs of identity prove
more generally welcome.  Mark has chosen a hard row to hoe, but his books
to date demonstrate he does it brilliantly, and his essAys & postings show
that he argues for it very well.

**********

Another Mark, surnamed Weiss, writes me via this list that the hotdog
thread isnt abt food, it's abt language.. Sure, I get that, but for me,
words are mixed up with the objects they name. When I read about hot dogs,
the taste & texture of a hot dog comes into my mouth. This is why I cant
discuss Hedy Lamarr's book _Ecstasy & Me_ , except with increasing
incoherence.

**********

Is this another list-held day? Perhaps we should all send ten bucks to the
listmaster so that he can hire extra help. (No, Charles didnt put me up to
this back channel. But it must cost _something_ to run this operation. How
come we're getting it for free? If we paid something, we could feel more
justified in wishing to control the means of production, & able to do
something about things that don't please us.)

Thanks, Mark, now I know how to spell 'merguez,' which I'd never heard them
until man-of-much-travel-and-many-talents Guy Bennett (whose Seeing Eye
Books series I hope you've all subscribed to) served them at a dinner a few
months back.  They reminded me a bit of a gamy Italian meat-product called
(I'm transliterating from my family) 'gimarede,' which isn't really a
sausage, having no casing. You know, this list, especially in the digest(ed)
form I receive it, is a bit like a string of sausages itself--a long
receptacle of undifferentiated matter pinched and twisted into separable
units.  To that extent, I'm with those who have recently suggested that
people stuff more rather than less into their casings (i.e. comment on
several threads in a single post).  Since, as CB comments, there's no limit
on the length of each of the arbitrary 50 messages, this might help avoid
more rejected messages.  Dodger Dogs, not Lil' Smokies, people.

Actually, I don't feel that strongly about this, but the strained metaphor
was too much for me to resist.

While we're on the subject, I've always been curious about the yuck factor
in American eating habits--the voluntary restriction of dietary choices.
Even in cultures with strict food taboos the range of what's considered
edible is usually fairly wide: traditional Jews, for instance, keep kosher,
but they eat intestines, tongue and liver. English, Germans, Italians,
French, Chinese, eat almost anything, regardless of the social class of the
eater. Americans, on the other hand, reduce their range as they get further
from their ethnic origins. Here's a short list of the often-considered
yucky: any innards, octopus, squid, eel, lamb or goat (at least in Anglo
Southern California--there are Greek restaurants here that don't serve
lamb), mutton, all game, duck, oysters and clams (particularly raw), all
other seafood except lobsters and shrimps. Veggies fair somewhat better,
altho okra commonly provokes a gag reaction. Actually, vegetables are more
tolerated for their healthfulness than loved--witness Bush's PR-
manufactured aversion to broccoli, which was supposed to make him seem
childlike and appealing, a regular guy or something.
The consequence--limited production of many of the offending comestibles and
a food industry that caters to food paranoia--hence the listing of
ingredients on restaurant menus and the proliferation of clone franchises
that protect one from the gustatory surprises of travel. Even cheeses are
affected by the general narrowing of taste--in the coutries of origins
hundreds of cheeses are produced. Here it's mostly cheddars and
near-relatives and one or two soft cheeses and unripe goat cheese among the
well-travelled: selection for blandness, as in the distaste for gamey meats.
I don't think that this progressive limiting of taste is a product of
agribusiness, altho it certainly makes its job easier--in industrialized
countries where the yuck factor doesn't exist or is less extreme demand has
successfully thwarted suppliers' homogenizing tendency.
Perhaps an anthro list would be more appropriate for this one. Any theories?

Out near Worcester, Mass., is a great place called Hot Dog Annie's,
open every day of the year.  One of the largest displays of hot dogs
rolling in place that you'll see anywhere.  They also do hamburgers.
A few years back the Boston Globe ran an interview with Annie herself,
and she complained: you go to most burger places and order a burger,
and what do you get?  A plate of weeds.  When you order a burger at
Hot Dog Annie's, we don't put any weeds on it.

Hi Dave, fair points all along  -  it seems crass on my part to use
Douglas' Dutton dilemma story:

>        Re Paul Dutton:
>                Making a "high"/"low" distinction --I don't think from
>conversations with him and his essays that Paul Dutton does this.  After
>all, his work has long drawn on blues forms, doo wop, early rock and roll
>and Free Jazz.  Paul has written esays in Musicworks on Doo wop and as
>well an excellent essay on bpNichol in which Free Jazz and country and
>western are discussed.

But what's curious then, is that when it comes to the performance poetries
which much align themselves to rap, dub, ragga and so on  -  surely the
blues, jazz, of our time  -  there is (and here i've only, as Lawrence
points out, got Douglas Barbour's report to go on) apparently a wish to
distance such influences in terms of poetic practice. That is to feel the
desire to define them outside of 'performance poetry'. Perhaps exactly the
point Dutton is making. That the verbal stylings and the vocal projection
have most impact when integrated. In other words that such things can be
discussed in terms of their vocal stylings but become more bothersome when
the linguistic content (we could go on gnawing over that one all night) is
offered without all of the contextualising sound.

My worry is of a priveledge being given to the Free Music trajectory as an
arrival on the trail of 'progress'  -  that idea that that's the stuff
that's really going down. It promotes what Fiona Templeton usefully
nick-names the 'ejacula-improv' approach to voice.

I suggest that is both old and too closed, reductive and sometimes even
essentialist (something McCaffery also pointed out). Not uninteresting, but
period.

I'm writing here as someone who values highly what Bob Cobbing is up to,
who has done and still does do voice-based performance work, who has in the
past played a lot of so-called Free Music.

Voice / orality / spoken rhetorics have far more to offer integrated and
inter-disciplinary poetics practices than such an advocacy, if that is what
is somehow surfacing, permits. It seems far too easy to consign 'that' to
'there' as not a part of. To say that's all slam poetry, that's stand-up
(Jeff Derkson can be hilarious and so on) or comedy poetry or whatever -
without looking at what can be learned and re-applied in other contexts to
other purposes.

Time to re-appraise, re-contextualise  -  move on (not in a teleological
sense but  - you know what i mean i think).

love and love

What are poems about? Or rather, what are _other people's poems_ about,
what do they do, since it seems likely that are many complications
involved in speaking reasonably about what one's own poems do. Probably a
writer can say useful things about the architecture of a poem, and the
working method, and also probable is the will of the writer to confirm or
deny rumors of influence. What then are other people's poems about?

Hi Bob, re

wouldn't the reversal also be true? I'm all for the

Paul made here a couple of years ago - we talked best part of an afternoo=

In the interest of limiting the flow of electrons through space this post
will serve three distinct functions.

1. Perhaps this should be backchannel. Where and for how much can one
acquire Dare vols II-III?

2. This should be of more general interest. What is the boundary between
social dialect/nonstandard material and slang, and is it guarded by
permanent gun emplacements? For instance, my wife's family, from Charleston
SC (deebutante class) and Asheville NC (educated ministerial hillbillys
become professionals), use words like wapperjar and bumfuzzled. Which are these?

3. This one's just because I want to tell the story. It speaks to a social
dimension of the yuck factor. My  then inlaws-to-be, trying to be nice,
acceded to my requests for regional food by taking me to a wonderful
black-run soulfood restaurant (I forget the name, but it's apparently
well-known) in Chapel Hill (we were visiting relatives in Durham, which is
close by). I was delighted to find chitlins (alright, chitterlings) on the
menu. They are a favorite of mine, and hard to come by in my usual haunts.
When I ordered them the black waitress asked me if I was sure I knew what
they were, i.e, "white people don't eat this stuff." My future father-in-law
(we very quickly became great friends) had a peculiar look on his face which
I interpreted as approbation, as in, "this long-haired yankee jew knows how
to eat!" I later learned that what he really meant  was "this long-haired
yankee jew is even weirder than the last guy she brought home--he eats
servants' food." I was, of course, the only one who ordered chitlins.

film-lovers may also know who she is -- at least if lucky enough to
have seen some of her admirable work in cinema -- a phase which, as I
understand it, basically followed on the heels of her (long-since
past) days of dance/choreography.  I think I only saw one such film,

Subject:      Sad News - Gerald Burns

A couple of hours ago, I received a telephone call from Scott Duddridge in
Portland, Oregon.  Scott let me know that Gerald Burns had passed away in his
sleep while at his parents' home in St. Clair Shores, Michigan.  Gerald was
staying with his parents to help care for his mother, who had suffered a
stroke.  Gerald's plan was to be there for approximately a couple of months,
assisting his mother in gaining back some of her functioning, and helping his
father handle the difficult situation.  It seems to me that Gerald had been
in Michigan for about a month when this occurred a couple of days ago.  As
many of you may know, Gerald had for the past couple of years made Portland
his home.

Scott Duddridge is planning to assemble reminiscences from people who were
friends of Gerald.  Anyone wishing to participate may contact me through
e-mail at shemurph@aol.com, and I will share contact information for Scott.
 For those who may want to write to Gerald's family, I can direct you on
that, as well.

The shock of this is great.  Suffice it to say that those of us who loved
Gerald will miss him greatly.  His contribution as a writer, critic, teacher,
and friend was exceptional.  You may remember Robert Creeley's having
selected Gerald's book SHORTER POEMS for the National Poetry Series book
selection that appeared from Dalkey Archive Press in 1993.  In Creeley's
words,

"These extraordinary poems are testament to their author's passionate
commitment to all that has entered his mind and heart.  He is our great
master of detail, of why it is and how it is that the things of our lives
constitute a primary index of place.  I love the pleasures he so invites, the
wit of his insistent response."

Gerald was born in Detroit in 1940, was educated at Harvard and Trinity
College (Dublin).  He taught at Southern Methodist University and New York
University, and in 1985 was awarded an NEW Creative Writing Fellowship for
poetry.  His volume of verse theory, A THING ABOUT LANGUAGE, was published by
Southern Illinois University Press in 1989.

These were among the things Gerald was proud of having done.

Sometimes we come to believe it is our right to have someone with us forever.
 In fact, each moment of time we have is a privilege.  Gerald's life and his
infinite generosity of spirit will continue to give those of us who loved him
courage.

Doggie Diner, with its trademark (literally) 20 foot tall smiling dachsund
head in a chef's hat, was a regional fast food chain with HQ in Oakland
during the 1950s and '60s (maybe even the '40s, a period I partook of only
partly and then only in a preliterate fashion, so I lack notes). I'll wager
that the one Charles is recalling was the one at the southwest corner of
Mission & Army streets in SF, immediately next to what was then Sears and
was, last time I needed it, the Employment Development Department (with some
pretty generic loft space upstairs). Doggie Diner's specialty was the foot
long hot dog, though as I recall any resemblance between that processed
thing and meat was too abstract for me to make the connection. My favorite
high school teacher, Charles C. Clarke, aka Chico Charlie to us at Albany
High, used to deliver supplies from the central DD warehouse to the 10-20
doggies.

We call pups in a blanket "pigs in a blanket" in our house.

Curtis Faville, last I heard (a couple of years back) was still living in
Kensington and still working at Social Security in SF (right next to UN
Plaza, known locally as Urine Plaza). His son Randy was living out near SF
State. Curtis "gave up" poetry with a vengeance. He studied architecture for
awhile (which led to his last book, Wittgenstein's Door, which Lyn published
as Tuumba 29) and spent some time in Japan thanks to a job that his wife got
with one of the armed services. While there, he got into photography. But
other than those ventures, he's been at Social Security for 20+ years.
Stanzas for an Evening Out remains one of the great books of the 1970s, up
there with Bending the Bow, Sentences, Space and a precious few others. I
don't think I ever met anyone who'd known Curtis who didn't learn something
useful about writing from him, but he will let you know that he doesn't want
to discuss it, Period (capital P), the instant you bring it up.

All the years I knew Curtis, I don't think we ever ate at Doggie Diner
together. Last meal we had was a breakfast at Mama Royal's Cafe on San Pablo
in Albany.

I never got to meet Gerald Burns, but I got to know him well through a
constant stream of mail from him, an experience many others will
recognize.  When I started _lower   limit   speech_, I got a few poems
from him.  Wrote back to tell him this was just the sort of response I had
hoped for -- I'd read Gerald's small pamphlets years ago and found his
work a refreshing departure from nearly everything else I was reading at
the time -- Gerlad also sent me a number of whimsical drawings (has anyone
ever collected his drawings for publication) --

There is a delightful interview with Gerald recorded for a Portland (I
think it was) radio program -- I hope they will air it again in
remembrance --

Has anyone mentioned that he used to work in the circus?

To my knowledge, the drawings have not been collected, but they should be.
 They were included in some Lucky Heart Publications (Jim Haining, now in
Waco, TX).  And of course in magazines and newspapers, not to mention
letters.   I have a number of them, also, that emerged ad hoc and were
shared, as do others, I am sure.

Joe -- I've got one, but it's her Yale address, and it's at my studio, so I
can't get it to you right now. But I heard she is moving or has moved, to
SUNY/Purchase, for this next year? If that's true, then it's possible that
my address is no good anymore. Still, I'll send it to you when I retrieve
it. Let me know if you get an updated one, please.

thanks,

Rong Wongsawan is perhaps the master of the Thai satirical novel and has
not, to my knowlege, been translated into English.  His career has brought
him fame, but perhaps because of his highly creative use of language, not a
very wide readership.  One of a generation educated outside the country, he
returned to become an important and much beloved social critic (perhaps
because he was of the hedonistic rather than the ascetic variety). He was
named National Artist last year and those of us who know him were relieved
that he would at least receive 8,000 Baht (approx $300) per month from the
government from the rest of his days. Until this time, his main income was
from the mass-distributed newspaper Daily News, for which he writes a
regular column under increasingly difficult circumstances since his health
is failing.

Sila Komchai's novel "the path of the tiger" has been recently translated
into English.  He is best known, though, for his short stories, having won
the SEA Write award in 1993 for his second collection.  He was among the
thousands of the best and the brightest of young Thai who were forced into
the jungles following the 1976 massacre.  Nature is an important metaphor
for his socio-political observations.

Sunthorn Plu composed in verse,over 200 years ago.  His favorite form was
"klone paet" (eight lined klone), double quatrains with both internal and
final, linking rhymes, to which he added a rhyming innovation of his own.
His many works include epic tales, plays and "nirat" or jouney poems(a form
much honored by Thai poets, even today, a personal interpretation of a
voyage).  His work illustrates how tonal languages expand plays on words and
make for a particularly rich poetic expression.  The following quatrain
(khlong form):

Khao khiao khote khoum khuen   khieng khieng
Rom ruen rouk rang rieng       riep roy
Hom hak hing hai hieng         hua haad haing he
Yaang yai yode yuen yoy        yoke yo yone yen

may be translated thus:

Emerald facades twist             merge forever
Perfect, coolly clothed           dark green forest
Nude trunks and broken branches   the riverbed
Huge trees shoot the sky          swaying canopy

although the translation cannot even approximate the original, since each
word has both rhyming and tonal values, the equivalents of which do not
exist in English.

Of course, Thai literature is as rich as any other, I simply happen to
admire these three more than others.

thanks for the info on Yvonne.  I hadn't heard of her film involvement.
how could I find her films?

perhaps I'll post the poem "Wreck Beach Performance" on the site.  she
was wonderful to work with, be with, dance with.  also her partner at
the time, Barbara (Lloyd) Dilly, who is director of the dance department
at Naropa Insitute...Barbara has been there since the first Naropa
summer of '74.

talk about the merging of poetry and dance....

Thanks Layne, Yvonne's work is surely overdue a major reappraisal

>talk about the merging of poetry and dance....

i hope you'll forgive me being a bit autobiographical, it might spark some
bases for discussions  -  Working on a boundary between dance and poetry is
something i used to do more. To be brutally honest i found working in old
tea warehouses and veneer factories with dancers preferable to propping up
the bar with poets and musicians for quite a few years.

                    When 'jgjgjgjgjgjgjgj . . . (as long as you can say it
that's our name)  -  a trio with Lawrence Upton and Clive Fencott  -  was
performing 3 (sometimes more) voice writing, much along the lines of the
Four Horsemen, we began, individually and or collectively i can't remember
which, to lose interest in holding a 'score' (the page in the hand
approach). That necessitated memorised materials and memory strategies,
themselves particularising editorial performance tools. Of course gesture
became more consious as part of the performance. I'm reminded of David
Bromige's hilarious presentation on 'podium behaviour' at last year's
Assembling Alternatives Conference in New Hampshire. How a poet presents
themselves, how they stand, what they do with their hands, what is readable
and revealed  -  Bourdieu's 'habitus'?

                    We did some work incorporating deliberate gesture, then
drifted onto seperate paths. I'd got very interested in the interaction
between vocalising and movement. In fact i always had been. One of my first
things was a sonnet of invented signs, several of which repeated, which
necessitated variations on vocal gesture and physical mark-making (drawing
with the hand in space, body wriggle, constriction and release  -  simple
stuff, related to writing).

                    I was in Baltimore, working with CoAccident throughout
much of 1979/80, with Kirby Malone, Chris Mason, Marshall Reese, Nora
Ligora, Patty Karl, Svexner Labs and Lisa Land. We did a lot of work that
incorporated what i'd now refer to as physical theatre.

                    Back in London the prospect of supporting myself
through my poetry seemed slim. I had however seen a couple of independent
choreographers, from X6 Dance Collective, performing at the ICA  -  Fergus
Early and Jacky Lansley. My line of interest jumped across from Judson. I
got invoved with the emergence of what was called New Dance in the UK.
'Dance' was becoming porous to quotidian movement, sports and so on and i
thought "i could do that". There was a lot of Contact Jamming happening (i
danced with Nancy Stark-Smith, Mark Tompkins and Julyen Hamilton and so
on). I auditioned for a company Jacky and Fergus were putting together. As
i remember, it's one of only 2 auditions i've ever been to, i knew i had to
have a piece. So i prepared something during which I improvised a talk and
then threw 5 balls of different sizes and colors up into the air (like
going to juggle which is a pet no-no -  as my friend Sianed Jones says,
when i see someone starting to juggle, i goes to sleep) opened my arms in a
grand dramatic gesture and saying something like a bunch of non-sequitors
let them all simply fall to the floor without making an effort to catch
any. I got the job and was in a dance company performing regularly and
earning ok (for about the next year).

                    That experience brought me into contact with many
choreographers for whom i was commissioned to write. They opted for a
spoken text instead of music. These were some of the most satisfying
performance experiences i can remember. Michael Clark, Mary Prestidge,
Miranda Tufnell, Lisa Nelson, Kistie Simpson, Sue MacLennan and Patricia
Bardi were all collaborators at this time. I'd always be 'on stage', always
be working from memorised materials devised with the movement, frequently
move myself at times.

                    A few years back i got together a bunch of younger
choreographers and re-created Jackson MacLow's 'The Pronouns' with
shinkansen on London's South Bank. That worked really well. Initially they
looked at the writing and couldn't find ways into it. When however, they
began to actually try to work out, in a space, how to DO them, everything
rocked.

                    It's this DO thing that interests me. Basil Bunting
declared that 'Poetry must be read aloud'. How many do that. And when they
do, how aware are they of the subtle particularities of what Steve Paxton
calls the small dance , taking place in their bodies?

Any thoughts? I'm keen to hear on this

love and love
cris

Subject:      execution/myth and poetry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I know a Rexroth poem titled (I think) "August 23, 1939" which is the
anniversary date of the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti. It begins with a
lengthy extract of a letter Sacco wrote to his son Dante while
incarcerated. The poem has wonderful energy, I think, memorable lines ('if
they line the cellars with cork it is not to still the pistol shots but to
silence the last words of  . . . ' -- an approximation, I don't have the
book before me either, which doesn't make it less memorable).  It's a poem
about exile and execution, a long list, not confining itself to US history
but Europe and Asia also.

As notorious as the Sacco/Vanzetti case was (is), I think it falls under
the larger notoriety of the Haymarket "martyrs, in--what?, 1886? 1888?
Indeed the context of the movements Sacco and Vanzetti were much active in
retained a heavy grasp on the memory of 8 (8?) anarchists executed in
Chicago. (Rexroth, in another longer poem--"The Dragon and the Unicorn," I
think-- answers when some young men ask him in Europe (in the late 40s),
"Is THE GRAPES OF WRATH true?" "Most of it's true. In the book one man is
killed, but really it was eight men."  (Or something like that.)

Paul Avrich's book SACCO & VANZETTI: THE ANARCHIST BACKGROUND is a
wonderfully informative book. His conclusion is that the cobbler and fish
peddlar WERE innocent of killing the paymaster and guard, but of
bomb-throwing activity they were not.

In fact, it's interesting to learn about how many bombs were thrown in the
years following WWI especially since many seem to be going off recently. Of
the group S & V were part of--disciples of an Italian anarchist who
published a paper in the US and was deported after many years living in the
country--can't remember his name-- the bombing attempt on Attorney General
Mitchell Palmer's house in Washington DC is linked to it. The bomb went off
on Palmer's front step. Some think the man carrying the bomb tripped going
up the steps.  Whatever happened, the authorities found his scalp on the
Chief Justice's lawn and other parts of him on the house of then-Navy
Sec'ty FDRoosevelt.

It takes so long to write posts like these, with the citations questionable
but not the essence of the material and work piling up before me, etc. -- I
think I lost my intended point.  Read the Rexroth poem, it's quite good.
And the Avrich book too, especially considering how often Sacco & Vanzetti
appear in 20th literature.

Dan,

This is what I love about the internet--the web particularly--the way it
abounds with random, questionable information.  The tension between the
authority of written word and a form which is no more reliable than
conversation.

The Rexroth poem to which I referred is "Climbing Milestone Mountain, August
22, 1937," pp. 89-90 in _The Collected Shorter Poems_.

It's a constant source of dismay to me that the decade 1965-1975 has become,
with astonishing speed, a subject for university courses, almost a
discipline, as aging college profs try to rewrite their youths, while the
once-subversive and seductive passions of almost everything that came before
gather dust and are lost to memory.
Important to remember that the greatest grassroots movement of the
post-Vietnam period thus-far has been the struggle to restore classic coke.

Carl's Jr. fast food out here in California has a new ad campaign that

"funnier" a word, seems kind of, well, funny) thing is that they are
handing out bumperstickers portraying a yellow star with a smiling face on
it and next to it the phrase:

EAT MEAT

who comes up with these ideas and can't anyone on the committee to promote

that this phrase can be easily altered with scissors to create an even

EAT   EAT ? -- Just kidding, don, i see your point.

And while on the subject, i wonder what other tv enthusiasts on this list
think of same Carl's Jr.'s "all over the place / all over your face"
campaign.  What kind of thinking renders the conclusion that the sound and
sight of big globs of red sauce dripping from the jowls of generally big,
sweaty guys is *appealing* to the fastfood crowd?  Really, where DO those
ideas come from?

Similarly: our local food co-op sells the bumpersticker: "friends don't let
friends eat meat", which is equally amusing when scissored at both the front
and back ends...

Good catch, David, but it's literally true. there were public demonstrations
by hundreds of thousands.
How quickly they forget!

Don Cheney adds this demotic note --

<< Carl's Jr. fast food out here in California has a new ad campaign that
centers around the phrase "eat meat." as funny as that is, the funnier (is
"funnier" a word, seems kind of, well, funny) thing is that they are
handing out bumperstickers portraying a yellow star with a smiling face on
it and next to it the phrase:

EAT MEAT

who comes up with these ideas . . . ? . . . >>

what I'm wondering is: does this suggest a commercial attempt to capitalize on
(& consolidate in language-in-circulation) a sort of contra-PC-ish-ness w.r.t.
meat eating? -- i.e., the idea of an "in your face" gesture: the bumper sticker as a
sign of identity ("I am what I like to eat") -- so that, in a highly
bumpersticker-sensitive society, contrarian responses could be anticipated:

  NOTHIN' BUT TOFU

or

  BROWN RICE! (19 years & counting)

or even a retro

  EAT YOUR VEGETABLES!

in short: a war of the comestibles?

What I'm trying to get at here, is the observation that, evidently, the fast-fooders
are feealing conceptually cornered by science facts & culture trends, and are
trying to lash out / take a stand / make a statement / gather a following / or
something . . .  (??) -- Carl Jr. as the avant garde in a culinary campaign of
carnivore reaction? . . . (just as other companies position themselves as proxies
of hipness nostalgia etc.)

the language of advertising at the Carl Jr. level lacks the finesse one gets used to
in pages of Vanity Fair or The New Yorker -- but then, perhaps the target
audience is believed not quite as accustomed to subtlety & irony, &c.  . . .

Things is going to infinity all around us and all you can say is hell is
other people? Poems remain. I notice that a lot of my friends are what you
might term celebrating (so some of them are pouring caustics down pipes
while they do it). Is this a different world-historical phoneme from the
one that preceded it, or are we in the middle of one big diphthong. (So
that differing becomes necessary, the raison d' from whom we are all trying
to get a table? -- in that making meaning takes on a macroscopic ((greil
marcus --> brioschi)) meaning of its own .. to differ _and_ survive is the
job. Differing the long range surviving the short range tho as the priest
at st marks liked to say a group in survival mode is not an attractive
group).

Echoes of bedraggled joy?

david, i think you're right about what is on the minds of the fast-fooders.
another funny carls jr. ad campaign is the poster in the window of the
local site: a picture of a hamburger with the phrase BITE THE BIG ONE!
underneath it!

seems like a conscious effort to attract kids. maybe someone can get a
lawsuit started. you know, someone who's been eating at CJs for some time
and has horribly clogged arteries, high cholesterol, etc. lawsuits could be
combined mirroring the recent tobacco company lawsuits (2nd hand
smoke/nicotine/Joe Camel). these lawsuits would target CJ for the myriad of
problems caused by consuming meat and with deliberately targeting/enticing
kids to eat meat.

and targeting kids is just the start. i'm sure something could be worked up
for mcdonalds targeting the black community AND kids, etc.

unlikely in the near term (by & large, burgers in our culture aren't so much given
up as transcended; -- and then rarely absolutely) --
but as for Joe C, there was this cartoon in last week's New Yorker:

two boys (in t-shrts & shorts & sneakers & baseball caps)
are standing at a street corner, smokin' ciggies --  says one:

Any thoughts? I'm keen to hear on this<<<

This is something which has interested me for some time.  The entire body is
continually mapping and consulting with what becomes constructed at various
levels as realities.  In one model it absorbs/seeks out about one hundred
billion bits per second, the mind/perception at the same time swimming in a
data space many many times this size.  This raises all sorts of interesting
questions.  Clearly not all of this activity is conscious.  However, by
subconscious I do not mean the gizmo laden productions of Freud et al.  Not
that I am necessarily against, or for, them.  I simply mean to refer to a
well of far from raw data/experience which is not always available at will.


Memories can seem to lodge in the body, one can see people fall into
coherent posture-dialects as they talk about particular things.  I am
interested in seeing how this might relate to the creative process.  By
focusing in a meditative way on particular parts of the body, e.g. the feet,
subtler and subtler sensations arise which may then transform into images or
sounds.  There are also breathing techniques which stimulate "dead" parts by
altering the oxygen/carbon dioxide balance.  (This can lead to a full body
orgasm.  You have been warned.)  Temperature is another medium.  I tried
things like somatic meditations in a sauna longer and longer times (drink
lots of water before and after).  And texture:  walking incredibly slowly in
bare feet and noticing every sensation.  When doing any of these exercises,
I would avoid having any desire to come out of it bearing a hot little poem
in my hand.  Rather the idea is to open out in general, to enjoy doing
nothing, to notice the subconscious (I have an idea that it can get quite
crotchety if ignored constantly or indeed if it feels one is exploiting it
for creative software),  to remember that I have a body.

Yes and yes to reading aloud.  And to noticing.

one of the things i miss about the bay area is the visibility of the gay
community and its humor.  the first time i saw that burger joint in the
castro called Hot n Hunky was a moment of sheer delight.  Seriously,
though, i think the meat industry is indeed in a backlash, viz the new "in
the zone" food combining diet and its emphasis on meat.

The characterization of various poets as later-day practioners of various
schools could apply to anyone, anytime, anyplace, and threatens to spark
another banal influence/originality thread. The issue is how and why do
these poets use these influences time and again to write. As far as changing
forms constantly -- that's a good thing, but as a reading of your own work,
it takes on characteristics of progress, evolution and technology.
Critiquing one's own work is a bit like the transference in psychoanalysis.
This would eclipse the idea that you can "do whatever you want in poetry,"
also the historical determinism you outline is still a specter to us all.
I'm sure you would agree that history is still dialectical (despite the
power of the irony you describe), and its tensions give rise to the choices
poets make in how and what they write.

Speaking of looking for people, does anyone have contact info for Juliana
Spahr, Lois-Ann Yamanaka, Bob Perelman, or Kevin Davies? Asking on behalf
of fellow Masonites--or Mason's Children, or however you prefer; honorable

"Critiquing one's own work" does bring up the problem of recursive
logic or the endless hall of mirrors effect (if it's not just conflict of
interest).  Is it possible that in the real world poetry and criticism
work in tandem - the critics reading back into the work of the past in
the context of history & the clash of world-views in order to
discover authentic - deep sense - what redeems the time - & poets
meanwhile implanting "how to read" directions in their poems based on their
own prior critique/borrowings of past endeavors...
but then recursiveness is built into nature, & poets should be able to
talk about what they're doing, even if it's to lead astray -
& who are these poets & critics?  & what is authentic poetry?
do individuals exist in writing - or is there an impersonal standard
& an impersonal memory & a tradition implanted in languages we
are trying to re-enact?  (or overturn?)  Say what, Socrates?
Can you dance to it?  Repent to it?   ? = ?[?]

that "recursiveness is built into nature" is one to ponder -- well said.

This discussion calls to mind (you'll pardon a putative mainstreamism?)
ex-laureate Mark Strand's little vol *The Monument*, which has (if memory
serves) an explicit conceit w.r.t. how it's intended to be read, to wit:

in translation.

The book claims (as I recall) that it's really written for purpose of being read
(centuries -- or so -- later) in translation.  I didn't happen to reach the  end of the
poem (but no matter, I was reading the English original, & so wouldn't "get it"
anyway).  Ergo can't elaborate on this authorial conceit; -- but perhaps this book
does address (or skirt around, or circumambulate, or carry to market, or . . . ) a
few of the issues that might be at issue here. ...

Interested in hearing what people have to say about "quality
and quantity". That familiar "s/he's too prolific" can be pretty
irksome for poets at times. It is most frequently levelled at those
poets who are "experimenting" with language - one digression per
financial year being more than enough... Fiction writers tend
not to get it as much, and for "genre" writers it's usually seen
as a plus!

the only really interesting subject [according to the Mouth of Gould
on Wed. a.m. in Providence] despite many dixcursions & cursed reasonings
about phonemes, parallelograms, quarks of style, & so forth, is

the relation between public & private & poetwy's pwace therein [if it has one]

mainstweam poetwy demonstrates recursiveness in the turbid flow patterns
of echolalia & hype [Jorie Graham's dog has the same name as my neme-sis]

"language poetry" is a recursive statement right here [referring back on itself
into the prima don materio]

"caustic" is a term in billiard mathematics having to do with endless
repetition of bounces within concentric circles

poetry writes itself into a corner & then recognizes itself in the
strange idiom in the other room

it will remain undefined because only YOU can create forest fires

sifted letter by letter, line by line [Isaiah taunts the sepulchres
with a recursive curse: see Sir Thomas Browne on the eternity of
human monuments (there is none)]  [Browne, _Urn Burial & the Garden
of Cyrus_ - a GREAT read]    - Hank O'RI

------- Forwarded Message Follows -------

For all who have been in suspense of how the chips are
falling -- here's an update


7/24/97

NAGPS Update
Conference Report on Tax Bill Released
Kevin Boyer, NAGPS Executive Director


** Thanks to NAICU, CGS and the Chronicle of Higher Ed for help in
accessing this information **


The Republican agreement on the Tax Bill has been made public via a
report from the Joint Committee on Taxation titled "Summary of Conference
Agreeement Relating to the Major Revenue Provisions of HR 2014 "The
Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1987."  NAGPS is still attempting to get
clarification on some of the provisions of interest to grad students.
This update will focus just on graduation/professional students - a
future update may broaden the information to include various tax
proposals of interest to undergraduates.

1.      117d - WE WIN!

        As promised over the last 3 weeks, section 117d of the Internal
Revenue Code was not eliminated from the tax code in the conference bill.
Though language does not appear in the summary, this is being interpreted
as an indication that the conferees chose to leave Section 117d of the
Internal Revenue Code alone.  NAGPS was promised by conferees' staff that
graduate teaching and research assistants would be protected ("we get the
message," they said).  The tax exemption of undergraduate tuition benefits
for faculty, staff and dependents of university employees appears to have
also survived.  Many have suggested to us that the work of the grad
students on the tuition waiver tax issue may have pulled the faculty/staff
benefits with it in the minds of the conferees.  We are thrilled that the
Senate position prevailed, and appreciate the hard work of the House
members (both Republican and Democratic) who worked to ensure 117d
remained part of the tax code.

2.      127 - WE LOSE!

        Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code allows for employer
provided educational assistance to be given to an employee without that
benefit accruing tax on the first $5,250 of the benefit.  Present law
expired for undergraduate tuition on 5/31/97, and for graduate tuition on
6/30/96.  The Senate position was to make Section 127 permanent for
undergrads and grads.  The House position was to extend Section 127 for
undergrads only through 12/31/97.  The conferees chose to extend Section
127 for undergrads only through 6/30/00 (3 years).

        We are disappointed in this development and we urge students and
their families to contact the White House to ask that the president push
for the original Senate position in this legislation.  The Senate
position has broad bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate.

3.      Student Loan Interest Deduction - WE WIN!

        If this legislation becomes law, student loan interest will be tax
deductible for the first time since 1986!  This has been at the top of the
NAGPS legislation agenda for 10 years and we are ecstatic that the Senate
provision survived the conference.  President Clinton has indicated
strong support for this provision, as well. Thanks should go to the
Senators on the Finance committee, particularly Senators Grassley,
Moynihan and Roth, for their support of this provision.

        The win is not completely untainted, however.  The original Senate
provision allowed for an up to $2,500 deduction for interest payments for
the first five years of repayment.  This provision would have been
phased out for single taxpayers earning between $40K and $50K.  Married
taxpayers would have had the phase out between $80K and $100K if filing
jointly.  The conference position increases the phaseout for single
taxpayers, phasing out between $40K and $50K.  The married phase out,
however, was dropped to from between $60 and $75K.  This reduction
essentially punishes married couples if both work.

        The idea behind the $2,500 deduction is to help graduate students
manage their post-graduation debt.  This debt for some professional
students exceeds $100,000.  NAGPS supports a return to the original Senate
position on the married couples phase out and we will urge the President
to stand firm to avoid this marriage penalty.

4.      Tuition Tax Credit - UNCLEAR

        The conference position on tuition tax credits is not yet clear
to us.  The conferees accepted the Senate position of a $1,500 credit for
the first two years of college (Hope scholarship).  However, the tuition
tax credit beyond the first two years is only 5% of up to $5,000 in
expenses.  (This translates to a $250 reduction in tax liability for
those paying $5,000 or more in tuition).  The Joint Conference Committee
report says "5% credit for up to $5,000 of expenses for education after
second year of college."  On the surface, this would seem to imply that
graduate education would qualify for the tuition tax credit, as well.
However, today's Wall Street Journal says that the tax credit is
available for students in their 3rd and 4th years of college.  The WSJ
article doesn't suggest that the credit will NOT be available for
graduate education - indeed, the WSJ reporter may not have even thought
of graduate education.

        NAGPS has phone calls into the tax staffers to gain clarification
on this issue.

        If graduate education qualifies for a tuition tax credit, we will
be pleased to have something in this part of the bill.  However, this is
a far cry from the President's proposal of a 20% tax credit on up to
$5,000 in tuition through the year 2000 and 20% tax credit on up to
$10,000 in tuition  afterward.  The President's proposal is 4 times
better over the next 3 years and 8 times better after that.  While a $250
credit would be welcome, NAGPS continues to strongly favor the
President's proposal.  We will be asking the President to clarify the tax
credit to ensure that it goes for graduate education, and ask him to
negotiate for a higher tax credit than 5%.

5.      IRA withdrawals - WE WIN!

        The proposal to allow for penalty-free withdrawals from all IRAs
for undergraduate, post-secondary vocational, and graduate education
expenses was included in the compromise bill.

6.      Education IRAs - WE WIN!

        The Senate proposal to allow for Education IRAs that could be
used, tax-free, for undergraduate and graduate education was included in
the compromise bill (the House version would have extended many of the
benefits to undergraduate tuition only).

####

In summary, the Conference Agreement provides some real tangible tax
relief to graduate/professional students.  We are relieved that in many
cases, the Senate negotiators prevailed on the Senate position, since the
House bill had little or nothing in it that focused on graduate education.

NAGPS is disappointed that some of the provisions in the Senate bill were
apparently lost in conference.  We are particularly concerned about
Section 127, the married income phase-out for the Student Loan Interest
Deduction, and the decision to lower the tuition tax credit beyond the
first two years of school (and the lack of clarity on this issue as it
applies to graduate education).

Interested graduate/professional students should communicate a strong
pro-education message to the White House, asking that the President
continue to strongly negotiate for the provisions that were in his
original proposals and which will benefit graduate education.  We
appreciate the President's support of graduate/professional education and
encourage him to keep this vital segment of our nation's post-secondary
educational system at the top of his list when negotiating with the Congress.

Specific details on the message we will recommend, and to whom you should
direct your comments will be forthcoming in the next several hours.  In
the meantime, you may direct email messages to the President at
president@whitehouse.gov, and to the Vice President at
vice-president@whitehouse.gov.  Watch our web site for sample text,
additional contact names, numbers and email addresses, and more updates.

In summary, NAGPS is very proud of the role we have played in preserving
tax benefits for the nation's graduate TAs and RAs.  But we are even
prouder of the strong citizen advocacy of our nation's
graduate/professional students.  Those of you who exercised your
democratic right to participate in the political process are really the
reason we saved 117d, and your voices were definitely heard.  Please
don't stop now - negotiations on the tax bill continue, and
appropriations legislation and higher education reauthorization
legislation now take center stage.  Without your voices, NAGPS is not as
strong in Washington, DC.

Actually, I've heard mention of the "Joyce Carol Oates" effect, where the
prolificacy of the writer overwhelms the reader, leading to a sort of
ho-hum response irregardless of the quality of the book at hand.

Also, speaking more specifically of poets here, there is often a huge gap
between what is written and what is published.  Even when I keep all my
poems in the mail for consideration, my success rate is usually only one in
ten. It takes months to get a response, and if I'm lucky enough to get
accepted, six months or more will pass before the poem actually is in
print. Sometimes it will apppear as if I'm being prolific because several
publications will occur at roughly the same time, but those poems may have
been written over the course of years (I just got a poem accepted that's
seven years old).

I don't think quantity vs. quality is a particularly useful way of looking
at writing or writers.  Is George Oppen or Elizabeth Bishop good or bad
poets because they didn't write that many poems?  Is Allen Ginsberg a good
or bad poet because he did write a lot of poems?  Do all the lousy poems a
writer cranks out make the good poems less good?  Do long periods of
silence drown out good writing?  Some writers churn out lots of work,
others don't.  Some are vegetarians, others like really greasy
cheeseburgers.  I'd like to think poems are judged irregardless of any
writer's work (or eating) habits.

This is Kevin Killian and this is so true!

I was reading this book "Robert Penn Warren" by Joseph Blotner and
thinking, if Robert Penn Warren writes one more book of poetry and wins one
more Pulitzer Prize I'm going to break down in tears!  Finally, he dies
(oops, should have used some spoiler space).  Anyway I knew very little
about Robert Penn Warren before reading this book and now I feel I know too
much.

How about the Janet Dailey scandal?  (She is the US romance writer who,
confronted with charges that she plagiarized a few of her books from the
work of Nora Roberts, confessed to her fans that in 1990 and 1991 she was
suffering from a psychological disturbance she did not, until now, even
know she had!)  I say, if one could write 200 books oneself, why steal 1 or
2 from one's rival . . . the Eve Harrington to one's own Margo Channing.

>I don't think quantity vs. quality is a particularly useful way of looking
>at writing or writers.

I do.  Maybe not at writing but at writers.  There's a psychological
disturbance in writing in any case.  "Are George Oppen or Elizabeth Bishop
good or bad poets because they didn't write that many poems?"  In Oppen's
case the poems he wrote in later life suggest to me a desperation about
catching up after 25 years of silence, guilt about Stalinism, guilt about
bowing to whoever or whatever it was told him to stop writing, etc.  In
Bishop's case there was the alcoholism and the tension about keeping her
sexual life a secret.  Yet these two actually managed to write quite a bit.
I'm sure both of them had days when they sat there trying to remember in
which book did I have the image of the fish, etc.

We all know writers who have written way too much, though we do not speak
their names, perhaps due to an obscure reaction to our own feeling of
living in a glass house!  In the Penn Warren book he is often quoted as
complaining that X or Y have "written themselves out," a kind of
self-erasure like a Max Fleischer cartoon of the eraser working its way
backwards around the outlined figure.

In San Francisco I go to a lot of poetry readings and am constantly trying
to maintain my composure when someone gets up to the stage and says, this
poem is in fifty numbered sections each with seven parts and an epigraph
from Levinas and I wrote it in response to, then they look out at the
audience and sigh, oh, I should just read the poem.  And I'm there
mumbling, no, what you should do is read for about eleven minutes and use
the rest of the time to go home and do the laundry.

 PS, John Kinsella, have these charges (or "writing too much") been
levelled at you?

Thanks.
--A querulous San Francisco crank.

The over-glossing thing can turn a reading into self-parody before
syllable one of the poem has been spoken. I was at a reading in New York
State this summer where the poet confessed charmingly that she was making her
"very own Zen rock garden" in her back yard by lugging around rocks--and
then offered a dark aside, with a little laugh, that she spent so much
time back of the house out lugging around rocks that her husband (whom she
glanced at) probably thought she was having an affair. This was rather
more than I wanted to know, and I don't remember the poem nearly so well
as its intro.

o well. Your mileage may vary.

also think arrogance toward quantity has to do with the set form of print
& the idea of history, where a poem is "something made" & done &
(following Lawrence) a little example of perfection--therefore we can be
suspicious of quantity cuz it smacks of the contiuous present.  In  more
living circumstances--for example a bar or cafe group that meets on a
regular basis for open mics, where participants may feel compelled to do
something their friends haven't heard before, or the poetry in Emily
Dickinson's letters-- the poet seems to feel the need to meet each new
occasion with creative force. Experimental poetry also seems very much to
be acting on present, immediate needs. It's maybe a question of whether
the poetry is *meant* to be a single object that stands against time or a
continuous act of invention which is also engaged in the flow of it?

i myself have been guilty of such excessive self-disclosure. at one panel,
i was surrounded by other panelists, in very adanced states of pregnancy
and with large diamond studded rings announcing their matrimonial
respectability. they even made comments about it during their talks, which
brimmed over w/ feminine/feminist-theological imagery of the old school.
this put me over the edge so when i got up to do my thing i crankily
announced that i was not pregnant, not married, not christian and probably
not really a woman.  they felt terrible of course and i felt some remorse.
on another occasion, the queer beats conference in fact, i don't really
know what i said, but at the party afterward, robert gluck was describing
some text or other to me as an "abject narrative," then said, "well, you've
probably written some of those yourself."

Thanks to Elizabeth Kubie for saying this so eloquently.

Let me only add that it is getting harder and harder for me to think of

On the other hand, I remember hearing Thom Gunn read when I was an
undergraduate, I think even a bare freshman. Thom was/is pretty amazing,
but his long introduction to his poem Moly (I believe this was the one)
included a full reading of a Robert Duncan poem which had occasioned Gunn
to write his poem. It was the first I had heard of Duncan, and it seemed
that the Duncan poem was so marvelous and rich that it overshadowed Gunn's
poem. Still, I owe it to Gunn that I began from that point to read Duncan's
work. And Gunn is still a poet I greatly respect as well. So, although it's
rare, very good things can happen in those long overtures to reading.

"there are no individual poems" [almost writes"indivictual"]:
utterance (to the phoneme) as the intersection of proliferating
& un-/recoverable fields of relations (poetic, political, Literary,
& commercial radio all news all the time...). nothing stands against
time, only in it (whatever is/was the intention...)(whatever that

else's. (even foresworn the scare quotes). "evening swarms over

"enough, already" near-dread that's really just boredom. "yes,

Does there need to be a polarity between print & performance?
Of course there ARE differences.  But what if you looked
at a written/printed poem as a musical score.  Then writing might
be an aid to composition (in quantity large or small).  & writing might
make POSSIBLE multi-dimensional performances, as opposed to one-time
"unrecorded" hits (or one-time recorded hits).
   I like the idea of a further integration of print & performance.  On
every level.  Real poems never stand against time - they re-express time
& enrich time.  Why are present needs IMMEDIATE?  Because they are impoverished
- they lack the meta-time represented in poetry & memory.  Does so-called
experimental poetry renounce memory & history in order to mimic (& therefore
"play a role" in) so-called "present needs"?  Somebody (Stevens) said the
purpose of poetry is to help people live their lives (do I have that right?).
We know what impoverishment is & that it asks for a response.  Is mimicry
& participation the only response?  Maybe it's a better response than
the offer of elite traditions & values.  But it might not be the only
response.  Ignoring history & what's been done (in print, in performance)
is an experiment in conformity (the flip side of uncritical imitation).

Subject:      Re: Crankiness: Quantity & Quality

The quantity v. quality argument can get tiresome.
But when I see a writer who seems to spill out
page after page after page with little regard to
what's there, what's been written, it often seems
to me that the writer's ignoring an implied contract
between writer & reader: "your (the reader's) time
will not be wasted by engaging this material, because
of the effort I (the writer) put into the product." What
we too often get is ego-driven wordspew--I wrote it,
so it must be wonderful, profound, entertaining...
Often I don't see any labor in the writing--I know Ginsberg's
dictum of "first thought, best thought," but I don't
like to think of that as an easy excuse for not
weighing one's words on the page, for not making hard
decisions: "this is better, than that--this is worth
publishing, this should be dropped in a bottom drawer
or the recycle bin."

There are some writers who need to lift their heads up
from the page/screen and look around--to check to see
if anybody's really reading those reams of brilliance
their unreeling. Actually the internet is a perfect great
black hole waiting for such writing--it can be laid out
there in cyberspace and the writer can pretend thousands
of interested readers are partaking of his/her bounty. "If you
build it (my own personal webpage), they will come." Atleast
the trees won't suffer from the profligacy of a too-prolific poet.

<<On the other hand, I remember hearing Thom Gunn read when I was an
undergraduate, I think even a bare freshman. Thom was/is pretty amazing,
but his long introduction to his poem Moly (I believe this was the one)
included a full reading of a Robert Duncan poem which had occasioned Gunn=

to write his poem. It was the first I had heard of Duncan, and it seemed
that the Duncan poem was so marvelous and rich that it overshadowed Gunn'=
s
poem. Still, I owe it to Gunn that I began from that point to read Duncan=
's
work. And Gunn is still a poet I greatly respect as well. So, although it=
's
rare, very good things can happen in those long overtures to reading.>>

Someone asked for this before.  Sorry for the repetition, but could someone
backchannel Mark Doty's email address to me?  Thanks.

P.S.   And to up the ante some more: if anyone can has a contact with
Ashbery, I'd love that as well.
