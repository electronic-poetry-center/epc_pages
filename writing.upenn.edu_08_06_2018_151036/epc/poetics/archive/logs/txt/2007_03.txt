Aaron,

I'd say Edson belongs to a particular school in the way that Bill Knott,
Emily Dickinson, William Bronk, Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk & others
like them belong to particular schools, which is to say I don't think they
do. They're their own schools. They might be associated with other people or
schools but their visions & particular expressions are singular and unique.

Hey Poetics -

If you had to make a case that Russell Edson belongs to a particular school
of American poetry, which one would it be?  Language? NY School? My hunch is
neither of those, so what do we call Edson's 'school'?

Just wondering,

Well laundrymats and "washing"  hands etc. are interesting tropes,
right?
like dig them two washerwomen in finnegans wake yapping away on tHe
metaphorical banks of the liffey. a couple years back i and 3 friends
did a
recording of select passageS of Fwake the laundryladies gossipaceously
chattering and we did a few quick loops and popped a tape  in the soUnd
system at the local "buanderie" and lo, it was hardly noticed.  but then
again who hears or reads finnegans walke? it was fun.
i figure no matter how ya cut the finnegans wake had to be written so
irish
ears can hear it. no matter how innovative or not the building they
inhabit.
or how forlorn.
So it goes, eh? as old man Kurt Vonnegut , has it.

1913 Press is punchy to announce the arrival of its newest book

SIGHTINGS by Shin Yu Pai

a gathering of visual-poetic texts, from four distinct projects.

"The physicality of the work and her stunning visual experimentations
originate from the body. Shin Yu Pai uses charts, diagrams and non-literary
forms of all sorts, to poetically gauge the complexities of race and gender.
Sightings: Selected Works is a gorgeous and brilliant collection." --Denise
Duhamel

Each copy of the book has been individually altered by the artist.
Please stop by the Small Press Distribution table at AWP to check it out!

Sightings: Selected Works [2000-2005]

email: ShinYu.Pai@gmail.com

"Sin Yu Pai's poems explode in a hundred urgent directions, with the
incandescence of fireworks. Her book delves deep into modernist experiment,
and draws back--not out of fear nor from a respect for convention--but only
when the human imperative to communicate might otherwise be cut short. She
is a young artist, of an age when a volume of 'selected poems' might seem
egregious, but in this case it is fascinating to watch, in Sightings, the
dyer's own hand judge, then set aside for us, the best of her amazing
production." --Kevin Killian

Rolando Murillo of Murillo Design was was recently honored with a Gold ADDY
award for his design of the Sightings cover. Check out Murillo Design, Inc.
at http://www.murillodesign.com

"In Sightings, Shin Yu Pai skilfully brings together four different poetic
approaches to draw attention to the language of the commonplace and
innervate tensions in the social familiar. Her eye for detail incises the
subterranean erotics of gymnasiums, mass transit, and grocery stores. She
transports the reader into the fissures of somatic displacement that scar
the surface of everyday life. In Sightings, Shin Yu Pai delivers a rare
optic, one capable of uncanny reflection and conveying the immediacy of
feeling." --David Michalski

Review/exam copies are available directly from
1913 Press: editrice@journal1913.org
or
Shin Yu Pai: shinyu.pai@gmail.com

"In Sightings, Shin Yu Pai disrupts voyeurism by an increasingly disruptive
text. The dazzling effect of these dismembered texts, which range from an
eye test to a play in verse composed from phrases from a Chinese-English
phrase book, is akin to exquisite corpses, texts that are sexual,
unconscious, and social hybrids that are not characteristic of culture,
western society, or imperialism." --Leslie Scalapino

Am sitting in the bathroom at the library. There are
maybe 6 toliets, and that's including the roomier one
for those who need more space. Each is full and
entering I know this because of where the toliets are
in relationship to the door and then everyone's feet.
Well, clearly, and I learn this soon after hanging up
my coat and bookbag, occupants are going poop and
sounds, fart and poop sounds, start. I sit with my
eyes closed, contemplating if it might be nicer having
more privacy, dignified, and start to doze. Sleepy
and, oh, all of a sudden I think of being underwater,
the well-tiled bathroom filling with echoes, as if,
nearly, swimming, an ocean pod, felt just like was
listening to whales.

I like the idea of NOT using this list as a showcase for poems, journal
jottings etc...

I DO appreciate announcements of calls for submissions, readings, other
potentially useful info.  Though I would appreciate it if folks would not
assume we know what city they're in from the street address.

Two things things this got me thinking about...

1. does our listmeister have a way of determining where list members
actually are in the physical world?  I'd be interested in knowing

2. I wonder what poetics issues people would like to discuss.  There's no
reason there couldn't be the question/issue of the week that could be
discussed without banning other types of posts.

It's alive.

http://www.vispoets.com/

If it seems a little quiet in there, that's because you're not saying
anything, yet. Consider this your invitation to do so.

It's a gallery, it's a directory, it's a group of forums, it's an
aggregator. It's able to grow organically as needs develop.

Please spread the word as far and wide as you're willing and able.

Features too numerous to list. Short version for those of you who
haven't already clicked and started poking around on your own:

--online gallery space for visual poets

free, easy, automagical in many ways (teachers, looking for a good
place to find a wide range of visual poetry?)

--web-based discussion forums that support attachments

Any special visual poetry interest not being served by their own forum
can have one made for them very easily. Low-fi version available for
those on dial-up who just really want the text and nothing else.

--calendar of visual poetry events

Currently one general calendar, but it's a trivial matter to add other
calendars as needed. What do you want/need?

--social networking bells and whistles

Friends, mutual friends, private messaging, alerts when threads you're
in are updated, you name it. Did you know yesterday was David-Baptiste
Chirot's birthday?

--RSS aggregation w/ community commenting

Through the magic of modern technology, the board updates as
RSS-enabled visual poetry related blogs are updated. If you think the
visitors to vispoets.com would be interested in your RSS feed, say the
word and we'll get it added.

Yes, you have to register to make posts (but not to read them).
Yes, the forums are moderated.

Thank you to all the alpha and beta testers who've been bumping into
things and trying to break things.

Extra special thank you to Karl Kempton for impetus, Klaus Peter
Dencker for guidance, and Marko Niemi for letting me sucker him into
assisting with the admin responsibilities.

Enjoy,
Dan

Mime-Version: 1.0

I spoke with Russell Edson at length about this matter years ago, and
although the documentation of that occasion was burned beyond retrieval, I'm
virtually certain he told me he did attend Black Mountain College.  For how
long is another matter.  Without checking my run of the Black Mountain
Review (currently in storage), I didn't want to state that Robert Creeley
included Edson's work in that magazine, though my memory told me so.
Finally, a publisher of many Black Mountain faculty and students, Jargon,
also published a book by Edson.  If you have to connect Russell Edson with a
school, I'd argue that reconnecting him with Black Mountain College is both
literally accurate and refreshing, and could potentially expand his present
readership.  Barry Alpert

Am reminded of Pound's biped - and creeley's attention
to 'sense'; ie, that poetry has a place, regardless of
the antics to add something to both culture and the
lives of people (so-called, said: everyday).

At 3:00 every day it becomes interminably hot in the subatomic basement where I work.  Lower level three.  I make my way to the bathroom and sit on the toilet, pants and underwear all the way up as if I am at my desk and shake, try to keep my muscles from bursting out of my beige skin and I talk myself back down.  I take off my shirt in the beige room within a beige room and lean against the toilet with a silver pipe for my spine.  It is cold enough to hurt even though - because - my flesh is so warm.  I put my head in my hands and fight the urge to get up and go back to my desk.

Am sitting in the bathroom at the library. There are maybe 6 toliets, and that's including the roomier one for those who need more space. Each is full and entering I know this because of where the toliets are in relationship to the door and then everyone's feet. Well, clearly, and I learn this soon after hanging up my coat and bookbag, occupants are going poop and sounds, fart and poop sounds, start. I sit with my eyes closed, contemplating if it might be nicer having more privacy, dignified, and start to doze. Sleepy and, oh, all of a sudden I think of being underwater, the well-tiled bathroom filling with echoes, as if, nearly, swimming, an ocean pod, felt just like was listening to whales. agj

Subject:      Re: Russell Edson & Black Mountain & a query re this query re
              "what school?"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I'v always associated at back of mind Russell Edson with Black Mountain, not
as  being OF the Black Mountain School but having gone TO the School, at
least for a little bit and having published while there in connection with
the School.
      When managing the Yankees and then the Mets the former Dodger baseball
player Casey Stengel was famous for adding "You could look it up" to
journalists obviously entertained by his stories, yet taking them with a
grain of salt.
       So look it up I did, and not in the precusros to MacMillan's Baseball
Encylopedia of Casey's time, but in Martion Duberman's classic Black
Mountain  An Exploration in Community, as was sure that is where I had
gotten the idea of Edson being connected with th School at some point.
      Sure enough, on page 387 of editon i have (the first; New York:
Dutton, 1972) Duberman writes:

         Back in June 1951 the college had put together a publication based
entirely on student and faculty work called The Bacak Mountain Review.
Various people had shared the editorail work--M.C Richards, Joel
Oppenheimer, Mary Fritton, Alex Kemeny, Hazel Larsen--and the contents had
included Nick Cernovich's Noh play, Natasha Goldowski on "High Speed
Computing Machines," poems by Russell Edson and Joel Oppenheimer, and a
piece called "Father" by Fielding Dawson.  Only theone issue ever appeared.
A second got set in type, but there was simply no money for printing it.
       Whn Olson and Creeley decided to put out anew publication and to call
it The Black Mountain review, they were apparently unaware of the 1951
effort (nor does Creeley make any mention of it in his preface to the 1969
reissue of the Review.)

      Duberman goes on to point out that  the two journals had nothing in
common other than Joel Oppenheimer's also appearing in the 1954-7
Olson-Creeley publication and Fielding Dawson's also repeating, but in the
later version only with a single drawing, not by any writing.  Duberman also
points out that the 1951 publication was an official organ of the college,
and so only space giving to faculty and students, whereas the 54-57 journal
was open to and included writers who had never set foot at the college.
(Denise Levertov, Larry Eigner, Paul Blackburn, Paul Carroll are the ones
Duberman points out at this juncture.)

       So--Russell Edson went TO Black Mounatin and was published by the
original official Black Mountain review, but is NOT considered a "Black
Mountain School" poet as those among the ones chosen for publication by
Olson-Creeley are, either by direct connection with the college and BMR in
some way as well as by way of Don Allen's giving them this name in The New
American Poetry. (Allen's grouping was based on both BMR and Origin, and of
his ten BMS poets only six were directly connected with the college. )

         In interviews with Edson, and in one  a writer here on the list
quoted him from, he does not see himself at all as part of any school,
though apparently he has called himself "Little Mr Prose Poem" at times.
Going by the work as well as his statements, Edson is an original, a unique
writer not of any movement, school or style.  One can say he is a "genre
writer" in that he writes "prose poems," but that is about it.  I think what
is much more interesting are the ways Edson talks about fiction giving birth
to poetry, that poetry is like silent movies, and that it has relationships
among the conscious and unconscious experience--what he calls a "waking
dream".
          Interestingly in one interview Edson speaks of the current
situation of poetry as "dull"--as a number of other poet commentators have
been of late, among them Amiri Baraka in the Decemeber 2006-January 2007
issue of the Poetry Project Newsletter ("Why is Most Poetry So
Boring--Again?", which especially singles out academic and Language
poetries.)

      Since this question was raised i have been wanting to ask Aaron
Belz--what was the purpose of asking the qeustion?  Is it a question that
has a specific meaning or reason to you to ask?  Or is it simply  something
to throw out to get the ball rolling so to speak, get something happening
which is "of interest to poetics" when a few people asked why things were
slow?  Are you writing on Edson, or do you have any ideas of your own on the
matter?  What i mean is, I wondered what prompted this speciific
question--what  relevance it has as it is asked--does sticking Russel Edson
in a particular box make his work any more salient? Important to you
yourself in your sense of things?  Enhance his value on the poetics market?
Do you yourself desire or have an interested in there being a category for
this writer?
       Russell Edson is always called "a hermit" or "reclusive" by those
writing about/interviewing him, and he himself acknoweldges this aspect of
his nature.  I think by "reclusive" and "hermit" there is a sesne meant not
only of a physical separtion from the "crowd," but also a literary sense of
this, that the work stands apart from any grouping of schools, movements,
categories.
      When a body of work and its author desire to be considered in
themself, know themsleves to be so, separate from the standardizing impetus,
why is there a counter desire to corral them, assert one's  ability to
"outsmart" or "outflank" the work and author and rein them in to a system?
Mightn't this say more about the person with such an aim or desire than the
work and author?  Arent' there actually such works and beings of which and
whom one may say they're "a true American original", that "they broke the
mold when they made them?"  And that that's a cause for celebration,
inspiration and thanks--that there are such works and beings?

(in the anthology Open Poetry Four Anthologies of Expanded Poems edited by
Ronald Gross & George Quasha with Emmett Williams, John Robert Colombo and
Walter Lowenfels, (New York:  Simon & Schuster, 1973), Edson is included in
the section called "Metapoetry:  The Poetry of Changes" edited by George
Quasha.  This includes such poets as Helen Adams, David Antin, George
Bowering . . . Jim Harrison, Michael Heller, Anselm Hollo, Halvard Johnson .
. . MacLow, Niedecker, Oppen, Rochelle Owens, Nicanor Parra, Schwerner,
Simic, George Stanley . . . Nathaniel Tran, Diane Wakoski, Eliot Weinberger,
Louis Zukofsky among others.

Bravo, Adam. Well said.
  But here's my doubt: How does one determine, in the present, what or who is avant-garde? It can't only be lack of official recognition, because lots of things lack recognition for lots of reasons, for instance that they are mediocre. Is it just a matter of proclaiming oneself avant-garde, and refusing to seek official forms of recognition? Or does it only become clear retrospectively, in which case your argument might circular: The avant-gardists are the artists who count because avant-garde is just our name for the artists who count. Actually, the whole topic reminds me in a very uncomfortable way of religious controversies over who gains salvation and how to know who they are. So never mind, forget I ever brought it up.

use|usage, an on-line journal of critical poetics, is seeking =20
submissions for its inaugural issue "Building Prospects".

Deadline for submissions for the first issue is 4/30/07 (see =20
submission guidelines below)

The journal offers poetry and essays on contemporary issues that =20
reach outside of literature. Our first issue, Building Prospects, =20
focuses on architecture and what Kojin Karatani called the =20
=93architectonic=94- the way in which architecture becomes a structure =
of =20
thought for the culture that lives through and in it. Very many of us =20=

spend the majority of our day in buildings, whether they are called =20
=93home=94 =93office=94 =93factory=94 or =93school=94, yet we rarely are =
called upon =20
to reflect on their nature. Building Prospects looks both towards =20
this nature and towards the future of our interactions with =20
architecture. As such, we are paying particular attention to the idea =20=

of green building, what it means and what its effect will be on the =20
rest of our consciousness. We are accepting poems touching on all or =20
any of these areas until we have met our quota. The essay =20
collaboration for this issue has already begun, but feel free to look =20=

towards future collaboration on these topics:

Sound Sorting
Computer/Author
Healthy Ideas

We do poetry and we do criticism, but not criticism of poetry- that=92s =20=

the next factory over. Our criticism is of =93the world=94, that scary =20=

place we encounter when we leave the factory each night. Criticism is =20=

a joint effort between our editor and reader volunteers. If you want =20
to help with our critique, read over the list of future topics, and =20
submit your resume of relevant experience for inclusion as a =20
collaborator. If you have ideas for future topics, feel free to =20
submit a proposal. Remember that we are trying to keep our topics =20
useful- we are trying to help!- so include some explanation of why an =20=

essay on the topic you are proposing would be useful to our audience.

We welcome, with open arms, poetry for our current topic, and will =20
select poems from up to 10 authors for each issue. We prefer fewer =20
authors with more poems, but are interested only in poems by those =20
authors that address our topic area. For each issue, we will publish =20
a set of topic hints and ephemera, in the hopes of steering you =20
aright (for this issue's topic guidelines, see above). There are no =20
style or genre guidelines for poetry submissions. The words =20
=93experimental=94 or =93avant-garde=94 will never appear outside of =
scare =20
quotes in these guidelines. use|usage is most interested in poems =20
that do the work that needs doing in surprising or unlikely ways- =20
we=92d be equally surprised at a qualified villanelle as we would a =20
qualified google poem. use|usage will not discriminate against =20
applicants for reason of historical tradition or poetic orientation- =20
we are an equal-opportunity exploiter of resources.

-Submissions should be e-mailed (not currently accepting print =20
submissions) to: use.usage@gmail.com
-Please put only the following in the title line: building prospects =20
submission
-If your submission is accepted, you will be contacted by e-mail
- use|usage editor will keep the e-mail of anyone whose work is not =20
accepted and send out a courtesy notice to let you know that your =20
work was not accepted and that its submission rights are once again =20
free and clear. If you want further feedback as to the nature of the =20
decision, feel free to reply back to this e-mail. In general, =20
determinations will weigh relevance to theme most heavily, followed =20
by intellectual and aesthetic considerations.
- use|usage is not interested in simultaneous or previously published =20=

submissions (use|usage is slightly paranoid and too broke to afford a =20=

lawyer).
-Submissions preferred as word documents, though we will accept jpegs =20=

or pdfs if you want to maintain your layout strictly. These will open =20=

in the reader=92s default pdf application. Future issues may include =20
expanded media options.

Animal Crackers! HA! I loved that.

When discussing the avant-garde we must remember that it was originally
a military term. In "The Transformative Vision", Jose Arguelles points
out that the avant-garde is a "social institution peculiar to
technological society, predicated on the progressivist notion that
reality must always be updated...(it is) actually the purest reflection
of a society neurotically trying to stay one step ahead of itself."

In general, I agree with the tone set in Adam's Bernstein post, but find
the dualistic nature of them (SoQ) vs. us (post-avant avant, etc.) limiting.

Dear mIEKAL:

I forwarded this posting at the request of the co-editor, but I
imagine the folks at the journal would be more than happy to consider
inbetween genres (and genders).

As you know, my friends, water has no shape. Wa...

Windows, windows. Rectangular. Squares. Oblong.

Moths fly on my sister's chest.

Like the prayer of two butterflies

My sister's hands were white from the wash.



Ciao,

Adam,
  I agree with others so far in that I think the tone and questions that rise because of your post are important to keep oneself continually engaged with.
  In terms of the oppression that you doubt in your post-- I agree, perhaps no one is really oppressed, maybe that's too strong of a word. But, in the context that you bring up, I suppose some level of oppression can be equated with less readership, less opportunity, less understanding, by those invested in strategies that are less popular, more demanding, or as Bernstein might say, on the brink of impermeability. Bernstein's commitment to artifice, I think offers some resolution to the situation. His work has always been firmly committed to form, as experimental, abstract or inventive as it might be and there has been an equal commitment to its history.
  I think  that you are right on by  suggesting that so called post-avant poets empower OVC poets by their inverse relationship or "Negative Critique" of it, but of course that notion depends solely on it remaining re-active and negative which doesn't get anyone much of any where, or it rests on the notion of the self-proclaimed avant-garde status, which others have pointed out is as slippery to determine in present time as water in ones hands. I also agree with you completely when you say that once the 'humanity' of our supposed oppressors is recognized , designations like: OVC seemed forced etc.. but again, and I could be wrong, I think that forced designations of that nature also depend on a kind of "Negative Critique" ( in the Frankfort sense), which again, remains wholly re-active, rather than active. For me, Bernstein's work surpasses mere re-action-- it leaves glib complaint behind( even when it seems to be just glib). His work is celebratory and affirmative, if not
 clearly registered in content, always in song. Bernstein's relentless (re) assessment of language and form, his demand that poetry is not a structure of signifiers that stand in for something like the "real" and is rather a means to engage and actively include readers in the meaning making process, which in fact is not a comfortable exercise in cultural "freedom" but can be one of the most vital aspects of life( as Utopian as that might seem) Perhaps the battle is less with OVC and more with OLU or official language use, which of course in the language game of art can be the most reductive and limiting procedure. -- and of course "oppressive" for those trying to find new ways. Thanks so much for your post. It was refreshing and I think questions of this nature are as vital as Bernstein's verse. Thanks!

Very well put.  I for one am very much in favor of
leaving the work of Mr. Edson in his charming boxless
box.  This is why I am draw to his work:

The Bridge

In his travels he comes to a bridge made entirely of
bones. Before crossing he writes a letter to his
mother: Dear mother, guess what? the ape accidentally
bit off one of his hands while eating a banana. Just
now I am at the foot of a bone bridge. I shall be
crossing it shortly. I don't know if I shall find
hills and valleys made of flesh on the other side, or
simply constant night, villages of sleep. The ape is
scolding me for not teaching him better. I am letting
him wear my pith helmet for consolation. The bridge
looks like one of those skeletal reconstructions of a
huge dinosaur one sees in a museum. The ape is looking
at the stump of his wrist and scolding me again. I
offer him another banana and he gets very furious, as
though I'd insulted him. Tomorrow we cross the bridge.
I'll write to you from the other side if I can; if
not, look for a sign . . .

CREPUSCLE and WAREQUIEM, 2007

"Since 1983 the amazingly prolific Alan Sondheim has appeared at Millenn-
ium on a regular basis with substantial new works. This time the multi-
talented media artist has come up with a highly erotic and controversial
feature entitled CREPUSCLE (TWILIGHT) which stars the remarkable dancer,
Foofwa d'Imobilite, along with Azure Carter and Alan Sondheim. The program
will include several short pieces shot in Switzerland." (CREPUSCLE is a
mutual production of the three of us. The program will most likely include
one work, WAREQUIEM, shot in Second Life.)

"CREPUSCLE (TWILIGHT) explores the exigencies of dance, eroticism, cultur-
al constraint, and arousal; it was edited from over a dozen segments in
Geneva. The work tenders the null-point of language, a point where words
stutter, where the body takes over, stumbles, where cultural tropes are
transformed and disappear. It's the deliberate recreation of repressed
memories. It challenges the conventions of dance, turning dance inside-
out, turning dance out. For the three of us, it's the culmination of an
erotic element in our work that subtexts and disrupts the performative
itself. CREPUSCLE rides the muscle of the body and jouissance, opening a
territory which remains virtual, haunting." (A.S.)

I was briefly at Black Mt. College as a kind of
retreat, but was gone by the time writers like Creeley arrived. I did
publish a book, What a Man Can See, sometime later from Jonathan
Williams' Jargon. By the time that book finally appeared I had
already published a book with New Directions. The BMC Review was
actually started by M.C. Richards before the appearance of the so-
called school of Black Mt. Poets.
This is probably not what the inquirers hoped for. I'm a terribly
uninteresting person. My work is much more interesting. I'm rather a
drag on anything I've managed to do.

Be well,

Brian--

Thanks for posting your message from Russell. I only met him a couple
of times, the first at the Great River Arts Prose Poem conference, my
colleague Chard deNiord and I coordinated with Peter Johnson. At that
time, I was into their letterpress shop which Russell paid a visit to.
I seem to recollect that he was very enthusiastic around this
environment and said that he had self-published a number of artist
books of his work early in his career. People who are unacquainted with
his work can go online and read most everything and there should be
some sound links as well. Hearing Russell read is indeed truly
interesting.

Best Wishes--Jacqueline Gens

Thanks, but no
thanks...

So turn those cranks
in the mind to more angst,
and give the poets more spanks
than thanks...

As usual, nothing they can take
to the banks,
for they are writers not think-tanks...

Maybe too many crank and spank,
but do not READ enough to thank.


DEAR POETICS:
A thanks goes out to all the truly interesting mumbo-jumbo that gets =20

Hal, I like your blog site Entropyandme

Also I am very much interested in the idea of "poetry" reaching far =20
beyond the confines of words. Can other things be poetic? Simply =20
because they are? The way a plant dips down low as if to bow to the =20
passerby... A song without words played on a street-corner... The =20
wrinkly man on the bus who tilts his head just so and his eyes alone =20
speak volumes into your soul...
Oh, that's right, these are the "guts" of good poems... Life and art =20
are something in themselves no matter what form their composition...

Free speech should be enjoyed while it lasts, in those avenues where =20
it is appreciated.  :-) Cheers! TFRice

Hello there.

I found this tidbit online today, and thought of recent discussions =20
within this UB POETICS. Possibly this might inspire some interesting =20
discussion. I will not make this a habit, that is, to post actual =20
poetry. (Who has the time to read things online, randomly, these =20
days... right now I should be doing housework and finishing the poem I =20
wrote on a napkin last night and working on a dusty novel and phoning =20
friends I haven't had any time for...)

This made me think especially of the embodiment / humanity / life that =20
a poem takes on for the reader. Regards, T. F. Rice  (Wyoming County, =20
NY)



A Poem

I needn?t touch your silken hair
or feel rose petal skin.
The type of love I have for you...
it burns from deep within.

Yet in my soul the fires rage,
but nothing is consumed.
My spirit wanders aimlessly,
from room to darkened room.

The proper words I cannot find,
sometimes to show my love.
Yet here I?m looking at your face,
while you look from above.

Still, my soul stirs with great desire,
to reach up and touch you.
As these feelings that I?m having,
I know they?re in you too.

But you will some day think of me,
when my book you have closed.
And I am just a memory...
and not the one you chose.

Alas...
of all that I have looked up at,
?tis you I wished I?d known.
For yours is a breathing spirit,
and mine... I?m just a poem.

Sean Allen

What I love about you, wifey - IS that you are so
snuggly, probably first, and then sweet, kinda sweeter
than anything that could be candy, and determined and
stubborn and STRONG, and then all that who might
otherwise be called A BEAST OF WOMAN.

I really love you. I think it'll be OK. Nice, my dear.

Expert on Russian Intelligence Shot Outside Home
Mar 3rd - 6:56am

ADELPHI, Md. - Police are investigating a shooting

terrorism and his contacts in the former Soviet Union.


He has also been a long-time critic of the the
government of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

from FIGURES FOR A DARKROOM VOICE, by Noah Eli Gordon and Joshua Marie
Wilkinson

An axe splits a tree from the story of a woodcutter's lost children, but who
splits you from
me? Who splits the lighthouse in half? When heat brings down these
separations, what
revives you is not the boy with his wrong name, but the name with its
wronged boy, an
error in place of an outcome. A note about the author, cut with slant
adjectives, trips its
nouns around like drunks. You know the fable, how its boat filled with water
when you
held the baby until you weren't certain if its breathing has stopped or just
matched your
own. There is a tiny blue heart inside this votive & it marbles your house
smoke in
miniature deletions from a huge marker.

What I love about you, wifey - IS that you are so
snuggly, probably first, and then sweet, kinda sweeter
than anything that could be candy, and determined and
stubborn and STRONG, and then all that who might
otherwise be called A BEAST OF WOMAN.

I really love you. I think it'll be OK. Nice, my dear.

Hello,
  I am looking for the source of an Oppen quote which I can only paraphrase by memory: "New York City is an example of a completely man-made landscape."
  I'm fairly certain this is from a letter in the Selected Letters, though it may be from an interview or daybook/working paper.
  Anyone familiar with this quote, please let me know!
  Thank you in advance,
  Eric Hoffman

that I send her a paper I wrote this past year on her, Lucie Brock Broido,
and Barbara Guest's work. I was reeling after the tribute to Barbara Guest

Dear Community,

I would like to let you all know that I will be taking a leave of absence
from Small Press Traffic from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008. I will be doing
this, after 7 great, illuminating years at SPT, to
refresh myself and to be with my (growing) family. Poet, educator, and SPT
board member Dana Teen Lomax will be filling in for me while I am away. She
has extensive experience in curating, fundraising, and nonprofit arts
administration, and I am very confident that she will do a fantastic job. My
thanks to Dana and to the entire board of SPT for making this year away
possible for me. I will look forward to seeing all of you, dear writers &
readers, on my return in 2008.

Subject:      Ratcliffe & Rodefer at SPT this Fri, 3/9
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by
Stephen Ratcliffe & Stephen Rodefer
Friday, March 9, 2007 at 7:30 p.m.

Stephen Ratcliffe joins us in celebration of REAL, new from Avenue B,
which, Michael Cross writes, is "the second volume in what promises to
be a long poem of unprecedented magnitudeâ€¦documenting the minutia of
the subject's extension into the world as the ocean's diurnal low-end
dissonance might frame the coastline it erodes." Ratcliffe's earlier
works include Portraits & Repetitions and Present Tense. He lives in
Bolinas and teaches at Mills College in Oakland.

We are thrilled to welcome Stephen Rodefer back to the Bay Area for
this reading. The author of Four Lectures, Left Under A Cloud, Mon
Canard and many other books, Rodefer has lived in theâ€¨UK and France
for the past fifteen years. His selected poems, Call It Thought,â€¨will
be published by Carcanet in 2008. He has an essay on canon making in
theâ€¨latest Chicago Review, which concludesâ€¨"Live free and die. Publish
and Perish."



Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to
current SPT members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented inâ€¨Timken Lecture
Hall,â€¨California College of the Arts â€¨1111 Eighth Street, San
Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th & Wisconsin)

There are some new links to interactive audio works at
http://vispo.com/misc/ia.htm including four Flash-based projects:

ACTIONIST RESPOKE
http://www.stromgasse.de/projects/actionist
by Michael Janoschek and Rüdiger Schlömer, Mouse on Mars (Germany)
"Mouse On Mars deserve more than an instant fun interface. Here is something
between a Sequencer and Sound Tamagotchi. Put some learning effort into it,
don't let visuals irritate you and most of all, don't be lazy. This is not
about just sitting back and having music served on a tablet." The music is
funky and so is the interface. Very cool piece. Sort of MAX-like.
FLASH

SPLICE
http://splicemusic.com
by Sean Mulroney, Wendell Davis (USA)
Sequencer that allows mixing of your own sounds or sounds uploaded by people
in the Splice community. A similar project is called JamGlue.
FLASH

PANDORA
http://pandora.com
by Tim Westergren, Tom Conrad, Nolan Gasser... (USA)
Fascinating approach to Internet radio. You create a channel by specifying a
song or artist. Pandora then starts playing songs related to your seed. Each
song is classified according to the 'music genome project'. Your 'thumbs
up/thumbs down' on suggested songs apparently 'train' the app. A similar
project is called last.fm.
FLASH

ANDRE MICHELLE
http://lab.andre-michelle.com
by André Michelle (Germany)
André's lab of his experiments with Flash work is very interesting. Sort of
like JSyn work in its granularity and wave synthesis.

Dear Poetries,

I'm mixing with trigonometries for the layout at http://listenlight.net
for instance 08.  This is our last call for work for this issue.  Many
here may have read the journal, which, in its entirety, will not be
long, to read.  I've had great luck with last minute calls for work.
Listenlight 08 will hope to be live in under a week.  Not over, not
outer a week.

What is listenlight?  It's not schadenfreude, and also it is un-yet, and
un-likely to be experienced over breakfast.  It is the most unlikely
poetry journal in the universe.  Realer than tax revenue.  For sure.

Send your best.  Your poetry will be archived at least until its editors
die.  Our promise.

Women especially are asked in kind to send in for review.

All best,

Jesse Wayne Crockett

Daze is days (the daily every where one reads every
Daily) and confusion (the Daily Bugle–or is it
Bungle?–of constant shock). “Cooperman’s poems contain
the philosophical and the plain-spoken, the scientific
and the ripeness of 19th century diction, while at all
times maintaining a healthy skepticism about
language’s capacity to bring us here (or hear), where
we have been wandering around lost for many years.
Cooperman’s poems tell us that all may not be lost,
there may in fact be a home, even if we never get to
open its door.

     --John Yau

The ache of Berryman and the balls of Berrigan—a
combination so striking in its language: sonorous,
yes, but also snarky; lyrical and yet perky—dare I say
perky? I do. As does Cooperman. Moments in Daze are so
delicate, and then around the corner comes the stab,
the surprise, the knowing frippery and the
twinkle-eyed nudge. The poems do daze, they dazz, they
does. No other poet has such panache and such beauty:
‘something pure in a heart can hide.’
							--D.A. Powell

Hi Amy,


On arriving to Atlanta I was almost mugged for my backpack. I fought him
off.

On leaving Atlanta Donald Revell kissed my cheek.

What do we want?
Your money
When do we want it?
Now
What do you get?
A link and that sense of moral superiority that comes with being nice

Sure, it isn't exactly a protest, but the Buffalo Small Press Book Fair is a
regional, one-day event that will bring together small press publishers,
activists, visual artists, and other DIY enthusiasts that will also have
lectures, exhibits, and performances.

These things can't happen on their own. Really. Chris Fritton and I have
been working diligently and we thank those that have supported us to this
point, now we hope that some of you can help us out on an individual basis.
Feel free donate as little as $1 if that's what you have. We are beggars,
not choosers.

So, for your donation, we will list your name in our program, and
website--and a link to whatever you wish, should you wish to have a link.
Links will appear here <http://www.buffalosmallpress.org/sponsor/>.

If you're feeling philanthropic and want to help insure that the Buffalo
Small Press Book Fair becomes an annual event, visit our sponsor page and
hit up the Paypal Donate button on the top right of the screen.

We appreciate absolutely any help you can give.

chris & kevin

Baraka's article was both arrogant and profoundly

French philosopher Jean Baudrillard dies

The Associated Press

March 6, 2007 [] PARIS: Jean Baudrillard, a French philosopher and
social theorist known for his provocative commentaries on
consumerism, excess and what he said was the disappearance of
reality, died Tuesday, his publishing house said. He was 77.

Baudrillard died at his home in Paris after a long illness, said
Michel Delorme, of the Galilee publishing house.

The two men had worked together since 1977, when "Oublier Foucault"
(Forget Foucault) was published, one of about 30 books by
Baudrillard, Delorme said by telephone.

Among his last published books was "Cool Memories V," in 2005.

Baudrillard, a sociologist by training, is perhaps best known for his
concepts of "hyperreality" and "simulation."

If anyone can backchannel some of the best performing poets you have seen

  it has to be how well they read in public, how entertaining, enthralling etc

  maybe they dance, juggle, eat flames, sound good, something
  (or someone) very photogenic?

  that is what is being proposed that I hire, preferrably something new (genre-wise)
  beyond spoken word, Beat type readers,
  but I would guess that some USOP and def-poetry jam will make it to the list
  I sure would like that coupled with resonance on the page

  if you have contact info, mores the better

I believe he's referring to the "outsider" status itself -- outsider artists generally have nothing to do with art institutions.  The idea of them submitting their work to a gallery would be in opposition to the very concept of Outsider Art.

think the point is that if an outsider is sending jpegs of their work to a
gallery to be shown, they probably dont qualify all that well as outsiders,
or at very least they are willing to shed the outsider, to become an inside=

I think he's confused, then, about what "Outsider Art" is -- it's not
a status thing at all. Outsider Artists are those who are self-
taught, who have little or no contact with the "art world", not
because they are too piss-proud to show their work in galleries, but
because the "art world" largely ignores those who are not in this or
that "art world" clique or claque.

The notion that recognition for quality work is anathema to
"outsiders" is just plain silly. It's the "I wouldn't be a member of
any club that would have me as a member" silliness. Outsiders are
just as interested in selling their work, and getting recognized for
doing good work, as any other artist. They're outsiders not because
they think they're not good enough but because the "art world" hasn't
recognized why they're good. Do you really think artists who do
"outsider art" think of themselves as rubes and hicks whose work is
crappy and just not good enough to be thought of as "real art"?

Whoa, Marcus.  How did you go from the notion of avoiding the influence of being institutionalized to this miserably extreme conclusion?  You have leapt far and conjured up this characterization *all on your own.*

Who said any artist must want to be part of an institution?  There are manifold reasons to avoid the influence of the machine (i.e.  demand from agents & a popular public, avoiding the drive to sell, etc).  Must an artist think of him or herself as a "hick" just because he or she doesn't desire a validation from galleries?  There are other ways to showcase one's art, if that's even what one wants to do  ...

  Also, as long as we're talking Black Took folks, Ronaldo Wilson would be on my list as well.

has anyone mentioned tyehimba jess (www.tyehimbajess.com/) (backchannel for
email) or douglas kearney (backchannel for email) or patricia smith? i saw
douglas
perform in ATL on thursday, and wow! not only did he refuse the podium, he
marched
up the aisle and had to turn his book in various directions to read his
poem, his
voice marched with him until he turned red in the face. it was quite the
breathable
moveable feast of language. exquisite.

Great! This "outsider art" discusion running around the "institution
grouping" seems to me a great way to explain Russel's Paradox.
Great, great, thanks!!!

Is this outsider art?

Malok has no idea what a jpeg is, but I did manage to teach him how =20
to send an email this last year (which only took about 15 years of =20
trying).  I still love the fact that Malok thinks Google is the =20
Internet.  I haven't bothered to try to correct his notion.

Why all the discussion? Other conditions in my life will keep me an =
Outsider
whether my Outsider art submission, if accepted, makes me an Insider. =
I'm
sure some of the others who submit will feel the same way.

think the point is that if an outsider is sending jpegs of their work to =
a
gallery to be shown, they probably dont qualify all that well as =
outsiders,
or at very least they are willing to shed the outsider, to become an =
insider

To have a notion of "outsider art" is also to have an
essentialist orientation toward another essentialist
orientation; namely, toward a notion of "art."  What is fine
here is how the first post knows that whatever "outsider
art" is, it is not this, and yet also knows that in order to
know this, it must itself have an essentialist notion
of "outsider art."  What is comic here is how subsequent
posts fail to recognize or admit the problematics of
definition, instead leading us along what Kenneth Burke
would call the "bureaucratization of the imaginative,"
sticking to the guns of their arguments, guns that merely
expel a little white flag that reads "Bang!"

"Outsider art" has become another niche marketing term in the branch
of the commodity economy known as the "art world."  Perhaps when Roger
Cardinal (?) published his illustrated monograph entitled "Outsider
Art" a few decades back, the term had meaning because of its novelty
as a rubric.  But now, in an era when "Outsider Art Fairs" are
annually held in New York City, it's become another way for art
hustlers -- er, dealers -- to make a buck off their designated "Other"
of choice.

On another level: if Henry Darger's work can be labeled "outsider
art," can John Ashbery's "Girls on the Run," inspired by Darger, be
called "outsider art" too?  If so, why?  If not, why not?

Mark,

Was Arts and Crafts movement in England an art brut or folk art movement,
though it has some of the elements of folk art?

In the antiques world, folk art has a few distinct elements: first, most
often no individual name is attached to the product; second, products have
practical applications. A third, a more tacit assumption, is that they are
hand made. In The States the typical folk art product would be quilts,
shaker furniture, early store signs and posters, kitchy pottery sets,
certain hand drawings, etc., are examples of folk art. In the East, the
quintessential one is carpets. The idea of folk are has deep roots in
Romanticism, racism and hierarchical structures. For instance, though moder=
n
industrial designed products possess two crucial elements of folk (anonymit=
y
and practical application), they are not called so because of the machine
element. Collectors of Oriental carpets make a big deal about whether the
weaver has only used natural (vegetable) dyes, that being more valuable by
multiples, or also chemical ones. On the other hand, if a Western artist, D=
e
Kooning for example, experiments with synthetic material, this is called ar=
t
(a new experiment). One can see here a subtle placing of the East on an
inferior level, with the suggestion that they do not quite deserve
industrialization and science. One must not forget, the presence of
chemicals or not in the dye material Van Gogh used, for example, does not
even come up. It is not relevant.

Once again, while early store sign posters are considered folk art, modern
advertizement (posters or T.V. ads, etc.) are not, though a certain stigma
due to its commercial aspect, is attached to advertising also (is
advertising an outsider art?). The fact is that early American posters
reflect the cultural, racial assumptions of their time: blacks in
subservient servant's clothing, blacks as monkeys (Coons), etc.

Ciao,

Dear Murat, advertisements and posters may not be considered folk art but they are considered art, particularly in some quarters.  I see many old movie posters, for instance, considered art now, especially by those who use them as decorations in their home.  As for advertising as art, Andy Warhol did his best to break down that distinction between high and commercial art.  However, most advertising is still not art.  It's purpose is to convince, to sell a product.  It is thus closer to propaganda than it is to art, and often about as honest as propaganda is as well.  That much of it is ugly and aimed at overcoming the consumer's conscious resistance through repetition into the subconscious and unconscious is another factor that makes it less honest than art.  Regards, Tom Savage

I suggest taking a look at Kasey S. Mohamed's blog
http://lime-tree.blogspot.com/
 where he has an ongoing discussion of the creation of an alternative format
for an AWP - a festival of poets and poetries and presses and parties
without the careerist components.
I think it's a sweet vision. And Ashland, Oregon, as Kasey offers - home of
one of the best on-going Shakespeare, Renaissance and contemporary theater
venues in the country - would be a great site for such.  (Bars, restaurants,
the works).

OK, a bit more seriously. Right, folk art is a=20
slippery term. You complain of ideological=20
leakage on one side. On the other, it slops over into "folksyness."

I don't think anyone has ever confused the arts=20
and crafts movement with folk art, any more than=20
they've confused The Ballad of the Ancient=20
Mariner with the ballads sung in crofter's cottages.

Advertising art, which is created in design=20
studios and mass produced, is highly sought=20
after, but it's a different market--dealers in=20
Howard Finster, or in old store signs, don't sell coca cola signs.

Likewise rugs. It's unimaginable that a folk art=20
dealer would sell oriental carpets as folk art.=20
Simply, people don't come to his shop looking for=20
them. But there's also a question over whether=20
they fit the definition: there are certainly=20
carpets made for personal use that find their way=20
onto the market, but most of the trade in=20
hand-made orientals is in rugs produced for the=20
market, where whole villages do little else. An=20
industrial product, despite design variations.

Even Navajo rugs are rarely sold as folk art.=20
There's more money to be made in the separate category of American Indian=
 art.

As a dealer and collector I picked up a number of=20
paintings by a guy who was selling them in the=20
back of his booth at a tag sale. Mainly what he=20
sold was old tools. An outsider for sure. But if=20
I mount an exhibition of his paintings is he still an outsider?

tom, would you please explain with a bit more detail how movie posters
(which have the function to sell, no matter which era) differ from
advertising (as you define it below)?

At least, in my neighborhood, the 'haircut' is the most common, most fluid
form of 'outsider art' - all puns intended.  There is always, however, the
the question of how to collect a great, curious, eccentric cut - or even an
'in vogue' cut. Photographs, films, plaster casts, artificial hair simulcra,
and wigs are not the real thing. Taking scalps remains a possibility, but I
understand, the nature of hair on a scalp is still to continue to grow! Plus
there might be other penalties related to this kind of capture and removal.

Fugitive, elusive - unless somebody knows something I do not know - the
haircut, no matter 'how great' as an an 'outsider art' form cannot be fully
preserved and captured.

I am sure we have all had poems appear and disappear like that.

Ah, yeah, but could Kasey get travel money, or rooms, for the visitors?

If the "price" of securing something like that could render it
susceptible to 'careerist components,'
that may not be so bad.
Oh, I'm sure some people can get their schools to pay for it--which
is also not so bad....
but then there's going to be those who can't afford to go,
or an inequality between those who get paid to go and those who
don''t....

not to sound cynical, and say it can't be done; and maybe kasey could
pull it off....
The closest I'm aware of anybody coming to this in the past 15 years
was that "New Coast" conference
and something could be done even better, but it's daunting

(i went to awp once, though (CHICAGO), and though i dreaded the
worst, it ended up not being so bad....

eye wonder--
can de-alienating fun and/or true connection be fostered through
institutional organization of any sort?

or to wander lonely as a crowd, etc....

Is it possible to discuss, in pragmatic measure, functions/presentations of kinds of art in the world -- as well as what one might actively avoid/define one's self against -- without spiraling into the old "impossible to define any concept" debate at every turn?  On my slippery slope, it's merely distracting and unproductive, not comedic.

I do have a question though as my logic hasn't been attended to since the undergrad class I failed -- How is noting that outsider artists resist the draw of art institutions essentializing the definition of outsider art?    Your conclusion seems cyclical and insular in a way that requires yet another leap, " ... whatever 'outsider art' is, it is not this, and yet also knows that in order to know this, it must itself have an essentialist notion of 'outsider art'."

I don't see how by knowing some periphery knowledge (that "outsider artists generally resist institutions") that I then must have an "essentialist notion" of outsider art.  In fact, I know very little about outsider art, perhaps because I haven't researched it/sought it out to any noteworthy degree, and then perhaps because it isn't frequently displayed in the galleries that I frequent.  I would assume that there are more artists engaged in outsider art activities than most of us know.  Where is the essentialist notion in that?


Will Esposito <williame@TEMPLE.EDU> wrote: To have a notion of "outsider art" is also to have an
essentialist orientation toward another essentialist
orientation; namely, toward a notion of "art."  What is fine
here is how the first post knows that whatever "outsider
art" is, it is not this, and yet also knows that in order to
know this, it must itself have an essentialist notion
of "outsider art."

What is comic here is how subsequent
posts fail to recognize or admit the problematics of
definition, instead leading us along what Kenneth Burke
would call the "bureaucratization of the imaginative,"
sticking to the guns of their arguments, guns that merely
expel a little white flag that reads "Bang!"

Someone call Harper's Magazine, please.

Once the work is out of the artist's hands, does that mean he doesn't control it anymore?  If he sells his work to you, has he allowed it to become a commodity?  Unless he contractually requires, upon selling to you, that the piece not be displayed, aren't you free to do with it as you please - apart from his principles?  And then by the very selling the work, or even just allowing its entry into the Art World proper, has he inherently negated his outsider art status, whether he contractually limits its presentation in the world or not?

Come on, Chris, don't get me started.
Okay, for starters. Baraka forgets, in a major way,
rhetorical rule number one: talk to your f**ing
audience. Do you think he believes his *own* poetry
sucks? No, he comes across as an insanely vain man. Or
that *he* might have some degree of guilty complicity
in the Evil System? Or that poetry might just not be
the best way of leading the fight, and shouldn't
define the dignity or rank of those who struggle?
Sounds to me like he doesn't like anyone who doesn't
write *like him*. Gimme a break. What an arrogant
jerk.
Plus, he's just plain wrong. I've read lots of
interesting poetry being written right now,
politically driven or otherwise.
You'll notice I didn't mention the antisemitism issue,
as I don't know anything about it and it's not
relevant to this article anyway. That said, given the
hateful language of this pinhead, I wouldn't be
surprised if.
Here's where I cover my head and wait for the
tomatoes. I'm going to regret this....

I don't know if this varies from state to state, but in California, if a
work is sold at auction, I believe the artist receives a percentage of the
sale.  (Which gives a California owner incentive to go to auction with the
same piece in New York, I assume, to where there will be percentage for the
artist).
And there are laws about what you can do to a work. You cannot, for example,
take a mobile or work by Alexander Calder (or anyone else) and weld it into
a patio lawn chair. Or, if a City has commissioned a mural for a particular
space, the art work cannot be destroyed or abused. It the wall is to be
changed, the artwork must be preserved and not destroyed, tho it may be
relocated to another site (which, I suspect, may include a warehouse).

Curious analog with poetry is that no one is entitled to abuse your original
poem, that is take it, alter it and/or misrepresent it with your name.
That's copyright violation.  A person can, however - as most of us in one
way or other do - take somebody else's poem (be the poet alive or dead) and
transform it something else, tho still maybe strongly echoing the original
work.   Where this gets challenging in the visual realm is in the area of
'appropriation art" - where a photographer, say, Sherrie Levine,
rephotographs a Walker Evans framed picture and puts her name under it.
Or, a personal example, when the Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco sold Man
Ray's photograph of The Woman With Tears (right name) for a million dollars
(it was the first photograph to break into 7 figures), I photographed the
Man Ray in the Gallery. I happily showed everyone my one million dollar
photograph. I appropriated everything, even the frame, except for the
original and the money!

I don't know if there is anything comparable in poetry to the practice of
'appropriation art' in that sense. Tho I once hollowed out a Shakespeare
sonnet, leaving only the first and last letters on each line. That was kind
of liberating! And the hollowed shape was intriguing.

Thomas Chapin was a brilliant jazz saxophonist and flutist, who died 9 years
ago of leukemia. During the last year of his life, his health prevented him
from making major concerts (e.g., the Monterey Jazz Festival) that would
have made him a star.



If any of you can forward this to others who can help, such as jazz DJs who
could dedicate part of their shows to playing Chapin's music, I would
greatly appreciate it. He was one of the very best sax saxophonists of the
1980s and 1990s, and one of the freshest musical voices of his time.



His web site, scheduled to open Friday, March 9, is www.thomaschapin.com

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I have no idea why Marcus sent this call to this list, other than perhaps
baiting Pavlovian dogs to a predictable series of giddy hilarity amid
ridiculing responses, so he in turn can laugh at the creatures in their
frenzy at having a big easy straw figure to tear apart and hurl lofty minded
abuses at--?
Who knows what lurks in the hearts of anyone--a lurker, a larker, a fair
grounds barker?

Is the spectacle of "outsider art" introduced in this setting, any more or
less hilarious than posts dealing with "the marginalization of poetry,"
"radical, innovative poetics" vs "official verse culture"?  Is Is the
commodification, mediatization, appropriation of "outsider art" "worse" than
the vast array of institutions, presses, reading series, journals,
anthologies, essays, conferences, exhibitions, blogs, book announcements,
calls for "transgressive, deforming, outside the box" poetry and essays this
list takes perfectly seriously?

Aren't many here continually proclamiing their "marginal status," their
"outsider" abjection in the face of monolithic publishers and strip mall
bookstores, official recognitions, prizes and the like? Isn't there often
here a highminded deploring and celebrating of one's, or the group's,
"difference" and "disabilities," financial woes and "marginalities" from the
standardizations of the mainstream culture?
Is the ridicule of "outsider art" because the true outsiders are to be found
here, as is so often claimed?

Yes, in many ways Outsider art, as with everything, including "the
marginalization of poetry," has become fodder for the canned laughing
machines of the tv "audience" implanted within as much of the society as is
possible.  It is by turns laughable, immensely sad and thoroughly,
inevitably visicious how everything becomes subsumed to the maw of
appropriation and exploitation.

Even so, the fact remains that the call to create is heard by people of all
sorts, and they respond in all sorts of ways, often in ways which have the
energy and qualities of those things which through time are thought to be
recognized as "art". Many of the works of "outsider art" are as "great" as
any of those produced by "great artists".  The impetus in the initial
recogitions of this, by Prinzhorn in his 1921 Art of the Mentally Ill and
Dubuffet in his 1946 proclamations and exhibtions of "Art Brut"--the impetus
was to expand the field of recognition of what "art" is--that is, "art" is
something more than that which has been defined as "art," produced soley by
a person or persons known to society as "artists".
The vocation of "artist" does not come only to those who think of themsleves
or are conventionally thought of, as "artists".  "Art" can call to anyone,
come to people by all sorts of strange ways, manifest itself in all manner
of forms, via the beings who "heed the call".  "Art" is at once far more
anarchic and far more disciplined within its exactions than what the
conventioanlly recognized and labeled ideas, theories, crtiical commentaries
and the whole appartus of discourse built around the term "art" --or
"poetry"--can ever conceive of, can only begin to find in practice.
The explosions of changes in 20th century art were initiated by persons ,
artists, who wanted to break through the barriers of what had come to be the
prisons of "art". So the turn to recognizing a "naive painter" like Henri
Rousseau as a geat artist, the turn to recognizing "primitve" and African,
Tahitian, indigenous arts of the world over as Art, recognizing the
interestingnesses of children's art, then that of the mentally ill, and,
with Dubuffet , that of the untrained creator in all sorts of media often
not remotely thought of before as "art materials" at all, yet the person
creating with great discipline from these "outside" materials  works of art
that do have the qualities of what is proposed to be demanded by art.
These recognitions born of a desire to regenerate western art from the
coffins and prisons and asylums into which it was being consigned-the ones
in the art world, the market world, the institutions---came almost entirely
from artists orginally--not collectors or critics. theorists, bankers,
sociologists of the soul.   (Prinzhorn is a great exception, to whom many
artists gave thanks for the immense possibilities opened by his book. Klee,
the Surrealists, thousands of artists to this day recall and thank
Prinzhorn.)
When an artist feels confined, to paraphrase audre lorde, you can't smash
through the wals of confinement and then hope to build something new with
the master's tools--the artist looks around for things to use as tools never
thought of before, and the same with materials.  "Necessity is the
motherfucker of invention," I say, and this is at the heart of  not simply
"outsider art", but of art which realizes it needs to find something other
than what it is working with that got it into this prison in the first
place.
Setting out to  find some other forms, tools and examples of
possibilities--the artist begins to recognize art al around that they have
never seen before as art, limited as they had been in an by  their
confinements,  and like any artist, sets to work using these new examples
and tools and forms.  An artist is a finder and a thief, too, like a crow
sighting and swooping down on what it recognizes as materials for the wild
constructions of its  Merzbau nest. And of course, by recognizing these new
forms as something to steal from, the artist at the same time is recognizing
that they in themsleves are an art equal with anything she has made.
And that means these things found and recongized need to be studied deeply
and with the discipline and respect one has brought to the things one has
known up to now as "art" and materials.

Th history of "modern" and "postmodern" art has been one continually
informed by the extensions of recognitions by artists of what is art,
outside the previous labels and conventions of such--and the uses or
appreciations of these arts' forms, expressions, histories, creators.

The first recogntion by ma institution of the equal status of "modern art"
and "outsider art" came in th first mega traveling show of the 20th century,
the Nazis' exhibition of Degenarte Art, in which works by great modern
painters hung side by side with works by asylum inmates--including Adolf
Wuffli, one of the first great "outsider artists" to become legendary.
The Nazis thought that by equating modern art with the art of the insane,
that they were underlining the "degeneracy" of modern art and those artists
represented.  Paradoxically, by this branding, condeming action, the Nazis
had stumbled on exactly what was being seen not as a "degeneracy" and
insanity in modern art, but the art of the "outsider" having an equal place
with that of "great artists" as "great art"as recongised by artists--who
mgiht just have some sort of expertise in art.
The Nazis ridiculed, humiliated, condemned the modern artists, equating him
and her with the works and person  of the mentally ill whom the artists
recognized as also being art, as artits in their right.  By considering
something so ridiculous and "sick" as "outsider art" to be art--this proved
that the artists themselves were ridiculous and "sick."  "It takes one to
know one"--can cut both ways.

So it is that ridicule, humilation and condemnation can often backfire.  It
is the Nazis who ended up experiecing these responses they had first flung
out into the world. They joined a long list of "critics' and "curators" who
had found their ridicule also coming back in their own faces.  The modern
art and "outsider art" went on being made and recognized as "art" by
bringing the new recognitions they opened in the world not only in the
spheres of "art" and "mental illness", but a reconsideration of al sorts of
labels and values previously stuck on art and on people and on things found
in the world.

It's quite easy to mock "outsider art" these days when one knows only a few
vague surface things about it being shown and sold in galleries, written
about and advertised in expensive journals, begining to be taught in art
history classes and ripped off by all sorts of poseurs. (Isn't
"radicalinnovative," "transgressive" "marginalized" poetry being taught for
a while now in both Creative Writing and literature classes in a great many
places--?)  But is not the same situation functioning in poetry, on the
poetics list , in any other art forms?  And mightn't others not a part of
this sphere here find what goes on here equally laughable?  And they do, do
this, too, find it hilarious, as much as outsider art is found hilarious
here.

I don't know why the call was sent to this list, because--it's predictable
that something like "outsider art" will be laughed at, the stereotypical
cartoonish ideas and images of it, that is.  It reveals both an ignorance of
the subject and at the same time a superior attitude to it--that the
"marginal, radical, innovative works" written of here, are superior to all
the junk made by the clowns and pretenders and money makers of the "outsider
art" world.  It is as though what is discussed here is "real art" and what
made over there "fake art". Or simply "bad art" cunningly marketed. One
might even think of it as an issue with overtones of  class, with "outsider
art" being made by the uneducated, unsophisticated, lumpen masses out there
in the heap of junk known as "the world", creating works of previously
unseen and unthought of possibilities found in the junk itself.

Each sphere looks out at the others and finds reasons to laugh at their
pretensions, seriousnesses, pomposities, and as well ignore what is there
that is really of interest and use in making one's own work as well.  God
knows this list has provided plenty of fodder for fun, just as every list
does at some point or another.  To understand what is really going on
beneath the surfaces, the easily seen  contradicitions, foibles and etc ,
--amd find out if anything of real interst going on--whether here or
anywhere--requires some digging.  You never know what you may find, here or
anyhere. I laugh as much good healthy gallows laughter as anyone at the
spectacle of the endless parade of the Emperors in their new clothes, which
is what a good deal of life --and lists, labels--often appears to be.  Yet,
the eye and ear that can see the nakedness of the Emperors on their boney
nags--is going to be wondering--why?--Why is this considered something--when
over there--there exists something else, which is of real interest, yet
stuck away in the background, practically in the broom closet?

One can be laughing mightily at a spectacle--and be unaware that oneself is
being a spectacle to be laughed at by another. Things whcih are "art" hidden
among the things which are simulacra or constructed conceptualizations of
institutionalized or throughly commercialized "art"--these things themselves
have their own laughter, at those who do not see them.
The best laughter comes when one sets out to undertand and feel "why"--the
why hidden behind the Emperors' new clothes.  A laughing mockery is going on
of something--outsider art, something else----and one would like to know
why--and finding one' way along the way of this--to understand that the
laughter existing further on--is that of the things hidden in plain sight,
yet concealed by the labelled clothes flung in front of them, to dismiss
them from a serious looking into, while one is supposed to be keeping the
eyes fixed on the Emperors left behind one . . .
Yet the view of the thing over there almost in the broom closet--calls
one--over there--away from the confinement of being forced to stand in lime
with al the rest and be filled with awe at the magnificent spectacle of the
Emperors' coverings up . . .
The labels--why bother to read them with such confining eyes? Why is
blocking the view?  What is covering up--and what is beyond
it--outside--over there--in the blue distances and right here, hidden in
plain sight/site/cite .  .  .

"A Dadaist is eomone who loves life in all its uncountable forms, and who
knows, and says that, 'Life is not here alone, but also there, there, there
(da, da, da)'"
--Johannes Baader, Oberdada Berlins, in December 1918 issue of Die freie
Strasse (The Free Street)

and also--

     "(The other thing I learned at college that was ever of any use to me)
was a definition I got out of the agronomy books, and I reckon it was even
more important than the first.  It did more to revise my thinking, if I'd
really done any thinking up until that time.  Before that I'd seen
everything in black  and white, good and bad.  But after I was set straight
I saw that the name you put on a thing depended on where you stood and where
it stood.  And . . . and here's the definition, right out of the agronmy
books:  "A weed is a plant out of place.'  Let me repeat that.  'A weed is a
plant out of place.'  I find a hollyhock in my cornfield, and it's a weed.
I find it in my yard, and it's a flower.'"
----Jim Thompson, The Killer Inside Me


So--here outsider art seems to be a weed--and "marginalized poetry" a
flower--yet think how but with just a sliight movement of the head, as
Cezanne wrote, the whole motif is changed.
In that case, outsider art, marginalzied poetry--why not take them equally
seriously and find out what is there which is real enough for something in
it to have been found by other artists and poets?

to quote the old song--"I wanna know, I wanna know/Who'll stop the rain?'
which can also be the rein and the reign--
An excellent introduction to and history of ousider art and art brut is

I think the governing term is "parody," and that the appropriation,
as long as you don't try to pass it off as an original, is yours to
claim as your own creation. The defining case in visual art is
Duchamps' mustachioed Mona Lisa. To defend their property rights,
museums limit publication of photographs of their holdings, and when
they license reproduction the contract spells out what the licensee
can and can't do. The same holds true for poems. There, and in verbal
art in general, the veryu vague test seems to be the percentage of change.

I don't know about the Calder. In most of the world the owner is
perfectly well entitled to make it into a lawn chair, unlesshe's
signed an agreement not to. But let's assume that in San Francisco
one can't alter the Calder (and I do assume your assertion is
correct), or even remove it to where one can, does this mean that no
artworks can be altered? Can I make a throw-pillar rug out of a
textile or throw a painting away? How are the limits set?

Amy, I'm sure that there are "outsiders" who would resist their art
being taken "inside" (what would Darger or Wolfli have said), but I
doubt that's  common. The artist whose work I bought  (his name is
Hendiekus, or Henry, Vanderloo) certainly wouldn't object. As to
definition, the boundaries will always be nebulous. Van Gogh was
largely self-trained, for instance, and gets treated one way,
Rousseau le Douanier, also largely self-trained, another. It's the
extremes that provoke criticism. To take an example from music, there
are ethnomusicologist's tapes, and then there's Peter Paul and Mary.
A Woody Guthrie is somewhere in between.

King's Woods


data-driven networked hypertext


by Lewis LaCook

2007
 PHP/MySQL, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript


http://www.lewislacook.org/kingswoods/index.html

/King's Woods/ is a data-driven, networked hypertext poem that utilizes  information about both the history and present of the city of Lorain,  Ohio, and grows with each subsequent user's experience of the work. It's  a poetic response to the city, and as such many of the work's features  are dependent on it; the positioning, length, and opacity of certain  elements rely on weather information about Lorain (the current  temperature, the days until the next full moon, etc)...

Hey, does anyone have Michael Palmer's email and/or snail mail addresses? I was in his Bread Loaf workshop several years ago and want to reconnect, send him my god-knows-when-to-be-published-manuscript, if he'll have it, but have lost the BL booklet I once had with what may now be, at any rate, an old address. If anyone can help me out, I'd appreciate it. I'm tired of waiting for the book deal and just want potentially interested people whose work I admire to be reading it. Please backchannel to me if you would if you could!

  Thanks!

  Tod

I think the "outsider" term is really a kind of epithet at this point. For me personally
I think of it specifically in terms of rural untrained artists or artists who have been
overwhelmed in some sense by their own biological 'alterities'.. (that which has been called mental illness).
Although, in reality, that's a pretty good definition of late capitalism, ideology, or just about anything else i
suppose...

In the urban terrain, the term is pretty much as useless or useful as anything else as there are lots of academically
untrained artists,
but nevertheless there are 'schools'.. The latest "outsider" school I've been looking at is the "Doodle school".
I'm making this up, but one member did describe it to me as such..

You also have Low-brow, graffitism, with their hybridisations and design wings.. in the sense that all art is a
planetary
phenomenon, I would call it all "Folk Art" as its made by "Earth Folk" and not a more confused, rustic, bunch of
mudlightbabies have i laid eyes on! Yikes! Pass the character flail, flaw, maw, awe, ale, pale, Yale, wail, whateva,
peron, garbo, garbone, barge, baaj...

Zines are still a pretty thriving indicator of this global tendency.

There are many, many conferences aside from AWP.  There are also many
festivals, although these tend to be focussed on : digital writing,
performance poetry, film, etc.; t'would be nice to have a large
innovative writing festival / conference.

AWP's flaws are, as Kasey notes in his blog, its strengths in some
sense (tho I would say -- perhaps ones an "alt AWP" wouldn't solve).
It IS the "associated writing programs" after all, and until
relatively recently there was no real presence of innovative writing
at AWP or in mainline writing programs.  So, I find the recent embrace
of AWP, which is really a second or third tier organization in my
view, by innovative writers, and then the subsequent retreat to more
focussed gatherings -- many long in existence -- somewhat puzzling.
Let's have a midwestern MLA!  Something for modernism!  Something for
American writing!  Oh we already have those.

The primary issue here is writing programs, and what are they good
for, what kind of market are they, and what kind of market do they
serve; it is good that the book fair is more interesting than the
panels, because isn't the coursework in the programs secondary to the
writing?

[A corollary is probably that academic conferences, including AWP, the
MLA, etc. charge their presenters; that's a problem.  There are a lot
of other huge problems, such as there's no fundraising for this thing:
where are the free hotspots brought to you by HP, who would like to
power your computer center?  where's the free coffee brought to you by
countless coffee shop chains that want to have reading series in them?
 Oh, we're academics, we can't fundraise, we can only invite textbook
companies to come try to sell writers their comp textbooks.  We can
only view you as the market for us, not vice versa.]

Unless your recommended poets are backchanneled to me
  I have no reasonable way to copy and paste
  from the once a day enormous digest posting that is sent to me
  into another e-mail

  I was not really interested in a front channel discussion per se
  I am too knee deep in this and busy garnering spectacular reviews
  for a new title of ours by Rachel M. Simon
  but I could send a collection of the results to the list
  if that is what some people would like.

  I am really looking for regional poets
  and ones who do not fit the traditional mode of "spoken word"
  Christian Bok and John M. Bennett would be two excellent experimentalist examples

  since I may not be able to respond individually
  thanks in advance for all the suggestions


Be well

I'm so embarrassed by my angry outburst that I
hesitate to indicate where the article can be found,
but I will: as David-Baptiste Chirot indicated, it's
in a recent issue of the St. Mark's Poetry Project
newsletter, edited by the witty marxist Brendan Lorber
of Lungfull! fame. And with that, I will cease
shooting my mouth off, although I must say that I just
love those "guns that merely
expel a little white flag that reads "Bang!""
Wish I had one of those.
Aren't they better than the real ones?
Am inclined to agree with David that it's a bit silly
in the poetry world to talk about what's "in" and
what's "out". We might know something of it in 70 yrs,
but for the moment, I'd say it could be pretty neat to
see what Marcus can come up with for us, no?
Once again, many apologies for my misplaced vitriol,
Amicalement,
Alex

MARKING OBAMA OFF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES LIST.  ENOUGH OF UNINFORMED
PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE!

    From: Fred Bush

  As I noted in yesterday=92s message, last Friday Democratic presidential
candidate Barack Obama gave a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC) in Chicago. For anyone who is at all familiar with what
is actually happening on the ground in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories, the speech was so pro-Israel and so out of touch with the
reality that it would turn your stomach.

  As Ali Abunimah noted in a review of the speech (for which go to this
link: http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article6619.shtml), =93Obama offered
not a single word of criticism of Israel, of its relentless settlement and
wall construction, of the closures that make life unlivable for millions
of Palestinians.=94 Abunimah goes on to note that there was not the
slightest inkling in the whole speech that Obama knew anything about, . .
=2E the hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza who live in the dark, or th=
e
patients who cannot get dialysis, because of what Israeli human rights
group B'Tselem termed "one cold, calculated decision, made by Israel's
prime minister, defense minister, and IDF chief of staff" last summer to
bomb the only power plant in Gaza," a decision that "had nothing to do
with the attempts to achieve [the] release [of a captured soldier] nor any
other military need."

  But, Abunimah goes on to note,

  Obama was not entirely insensitive to ordinary lives. He recalled a
January 2006 visit to the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona that resembled an
ordinary American suburb where he could imagine the sounds of Israeli
children at "joyful play just like my own daughters."

  Why does Obama=92s speech turn my stomach?

  While this is the reality for Israeli children, here is the reality for
Palestinians:

  Aid sanctions threaten West Bank health
  By Amy Teibel, Associated Press, 4 March 2007

  YATA, West Bank - One slip, and Issa Abu Shakr's 5-year-old nephew
plunged into the fetid stream of sewage that flows outside the family's
West Bank home. The contact with the filthy water required multiple blood
transfusions and a 10-day hospital stay, Abu Shakr says.

  A few miles away, Maisoun Seidat picked up a blue bucket for one of her
three daily trips to a communal cistern. People shouldn't have to fret
about something as elemental as water, Seidat says, but in the parched
West Bank, it's a constant worry.

  These are the human face of the toll exacted by U.S. sanctions following
the rise to power of the militant Islamic Hamas group. U.S. projects were
to have dried up the toxic flow that threatens the Abu Shakrs and bring
more water to the Seidats. But the money has disappeared into the morass
of Mideast politics.

  Projects meant to make sweeping changes in the Palestinians' quality of
life -- like the sewage treatment plant that was to have been built near
Issa Abu Shakr's home in Yata village near Hebron -- have been put on
hold. Meanwhile, the Abu Shakr family complains of asthma, burning throats
and colds. The trunks of olive trees near their home are blackened by the
squalid flow. "The fact that they stopped the project is a disaster," Abu
Shakr says.

  Palestinians had hoped a power-sharing deal between Hamas and the
moderate Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, would revive the aid, and a
$250 million package of waste and wastewater programs the U.S. had planned
for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice indicated in a recent visit to the region that this won't happen
unless Hamas moderates its refusal to recognize Israel's existence.

  Other major donors have continued their smaller-scale infrastructure
projects. But it is the U.S. the Palestinians depend on for water and
sewage treatment, says Naim El-Mani, senior technical adviser at the
Palestinian Water Authority.

  More than 80 percent of communities in the West Bank aren't hooked up to
a sewer network, and much of their waste ends up in riverbeds, some of it
running into Israel, water experts said. The suspension of the wastewater
project "is like a time bomb," he said.

  The U.S. poured $468 million into the Palestinian territories in 2006 --
the year Hamas rose to power -- compared with $400 million approved the
previous year. But Howard Sumka, director for the West Bank and Gaza
operations of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said his
agency's mission has shifted toward "health care, food assistance and
education" -- the things most threatened by the international aid boycott.

  A sign outside a new water reservoir in Seidat's village of Bani Naim in
the rocky hills near Hebron marks a USAID project designed to increase the
hourly flow to the area by more than 260,000 gallons.

  But the reservoir is empty, as are two others built for the project.
Dozens of enormous concrete pipes that were to carry water from the
reservoir to the surrounding area are stacked by the road, and the only
workers present are guards keeping away thieves.

  Of the West Bank's 2.4 million people, about 120,000 living in small
communities do not have piped water, and those who do receive it only once
every 10 days on average, says Ihab Barghouti, economic adviser to the
Palestinian Water Authority. So West Bankers rely heavily on purchased
water -- sometimes from untreated springs and wells -- and rainwater
collected in cisterns, Barghouti says.

  Average daily water consumption, for drinking and bathing, is still only
8 to 10 gallons a day, about one-third the World Health Organization's
recommended minimum, and some people shower monthly, El-Mani said.

  "Sometimes, before I go to sleep, I think, what shall I do in the
morning in order to have water," said Seidat, a 29-year-old schoolteacher
and mother of three. "Am I going to have water in the morning or not? What
shall I do? Where do I have to go? These are big questions in my mind."
Water consumes about one-fourth of her family's monthly income of less
than $600, she says. In the past seven months, she has received just $700
of the $4,000 owed to her because international sanctions leave the Hamas
government unable to pay full salaries.

  The U.S. government is penalizing the Palestinian people for exercising
their democratic right to vote, says Seidat's brother-in-law, Ahmed
Seidat. "They talk about choice, but punish our people," he fumed.

  In Gaza, the revised U.S. aid policy means nearly 3,000 illegally
drilled wells are depleting Gaza's Coastal Aquifer and letting in
seawater, Barghouti says.

  At a municipal water distribution center in the southern town of Khan
Younis, children fill bottles while adults fill 260-gallon storage tanks
on donkey-drawn wagons. Sometimes the donkeys drink from the same source.

  To save the aquifer, USAID was going to build a desalination plant and a
pipeline to deliver the water to Gaza, but those plans were suspended
after three U.S. government contractors were killed by unidentified
assailants in October 2003. Moves to resuscitate the project were cut
short after Hamas' rise.

  "USAID was doing big projects that no other donor could do," said El-Mani=

  Maria doesn't know she'll never walk
  By Lilach Shoval, Ynet News, March 2007
  (Ynet News is the internet news site of the major Israeli daily Yediot Ac=
hronot)

  The London Times reported on Sunday that it had collected almost $10,000
in readers' donations for Maria Aman, a six-year-old Palestinian girl who
was seriously wounded in a targeted killing in Gaza some ten months ago.
Aman's mother, grandmother, brother and uncle were all killed in the
attack while she was left paralyzed from the neck down and will have to be
ventilated for the rest of her life.

  After her injury Maria was transferred to the Tel Hashomer hospital in
central Israel and from there to the Alin children's rehabilitation
facilty in Jerusalem. Initially her father, Hamdi, was barred from
visiting her as he did not have an entrance visa from Gaza but due to
public pressure he was granted entry and since then hasn't left his
daughter's side. He sleeps on a mattress beside her bed, clothes her,
feeds her, combs her hair and takes her for walks.

  "I haven't told her that her condition will never change yet. I'd rather
she think it's only temporary so that she'll be happy and won't get
depressed. Her brain is the only thing that works and the situation is
very difficult for her," Hamdi told Ynet. "In the meantime she's learning
with a computer, she goes swimming in a special pool in the hospital and
she's taken good care of here."

  After ten months of rehabilitation Maria is being allowed to leave the
hospital and move in with her father, though she will have to remain close
to the medical facility in Jerusalem since it's the only one in the
country which specializes in cases like hers. In the meantime she remains
in the hospital until the ministry of defense locates housing suitable for
her needs and also purchases the expensive medical equipment she will
need. The special wheelchair alone costs some $12,000 and her family
continues to live off state stipends and donations. Maria and her father
are not Israeli citizens and are in the country on visas.

  For several long months Hamdi did not receive the compensation money
from Israel and only media pressure eventually helped him. Hamdi was also
given a room in the hospital motel.

  Hamdi: We want an Arab environment The ministry of defense has offered
Hamdi a home in kibbutz Ramat Rachel near Jerusalem, close to the
treatment center, but Hamdi says the offer is irrelevant.

  "What will I do in a kibbutz," asks Hamdi, "from one prison they want to
send us to another prison. Maria and I are Arabs, we need to live in an
Arab environment. The best solution for us would be Beit Tzafafa, since it
is both close to the hospital and the school I want to enroll Maria in.
The problem is that the ministry of defense has yet to find us a home
there."

  Following the media exposure Hamdi and Maria garnered many citizens have
come to the Alin hospital to offer aid. Some donate money, others bring
food or clothes. "It warms my heart," says Hamdi, "I can't work when my
girl is like this. I will never stop trying to help her condition. As soon
as I can and have enough money, I will check with doctors abroad if there
is anything that can be done."

  Hamdi maintains a close relationship with his family in Gaza, including
his three-year-old son who he left there. The family also sometimes comes
to visit him and Maria. "I will never leave her. All my life I will buy
things for her, cook for her and feed her," promises Hamdi.

  (5) Wounded teen speaks about friend's killing at Gaza fence
  By B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occup=
ied Territories, 3 March 2007

  'Abd a-Ra'uf Feisal Hussein al-'Adini, 16, is a high school student and
a resident of Deir el-Balah, in the Gaza Strip. His testimony was given to
Muhammad Sabah at the witness's home on 25 January 2007.

  I live with my father, grandmother, and aunt in a two-room shack with a
tin roof. I am in the tenth grade at the government school in Deir
el-Balah. My father is ill and is unemployed. My aunt, who works at a
vegetable store, supports us. She works ten days a month and makes less
than 600 shekels. The welfare ministry gives us 100 shekels every two
months, and once a month we get 50 kilograms of flour, four kilograms of
rice, and one liter of cooking oil. We have to make do with this. We don't
have money and I don't receive an allowance when I go to school. I try to
eat breakfast at home before going to school, because I can't buy food
like other students do. Once a week, I get a shekel or two for myself. I
have to walk to school, a distance of around 1.5 kilometers, because I
don't have money to pay for transportation. It would be easier if I had a
bicycle.

  The financial situation of my best friends at school - Mahran Zakaria
Abu Nseir and 'Imad Abu Sheikhah- is better than mine, but not by much. We
spend time together in school and out, and we meet during recesses.

  Two days ago [23 January], the last day of school semester, I went to
school and took an exam in mathematics. Then, around nine o'clock, I met
my two friends. We sat together for about fifteen minutes. Mahran
suggested that we quit school and look for work in Israel , anything other
than this life of hardship in the Gaza Strip. Mahran's father is a
government clerk, and he lives off advances that he gets on his salary,
which is not currently being paid. 'Imad's father is a merchant, and is in
relatively good financial shape. 'Imad and I agreed to the idea of working
in Israel ; in any case the situation there is better than it is here.

  We agreed to meet at ten at night in the center of town. Mahran arrived
at my house by bicycle before ten. We both got on his bike and drove to
the meeting place. We left the bicycle with a friend of Mahran's. We
started on our way, walking east, to the Israeli border. We got there at
11:30 at night. When we got to about fifty meters from the border, we hid
behind some trees. We watched the border for about an hour. We saw an
Israeli army jeep and waited for it to go away. We didn't see it anymore
and thought it had left. Later it turned out that it had simply turned off
its lights.

  We moved closer to the border fence. We didn't have any tools to cut the
barbed wire. We thought we would have to climb over it. We crawled on our
stomachs until we got to the barbed wire and then quickly stood up.
Unfortunately, there was an opening, and this encouraged us to enter.
Mahran died because of this.

  We moved closer to the opening and then gunfire erupted. My friend, whom
I loved, Mahran Abu Nesayer, was hit in the stomach. I heard him cry out
and recite the martyr's prayer. Then they fired flares into the air. I
looked at Mahran and saw he was bleeding from the stomach. His shirt was
torn in the area of the wound. The three of us laid there and the shooting
continued. Mahran died five minutes after he was hit. Five minutes later,
I was hit on the right side of my buttocks, because I was laying on my
stomach. When I was hit, I called quietly to 'Imad and asked him if he had
been hit. He said that he had been hit in the shoulder. He was about half
a meter from me. I had hugged Mahran's body after he died, so he was right
next to me. I cried when I hugged him, and asked him to wake up, but he
was already dead.

  After four or five minutes, the shooting stopped, and one of the
soldiers said something in Hebrew, but we didn't understand a word. We
said, in a loud voice, "Help us, we are bleeding and we are not armed, we
only want to work in Israel . We don't want to carry out attacks."
Immediately, the soldiers again started shooting. We were totally exposed.
We had no place to hide, and lots of flares had been shot into the air. We
laid there bleeding. The shooting continued for about twenty minutes.

  Then one of the soldiers spoke to us in Arabic: "Come through the [hole
in the] barbed wire, with your hands up." 'Imad and I stood up and didn't
see anyone. We crossed the barbed wire and then saw about twenty soldiers
around twenty meters away. They were on the other side of the electric
fence, and their weapons were aimed at us. They ordered us to undress. We
undressed to our underwear. They ordered us to remove that as well. We
stood there completely naked. We were shaking from fear and from the cold
of 12:30 in the morning in the middle of winter. We stood there for about
five minutes, and then they ordered us to get dressed. It was hard to
undress and dress because of the wounds we had sustained and because of
the bleeding.

  They told us to come toward them and climb the electronic fence. 'Imad
tried but couldn't do it because his shoulder hurt so much. I helped him
climb the barbed wire, which was about three meters high. I, too, could
barely climb over the barbed wire. They ordered us to sit down on the
ground and put our head between our legs. We stayed like that for less
than five minutes. They ordered us to start walking, and they followed
with their rifles aimed at us. We walked east about fifty meters. Then
they treated our wounds for about ten minutes. One of the soldiers gave me
first-aid. He was wearing a green uniform and had a flashlight on his
head. Another soldier treated 'Imad. They took the two of us to an army
jeep and blindfolded us. The jeep drove off and about half an hour later,
we got to an Israeli army outpost, where they removed the blindfold. Some
of the soldiers filmed us, as if we were some wonder. They took 'Imad
away. I later learned that they took him to a hospital in Israel . They
didn't take me to hospital and didn't treat me completely, although my
wound hurt a lot. They put me in a room.

  At 6:00 in the morning, an Israeli in civilian clothes came into the
room He was apparently from Israeli Intelligence. He spoke with me in
Arabic and asked me how old I was and what my name was. I told him. He
asked: "Why do you want to come to Israel ?" I told him I wanted to work
in Israel. He offered me money but I refused because I was sure he wanted
me to work with Israeli Intelligence. He offered me money again, and again
I refused. Later, they moved me to a room with a bed and thin blanket. I
was alone in the room. At 9:00 A.M., 'Imad arrived. At around 2:00 P.M., a
group of soldiers came. They ordered us to get ready to go back to Gaza .
They blindfolded us and put us in an army jeep. The jeep took us to a gate
at the border in the area of al-Maghazi. We crossed through the gate, and
the residents of al-Maghazi called an ambulance for us. The ambulance came
and took us to Shohada al-Aqsa Hospital , in Deir el-Balah. The doctors
examined and X-rayed us. Palestinian

 Police officers came and asked us to tell them what happened. When we
were discharged, we went to the police station in Deir el-Balah and told
them our story.

  Now I am at home, and the days pass. But I feel as if I am still living
what happened.

The bookfair was fully enjoyable, but to take it in -- it seemed vast -- I
had to plan to spend two hours per day of the conference slowly walking
aisles.  The panels I attended were good as well.  I had intended to  pick panels
just by topic, but when I realized that many of them were poetry  readings, I
started to pick by poets on the panel.  It is as interesting to  realize what
the panelists avoid mentioning -- esp. during war-time when  afterall we all
have to file through security at airports and feel like suspects  if carrying
shampoo -- still, a tiny few of the panelists tried to bring things  like that
up, and those who did risked saying things that might come out to the  audience
sounding like bent nails: people don't want to hear about it,  about
citizenship.  A tiny group attended the Pen America session on  writers in prison and
book-banning here, on censorship and self-censorship,  though the session was
held in one of the ballrooms to accommodate a large  crowd.  Translation was an
outnumbered subject.  I felt proud to  have attended U of Houston, when I
listened to the panel on international  writers on writing, given by Ed Hirsh,
Adam Zagajewski, and Eavan Boland.   Hirsh eloquently addressed the current war
-- the only panelist I heard who did  -- and the others addressed issues such
as exile in their countries of Poland,  Ireland, and Mexico.  One journal,
Meena, publishes in Arabic and  English.  The conversation with that publisher
was better than all the rest  -- it was the only journal like it I saw.  He
described a poetry festival  he had attended in Nicaragua.  Five Americans were
invited there.   That festival was set up like a flower or farmer's market with
music and dance  and food.  The poets were warmly welcomed from the many
countries by a  poetry audience, perhaps not comprised only of poets, as poetry
audiences tend  to be here.  I fell in love with the prose-poem journal,
Sentence,  edited by Brian Clements and was so glad to get a copy.

It is so hard to find poetry in paperback -- even at bookstores -- then to
take in the huge fair at the AWP takes patience.  It is as if the poets and
publishers hide it from you then spring it on you all at once.  I have  long
wished they could distribute their wares to wider audiences, to doctor and
dentist offices, for example.  I had to go to the eye doctor when I  returned from
the conference, and the routine American ad-filled range of  magazines in the
waiting room left me feeling denaturalized before my wait was  over, compared
to what we could find at the AWP bookfair.  (I was still  upset at having to
stand in line to disrobe in an airport -- Pulitzer  prize-winners were in that
throng! -- and stash my shampoo in baggies.)   Yes, it is my Lebanese
psychiatrist who carries art periodicals in his waiting  room -- I'll ask him how that
got  started.

Fairly normal Baraka, I'd say--a few wild shots, contradictions, etc.--but =
in large part the position articulated here is fairly "mainstream." Dana Gi=
oia, Phil Levine and Baraka would agree on a lot...

calling it performance poetry or spoken word creates a problem
  and many have asked for clarity
  this is not about categories, this is about poetry performers who have not been represented in american media in a large context

  Bok and Bennett are examples of experimentalists who are very successful as performers.
  Ken Waldman is an Alaskan fiddler who "tells" poems with bow in hand
  Joy Harjo works well with music also.
  I am not sure what category Jeff Mc Daniels would fall in or myself or Sean Dougherty or so on.

  I am looking for excellent performers, world class, the genre of poetry is irrelevant. Hope that helps


Be well

Scarcity of Ads Endangers
Newspapers' Book Sections
By JEFFREY A. TRACHTENBERG
March 6, 2007; Page B1

Sometime this spring, the Los Angeles Times is expected to announce
that it is folding its highly esteemed Sunday book review into a new
section that will combine books with opinion pieces. That would reduce
to five the number of separate book-review sections in major
metropolitan newspapers still published nationwide, down from an
estimated 10 to 12 a decade ago. The reason: not enough ads.

Book publishers in recent years have moved away from buying ads in
standalone book-review sections in favor of paying to stack mounds of
books in the front of chain bookstores. Some small literary
publications, such as the New York Review of Books, are showing
growth, but the book review as a separate section is endangered not
only at the Los Angeles Times but at other major newspapers like the
Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle and San
Diego Union-Tribune.

The New York Times Book Review is an exception. "In 2006, our [ad]
revenue from books was up almost 10%," says Todd Haskell, vice
president, business development, for the Times. (The figure refers to
the book-review section plus the paper as a whole.)

"Our book review is a vibrant part of the Sunday newspaper and will
continue to be," says Mr. Haskell. "We aren't backing off an inch."

In an era of targeted marketing, publishers say the best time to reach
readers is when they are in the stores with money in their pockets
looking to make an immediate purchase. But with a sea of titles in the
stores -- the average 25,000-square-foot store in the Barnes & Noble
Inc. chain now stocks between 125,000 and 150,000 titles -- the only
way for publishers to stand out is to pay for real estate in the front
and pile those books up high.

"You want to see your books in prominent places," says Tom Perry,
associate publisher of Bertelsmann AG's Random House Publishing Group.
"Such co-op advertising is where marketing dollars are going that
might otherwise have been spent on advertising." However, Mr. Perry
notes that Random House on occasion advertises in the New York Times
Book Review when it is searching for what he described as a
"traditional book buyer."

One publisher says that chain bookstores can charge $1 or more per
book to stack titles in desirable locations, such as on a table at the
entrance or in a display featuring new nonfiction titles.

Even those who say they still support book-section advertising say
it's only effective as part of a larger marketing effort. Michael
Pietsch, publisher of Lagard=E8re SCA's Little, Brown imprint, says
advertising in book reviews can help drive sales if the author is
well-known and if it's done in conjunction with online campaigns.

Readers in San Francisco have shown themselves responsive to new
writers, Mr. Pietsch says. As a result Little, Brown often sends them
there and supports their visits with ads in the San Francisco
Chronicle, a property of Hearst Corp. "We can see the effectiveness of
advertising when we do it in conjunction with other promotions," he
says.

New York publishing houses have always cried poverty when it comes to
advertising. Every book requires a different ad, as in the movie
business, but the publishers don't have the studios' deep pockets. And
unlike other advertisers, publishers can't do brand-building: No one
buys a book because it comes from Random House or Simon & Schuster.

As the ads dry up, some of the remaining book sections fight for
survival. "You constantly have to justify your existence," says Oscar
Villalon, who edits the book section at the San Francisco Chronicle.
"Why? We don't bring in ads."

"We rarely get ads from publishers -- and I would not shy away from
the use of the word rare," says Arthur Salm, books editor for the San
Diego Union-Tribune, which is owned by Copley Press Inc.

At Washington Post Co., Jabari Asim, deputy editor of Book World, the
Post's weekly book-review section, says, "Overall, it's pretty bad.
It's very frustrating."

In California, Messrs. Salm and Villalon both say their cause won't be
helped by the Los Angeles Times's plan. The thinking is to introduce a
tabloid format that combines the weekly book-review section with
Current, an opinion section that runs on Sunday.

The 12-page section, to be introduced on April 14, will appear with
the thinner Saturday paper, which will make it not only stand out more
but also save money on printing costs because circulation is lower
that day than on Sunday. Word of the Times's plans for the book review
was first reported on the Web site LAObserved.com.

The Los Angeles Times is undergoing budget pressures as its parent,
Tribune Co., struggles with restive shareholders demanding a sale. And
at Tribune's hometown flagship, the Chicago Tribune book section had
no publishing ads at all in its 12-page book-review section Feb. 25
but still is intact.

"A book-review section is a small but important symbol of the support
of literacy," says Jim Warren, the Tribune's managing editor/features.

It vexes Mr. Warren that many New York-based publishers prefer to
advertise in the New York Times Book Review, while ignoring regional
reading communities.

"The last industry in America to go to for any wisdom about marketing
is book publishing," he says. "To say there wouldn't be a benefit to
advertising in one of the last standalone sections in a vibrant
bookselling city is an absurdity too gross to be insisted upon."

The shift away from traditional advertising hasn't helped the industry
sell more books. Bookstore sales in 2006 dropped 2.9% to $16.1 billion
from $16.6 billion in 2005, according to preliminary estimates from
the U.S. Census Bureau. Total retail sales during the same period rose
5.8% to $3.9 trillion.

Most newly published books don't get any consumer advertising at all.
Instead, publishers employ publicists to spread the word to readers
through interviews, reviews and book signings. Increasingly,
publishers are also using independent bloggers to convey news of new
titles, which helps to pinpoint specific interest groups.

The New York Review of Books, owned by Nyrev Inc., and Bookforum both
saw their sales increase in 2006. "We tend to publish reviews of books
that might not otherwise get reviewed, so when publishers have the
right title, they advertise here," says Danielle McConnell, executive
publisher of Bookforum, a unit of Artforum International Magazine Inc.
In addition to ads from some traditional New York publishers, the
magazine is also supported by academic presses and art-book houses.

Carlin Romano, the literary critic at Philadelphia Media Holdings
LLC's Philadelphia Inquirer, says that part of the problem is that
newspapers often don't have a sales person who understands the
intricacies of the book business. Even when publishers have money, he
says, they go the New York Times Book Review or the New Yorker, both
of which are national.

Some publishers do feel remorse -- and concern. It's hard to generate
word-of-mouth if readers don't see reviews.

"Over the years, I've argued that regardless of whether we think an ad
is selling a book, maybe we should help preserve some review space,"
says Mr. Perry of Random House. Despite this, Mr. Perry says that
Random House prefers to advertise when a book is already a best seller
and the publisher has something new to say about it.

The Inquirer, which had a 16-page section in the early 1980s, folded
its review into another section in 2001. Frank Wilson, the paper's
book-review editor, says that he has proposed that the paper restore
its standalone section.

"I think it's time to relaunch," Mr. Wilson says. "I don't understand
why newspapers, when they want to cut space, they immediately think of
depriving people who like to read."

Mr. Wilson says his plan calls for using new technology to franchise
such a section to other papers nationwide that could add reviews for
local authors. "I think it will enhance revenue if we can hit 30
cities," he says.

Hi's - I'm curious: has anyone out there listened to Dj Spook'y Rythm
Science cd?  Any thoughts?  Right now I'm listening to the track where
Vedic is mixed with Tristan Tzara...although I admire DjS, I can't
help thinking that this suffers from the same thing that happens when
most novels are turned into movies - Tzara loses his substantiality
and I feel like I'm listening to music in a spa...It's very unlike the
Susan Howe/David Tudor collaboration!

One more thought on Rhythm Science: on the other hand, the mix of
Gertrude Stein and Dj Wally/Dj Zeta seems absolutely perfect - I guess
the ideal remix/cover is one that brings to the surface some
particular shading of the original...here it seems to make perfect
sense that Stein is some kind of foremother to the cut and paste
aesthetics of the dj!

Hopefully I'm not talking to myself here,
Lori

MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY by Barbara Henning

Cover by Miranda Maher

110 pages		$14.00

ISBN: 0-935992-43-X


"In this witty, post-Oulipian take on you-are-what-you-read, Henning
dispossesses, recycles, and levels out the singular lines she lifts
from the likes of Bataille, Joyce or Gertrude Stein, all the way to
authors of travel and cookbooks that sit on her shelves. The resulting
seventy-one "sonnets" sound their orphaned music: "strangers now, but
once we were lovers" with the hidden glee of the artist behind her
console, sampling, spinning, shredding, and remixing. MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY
is a concept, a mirror, a community: see you there!"
Chris Tysh

"An autobiography fished and (un)tangled from the life of words: words
on paper in the air for all of us. In the beginning was the word, and
here "author" becomes a dispersed beginning entity, there all along,
allowing us in to language and life as only Barbara Henning might.
Where is Barbara Henning in this? She is everywhere, as it is finally
her "infinite pilgrimage," undertaken with and for the benefit of all.
In this wor(l)d, as she writes, and we read, "it is indeed our good
fortune / to spread out in this wide / finite subject." It is assuredly
our good fortune to open this book and let ourselves in."
Charles Alexander

"What you write : what's for dinner : the books on your shelves :
leftovers. Barbara Henning has prepared us a great meal where the
sonnets are even better than the index."

Dear Poetries,

Due to a schocking wave of submissions to our little journal at
http://listenlight.net, the release date for issue 08 of Saturday the
10th is being delayed.  Also, the intended design, employing php
trigonometric functions for div placement --- lo, it does not work in
the MSIE browser.

Get Firefox <http://getfirefox.com>.  It's free.  Do it now.  It's easy
to import your IE bookmarks.

Any further submissions, as well as some already received, will be held
for consideration for issue 09.

Best wishes,

Jesse Wayne Crockett

Joseph Summer, director of The Shakespeare Concerts, is certainly one of =
the very finest composers alive. His Shakespeare music is terrific. I hig=
hly recommend the event descibed below -- I'm going too! -- Philip

Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day: a winter concert

What:   The Shakespeare Concerts, an evening of music by Berlioz, Britten=
,
             Brahms and Massachusetts based opera composer: Joseph Summer=
.

When:  Saturday, March 17, 2007, 8:00 PM
Where: Razzo Hall, Clark University, WORCESTER, MA
&
When:  Monday, March 19, 2007, 8:00 PM
Where: Jordan Hall, BOSTON, MA
*** FREE AND OPEN TO THE PUBLIC ***

Who:    Kellie Van Horn, mezzo-soprano; Alan Schneider, tenor;
             and Eve Gigliotti, soprano;
             Quartet X with violinists Krista Reiser and Rohan Gregory,  =

             violist Peter Sulski, and cellist Jan M=C3=BCller-Szeraws;
             Sarah Brady, flute; Max Zeugner, double-bass;
                               John McGinn, Music Director

          The seasons play a major role in the sonnets of William Shakesp=
eare. Of the four seasons, the bard was fondest of summer. "Then let not =
winter's ragged hand deface In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled," be=
gins Sonnet VI, reflecting on the line "Then, were not summer's distillat=
ion left a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass," from Sonnet V, which =
immediately precedes it in this unparalleled collection of one hundred fi=
fty four fourteen-lined homages to an as yet unknown idol. "O, how shall =
summer's honey breath hold out Against the wreckful siege of batt'ring da=
ys," the poet laments in Sonnet LXV, as well as in Sonnet XCVII where he =
recalls ruefully a painful absence: "What old December's bareness everywh=
ere! And yet this time remov'd was summer's time." Shakespeare saw summer=
 as the quintessential symbol for love and happiness. "For summer and his=
 pleasures wait on thee, and thou away, the very birds are mute." (This a=
lso from Sonnet XCVII.)  Of course, his most well known reflection on the=
 happy season is "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day," the opening li=
nes of Sonnet XVIII.
          Joseph Summer, the composer of The Oxford Songs, (settings of m=
ore than sixty sonnets and scenes from the Shakespeare canon,) was natura=
lly attracted to those sonnets of summer. This March, he brings to Razzo =
and Jordan halls an evening of music based on the words of William Shakes=
peare, featuring his own realization of Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer'=
s Day for mezzo-soprano, flute, and string quintet. Summer's setting of t=
he immortal sonnet was informed by his interpretation of the underlying m=
eaning of the sonnets, which he sees as a plea by Shakespeare to a young =
man to have a child. The evidence supporting his opinion is abundant. The=
 last two lines from Sonnet VII are clear as can be: "So thou, thyself ou=
tgoing in thy noon, unlook'd on diest unless thou get a son." The last tw=
o lines of Sonnet X: "Make thee another self for love of me, That beauty =
still may live in thine or thee." "And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can =
make defence Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence," are the =
concluding lines of Sonnet XII. The combination of the season and the com=
mand to "breed," led Summer to think of his daughter, Eve (born on the ev=
ening of June 20, also known as Summer's Eve) when writing the music to S=
hall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day. The setting is pastoral and gentle=
, evoking the beauty of a young girl gathering flowers in a field, which =
is how the aria grew, as Summer looked out the window of his studio upon =
his daughter, gathering daisies and singing to the wind, when she was fou=
r years old. "Rough winds do shakes the darling buds of may," wrote the p=
oet.
          On Saturday, May 17 and Monday, March 19, the audience that gat=
hers at Razzo and Jordan Halls will hear how Berlioz, Britten, Brahms, an=
d Summer brought their own interpretations of Shakespeare to life in the =
form of opera, song, and musical tone-painting.
          Berlioz, most famous for his revolutionary Symphonie Fantastiqu=
e, was an ardent admirer of Shakespeare. He crafted numerous pieces based=
 on the bard, including La Mort D' Oph=C3=A9lie (the death of Ophelia.) K=
ellie Van Horn, mezzo-soprano, will perform with The Shakespeare Concerts=
 music director and pianist, John McGinn this concert aria based on the s=
oliloquy "There Is A Willow Grows Aslant A Brook," from the play, Hamlet.=
 Soprano Eve Gigliotti will perform Brahms' Five Ophelia songs and Summer=
's "They Bore Him Barefaced On The Bier," both interpretations of Ophelia=
's mad scene from Hamlet. Van Horn and Gigliotti will be joined by Boston=
 tenor Alan Schneider and the Boston based string quartet: QX in "Two Lov=
es I Have" the world premiere of Summer's setting of Sonnet CXLIV. Van Ho=
rn will also sing the one work on the program not directly related to Sha=
kespeare, a setting of William Butler Yeats' sonnet, Leda And The Swan, f=
or string quartet and soprano. Alan Schneider, in his fifth season with t=
he The Shakespeare Concerts, will perform Summer's "To Be Or Not To Be," =
which he has recorded for Albany Records on the first The Shakespeare Con=
certs album: What A Piece Of Work Is Man.  Schneider will also perform a =
flirtatious Sonnet CXXVIII with violin soloist, Krista Reisner, as well a=
s the final song from Twelfth Night with QX and bassist Max Zeugner. Much=
 of the music heard at the concerts was recently released by Albany Recor=
ds, under the title Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day?
          Interspersed throughout the evening's songs will be three diver=
timenti for string quartet by Benjamin Britten. Britten acknowledged Shak=
espeare in these pieces, as he titled them "Go, play boy, play," a line f=
rom the bard's frightening play, A Winter's Tale. QX, a Boston based stri=
ng quartet, consisting of violinists Krista Reiser and Rohan Gregory, vio=
list Peter Sulski, and cellist Jan M=C3=BCller-Szeraws will be joined by =
double bassist Max Zeugner to perform Joseph Summer's Dance Of The Mechan=
ics, a suite of comic dances based on the vulgar characters (known as "me=
chanics" in Shakespeare's time) from Love's Labour's Lost.

Adam:
AB's poems--the ring of truth, just terrific--I know there's no such thing
as truth & the ring of it doesn't make sense anymore but that was the phrase
that came to mind--in fact they give me tips on where I might go next.
Thanks.

At http://www.vispoets.com/ we now have a patron, a donor, an angel,
someone who likes what we're doing enough to put their money where
their mouth is, someone with a way and the means to encourage visual
poets and to support the presses who publish them.

Beginning one week from today, next Friday, March 16th, and running
for the next two months of Fridays (as a test, longer if it works
out), this patron will select the most interesting work of visual
poetry posted to the members' galleries
(http://vispoets.com/index.php?automodule=gallery&req=sc&cat=1) the
previous week and award them $25 in printed visual poetry material
from one of a variety of publishers (patron's choice of publisher,
publisher's choice of material).

All you need to do to have your work considered is be a registered
member of the site, and post something to the members' galleries that
week.

If you are a publisher of visual poetry and would like to send $25
worth of your wares to a winner or two, please email me at
vispoets@logolalia.com with your interest and contact information.

If you would like to add your support to this endeavor by sponsoring a
similar project, or, simply adding cash to all or some of the weekly
awards, we can work with you to make that happen. Email me at
vispoets@logolalia.com to discuss it further.

Whee!

Congratulations on the forthcoming exhibitions.  Wish it were more
convenient for me geographically, since there will be a fair amount of work
on view which I haven't experienced.  Carolee was indeed "friendly" towards
an ekphrastic text I wrote during her performative lecture in WASH DC about
two years ago:


PERFORM, CAROLEE [SCHNEEMANN]


Physicalization of the pictorial plane /
EYE-BODY exists as 36 images,
rigorous set of parameters for MEAT-JOY.
Found this huge crate filled
of physical configuration and the momentum
rope activates a language,
musculature in the acting.


Confluence of properties which are so entrancing /
an extraordinary psychic mystery story
ran
out in my nightgown into the snow.
Life juxtaposed with menace.
Enough confidence to trust
expectation of fantasy and righteous death.

"Everyone, The following is the press release announcing my first curatorial
endeavor -- an exhibition of works by Carolee Schneemann opening at CEPA
Gallery in downtown Buffalo on March 31. If you are in town, hope to see you
there. many thanks, Photi

CEPA Gallery Presents:
Remains To Be Seen
A thematic exhibit of the work of Carolee Schneemann
March 31, 2007 – May 26, 2007

CEPA Gallery is pleased to announce the opening of Remains To Be Seen, a
retrospective examination of the artistic output of Carolee Schneemann that
surveys the breadth and depth of her expansive contribution to contemporary
art. The exhibition will open with a reception for the artist and the
public,
Saturday, March 31, 2007 from 7 – 10 p.m. The artist and the exhibition’s
curator, Photios Giovanis, will be present.

Conceived to foster an internal dialogue between Schneemann’s diverse bodies
of work, Remains To Be Seen counters a traditional chronological format to
focus on the complexities of her creative process and its scope of
influence.

Remains To Be Seen features three central issues; War, Erotics, and Felines,
with Schneemann’s most well known works including Interior Scroll, Vulva’s
Morphia, and screenings of her films, Fuses and Meat Joy. The section on
cats
will include large format photographs and the recently completed film
Infinity Kisses. The war pieces will include video and photo grids spanning
1964 - 2006 that directly address Vietnam, Kosovo, Lebanon and the events of
9/11. Additionally, CEPA’s Public Art Window on Main Street will present
Vesper’s Pool, a display of mystical objects that center on the death of
Schneemann’s cat, Vesper.

A companion exhibit titled Broken Borders at the Museum of Contemporary
Canadian Art in Toronto, curated by David Liss, runs March 23 – April 30,
2007. It addresses Schneemann’s history of working in Canada and includes
three recent large scale, multi-channel video installations.

A catalog, Split Decision, produced in partnership with the Museum of
Contemporary Canadian Art, encompassing the two exhibits, will be available.
The publication explores Schneemann’s career from different historical and
political perspectives to expand critical awareness of her work. It will
document a wide range of works and will include essays by leading art
scholar
Thomas McEvilley, Canadian art critic Jim Drobnick, Buffalo-based media
artist Caroline Koebel."

Hi all,

Still no new permanent distributor for boog city as yet, so I'll be
borrowing my dad's jeep to deliver the paper tomorrow, preferably, or
Sunday.

I'm hoping someone might be game to ride along and jump out and drop off the
papers at each of our 33 distribution points. I can pick you up and drop you
back off and, if there's something you've been needing to pick up and
haven't had a vehicle to do so, help you out with that, too.

Please let me know as soon as you can.

THANKS!
david

Comments: To: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

The Age of Huts (compleat)

Ron Silliman is the author of more than twenty volumes of poetry. His
most recent books include _Woundwood, Under Albany, MultiPlex,_ and
_N/O._and the weblog "Silliman's Blog" (ronsilliman.blogspot.com).

http://go.ucpress.edu/Silliman

"It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of Ron
Silliman's _Age of Huts_; it was ground-breaking when it first began
to appear, piecemeal, a quarter of a century ago, and it remains a
revolutionary work today. With its proliferative architecture, its
encyclopedic arc, and its endlessly inventive methodology, _The Age
of Huts_, with virtually every sentence, renews its engagement with
the world."-Lyn Hejinian


Between the Age of Innocence and the Age of Experience comes _The
__Age of Huts. _This book brings together for the first time all of
the poems in Ron Silliman's _Age of Huts _cycle, including _Ketjak,
Sunset _ _Debris, The Chinese Notebook, _and _2197, _as well as two
key satellite texts, _Sitting Up, Standing, Taking Steps, _and _BART.
_Each poem offers a radically different approach toward using
language to explore the world. One of the founding works of Language
Poetry, _The Age of __Huts _is about everything, more or less
literally, as each sentence, even each phrase, embarks on its own
narrative, linking together to form a large polyphonic investigation
of contemporary life. From _Ketjak, _one of the first poems to employ
"the new sentence," to _2197, _a serial work that scrambles the
vocabulary and grammar of its sentences, _The _ _Age of Huts
_questions everything we have known about poetry in order to see the
world anew.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is
available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Silliman

Subject:      Re: Outsider Art
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

though not an "outsider artist" other than that his well known Anarchism and
having been the Cultural Director as it were during the Paris Commune of
1871--which got him booted out of France to save his skin--Gustave Courbet
wrote a famous kind of "outside" credo in a letter of refusal to a Minister
in the French Second Empire government in 1870--which Monarchist government
had decided to make up for the bad treatment M. Courbet had endured due to
his involvements in the 1848 Revolution-
For in the immensity of its forgiveness and willingness to embrace M.
Courbet as an artist and Frenchman--this noble government  had decided to
give him the ribbon of the Legiond'Honneur--a purely political move to be
sure, but one that would most surely tempt any Frenchman, artist or not--
But not Gusatve Courbet! Courbet's famous letter of refusal ends with some
ringing lines of another kind of "outside" that an artist may hear calling--

      "Therefore permit me, monsieur le Ministre, to decline the honor you
thought to bestow upon me.  I am fifty years old and I have always lived as
a free man.  Let me be free the rest of my days;  for when I die, let it be
said of me:  'He never belonged to any school, to any church, to any
insitution, to any academy--least of all to any regime, lest it be the
regime of liberty."

Bukowski, despite the Hollywood films and vast cult following and steady
sales iin the usa, was the kind  of "american outsider" who was a cultural
icon overseas--in his native Germany, France, Italy and many other
countries, Bukowski is ranked as one of the greatest, and fairly often, the
greatest of American writers of the last fifty years or more--

a much more usual fate of an "outsider artist" --the examples are far more
than one might think--is that of Prophet William Blackmon, a preacher and
painter, whose vocations in both cases come from God--Prophet didn't begin
paintng until late in life--his works have been collected and exhibited and
included i books and a very large one hangs here in the Milwaukee Art
Musuem, with its famous Calatrava "wings"--and just a few weeks ago at
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Prophet shared a show with another
spiritually -inspired Seattle artist--and there was an evening with Prophet
present, to talk after showing of the film "God's Spaceship," a 1989
documentary/interview--
i first met Prophet about 18 years ago, selling paintings on the street
corners and giving readings of illlnesses and praying for their
healings--and once and a while a prediction regarding the future that had
come to him from God--he had a tiny ministry of mainly homeless and very
poor people and also did shoe repairs--
as he is getting quite elderly now, it's more difficult for Prophet to work
at his trade and the minsitry has always been a basically losing business as
he gaves away much of what he has to the homeless worse off than himself--
this winter he found himself homeless--fortunately offered lodging by a
Sister in his ministry--
his spirit is indomnaitbale as ever--he vastly enjoyed the evening and spoke
for quite along time about his life, his Faith, his visions from God, and
his painting, which he does directly on instructions from God--
(he told me one time when i had first begun making rubBeings and spray
paintings--he thought they also were sent by God--since no one else was
making these things, God had called to me to make them so the world would
know these things exist though no  one had noticed them before--he also told
me another time God works through such kinds of art as He tells people to
do, to show sanity in an insane world--sanity to be seen so people will
suddenly know the insanity of their brains and want to be sane--"which is a
dangerous thing in this world"--he laughed quite a bit at that, Amen--)

so despite all the hoopla and commercializations and appropriations,
distortions, massive mad immensities and intensities of bullshit--there are
actually a great many "outsider artists" who despite being wirtten about,
collected and presented in museums, remain in life ill, neglected, poor,
without materials to work with or home, living in various places as they
can--and in many cases, uncertain what will heppan to their works after
their deths--because all sorts of things become possible when they are
infact dead--
possibilities many artists know exist--yet not for them, not in this
lifetime--
not  in the sense of agreat genius or respectable more or less  nice artists
who one can sentimentalize over for having been overlooked in their
lives--and later welcomed into the worlds of respectability--and al its
instituions--
because the "outsider artists" in the original senses of this--are always
going to be "outsiders" in a way their fellows aren't--
that kind of outsiderness--Art Brut-- is something that can't be
appropriated or learned in art school or "rescued", or captured by a label,
a section in art books or museums--

it's not a question of being "more""outside" or "more authentic"--but of
something other--
something that for all the "recognition" it gets, remains paradoxically
mainly unrecognized-
there are and will be always a few exceptions--but even those aren't
recognized as being "real artists" like the ones runinng the vast gamut from
O'Keefe and Picasso to Yoko Ono to Charles Schultz to  Thomas Kincaide to
any issue of any art magazine no matter what genres--including the journals
of "outsider art"--
more and more of whom are like the artist i saw posters of for a while
around town, "Wisconsin's Most Famoous Outsider Artist"--(never heard of
him) --pcitured in studio, expensive easel produly standing among tons of
the latest offerings from Utrecht,with a nice view o fa "landscape" through
the "studio window"--immensely professional looking and al speaking very
much of being guaranteed the viewer the very best and most up-to-date in
"Outsider Art"--complete with web site, fax address and al the rest--
"a perfect addition to any home"  i am sure--


again, i would recommend Lucienne Piery's Art Brut:  The Origins of Outsider
Art

for the hsitory of this and for the ways from the very beginning of
Dubuffet's naming, collecting, exhibiting, writing on, having monographs
written on, establishing a center for Art Brut, and influencing the Artists
Houses set up for Art Brut artists--from the beginning of all this, the
awarenesses of the continual changes and obstacles, questions involved, both
in critical terms, effects on the personal lives of the artists, and the
financial aspects and the dangers posed by all the massive masrhalling of
powers of the art world and media which  in the end have buried Dubbeffet's
orignal ideas of Art Brut and what Art Brut inspires and can be an example
of in different ways of thinking about materials, possiblities, researchs,
for other artists--
(even in the midst of the furor, now, and later, once the feeding frenzy has
become but a laugh and lark, a discarded and discredited fashion--so
deminished and pase as to be laughed at as here and now--the artists
themsleves, the vast nameless ones,the creators, go on creating anyway--art
brut in Dubuffet's conceptions of it--has been around since the dawn of time
and will cointue on regardless--maybe one of the only kinds of "art" which
will d so--having been nameless and unnoticed for millenia--it's not a
"movement" in any sense of the term--other than a continual movement of
making out of its own myriad callings--it's not going to have an "end" as
say any School or Movement etc does-- the stubborn, "Brut," anarchic
persistence of the "art" "drive" or "impulse" no matter what is done with
it, to it, for it, by it--kill the artists, burn their works, ban them,
throw them in jail, put them on peddestals, ahng them in person and in
galleries, chop off their hands, put out their eyes, sic god, the state, the
crtics, the collectors, the dealers, the forgers, the ridiculers, the
know-it-alls, the pedants, the art lovers, the art teachers, the art supply
companies, sic all of them on art, the artist--there will always be some
damn fool who in some inexpicable way hears a calling and will start making
things out of next to nothing-anything at hand---regardless if anyone else
is even paying attention--and so Art Brut wil return to its anonymity . . .
or recognitions . . . whatever the ebbs and flows of these--it remains
intact--obdurately watching al that comes and goes around
it--vanishes--reappears--like Easter Island heads observing the circulations
of the air, the light, the ocean, the ships, the birds, the visiting
humans--knowing the energies that live in them are out there out
somewhere--creating their myriad strange companions--


Dubuffet's ideas and projects and their histries as Lucienne Piery details
them are
ia far more interesting and useful vision and hisotry than what has beomce
the kind of mindless "another booth at the art fair" Christopher Winks  ably
describes--
which is actually interesting in a funny way as when i was a kid in Vermont
at places like the notorious Tunbridge World's Fair and scattered about
through  other much smaller fairs--there would be itinerent portrait
painters who would set up shop and for a noimal fee paint your picture--or
if you wanted, a picture of something else--they'd also have a little bunch
of hand made set ups for displaying their other works-- and if they wre
alittle more prosperous than some of their brothers and sisters also making
the circuit, they'd have anextra display of velvet Elvses, those Children of
the Damned kids wtih immense eyes, Jesus, unicorns, stock cars, and the
like--your basic kitsch--
the artists for the most part were affable carnies--could keep up a good
patter,chain smoke and have some brews--and in general add to the festive
atmosphere (which at the Tunbridge World's Fair, of course, eventually just
slid out of control--it lasted for days--what with homebrew swigging and
later on open marijuana smoking backwoods people charging the"Garden of
Eden" strip show tent, "liberating" the Freak Show (inviting them to join in
the party aad leave their tents)--old family feuds erupting, smashed stunt
drivers crashing, illegal gamblers pulling knives and the like--once more
highminded folks started moving in to the state, of course all this
basically good clean medieval Rabelian fun had to stop!--"outsiders" from
the wealthier, more educated and more morally concerned parts of the world,
like new Puritans--refused to accept the Art Brut qualities of this
happening scene--horrified at the anarchy of it all--my God!--drunken
"liberated" Freaks posing for portraits with families, naked couples running
into the woods, the "Garden of Eden"dancers baring all while drinking and
smoking on stage, the ecstatic glee of children on rides at which the stoned
carnie had fallen asleep with the "On" lever on for an hour or more due to
his having collapsed on it--
Woodstock to these new people was a Sacrement, but this kind of communing
obviiously foul and pagan--and attended by al the wrong sorts of people--so
it was banned, done away with, and consigned to happy memories--and
onewonders what happened to al those painters?--probably collectors now
among the ones who put them out of work and fun--making a bundle off their
surviving works on ebay, sellng them at nice new fairs with New Age  and
RISD educated themes in booths of their own--as "Primitive Portraits" by
"Outsider Artists" --to dealers disguised as tourists who in turn purchase
them for the galleries in New York, Milan, Paris, Stuttgart, Tokyo, Sao
Paulo, Dubai, Los Angeles, etc--

meanwhile--uncannily--hidden in plain sight--"they walk among us"--the
"outsider artists"--
"art brut"--among their own "regimes of liberty"--

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce in paperback:

The Collected Poems of Ted Berrigan

Hi Kasey (long time etc), and everybody over at Kasey's blog who's posted
on this subject, and anyone reading this here, Zukofsky's "Mantis" is
probably the precedent for how Ron uses the word torque in his "New
Sentence" essay. Torque seems a novelty in Ron's essay, as it provides
some high contrast with other terms he uses there such as measure,
paragraph, syllogism, sentence, polysemy / ambiguity. Zukofsky
characterizes (among other things) how he writes the sestina "Mantis" by
the parenthetical phrase "thoughts' torsion." Torsion would then refer not
only to the 'twisted' normative syntax displayed in "Mantis" but to the
multiple twists performed on the sestina form invented by troubadour
Arnaut Daniel by evoking a particular use for it in 1933-34 Depression
America (after a late-19C sestina splurge by Chucky Al et al). And since
it's Zukofsky, torsion away from historical precedent toward contemporary
particulars is going to hold you at every level, down to the syllable and
into the letters if you care to go. D'ya think? - Louis

Yes, agree with Murat, David, a wonderful, insightful post.

Funny, how it also makes me think of 14th century German (I believe) iconic
Christian paintings in devotion to and in celebration of various Biblical
allegories. I remember a CAA annual conference in Boston in which the
lecturer showed infra-red (?) slides of the under-painting (preliminary
sketches) for various works. Instead of stiff depictions of iconic
allegorical figures, we  were given a very naturalistic view of the models -
men, women and children - drawn from the village around the school where the
works were painted, definitely  made to conform to and please the strictures
of the Church.
Following the argument here, the 'outsider' art was actually secreted into
the interior life of the 'inside' of the Church.  I guess we might call
these 'under paintings' a case of "insider" art. Ironically it's taken 6
centuries to bring the work into view.  I don't know if the work will ever
achieve the attention of Courbet - but it's definitely of the material
world, and not of allegory made.

Somehow brings up the recollection of the story of prisoners in Quantanamo
making poems on thin strips of the paper pealed back from paper cups - and
passing those strips among each other. Definitely 'insider' art by
'outsiders.'

Thanks for these, Jennifer B.
I get the Bk Rev on Wed so I wrote a letter to the ed then, saying that if
the Times wants to do something for poetry in this country they shd review
innovative poetry from the Lang poets on--but then saying that maybe that i=
s
pointless to suggest bec it is a mainstream publication.
Yr Tarn essay is the kind of thing that shd appear there!
Best,
Ruth L.

the Guardian about them and some of their works to see the light of day.

Something that never ceases to amaze and fascinate me is how many fragments
of ancient texts--Sappho for example--quite recently a singificant find in
Egypt f her work--how many are found in large waste disposal areas and even
sometmes blowing n the streets in Egypt.  The texts were written on the
backs of papryi which were being recycled from the windings of what were
considered insignifcant mummies.  (Rather like the truly wild "routine"
recorded by Burroughregardng heirachy and decompositon of mummies ont eh CD
that comes with the Word Virus selection of his works.) Considered recycled
near-trash to begin with, they eventually found their ways all the wayinto
the trah, where rummaging scholars now find a regualr feast of poems,
documents, etc in fragments.
      Since I do a great deal of work with found materials and fragements
found in streets, alleys, dunpsters, concstruction sites and so forth--it's
an added hilarity to pretend am  finding the Milwaukee equivalents of the
fragments of Sappho lyrics among the wind blown rubbish clambering about in.
  Makes one think of the Mr Magoo episode in which he gets hooked on
archeology and is inhis nearsighted way excavating dumps and consrtuction
sites!  As a child I used to help my steamiftter grandfather go through
sites he worked at after dinner  to find scrapmetal and loose screws etc
he'd weld into all sorts of things at home, from a merry-go-round to a
go-cart to religious chokers and birdhouses, jewerly and the like. The
interrealtionships among junk, recycling, the finding of fragments of lost
poems, and also making new poems from scraps and biits and pieces of thrown
out, smashed, weathered, refuse as a way to refuse that the lives of the
things themselves are ever gone completely, but like Whitamn's "leaves of
grass," are tongues still speaking, from outof the ground itself.
A lot of "outsider art" is made in this way, as well as the work of one of
the greatest all around artists/poets of the 20th century--Kurt Schwitters.
What I like especially with Schwitters is ht he used found materials--the
Surrealists used things found, but at fleamarkets, and hence pruchased for
use.  The Situationists with their "psychogeographies" and "driftings"
carried this into the realm of o form of awareness of the states of mind
eoked by found archectrues, streets, squares, and ambienece at once
constructed and evocative beyond its physical being into the relam of a
provocation of free mental play, daydreaming, fantasy, imagination.  (Though
one finds this also In breotn's Nadja and Aragon's Paris Peasant--and
further back in De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium Eater, which
Baudealire partially translated.)  (Think of Atget's dreamlike documenatry
photos of empty Parisian sites as ebing related to these.)
Among various writers and artits since the bginnings of modernism with
baudlaire, one cn find  coonections with aspets of "outsider art" in the use
of found materials that are the excess as it were of the overaproduction of
mass production as well as as the built in obsolence of this, combined with
the throwing away of all manner of materials once used. A Joseph Cornell
box, for example, is not that far from many works of "oputider art" which
are madewith fragemnts of onbects, texts and collections of these which
share certan qualities of resemblances among themselves.  What develops very
often is a langauge, a text in a sesne, made up of forms which begin to
carry  cetain private meanings and connotations--hence the repititon of many
key elements, wheather in Cornell, Schwitters or amny Art Brut artists
iexemplifeid n the colection begun byDubuffet.
William Carlos Willims in Spring of All ues many exmaples of this, some more
obvious than others.  As he said himself a poem can be made of anything"
(the famous one of the Dungess is it  clams--menu is an example).  Willims
takes a black and white repoduction of aJuan gris paiting, voices off
theradio and their advertiing slogans, billboards and signs, all manner of
fragments from daily life to create his own form of poetry from raw
materials foudn in the environment he is goig about in on his Doctor's
errands.  Dos passo in the USA trilogy andManhattan Transfer usses raw dta
also, documents, headlines, newspaper stories, snatchesof popular songs and
the like.  The most extreme and brillaint user f found texts I think is Paul
Metcalf, whose Apalache is completely made of found texts, yet the way it is
put togetehr by Pual makes of these one of the great long poems in a sesne
of modern times.  (Man of his toher works are constcutedof juxtapostions of
found texts, with here nd there linking commenatry of his own, and other
times not, simply the juxtapostions.  Oslon and Susan Howe's earlier work
also do this and Clark Coolidge's Smithsonian Depositions, another
brilliiant book made of found texts.)
In a great many "outsider art" work, Art Brut, there is also much use of
found materials and in also of mixingof texts with images. Sometimes the
"texts" are completely invented, others like Prophet Blackmon write wods
from Scripture around the paintings or within them also.
I think that both Prinzhorn with his 1921 book Art of the Mentally Ill and
Dubuffet with his creation of Art Brut and its ideas he presented for other
artits, viewers,etc--I think iwht both tthese projects there is this now
buried concept of Art Brut, "outsider art"--that is it art on apra with
"high art"--i terms of art itelf, and in termsof the usesofmaterials,
private lnaguages every rtit creates among public ones found al about one,
and that the difference is not in the art being not art, but in that the
motivations of the Art Brut and outsider artist are differrent from those of
the "rtist" as standarldy conceived of. That many outsider artist and Art
Brut creators may be anything from copletely ignorant of "art" so called to
having a sketchy knoweldge gleaned from newspaer andmagzines, a tv show
nowadays or a talk they heard someplace is not necessarily what sets them
apart intheir difference, for man "artists" have begun in this way also.
The difference seems to be that the "outsider" or Art Brut creator--is an
uncanny and strange way considered to be more "open" to the operations of
forces from "outside" which are drving their work in a different way than
does say the classical "Muse."  For Prinzhorn's pateints of curseit is
"mental illness" that provides the "poutside force" so to speak,
thesomething which "makes a difference."  Many Art artits are not "mentally
ill," but simply outside any conception of the "art world."  Each one has a
different motivation or desrie in craetingtheir work, but it not in the
manner of n "artist," that is it i driven by something esle than the
thoughtof bengpart of any system other than its own.  It is definetley
capableof being seen and understod as "art," yet also obviously stands
outside the institutions and histories and cocnepts of the "art world"
system.
For Dubuffet this ofers t the "artist" an example of an opening and way out
the sytemsof "art."  Whetehr an "artist" can bever "become an outsider
artist" per se is debatable.  What Dubuffet is suggesting not to "become an
Art Brut creator," but to be sinpired by their examples to go further and
further afeld fromthe constarints of the system.

It's imporatant to note hat Dubbeffet's criteria for Art Brut are notlimited
to  mental illness.  in the early days of roganzing Art brut and collecting
it, selecting it for exhibtions--Andre Bretonworked closely with Dubuffet.
But as with many others, Breton was to split from Dubuffet andleave the
field tohim.  The cuase of their disagreement wasthat breon wanted toinsist
tha only works by the mentally ill could be considered Art Brut. (he had
after al trained as a psychologist.)  For Dubuffet, itis the "art" qualities
which are considered, not the mental status of the creator, which cn be
anything at all. Dubuffet was more interested in the untrained and unknowing
things made by creators than in the psychological motivations.  That's avery
improtant point but one ofte overlooked by people when speakingof "outsider
art" and thinkingof it onlyasworks by the mentally ill.  A lotof Art Brut
creators were and are solid citizens with regular jobs they stay with for
years.  The live a "normal" life except that they produce thei works,
without the intention of them being part of the art system.  The works can
be seen if so desired as the "secret" or "inner" lives and deries, dreamsof
the "normal
" persons, but again, this isn't "mental illness."


If one begins to think of Art  Brut and "outsider art" as having both a
difference from and many interrealtionships with aspects of "art", I think
it's a very interesting and useful way of questioing and finding ever more
ways of making things and thinking with things found.  art Burt is a kind of
tool in Deleuze and Guattari's  sense of the tool kit--or my grandfatehr's
sense or my own bag of tools--a tool kit for oepning lines of
deterriorlaizations and investigations, what i call "anarkeyology."

It really is no accident that though  doing so out of hatred and scorn, the
nazis mad a conection between "outsider art" and "modern art."  The nazis
saw this "degenerate art" on both parts a "mental illnesses" which needed to
be eradicated from a "healthy" society.  Dubuffet in  a sense sees their
point, but not as "metnal illness" but as a form of revolt against systems,
Fascism ceratinly beingone of them, and to be extended to all systems if one
so desires. The Nazis recngized what they thought to be a "danger to
society,";  Dubuffet saw the "danger"  (of contemination, contagion, etc)
as a "healthy revolt" against society and the "art sytem."  And not only a
healthy revolt, but the most imperatively neccesary one.  "Necessity is the
motherfucker of invention," iin that sense as wel as in using lietarlly
anything to make a poem or "art."  And necessity begins very often not from
a nothing, but from the excess refuse and loose parts, fragments, of systems
which are
continully creating new orders so as to control the breakdowns built into
them. By making use of materials that are part of the breakdowns, one has a
chance to make things moving inthe directionof an outsideof the syetem. It's
in this area that Art Brut and many apsets of art from odernism on overlap.
And I think tha is very much in the origins of Art Brut having been created
as it were by an artist, a very great artist.  (Robert Smithson works can
also be seen as related to a this, in the use of broen rok, soill,
strutures, sites/non-sites and his ideas at the timeo f his death on using
art in th reclamation of industiral y deimated landscapes--again a recylcing
and a making use of the found materials.)  Here below is Guardn article re

>
>Twenty-one poems written "inside the wire" in Arabic, Pashto and English

>law professor at Northern Illinois University who represents 17 of the
>detainees at the camp. The collection, entitled Poems from Guantánamo: The
>Detainees Speak, will be published in August by the University of Iowa
>Press with an afterword written by Ariel Dorfman.
>
>It all began when he turned up at the secure facility in Washington DC
>where all communications from detainees are sent, and found a poem waiting
>for him.
>
>"The first poem I saw was sent to me by Abdulsalam al Hela," he says. "It's
>a moving cry about the injustice of arbitrary detention and at the same
>time a hymn to the comforts of religious faith."
>
>"It was interesting to me because I did a PhD in literature, but I didn't
>think too much about it."
>
>A second poem from another client followed soon after, and Falkoff began to
>wonder if other lawyers also had clients who were sending poetry. It turned
>out that Guantánamo Bay is "filled with itinerant poets".
>
>Many of the poems deal with the pain and humiliation inflicted on the
>detainees by the US military. Others express disbelief and a sense of
>betrayal that Americans - described in one poem as "protectors of peace" -
>could deny detainees any kind of justice. Some engage with wider themes of
>nostalgia, hope and faith in God.
>
>But most of the poems, including the lament by Al Hela which first sparked
>Falkoff's interest, are unlikely to ever see the light of day. Not content
>with imprisoning the authors, the Pentagon has refused to declassify many
>of their words, arguing that poetry "presents a special risk" to national
>security because of its "content and format". In a memo sent on September
>18 2006, the team assigned to deal with communications between lawyers and
>their clients explains that they do not "maintain the requisite subject
>matter expertise" and says that poems "should continue to be considered
>presumptively classified".
>
>The defence department spokesman Jeffrey Gordon is unsurprised that access
>to detainees poetry is tightly controlled. "It depends on what's being
>written," he says. "There's a whole range of things that are
>inappropriate." Of course poetry that deals with subjects such as guard
>routines, interrogation techniques or terrorist operations could pose a
>security threat, but Gordon is unable to explain why Al Hela's poem is
>still classified, saying "I haven't read any of these [poems]".
>
>As with prisoners within the American justice system, he argues, there are
>constraints on their first amendment rights. "I don't think these guys are
>writing poetry like Morrissey," he continues.
>
>"The fear appears to be that detainees will try to smuggle coded messages
>out of the camp," explains Falkoff, a fear that has often allowed clearance
>for English translations only - Arabic or Pashto originals being judged to
>represent an "enhanced security risk". In many cases even Falkoff has only
>seen the translations prepared for the volunteer lawyers by the few
>translators with the requisite security clearance.
>
>Because of security restrictions, Falkoff cannot give any further details
>about Al Hela's poem, or about other poems sent to him by his clients that
>have not been cleared for publication by the department of defence. He is
>not allowed to see about 20 poems sent to other lawyers that have not been
>cleared for publication.
>
>Many poems have also been lost, confiscated or destroyed. Falkoff is unable
>to even offer an estimate of how many poems have been written in the camp.
>
>"To start with," he says, "there are probably 200 detainees who either
>don't have lawyers or have not been allowed to communicate with their
>lawyers. Even for those clients who have lawyers, I really don't know how
>many poems they've written or whether they've been confiscated.
>Communicating back and forth with our clients is a very, very difficult
>process."
>
>Only one of the authors in the forthcoming collection wrote poetry before
>his incarceration. The religious scholar Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost wrote
>25,000 lines of poetry during his time in the camp, only a handful of which
>have been returned to him. A poem he wrote on a Styrofoam cup and
>reconstructed from memory after his release appears in Poems from
>Guantánamo. The other detainees were not poets before their incarceration,
>but have turned to poetry under the particular pressures of their
>situation.
>
>Moazzam Begg, who spent three years in Guantánamo Bay before being released
>without charge in January 2005, began writing poetry as a way of explaining
>what he was going through. He knew that everything he wrote would be
>censored, so used poetry to try to describe his situation to his family.
>
>"The idea was to say it without saying it," he says, "and to explain to my
>interrogators that it was a farce."
>
>The formal constraints of poetry gives the writer control over their
>material, he says, "the ability to say the words without going into a
>rant".
>
>Poetry was also a way of engaging with the system.
>
>"I knew that everything I wrote would be censored," he continues, "and that
>the person censoring it would have to read the poem." By writing in
>English, a language rarely used by detainees in the camp, he was able to
>communicate directly with guards, and perhaps those higher up in the US
>military.
>
>It was also a way of "showing anger" and "channelling frustration".
>
>According to Falkoff, detainees are writing poetry because "they're trying
>to keep hold of their sanity and humanity".
>
>"They have really, really nothing to do there," he says. "They get, now, an
>hour of exercise every other day or so. They don't have access to books,
>apart from a Qu'ran - which they get whether they want it or not - and a
>little book cart with some Agatha Christie novels and some Harry Potter.
>They're not allowed to interact with the other prisoners. There are no
>communal areas. The recreation area is like a chimney with 30ft high
>walls."
>
>"They're writing poetry because they need some kind of mental stimulation,
>some way of expressing their feelings, some outlet for their creativity."
>
>According to the poet Jack Mapanje, who was imprisoned in Malawi because of
>his writing and now teaches a course on the poetry of incarceration at
>Newcastle University, prisoners often turn to writing poetry as a way of
>"defending themselves".
>
>"People are writing as a search for the dignity that has been taken away
>from them," he says. "It's the only way they can attempt to restore it, but
>nobody is listening to them." He was imprisoned himself with many people
>who were illiterate, he says, but many of them were writing poetry, or
>singing songs about their captivity - "it's the same impulse that drives
>people to prayer."
>
>"Poetry talks to the heart," he continues, "there is something immediately
>passionate about it." For Mapanje, poetry is a more "natural" means of
>expression than prose, a means of communication that "anybody who hasn't
>got any craft will come to".
>
>The poet Tim Liardet, whose Forward prize-shortlisted collection Blood
>Choir deals with the time he spent teaching poetry at a young offenders'
>prison, agrees there's an "instinctual" urge to reach for poetry in extreme
>circumstances.
>
>"They're feeling things they've never felt before, or never with so much
>intensity," he says. "They've never had to try to match such an intense
>experience with language before."
>
>Many of the offenders he worked with resisted his efforts to get them to
>write poetry, he continues, but "the ones who ended up writing it were the
>ones who found it themselves. They weren't following an example from me."
>
>Falkoff is hoping the collection of poems from Guantánamo Bay will put a
>human face on people branded by the former American defence secretary
>Donald Rumsfeld as "among the most dangerous, best-trained, vicious killers
>on the face of the Earth".
>
>The quality of the poems in the collection is "variable", says Falkoff, but
>"there's some really good stuff there". He stresses that because of
>security restrictions he has often been unable to see anything more than
>translations prepared without "poetry in mind". Nevertheless some of the
>poems transcend their extraordinary circumstances, he says, and "just knock
>me over".
>
>With the courts moving slowly towards fair and open hearings, he continues,
>"the detainees' own words may become part of the dialogue. Perhaps their
>poems will prick the conscience of a nation."

Kasey's third question / scenario that ends his post today on torque
deprecatingly implies that his own desire to articulate a neutral taxonomy
and Ron's desire to evaluate under-40 poetry both may be equally reifying
a literary past of collective prose-poem practice. So or not, I believe
there's a missing, larger point in "all this," and it peeks out in the
language of Kasey's third scenario that asks: "How much of all this really
has to do directly with any formal considerations of syntax or grammar or
lineation or whatever, as opposed to drawing on a set of associations
which have accreted around surface features of Language writing, but which
ultimately have much more to do with superformal considerations (political
contexts, statements of intent, social dynamics, etc?" It strikes me that
a larger and more challenging point stems from a directly opposed premise
to that of Kacey's third scenario, namely that the "formal" and the
"superformal" are not differentiable (Kasey's scenario suggests they are
differentiable, it would seem). Or at least they are not differentiable
except in a guidebook way (as in a guidebook to form and ideas about
poetry). Surely form as inherently neutral pure essence doesn't exist
except in guidebooks and the rhetoric of criticism ("A sestina is...").
Frankly the social as neutral pure essence of "sociality" doesn't exist
except in the loins of partygoers' heads and the drawing rooms of Georg
Simmel. As Adorno a window no writes: "In order for the work of art to be
purely and fully a work of art, it must be more than a work of art" --
which sounds like an enormous challenge for any of us. The "more" in this
quotation points to a different understanding of "torque" than as either
"formal" or "superformal" elements of a "work" and its context. Le torque,
here, however, is no longer Ron's torque (as he outlines it in his
torqu-ography -- the recent blog-post that I only just read), nor is it
Kacey's torse / torsion / torque triad, and yet Le torque informs both
Ron's evaluative comments and Kacey's umbrage to them. As I said, it
sounds to me like an enormous chilly lunge for any of us to take. - Louis

That's terrific. This would be a good thing to have Vincent post to our
minors list, don't  you think?

"all these pretty nuns"
by Jamey Stevenson
=A0
all these pretty nuns
are enough to make a boy like me
reconsider piety
and I've been cast out of paradise so many times
for so many victimless crimes
it's a sin
but when God steals your woman you know you can't win
=A0
all these pretty nuns
cloistered in the hollow of His hand
while this voice commands me:
"climb this tree"
"pick this apple"
but your spirit guides you past all desire
and you can't feel the fire
=A0
(you can't feel the fire)
=A0
bring me a chariot of my own
to knock down the pillars and shatter the throne
after all, don't we all die alone?
it's a sin
but when God steals your woman you know you can't win
=A0
heart and soul
you're drawing lines that don't exist
self-deprivation is always the twist
while you leave me twisting
unkissed
=A0
all these pretty nuns
shivering in God's embrace
forbidden fruit is an acquired taste
but you'll continue chaste and chased
it's a sin
but when God steals your woman you know you can't win

Pas.

siting the edge of SL - at this particular point, SL/RL physics is trans-
formed into aberrant behavior; objects are literally deconstructed.

Think of these as collisions, speed-motion studies, the last digital ikon,
emptied signifiers, transformations of desire, metaphors for metonymy.

Stephen,

If life is a prison (an idea considered since time immemorial), then the
outsider is the insider, and the insider the insider seeing itself clearly.

a sudden and mysterious illness which turned out to be a serious case of
meningitis. He needed emergency surgery and also suffered a heart attack and
kidney failure as a result of symptoms related to the illness. His friends
have come together to help him at this critical time. We are reaching out to

Hi All,
I'm pleased to announce that Jennifer has been accepted into the
University of Chicago's Comparative Lit MA/PHD program. We (Jennifer,
Sherpa, myself and Hot Whiskey) will be moving to Chicago this August
and should be there for a while...at least 6 years or so....so, if
anyone wants to hang out out there, we'll be looking for friends and
letterpress facilities and good poetry happenings and will also plan
to host these sortsa things as we have in Boulder. Very excited. Hope
to really build a community out there of poet artist weirdos and to
find and join the ones that already exist.

We'll be there the last week of March checkin things out. If anyone
wants to have a drink or trade chapbooks or dork out over poetry,
we're open.
best,
Michael Koshkin

Dear All
The English Department (UMN) and the IAS's Art as Knowing
Collaborative are sponsoring a reading by KAMAU BRATHWAITE at the
Loft, 1011 Washington Avenue South, Minneapolis, March 23, 7 pm.
Those of you who saw his 1997 performance at the Cross-Cultural
Poetics conference know what an astonishing experience it is to see
him perform.

Just got an email from a pal sent a letter detailing
18-hrs of sleep per week out in Iraq.

Stood out at the bus stop, smiling like a sunfish,
eating ribs of bacon, a Turkish coffee, testing my
reflexes, a sign around my neck: This might look like
me, but it aint, and this aint my life. Hard life.

Anyway, anyone know of open mics from here, that's
Milwaukee, Woodland Pattern not-with-standing hype and
content, places to read. Oh, and I want to read to
civilians - not other poets.

Two more months till returning to China and don't
wanna drink myself to death outta pure mindlessness
and sadness. I gotta wife to make proud!

An excerpt from that letter:

"...I'm officially a combat veteran now as of 2 days
ago...patrolling a village near Fallujah, and recieved
contact from small arms fire, and mortars. The day
before that, one of our weapons attachments got shot
in the head by a sniper, but he can thank kevlar he's
still alive. We seem to have found a bit of an
insurgent stronghold, and hopefully will make more
progress there in the near future...We operate in
rotations here. We'll spend a week on the countryside
staying in Haji houses, and then go back to base for a
couple days R & R. The time we're out is pretty
exhausting, but doesn't hit you until you get back to
base. Our first week out I managed about 20 hours of
sleep. Our second week only about 18...all time seems
to run together, and you forget everything, but what
you're doing right in the moment..."

After some hiccups on the distributor's part, 'Don't Ever Get Famous:
Essays on New York Writing After the New York School' (Dalkey Archives,
2006) is finally available at your usual online emporiums, and, as far as
I can tell from my perch in England, at your favorite independent
booksellers as well.

Please note that you can preview at least some of the contents thanks to
John Tranter at Jacket, who reprinted Andrea Brady's article on Wieners,
Olson and O'Hara. You can read Andrea's piece at
http://jacketmagazine.com/32/brady-wieners.shtml. Do feel free to email me
at dkane@panix.com should you have any problems getting a hold of a copy.

all best,

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by?
Katie Degentesh & Drew Gardner

Friday, March 16, 2007 at 7:30 p.m.

Katie Degentesh joins us in celebration of her first book, The Anger Scale
(Combo Books, 2006), of which Anselm Berrigan says “"Don't be fooled by the
bawdy surfaces... [these] joyous, meta-ballistic poems will guide any reader
daring enough to read them in a realm where everything is turning out just
like the prophets of the Bible said it would. You will be shamed by your
elders and peers for not possessing this book.” Degentesh has an MA in
Creative Writing from UC Davis, and now lives in New York.

Drew Gardner is the author of Sugar Pill (Krupskaya, 2002) and Petroleum Hat
(Roof, 2005), which received a Small Press Traffic Book of the Year Award
and of which Publishers Weekly says “Gardner conjures the kind of
complicated, childish political ignorance and faulty, malevolent citizenship
that George Carlin can only joke about.” Gardner joins us from NYC, where he
edits Snare magazine and teaches workshops at St. Mark's Poetry Project. He
conducts the Poetics Orchestra, an ensemble featuring poetry and structured
improvisation.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to current SPT
members and CCA faculty, staff, and students. ?

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in?Timken Lecture
Hall,?California College of the Arts ?1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco

A/Rose for Baudrillard

I have troubled sleep; nightmares become me. Recently I traded in for a
copy of Sartre, Troubled Sleep, signed by him, scrawled signature to a
friend. Barthes was hit by a van I think, all these men and some women but
less women - Derrida, Foucault, Deleuze, Guattari, Lyotard, Baudrillard,
Althusser, Lacan, bounded by what seems the cold war iron of Badiou.
Kristeva, Cixous, Irigaray, Wittig, perhaps are still alive. I raised
myself on all of them and now they're divided among the militants, the
academics, the pieces of 'deconstruction' applicable to any analysis where
something or other falls apart, 'simulacrum' following DeBord's 'specta-
cle' where 'revolution' became synonymous with natural skin care and
something everyone did against the name of 'freedom.' I don't mean to say
anything here, I wonder about the doubting that once swayed the world,
Jabes, Blanchot, or what I read as doubting, never say anything unless
said to oneself, withdrawn, proffered as kind of a peripheral speech. This
wasn't them, my reading, what I garnered, that excitement, Merleau-Ponty,
at the birth of the world, its bearing, re-borning. Vietnam is now mute,
May 68 almost forty years ago and most of us humans have never thought of
burning monks. Tibet is a foregone conclusion; can one imagine the Dalai
Lama back at the Potala? Bohm kept on moving; he was close to insane with
the stress of homelessness. I wait for my first stroke, but none of the
others, none of them, none of you, will speak to me. I'll go to heaven or
hell with stitches in my mouth. I'll try to say something about the world.
My eyes grow wider and wider.

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 7 pieces by Christopher Major.

The language I enjoy the most is the language that reveals and revels
in slippage, trapdoors, inbe tweens, ambiguities, multiple
simultaneous indeterminate functions.

Many would say that ASCII art holds no more promise than shaped poems
for producing anything remarkable, because ASCII art uses letterforms
exclusively for their visual properties, with no regard for their
semantic value.

These poems of Christopher Major's go beyond ASCII art, beyond the
mere shaped poem, and occupy a place that is indeterminate with
respect to what, exactly, language is doing, has done, and can do.

Enjoy,
Dan

Thomas Devaney presents
No Silence Here, Enjoy the Silence
for LOCALLY LOCALIZED GRAVITY at the Institute of Contemporary Art
6:30-7:30 pm March 14th

John Cage wasn't the last word on silence. There may be as many
silences as there are sounds, yet how many of these silences have we
been available to experience? "No Silence Here, Enjoy the Silence" is
not a sobering moment of silence, or an exercise in silencing, or even
a temporary vow of silence, but it is a listening workshop via silence
and the senses. From the silence of a gift, to the gift to silence
poet Thomas Devaney will host a night honoring the many silences that
are often simply missed, offering a series of experiences to allow
silence to emerge.

"No Silence Here, Enjoy the Silence," will feature Devynn Emory, in
the first dance performance of John Cage's silence masterpiece 4'33,
among other experiences that are best expressed by silence. Other
participants include Brian Eckenrode, juggling, and Tyler Gibbons of
Red Heart the Ticker on double bass.

Subject:      FIRST SCREENING by bpNichol -- Computer poems from 1984

FIRST SCREENING (1984)
Computer Poems
by bpNichol
http://vispo.com/bp

In 1983 and 1984, bpNichol used an Apple IIe computer and the Apple BASIC
programming language to create First Screening, a suite of a dozen
programmed, kinetic poems. He distributed First Screening through
Underwhich, an imprint he started in 1979 with a small group of poets. The
Underwhich edition of First Screening consisted of 100 numbered and signed
copies distributed on 5.25" floppies along with printed matter.

However, the Apple IIe soon became obsolete and the poems became essentially
inaccessible. But in 1992, four years after the death of bpNichol, J. B.
Hohm, a student at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, began
creating a HyperCard version of First Screening with the approval of Ellie
Nichol, bp’s widow, and with assistance from Dennis Johnson and Fred Wah. In
1993, Red Deer College Press published this version on a 3.5" floppy disk
for the Macintosh computer.

This HyperCard version of First Screening was a careful re-creation and
recoding of the original, and it extended the life of the poems of First
Screening a few more years. Still, HyperCard eventually died, leaving the
poems unavailable to all but the few who owned a functioning old Mac or an
even older Apple IIe and a readable diskette (unlikely, since the usual
lifetime of a diskette is approximately five years). In 2004, Apple stopped
selling HyperCard, and OSX’s Classic mode was the last Mac operating system
on which it was possible to view HyperCard works.

So we are very happy to present to you four different versions of First
Screening.

1. The original DSK file of the Underwhich edition with a
   freely downloadable Apple IIe emulator (available for
   PCs and (maybe) Macs), along with scanned images of the
   printed matter distributed with the Underwhich edition.
   This version is closest to the original.
2. An online JavaScript version of First Screening created
   by Marko Niemi and Jim Andrews.
3. A streaming Quicktime movie of the emulated version.
4. The original HyperCard version, which may, perhaps,
   become easier to view in the future via a HyperCard
   Player emulator or some other means. We’ve also posted
   scans of the printed matter of this version.

This project has taken us almost three years. We’ve learned much about
bpNichol’s First Screening and how the destiny of digital writing usually
remains the responsibility of the digital writers themselves. As a group and
individually. This project illustrates that work can indeed survive the
obsolescence of technologies if others are still interested in the work and
the artist has provided what is required to implement the work using later
technologies. bpNichol originally created 100 copies of First Screening and
distributed them widely, which was important to the propagation of the
bitstream. Fortunately, the source code was relatively easy to extract and
fairly simple to understand. First Screening is some of the earliest
programmed, kinetic poetry. This historical significance, together with the
quality of the work itself and bpNichol’s literary stature (he was awarded
Canada’s highest literary honour in 1970), have also motivated us to
complete this project.

The recovery started in 2004 when Lionel Kearns showed Jim Andrews the
HyperCard version on an old Mac. Lionel also had three 5.25" floppy disks
bpNichol had given him. Jim took those floppies to Information Services at
the University of Victoria, Canada, where Jeff Rivett, a data analyst,
recovered the data using his own functioning Apple IIe at home.

That version of First Screening turned out to be incomplete; Barrie Nichol
must have given Lionel these disks while still writing the piece. Geof
recognized that the disk was missing some of the poems in the published
version and that Lionel’s disk presented the remaining poems in a different
order. In an attempt to preserve these poems, Geof had stored his 5.25"
floppy of the Underwhich edition carefully, made a silent videotape of the
poems as they played on the Apple IIe, and printed out the source code. He
could no longer view his floppy, since he no longer had an Apple II series
computer, but the printout and the video indicated that three poems were
missing from Lionel’s draft copy: “Reverie,” “Any of Your Lip,” and
“Off-Screen Romance,” along with some initial and final bibliographic
matter.

Following unsuccessful efforts by the University of Albany to recover the
data from Geof’s 5.25" floppy of the Underwhich edition, Geof shipped the
floppy from New York to Dan Waber and Jason Pimble in Pennsylvania. Dan and
Jason were able to recover the full version from Geof’s 22-year-old floppy
using a functioning Apple IIe computer and a range of open source software.

O ye digital poets: the past of the art is in your hands and it is you who
must recover and maintain it. Although the history of digital archiving is
more than two decades old, most professional archivists have little interest
or training in the process of preserving and ensuring functional access to
digital materials. For instance, although bpNichol’s work is archived at
Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, no one there had or could copy the
data from the Underwhich edition floppy to contemporary media. They were not
uninterested, however, and many thanks to Tony Power for trying.

The secret to this project has been a combination of passion and knowledge.
None of us understood the entirety of the situation facing us at the outset.
Each of us brought a different set of skills to the task, and all of us
brought our love of Nichol’s work and our desire to make sure that others
could once again see these early digital poems. We hope our efforts prove
worth it for those who visit http://vispo.com/bp now and into the future.

Wonderful Alan,

Arrows, Errors, Arroz, Ars..
the mediation between the apophatic and cataphatic empuseams
is the meat mata materia, philosophy as rack, the suffering ground
in its useless solipsism or its grotesque abundance of meaning,
that flopping itself is both the sine of the times and the gasping
of the fish of the word as a horrible messianism of the pathetic.

i had the thought that baudrillard just ends up looking like another
sun baked truck-driver with a spreading nose..

keep on truckin'/
riots in columbia

the greatful dead?
oh no! how, how?

please to note the over under - sine wave assoc. as well.. weaving, etc. mappings as in encoded strings..
not to mention the "crestroughing" @ freq. etc.. alan usually stays away from the popular register..
though in this sense, a fairly venerable one..

darkness.. hmm.. actually where the eye boundaries difference.. it has been said / of early eyes..

pilot seams asaunter / only takes 3 corners to make a square, or its abstraction an extraction of noise
or is it the noise itself, a self-fecundating, organic "standing wave"..

you are definitely not qualified to answerve..

********

GLOSSOLALIA is a sound art project.

BLACK SAIL is an in-progress album of electro-poetics.

Electro-poetics involves using oral recitation as a sound source for
aural art, along with digitally manipulated acoustic instrumentation
and appropriated material.

GLOSSOLALIA is a sonic companion to the text-based F7 project. Both
projects employ appropriated material and technological mediation,
inscribing the same kind of tension between chance and deliberate
operations into different media. Some selections from F7 available
online are here.

GLOSSOLALIA tracks do not cost anything. The page will be updated with
new mixes periodically.

GLOSSOLALIA is also seeking audio submissions of poets reading their
work to continue the project. Contact brian.g.howe@gmail.com for more
information.

The re-use of any and all GLOSSOLALIA material is avidly encouraged.

We were most interested in making it available in formats where you don't
have to buy any software to run First Screening.

I think someone tried to import the HyperCard version of First Screening
into the free trial of Supercard but it didn't work, if memory serves me
without bugs and incompatibilities.

Some folks need to learn how to work their toasters!
In the meantime, I'm forwarding this:

_____________________________________________


Dear friends,

Please join us for Parallel Bars' first reading event:

WHAT: poetry by Dorothea Lasky and Paul Killebrew, paintings by Tim
Bowen

WHY: see below or < http://www.fallingcow.org/about/parallelbars.htm>

WHEN: Saturday 3/17 at 7pm

WHERE: Falling Cow Gallery, 732 S. 4th St., Philadelphia

WHO: everybody

HOW: with refreshments

HELP US SPREAD THE WORD: Please forward this announcement to all of your
friends, enemies, students, teachers, colleagues, bosses, neighbors,
relatives and so on. We hope to reach a large and diverse audience.



*****************************************

PARALLEL BARS hosts its first reading event on March 17th at 7pm at the
Falling Cow Gallery. Organized by poets Dorothea Lasky and Laura Solomon
in conjunction with artist and gallery owner Tim Bowen, Parallel Bars
will pair poetry with visual art whose messages converse with one
another by means of form, process and subject matter. By offering this
microcosm of existing relationships, the series hopes to provide
audience participants with an opportunity to discover larger connections
between sight and sound, time and space, and individual and collective
experiences.

The first event will feature Tim Bowen's series of 100 paintings
entitled PeopleTIME 2005 which depicts various significant national and
international events that occurred throughout the year 2005. The title
is based on the idea of using two images per week, one from People
magazine and one from Time magazine, focusing on relevant news items
which juxtapose the superficialities of popular culture with the
serious, often grim, geopolitical and social realities of the day.

Within the visual, public world of PeopleTIME 2005, poets PAUL KILLEBREW
and DOROTHEA LASKY will read from their new books. A single poem,
Killebrew's INSPECTOR VS. EVADER (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2007) is a
litany of private observations in constant competition with one another.
Like Bowen's project, the poem laces together moments both monumental
and trivial while persistently seeking the meanings between them all. By
doing so, Killebrew illuminates the holiness to be found within each
moment of experience, no matter its outward appearance.

From this same vision emerge the poems of Dorothea Lasky's AWE,
forthcoming this year from Wave Books. Within this collection, Lasky
captures the magnitude and privilege of having a brain and body
isolated, even if sometimes painfully so, from all other brains and
bodies. Insisting upon a solitude that transcends itself, the poems
reveal a separateness to things that enables connection, a process that
in turn makes possible our awe to be a part of anything at all, even
more so, our awe to be a part of everything.

In keeping with the nature of the specific work of all three
contributors, and in line with the application-to-life-mindedness of the
series itself, Parallel Bars will dedicate its first event to local poet
Frank Sherlock. Sherlock was hospitalized on January 22nd with a sudden
and mysterious illness that turned out to be a serious case of
meningitis . He needed emergency surgery and also suffered a heart
attack and kidney failure as a result of symptoms related to the
illness. Like many other Americans, Sherlock is uninsured. Donations
will be accepted on his behalf, and the event will serve as a precursor
to a benefit show to be held the next day by the friends of Frank
Sherlock.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++

Paul Killebrew was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. He is author
of the newly released Inspector vs. Evader (Ugly Duckling Presse), and
his chapbook Forget Rita was chosen by John Ashbery for the Poetry
Society of America in 2003. He lives in Brooklyn and is in his last year
of law school at NYU.

Dorothea Lasky was born in St. Louis. Her first full-length collection,
Awe , is forthcoming this fall from Wave Books. She is the author of
three chapbooks: The Hatmaker's Wife (Braincase Press, 2006), Art
(H_NGM_N Press, 2005), and Alphabets and Portraits (Anchorite Press,
2004). Currently she lives in Philadelphia, where she studies education
and co-edits the Katalanche Press chapbook series. She is a graduate of
the M.F.A. program for Poets and Writers at the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst and also has been educated at Harvard University,
University of Pennsylvania, and Washington University.

Pig of Puglia *(edible portions published in various journals =96 one such =

unacceptable, beloved family whose Auntie was born with bristles and

restaurants. She has studied with the Maurice Sendak Kalighat School of the

partially mastering a parasite ingested last summer in Chandigarh India.

Hey folks,

My first book, Key Bridge, was just published by Carolina Wren Press:

http:\\www.carolinawren.org/books.html

and here's some info about it

http://www.carolinawrenpress.org/pdf/KeyBridge_PRESS_RELEASE.pdf

Key Bridge is about pregnancy of a sort and the related topics of
birth and death, coming into being and fading out of it again.  It's a
long poem set against the backdrop of Washington, DC, where I grew up.
 The subject matter on a line to line basis covers a lot of DC
history, geography, flora and fauna, Lee Boyd Malvo & John Allen
Mohammad (the "DC Snipers"), racial identity, "whiteness," and a few
other things.  It's also, really and against my better wishes, a love
poem.

I'm also looking for readings; I'm assuming I'll have to cover travel
expenses for readings, so I work for cheap (dinner? a place to sleep?)
 If anyone has recommendations or offers, please let me know.

Thanks and enjoy....

best,
Ken

Maybe I missed something. But I see no location for this event listed.  I've never heard of the Barking Spider so I doubt it is in New York City.  Still, if people are looking for an audience for the wonderful Kenneth Patchen, they should tell us where the event is located.  Regards, Tom Savage

Hi Jennifer

I think John Tritica, Mary Rising Higgins, Larry Goeckel, and Stefi Weis=
burd (for example) would have something to contribute.  They don't subsc=
ribe to the Buffalo Listserv.  Do you have addresses for them?  There wi=
ll be a memorial reading soon.  Would you like me to announce your issue=
?  If you had a flier, I would print it & hand it out.

Also, I have two recordings by Gene on CD.  Would you like copies?  =

A follow up to an item a while ago on Ron Silliman's blog--yes, I agreed, Bill Corbett already IS the poet laureate of Boston, so why don't they make it official? And I wrote to members of the Boston City Council.

And here is a response.

I wish I could be there for the hearing--I grew up in Boston but now live far away.
If any Boston poets care to attend, I would be interested in hearing how it goes.

Thanks to my friend Ken Rumble for forwarding this to the list (and my
public congrats on the publication of his *Key Bridge*) -- I'd planned on
doing so myself, but he's saved me the trouble.

I've been lurking on POETICS for awhile, but I seldom post to email lists,
so I should briefly introduce myself-- Brian Howe, writer living in Chapel
Hill NC, music journalist by trade, poems in this, that, and the other
journal, now working most fervently in the vein of sound art and
electro-poetics, hence the
Glossolalia<http://glossolalia-blacksail.blogspot.com/>project.

Here, I simply want to emphasive the open nature of the project-- all
Glossolalia <http://glossolalia-blacksail.blogspot.com/> mixes are fair game
for any sort of re-use, so I hope you'll download them, do strange and
wonderful things to them, put them on your website or send them back to me
for mine. Also want to emphasize my desire for audio submissions (in a
collaborative, not editorial, spirit) from poets to further the project. If
you're interested in participating, please contact me backchannel at
brian.g.howe@gmail.com

Best,
Brian
http://glossolalia-blacksail.blogspot.com/

********

GLOSSOLALIA is a sound art project.

BLACK SAIL is an in-progress album of electro-poetics.

Electro-poetics involves using oral recitation as a sound source for
aural art, along with digitally manipulated acoustic instrumentation
and appropriated material.

GLOSSOLALIA is a sonic companion to the text-based F7 project. Both
projects employ appropriated material and technological mediation,
inscribing the same kind of tension between chance and deliberate
operations into different media. Some selections from F7 available
online are here.

GLOSSOLALIA tracks do not cost anything. The page will be updated with
new mixes periodically.

GLOSSOLALIA is also seeking audio submissions of poets reading their
work to continue the project. Contact brian.g.howe@gmail.com for more
information.

The re-use of any and all GLOSSOLALIA material is avidly encouraged.

Very nice assortment of items. I love the pictures, especially the laundry =
picture. Would that I had a yard. I'm still doing our laundry in the coin-o=
p machines in the dirt-floor cellar of this apartment building.

You are a Californian, Stephen, so this may be exotic: I remember what it w=
as like to have no dryer in the house in the 1960s  with three bedwetters a=
mong the five of us kids--going out to hang the wet sheets on icy cold days=
, and then they'd freeze on the line--taking them down as it started to rai=
n snow or sleet and feeling the sheets crack crack crack in my hands.

I've been lurking too much of late, so I'm out of the loop.  Do you want us
"just" to post something here?

"Where the waters meet at the end of the world"

http://www.asondheim.org/drowned2.mp4
http://www.asondheim.org/offthere.jpg

Where the waters meet at the end of the world
bodies merge in streams; arms and legs unfurled
in death or signifiers streamed and long forgotten.
There is no kelp among the drowned, no seed rotten
and uncalled for. When my friends swim, they die
allegiance emptied of their final cry
when all is drowned and doomed. Waters shear waters,
some sign, untoward, approaches, slaughters
our pretty young women and buoyant young men.
Sightless, nothing goes further then.
Witless, nothing goes further then.

THE HALL OF THIRTY-THREE SPACES

I WENT TO VISIT SEVERAL THOUSAND GOLD BUDDHAS
THEY SAT THERE ALL THROUGH THE WAR,--
THEY DIDN'T APPEAR JUST NOW BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE IN
TOWN--
SAT THERE 600 YEARS.   FAILURES.
DOES BUDDHA FAIL.   DO I.
SOME DAY I GUESS I'LL NEVER LEARN.

**KYOTO, 28:XII:66

(Note, that there is a temple in Kyoto called SANJUSANGENDO, The Hall of
Thirty Three Spaces,
and it contains 10001 gold buddha statues and twenty-eight other statues of
the followers of Kwannon Bosatsu. The statues were made in the 12th Century
A.D.  and are a great magic pleasure. I enjoy it all, I enjoy living in Kyoto,
being a  Buddhist, rather like an American Bible Belt minister would get a boot
out of  being able to live in Jerusalem & the Sea of Galilee and Bethlehem,
if it  were possible for any of us to go there. I'd like that, too. The war
goes on  there as well as in Viet Nam. The war continues on the subway, in the
offices of  BBD & O, in the Chase Manhattan Bank, at the poetry conference at X
University, in the kitchen on Saturday night when papa is loaded out of his
head  on cheap bourbon and wants to torture the children, kick the cat, kill
himself.....)

I am working on the forward for the next issue, Pavement Saw 11, the sell out issue, and was wondering if any of you had statements you have used, or that others have said to you, that are terribly blunt about how bad someones poems are.

  This all stems from a recent conference where I was talking with this lady who tried to confer upon me a copy of a book called _Toxic Feedback_ for gratis, which I only agreed to take if it was inscribed "to the most magnificent editor in the United States." Anyways, I was very disappointed when I started reading it at home as does not offer usable toxic feedback but rather advocates against the notion. A pity.

  Please backchannel nasty feedback of literary value, I can mention your name in the forward if it is a good one, or you can be anonymous it is up to you. What I cannot do is give you a free issue as the issues are accounted for and disappear within a year.


Be well

>BACKGROUND
>On March 16, 2003, an Israeli soldier used a Caterpillar bulldozer to crush
>to death 23-year old American activist Rachel Corrie. Rachel was protesting
>the demolition of a home belonging to Samir Nasrallah, a Palestinian
>physician, in Rafah. Despite her bright orange vest and the fact that she
>stood 20 meters in front of the bulldozer—the Israeli soldier contended
>that he did not see her.
>
>Rachel's parents called on the U.S. State Department to conduct an
>investigation into the details of Rachel's murder. On March 25, 2003, U.S.
>Representative Brian Baird presented Resolution 111 which called on the
>U.S. government to "undertake a full, fair, and expeditious investigation
>into Rachel's death." Despite her parents' call for an investigation and
>Baird's resolution—no U.S. investigation was ever conducted.
>
>Nearly four years later, our government has done nothing to hold Israel
>accountable for its violations of international law nor held CAT
>accountable for its role as aiding and abetting such violations.  Despite

Folks, please treat yourself to Danielle Dutton's debut, _Attempts at a
Life_: hyper-literate (and just plain hyper) short fictions / prose poems
that manage to be both intelligent AND funny. Think Woolf on
methamphetamines, a mutating textual DNA spiraling through time, a tango of
"lives" as disparate as Bronte and Hejinian. Fits and starts and gleefully
aborted existences, Dutton's "attempts" feel positively, wonderfully alive.

Cheers,

Christian

ATTEMPTS AT A LIFE
Danielle Dutton
ISBN: 9780977901937
Fiction. 5"x7", 90 pages, perfectbound
March 15, 2007
Also available in a limited, handbound, hardcover edition.
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Dutton/index.html

Operating somewhere between fiction and poetry, biography and theory, the
pieces in ATTEMPTS AT A LIFE, though nominally stories, might indeed be
thought of as “attempts.” Like the “experiments in found movement” one
character conducts (in “Everybody’s Autobiography”), Dutton’s stories find
movement wherever they turn, in every phrase and cadence, each sentence a
small explosion of images and anthems and odd juxtapositions. This is
writing in which the imagination (both writer’s and reader’s) is capable of
producing almost anything at any moment, from a shiny penny to an alien
metropolis, a burning village to a bright green bird.

Danielle Dutton’s stories remind me of those alluring puzzles where the pool
is overflowing and emptying at the same time. Dutton’s answer? That the self
is a rush of the languages of storytelling and moments of helpless intimacy,
and she recalculates the lives of her numerous heroines to assert the busy
and the broken.

—Robert Glück

Danielle Dutton writes with a deft explosiveness that craters the page with
stunning, unsettling precision. Here “car lights like licorice whips slick
the road outside the window,” there “the puffed-thumb Emma person” sways and
falls, and everywhere “the firelight is orange against the midnight of the
ocean.” Her marvelous, generous ATTEMPTS AT A LIFE proves that, like
Gertrude Stein, she knows how to be “at once talking and listening.”

—Laird Hunt


ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Danielle Dutton was born in Visalia, California in 1975. She is the author
of a novel, _S P R A W L_ (forthcoming from Clear Cut Press), and her work
has appeared in many journals including NOON, 3rd bed, Denver Quarterly, and
Fence. She lives with her husband in Colorado, where she is completing a
Ph.D. in English and Creative Writing at the University of Denver.

DAN GODSTON teaches literature and composition at
Columbia College and poetry and other art forms
through several arts education organizations. His
poetry and fiction have appeared in Chase Park,
Versal, 580 Split, Kyoto Journal, California
Quarterly, after hours, Drunken Boat, and other
publications. He also performs and composes music.

JENNIFER KARMIN is a poet, artist, and educator who
has experimented with language throughout the U.S. and
Japan.  Her multidisciplinary projects intersect
writing with sound and image.  Currently at home in
Chicago, she is a founding member of the public art
group Anti Gravity Surprise and co-curator of the Red
Rover reading series.  In the fall of 2006, Jennifer
collected writing about walking in cities and created
WALKING POEM.  On October 25th 2006, she started
walking from Chicago's Picasso statue and navigated
the city using the collected writing as her map. Once
read outloud, each piece was given away to passing
pedestrians.  Jennifer works as a Poet-in-Residence
for the Chicago Public Schools and teaches creative
writing to immigrants at Truman College. Recent
publications include: The City Visible: Chicago Poetry
for the New Century, Growing Up Girl: An Anthology of
Voices from Marginalized Places, Bird Dog, and Milk
Magazine.

"Wordslingers is always looking for new voices. If you
know someone whose work you like and respect, hip them
up to the show and let them know it's damn near as
easy as falling off a log to be on the air in 2008 and
easier still to submit poetry."

Hi All,

Reciprocal Distillations by Clayton Eshleman is now available for
pre-order. The official release date is April 1.

The poems in this collection address, in one way or another, artists
and/or works of art, including the painters Joan Mitchell, Leon Golub,
Francis Bacon, Caravaggio, Jean-Baptiste Corot, Unica Zorn, Henri
Michaux, Arshile Gorky and Henry Darger. Certain poems in this book
should also appeal to readers interested in Ice Age cave art, and
African art.

Adrienne Rich has written that Eshleman is "a poet and translator who
has gone more deeply into his art, its processes and demands, than any
modern American poet since Robert Duncan and Muriel Rukeyser."

Is there something I'm missing or have you mispelled
Unica Zürn's name.. I'm not really that picky and I suppose
the dead aren't either, but Unica had a pretty rowdy ride
and deserves her u and umlaut.. (perhaps) shrugs..

Hello, I am looking for a guest designer for an upcoming issue at
listenlight.net.  I will favor content that requires some server-side
programming for subtle to extensive variation on the page for each
view.  I can write the code for your programming ideas.  I don't favor
client-side programming, but a little bit (e.g., simple mouseover image
swapping) would be okay.

It's not a paying job, so a good opportunity for students developing a
portfolio, perhaps, or for anybody who would like to see their creative
vision incorporated into the mix.  I can offer a substantial web hosting
package for your efforts, if you want, & even, at my expense, register a
domain name.

Send me a message if you're interested.

Best wishes,

Jesse Crockett

My apologies Larry,

You are correct, but will be glad to know that this error isn't in the
book. We pasted this letter from a text document and I guess the 'u'
with the umlaut was converted into an 'o' in the process. I agree that
the umlaut is vital. In fact, I'd like an umlaut in my name...how
would that work?...okay, being silly, thanks for being a close reader
anyhow.

Curious. The reviewer is almost entirely concerned with what he thinks the poet does and doesn't want to say; at the end, for instance, he writes of what the poems "do not tell us," what "they do not say," and what "they never advise us" because instead "they say that..." But there is nothing about the form of the poems, their linguistic structure. Maybe he thinks that Times readers wouldn't believe that such a poet is saying anything at all and therefore he is overcompensating?

OPEN TEXT READING SERIES #4: ANNE STONE
Sponsored by the Canada Council for the Arts
& the Creative Writing Concentration at Capilano College
http://capilanocreativewriting.blogspot.com

The Spring 2007 OPEN TEXT series at Capilano College continues on March
22nd, 2007 with a reading by Vancouver author Anne Stone.

Cedar 148 @ 12:30
Capilano College
2055 Purcell Way
North Vancouver

Anne Stone is an editor of Matrix Magazine. Together with Amber Dean, she is
currently guest editing a special issue of West Coast Line on
representations of murdered and missing women. Her novels include, jacks
(DC
Books 1998), Hush (Insomniac Press 1999) and Delible (forthcoming,
Insomniac, 2007), which tells the story of Melora Sprague, a 15-year-old
girl whose sister has gone missing. Stone teaches creative
writing/literature at Capilano College in North Vancouver and at Concordia
University in Montreal.

"Everything has a beginning. My sister's disappearance has to have one.
There has to be a time, a moment, in which she began to disappear.
I've looked for some sign that Mel was poised to leave. Maybe it was
there in the world she saw around us, the one that was slowly dying as we
pretended not to see. Or in her dreams of the a-bomb, quietly imploding in
our mouths as we slept, shattering millions on millions of teeth. A city's
worth of polished bone, demolished in an instant. And what could any of us
do but stir in our sleep, lick at broken mouths, and feel ourselves already
dead, this as the fire consumed the part of us that could dream of bombs to
begin with."

unlike simulacrum this piece has a 3-dimensional quality that comes not from

maybe he was afraid to situate her in Language poetry or anything related
for fear of losing readers...? ironic, ain't it? that wd be how to GET
readers, I mean, by actually reviewing innovative writers.

The second issue of EOAGH, edited by Tim Peterson, was devoted
to Jackson Mac Low.

My section is on this page: http://www.chax.org/eoagh/issuetwo/piombino.htm

Also, my new book out from Factory School's Heretical Texts, based
on the first three months of my weblog *fait accompli* has this
passage as its second entry:

:: February 13 ::=20

=20

Ran into Jackson Mac Low at the Met the other day. After a particular work
was pointed out to him, he said: =B3In art there is altogether too much likin=
g
and disliking.=B2 Strange thing is, I've been thinking the same thing myself
lately.

Jackson has also said that there is no particular style of poetry he favors=
,
and that he likes a good poem in any style, so I don't think he meant, in
saying =B3there is altogether too much liking and disliking=B2 that one should
suppress enthusiasm or not be critical. I had the feeling he was talking
about going to museums and art galleries or even movies and overhearing
conversations where reactions often seem to neglect time for fully absorbin=
g
and encompassing an experience. This leads into my recent preoccupation wit=
h
the positive side of ambivalence. The ability to tolerate ambivalence, or
ambiguity, can create an opportunity to wonder, to wander, daydream, to
think, to puzzle or figure things out. Full circle: isn't this often what i=
s
wanted from artistic experience in the first place?

Barry, Ruth,

I never thought I would ever defend the New York Time Sunday Book Review,
but I think your comments are unfair. For instance:

"Compact and as densely patterned as silicon chips" or  "Where other poets
seek symbols for the soul, Armantrout looks at minds and sees machines:
'Crossed wires released such / hope-like sparks.'"

These seem to me to be authentic observations about the form and language of
the poems. It is true that the review does not approach her poetry in
Language School poetics terminology. But this is the purpose of a large
publication like New York Times, to present a work in terms familiar to its
readers. What else can it be? In those terms,the observations of the
reviewer are quite acute and I do not think they tell any lies about the
poetry.

Here we come to a question we have discussed in this and other lists over
and over again, that there is always a profound break between the writing
process and the reception of a poem. What a poet (or in this case a poetry
school) envisions is different from the way the public sees or receives it,
this difference not necessarily negating (but definitely complicating) the
validity of either side's perceptions.

Ciao,

Murat

you know his book Doings w/ accompanying CD of 15 of his readings--from
Granary Books? his last reading, I believe, was one w/ Anne Tardos in
Cambridge, MA--contact John Mercuri Dooley at Demolicious website for more
info abt that. Tim Peterson did a special issue of his online mag EOAGH on
him--you can find it at the Chax Press website.
good luck

I have no idea what the reviewer's motives were, but I don't think it
would have done Rae a service to trot out the group name in a review
too short to allow for much history or nuance. It would have
attracted those who already know her work and no one else.  I'm also
not convinced that Language has much descriptive or explanatory power
when attached to Rae's work. If one has to look for fellow travelers
Dickinson is a good choice, and it's the one that the reviewer chose
(was it in the publicity release?).

To identify a poem or poet as Language implies that reading and
enjoyment require a special set of skills (or tolerances) different
from the reading of other poets. This simply isn't true of Rae's work.

If the idea of publishing reviews of "innovative" poetry in daily
newspapers is simply to present the same kind of review that a reader of
this very specialized e-mail discussion list might want to read or
write, then what's the point?

Stephen Burt's review of Rae Armantrout's new book is generally
supportive of the work and might actually attract new readers to her
poetry. I assume that Rae'll get reviews in poetry magazines and
critical journals that will place her work in context. But it seems
weird to criticize the review because it doesn't include an extensive
history of Language poetry and Armantrout's place in that genre, or a
detailed analysis of formal elements of her work. There are plenty of
venues for that kind of critique (it seems as if at least half of the
people reading this list publish one). However, a daily newspaper, even
one as "august" as the New York Times, is not such a venue.

Reviews in general interest publications such as daily newspapers,
popular magazines, or NPR programs basically function as a marketing
tool. The primary focus is to let a general audience know whether they
might want to spend time and/or money reading the book, seeing the show,
etc.

Obviously, it's nice when there's something more than that in this kind
of publication, but the editors and publishers would be perfectly happy
if they could get away with just running a letter grade, a number of
stars, a picture of thumbs up or down.

Nick,

The below point, esp on the "positive side of ambivalence", holds much import for me.  Can you post a bit more from the entry?  Or do you elaborate on this idea elsewhere?  Do you mind if I post it on my blog?

Thanks,

Amy

I thought it was a solid review, BUT I didn't esp. like the
following: "who has been writing such poems for 30 years, at first
for a West Coast cult following, now for what should be a national
audience."

There's the problem, for one, with "cult following" (esp. when you
situate same out on the West Coast, where the term has a peculiar
valence). And then there's this question of what's happened twixt "at
first" and "now for what should be." How to get a handle on
Armantrout's present readership, if it's neither a "cult" nor a
"national audience"?

Anyway.

Best,

Joe

~Crayon~ (Fall 1997), which was a festschrift in honor of Jackson's
75th bday (yes, I have a piece in there myself).

Having written fiction reviews for the NYT, I've also observed that often they
assign a length, say 800 words, that then is edited to suit their Sunday
needs.  So who knows what was said and what remained. But the attention to
audience as an enfeebled or mad group (West Coast cult) is always vexing.

well, I was glad to see the review but what I mean to say is that the TBR
has so much power that if they were to put her work in context, even tho she
doesn't like to be identified as a Lang poet--in other words, talk abt what
has been going on outside the mainstream since the 70's at least, their
readership might be inclined to pick up a related book or two. It cd change
the readership for poetry in this country. To that end I wrote a letter to
the ed. Maybe this is naive or useless, like mixing iguanas w/ puppies--ok,
I know the metaphor is apt in only a limited sense. If the audience thought
iguanas were some of what poetry is these days they might at least we cd
watch them on Animal Planet.  And imagine if The New Yorker had a spread on
Lang poets, books wd sell like sushi. sorry, I'm not thinking too clearly
today.

Then again here in Boston the same 40 or 50 poets show up at the
'innovative' readings while the great majority of more trad poets go to
other readings, and it seems never the twain shall meet. Maybe it's a matter
of sensibility, but if postmodern poetry were touted the way postmmodern
visual art is, what a dif world it wd be, for better or worse--considering
the pretentious descriptions at the new ICA in Boston, but at least people
seem to feel they shd go there to find some critique of our society or just
to see what artists are doing.

yeah, I  mostly liked the review as well, given the constraints under
which its author was no doubt operating....

as for the phrase you cite, Joe [and that you comment on, Maxine] hat
sense of "cult following" is I think most commonly seen in rock
criticism--which fact will either amuse or irritate those who get
it:  what does it mean to treat language poetry writers/readers as
akin to, say, fans of some indie rock band?..anyway, for better or
for worse, Burt is offering the shorthand analogy for career
narratives that NYT readers are most likely to understand; and the
assumption/argument entailed by "what should be", then, is a version
of the one everybody makes about their favorite local band:  they
should make it big!  get signed to a major!

so, yeah, the cultural and political specificity of West coast
language writing gets slighted, but it was ever thus:  this is trad
literary history:  the wave of the avant-garde recedes and one or two
"major poets" are left gasping on the strand, to be discovered by
critics.....

  Compostition Marble
Winner of the 2005-06 Chapbook award

32 pages, saddle stapled, $6.00
  A small part of Joshua Corey's work in this collection appeared Denver Quarterly.

 "This chapbook length set of three poems explores the events of 9/11 in a variety of of methods and voices from Ginsberg's rants to William Carlos Williams variable foot, from Mallarmean and Black Mountain invested space usage to Paul Celan's numbness."

Joshua Corey was born in New York City, grew up in New

  both contest winners: Selah was chosen by Robert

  finishing a dissertation on modernist pastoral. Visit
  his blog at http://joshcorey.blogspot.com

  from Compostition Marble:
        ragged right the boroughs, the former Idlewild, Hal
        Hartley movies shot in Texas only to be set here,
        the Hamptons hampered, West Egg, Montauk,
        salt water’s long longeurs. Eventually the old world,
        th’unconscious that dreamt self-writing. Ruins of freedom
        ruin mass graves and train stations: the Seine, the Danube,
        the Po, NATO expansion toward Sarajevo: fire flakes
        from burning libraries suspend red stars over Srebenica.
        The end of the West forecast in geography, fanaticism,
        hospitality withdrawn. Stars of suffering and we
        the excluded consolation. Wrapping round about
        over the Caucasus, minefields, oilfields abloom,
        boom: nuclear blackmail, the afterlife in a flash
        of human hair, self-surrounded by the map’s
        biggest blank blue. Hard a port, in fog, San Francisco.
        Peace. Peace and no use in a command center.
        No use in a needle over zero. Peace and no use
        finding ground for the inflammable. Peace
        finds no use never minds never saw a tumbling
        body’s fall.

For what it's worth, thought I'd point to an earlier article by Burt on
Armantrout.  It appeared in the Boston Review in 2000:

I Liked very much Murat's point re the complicating of a poet or poetry
group's ideas of how their works should be received, and how they are in
fact received.  It is not just the massive apparati involved via production,
distribtuion, promotion, reviewing, blurbs, mentions, footnotes, soundbytes,
blips on blogs--there is also involved another process of translation, and
of the existences of othernessess within language, and then within language,
modes of that language when attempting to deal with othernesses found in
other forms of the language.   Murat has written very fascinatingly of many
aspects of this in relation with poetry and I think it could be extended to
considering the ways poetry is reviewed, as a continual translation across
"borders" or "frames" of forms, language tropes, considerations of the
readership's language and so forth. I think often, as Murat noted, a
reviewer for a large paper can make some very acute direct
observations--that sometimes escape the reviewer too closely inolved with
the poet, the poet's group and so forth, too intent on  being a proselytizer
or an explainer, in which case the poetry gets lost amidst the floor plans
and the furniture.

There is a an amzing short essay by Robert Musil in his collection
Posthumous papers of a Living Authro, called "Surrounded by Poets and
Thinkers".  (The "posthumous" work appeared in 1929, 13 years before the
"living author's" death.)  Musil begins by nothing how everyone claims they
are not reading, no one reads anymore, and that, beyond that, everything is
in decline--medecine, mathematics, philopshy--as well as poetry.   The catch
is that each group sees this deline only in the others, not in itself.  So
whie the rest of the world goes to hell n a hand basket, one' own chosen
feild is burning with a creative fire unequalled in the annals of genius.

"     Just take a moment to leaf through the news and reviews in our
magazines and newspapers, and you will be truly amazed at how many deeply
moving, prophetic, greatest, deepest, and very great masters appear over the
course of a few months;  and how often inthe span of such a brief period,
'finally another true poet' has been granted  to the nation; and how the
most beautiufl animal story and the best novel of the last ten years is
written.  A few eeks later hardly anyone can still remember the
unforgettable impression they made."

    Musil continues:  "Here we may add the second observation, that all such
judegements derive fro diverse circels hermetically closed off to each
other.  They are formed  by related publishers, auhtors, critics,
newspapers, readers, and miscellaneous successess, each of whom does not
have conatct with anyone outside his praticular circle;  and all of these
large and samll circles, whose cohesiveness may well be compared to that of
a romantic entanglement or a political party, have their own geniuses or at
least their "No-one-else more worthy the title.'"



Whenever a review of a poet who is considered a kind of "one of us" of this
list appears in a venue and by a person that is "not one of us"--the
sometimes scandalized response always makes me think of Claude Rains'
character in the film Casablanca when he has to shut down Rick's Cafe
temporarily. "I'm shocked!  Shocked! There is gambling going on!"

I also, with several others,  thought that given the space and readership
--and a myriad other considerations, such as the advertisers, political
lobbies etc. which are involved in the printing of any newspaper--i've
written for several--that the reviewer did very well by Rae Armantrout and
her poetry and I have a strong feeling greatly increased potential and
actual sales.

The reference to "West Coast cult following" does not necessarily refer to
Language poetry--this is an asumption made only by those who know of such a
thing as a West Coast Language Poetry.  It could just mean "she is very
popular in the area where she lives on the West Coast."  Besides, having a
cult following can be seen by many people as a pretty cool thing!  Who among
poets doesn't want to think fondly of their own personal "cult following"?
Isn't it much better than if say  the reviewer wrote that Armantrout is
primarily a poet of West Coast suburbia writing of facing the questions
which come with aging?  That would make her sound like a "confessional" poet
wouldn't it?

It's fun to imagine a dictatorship of the poet and poets' groups, who would
lay down the law for the exact forms of the reception of their works.
(These actually already do exist, just never at quite the incredibly
omnipotent level that poets and poets' groups wd like them to.  There can
never be, after all, suffiencent unto the day enough worship to sate the Sun
God, the Sun King or The Dear Leader, Big Brother, the Empress, the Gang of
Four and the rest--)
      I just read three reviews from three different journals in NYC in
1858-9 of Whitman's first edition of Leaves of Grass.  Excellent and most
perceptive reviews!!!!  By God--the ideal reader as reviewer!  (The famous
letter from Emerson being used to promote the second edition.)
     Of course, the reviewer in all three cases just so happened to be
Walter Whitman under other names.

      Ruth's question re the difference between poetry and the visual arts
in terms of people's willingness to see the "postmodern" or "innovative"
might be that in hearing, people want "comforting words," or sounds, as
humans do.  Some people like to be comforted by the familair sounds of one
form of poetry, some by another.  With images, people are so bombarded
continually by the "new," the "shocking,"  and the "tradition of the new,"
the "museum without walls" of cyberspace, advertising, videos, t-shirts,
logos, fashion, etc etc--that too often the supposedly "radical" show is
another way of saying "the familiar," or "the latest variation on the
familiar," or "the uncanny mix of the new and the familiar".
      In other words, in all cases the audiences go for what they expect to
have given to them.  The familiar, the comforting, whether traditional or
innovative, it's all comfort food.  And sells like hot cakes to its chosen
demographics, proporitonately speaking, given the varying sizes of the
audiences involved.
       If one really wanted to be jolted by something "new" and "shocking"
it would be to take a look at the world in front of one.
       But that's why people turn to comfort food isn't ?  And maybe why the
lack of the arts' involvements in many ways with the political/activism so
often remarked on.
        Musil ends his little (three and a quarter pp) essay on a very
prescient note, seeing from the sitution he dscribes the future just three
years away--and in many ways our own present--

   "It is unfortunately to be assumed with infinitely greater certainty that
this (plenitude of circles, groups) will rather turn out to have been a
sign, not recognized early enough, of the spread of a dangerous group-mania.
  Infected by this mania, thousands of little groups  each peddle their own
set notion of life, so that it ought not to surprise us if soon a genuine
paranoiac  will hardly still be able to resist competing with the amateurs."

Thanks to the list members for drawing attention to the review of Rae
Armantrout in the TNYTimesBR and to the Boston article by the same  reviewer.  I
might have missed it, not because we don't receive the  Review here: we do, but I
sometimes forget to "check" it, which is how I usually  approach it.  I have
become someone who barely reads fiction and who wants  to know a quick
run-down of titles and names; non-fiction is too warring or  something, and I'm
trying to preserve myself a little in avoiding that at  book-length.  That leaves
poetry; I love to find reviews of poetry in the  Review.  I would have been
stunned that it was there at all.  And  wondered what "cult following" actually
meant re: Armantrout's readership.   I got a chance to hear her read, along
with other Wesleyan U P poets at the AWP:  Armantrout, Komunyakaa, Gizzi, Notley,
and Karen Brennan.  This has emerged  as what will be a good and positive
memory from the convention: These are all  good poets.  It might have been the
best reading overall I heard.  I  am someone who has read language poetry.
There was no introduction to them  from the podium as language poets.  It is
exactly the kind of moment I was  trying very hard to understand:  There is an "us"
and "them" mentality in  cw, not perpetuated by those poets that I can
perceive.

The reviewer complains that Armantrout's poems fail to cheer everyone up  for
living.  Discouragement in poems provides solace, if you've been
discouraged.  Which poets cheer everyone?  The reviewer doesn't  say.  At the reading, I
thought the women were like "mother" poets.   The skill alone cheered me.  My
mother, who reads a lot but not poetry,  would have had no trouble in
following the poetry of that reading.  I've  been reading a lot of poetry: various
poets at poets.org, Dickinson, H.D.   It's depressing and beautiful, not all
cheering, and hard to share with others  except who are other poets or "poetry
lovers" and that it's "language poetry" is  not the reason for it.  That it's
poetry is the reason for it.  People  need to try a little harder to read poetry
w/  non-poets.

Folks in the area,

Please join us at the NYC release party for Denver author Danielle Dutton's
genre-blurring debut, _Attempts at a Life_, just out from Tarpaulin Sky
Press.

March 24, 2007, 2 p.m.
The Four-Faced Liar
165 West 4th Street (between 6th & 7th Ave), NYC

The reading will be hosted Christian Peet, Elena Georgiou, and other TSky
Press editors, and will be followed by a book-signing.

Operating somewhere between fiction and poetry, biography and theory, the
stories in _Attempts at a Life_ do what lively stories do best, creating
worlds of possibility, worlds filled with surprises. Like the "experiments
in found movement" one character conducts (in "Everybody's Autobiography"),
Dutton's works finds movement wherever they turn, each sentence a small
explosion of images and anthems and odd juxtapositions. This is writing in
which the imagination (both writer's and reader's) is capable of producing
almost anything at any moment, from a shiny penny to an alien metropolis, a
burning village to a bright green bird. "Alluring puzzles. A rush of the
languages of storytelling and moments of helpless intimacy"--Robert Gluck.
"Stunning, unsettling precision. Like Gertrude Stein, [Dutton] knows how to
be 'at once talking and listening.'"--Laird Hunt.

Danielle Dutton was born in Visalia, California in 1975. She is the author
of a novel, S P R A W L (forthcoming from Clear Cut Press), and her work has
appeared in many journals including NOON, 3rd bed, Denver Quarterly, Fence,
and Tarpaulin Sky. She lives with her husband in Colorado, where she is
completing a Ph.D. in English and Creative Writing at the University of
Denver.

ATTEMPTS AT A LIFE

ISBN: 9780977901937
Fiction. 5"x7", 90 pages, perfectbound
March 15, 2007
Also available in a limited, handbound, hardcover edition.

I never suggested that "Language school poetics terminology" be employed--though that might have been instructive for me as I don't know what it consists of. I don't much like criticism of contemporary writing that mimics "theory," though, if that's what you mean.

  But of the two comments you quote, only one, the first, seems to be about her language, and that her language is compact and patterned may be true but it doesn't distinguish it much from that of many other poets. "Like a silicon chip" is a nice simile though. And the second comment is still about her subject matter, isn't it.

  Of course, with a good poet the thought and the form are hard to extricate...but I'd have liked to have learned more from the review about the second. I am not writing here from the position of a know-it-all, but rather as someone who has been interested in Armantrout's work without ever having reached the "eureka!" moment of feeling that I get it. So when I read a review I'm hoping to be nudged a bit toward getting it. And my bias is such that it will more likely be a formal description that gets me there than a discussion of the subject matter of the work.

Murat Nemet-Nejat <muratnn@GMAIL.COM> wrote:
  Barry, Ruth,

I never thought I would ever defend the New York Time Sunday Book Review,
but I think your comments are unfair. For instance:

"Compact and as densely patterned as silicon chips" or "Where other poets
seek symbols for the soul, Armantrout looks at minds and sees machines:
'Crossed wires released such / hope-like sparks.'"

These seem to me to be authentic observations about the form and language of
the poems. It is true that the review does not approach her poetry in
Language School poetics terminology. But this is the purpose of a large
publication like New York Times, to present a work in terms familiar to its
readers. What else can it be? In those terms,the observations of the
reviewer are quite acute and I do not think they tell any lies about the
poetry.

Here we come to a question we have discussed in this and other lists over
and over again, that there is always a profound break between the writing
process and the reception of a poem. What a poet (or in this case a poetry
school) envisions is different from the way the public sees or receives it,
this difference not necessarily negating (but definitely complicating) the
validity of either side's perceptions.

Ciao,

Murat

I like Nick's reading of the music/indie industry lingo. I don't
*think* most readers of NYTBR will see it that way, and I'm not
certain Stephen B entirely meant it that way. And it still leaves
open the question of how to think about what's happened twixt Rae's
"cult" reception and SB's gesturing toward a nationwide readership.
Which is to say, even if avant-garde reception works this way over a
period of a few decades, it might be a mistake to see the
corresponding literary history as analogous to music industry trends.
Rae is widely anthologized, for one -- she's a nationally known
quantity, at least insofar as poets can be understood as known
quantities, and not someone who's been toiling away in relative
obscurity (relative, that is, to any but the most celebrated poets;
if you prefer, she's no more obscure than 99% of the poets out there).

I'm very happy she's gotten the attention she's gotten, just to be
clear. I have, let's see, five anthologies here at home that include
work by Rae, and one compilation that incl. her work (the
~Conjunctions~ "American Poetry: States of the Art" issue). Which is
to say, good for her. And of course, again, nice to see a review of
her latest in NYTBR.

Btw, David -- me, I don't want no cult following!

It's like a completely different writer. I wish he (or his editors) had more respect for the Times' readers. Why couldn't a sentence like this be published there?:

  "Many poets could portray a beleaguered housewife, an oil spill, the land of the dead, or a Homeric siren: Armantrout's trick is to do all four at once. In doing so she also asks how much her word choice, our word choice, creates the events and reactions we try to interpret. "

  That really says something about the way the poetry works, and in the process indicates something of its subject matter as well.

All:

I've received a number of emails asking about the availability of John
Taggart's Atticus/Finch chapbook, Unveiling/Marianne Moore, and I
thought to send a general note to let folks know it's still available.
I printed fifty extra copies of this one to make sure there'd be
enough to go around, so if you'd like to order a copy, you still have
time to do so. Also, if you'd like me to set a copy aside for you,
simply send an email.

Here's the ordering info:

Send a check made payable to Michael Cross for $8 to:
Atticus/Finch Chapbooks
c/o Michael Cross
State University of New York at Buffalo
Samuel Clemens Hall #306
Buffalo, New York 14260-4610

I also thought to forward an announcement for Stephen Ratcliffe's new
book, REAL, which I designed for Avenue B. In my opinion, nobody's
doing what Ratcliffe's doing. This new work promises to be _very_
significant for writers thinking about what a long poem can do.
Ordering info below:

Stephen Ratcliffe
REAL
Avenue B
484 pages, paperback
ISBN 978-0-939691-13-5, $22
Publication Date April 1, 2007

Pre-publication price, $18 postpaid (through March 31),
send check to Avenue B, PO Box 714, Bolinas, CA 94924.


from the back cover:

Written as a daily practice from March of 2000 to July of 2001, REAL
has
a meditative intensity as it gives both the spectacular and the
ordinary moments of daily life an equal attention. This is a deep, long
poem, not for those addicted to the surface pleasures of the quick cut.
Each section of this poem is seventeen lines and certain themes return
again and again -- the ocean, relations between men and women, small
animals such as cats and owls, lemon yellow and various blues. This
structure frames and supports the poem’s celebration of intimacy with
both the natural and the human world and its quiet, patient
attentiveness to how luminous it all can be to those who just sit still
and notice.
-- Juliana Spahr

This year and a half of the poet’s life reads like an inspired
documentary. Daily pieces are comprised of stage directions in which
action, color, figures and objects emerge and disappear in the
cinematic framing of a subtle drama.  Instructions on what to view in a
beautifully spare but concise world.
-- Joanne Kyger

Stephen Ratcliffe’s REAL, the second volume in what promises to be a
long poem of unprecedented magnitude, continues where 2002’s Portraits
& Repetition left off, occupying the measure of a day in 474 takes or
frames, each documenting the minutia of the subject’s extension into
the world as the ocean’s low-end rumble frames the coastline it erodes.
 These nuanced gestures resist being dwarfed by the sheer girth of the
project, so that in a tradition akin to the minimalist music of Steve
Reich or Tony Conrad, the repetition of the open note holds the
listener mesmerized for hours, suspended just outside the body’s frame,
only for the slightest tonal shift to return one’s geist to form; as
such, these poems read not as autonomous stanzas in a collection of
verse, but rather as notes in a massive orchestral architecture.
Ratcliffe dwells in this music with such confidence that, when it
shifts directions and reorients its centers of gravity, the entire
structure quakes, taking us with it.
-- Michael Cross

Dark sky. You take my friends from me. They return, mother, in dreams.

She is dead and the argument has disappeared, in the still air there.
Nothing is left of the argument. She cannot reply.

More and more I remain on mountaintop or valleybottom. There is naught

Hi Barry and David,

Perhaps, our difference is in our expectations from a New York Times Book
Review article. I expect very little. New York Times almost never reviews
poetry books, and when it does (forget about the quality of the review) its
choice of books seems so arbitrary to me that I feel speechless. Her being
one of our own, I am glad they chose Rae's book regardless of the reason for
their choice. I am glad the review does not say anything stupid or blatantly
false about the book.

I share your ambivalence towards Rae's work. I heard her read about two
years ago in New York. A few weeks later, over dinner, I asked a poet friend
why he though Rae was a very good poet. He explained. His arguments were
reasonable and cogent; but I was not convinced. For me, there was a militant
dryness to Rae's work which -to use an odd phrase- was not necessary, an
attitude rather than an essence.

In its own way, I think, the reviewer is trying to confront this quality in
Rae's work, both supporting and defining it as a radical skepticism and also
warning the average reader about it. I give the review a lot of credit for
this attempt.

Are you not saying your quarrel is basically with Rae's work, which the
review could not quite dispel, the same way my poet friend could not dispel
mine?

"Where other poets seek symbols for the soul, Armantrout looks at minds and
sees machines:
'Crossed wires released such / hope-like sparks'": Are images not part of
the form/meaning of a poem? For instance, is "hope-like" a positive image of
hope or a negative image of illusion of hope?

David, thank you for pointing the direction in which the comments in my
earlier post were going.

Ciao,

Murat

It's great to have both http://bostonreview.net/BR27.2/burt.html and

also http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Armantrout.html concerning Rae
Armantrout's work.

In this thread, I've read several underestimations of the quality of the
nytimes review. It's a much more um exciting read than the bostonreview.net
piece. I did actually find the nytimes review exciting. Clearly it was
written after the bostonreview.net piece. Stephen Burt had some practice
already, then. Also, one senses some productive editorial pressure in the
concision of the nytimes piece.

There is a review of Jackson Mac Low's 1986 Roof Books "selected" titled
"Representative Works: 1939-1985" in Parnassus, Volume 15, No.1
(1989). The review is substantial and was written by John Perreault and is
on pages 201-216. I came across this interesting piece quite awhile after i=
t
was written because there was a review in this issue of my own first book o=
f
poetry by Sven Birkerts , otherwise I probably would not have been reading
Parnassus. I told Jackson about it after I discovered it, which was a few
years after its publication,  and gave him a copy because he didn't know at
the time that it had been published! For those who still remember the era
before Google, such things in the small press world were very possible;
still Jackson was surprised to learn about the review by Perreault, someone
who I knew very slightly and I'm pretty sure Jackson knew somewhat better.

The review opens like this:

"How do we judge the importance of a poet living in our time? This is an
embarrassing question. Accolades and critical reception may not be the
answer, for these are often determined by academic fashion. The number of
books sold is certainly not the proper gauge. Although an informed consensu=
s
over time may afford some hint, this is little help to individual readers
whose responses may be caused by the weather, politics or personal need. We
are left, then, with comparing the poems produced by our contemporary to
poems from the past that are now judged important. In other words, poet X i=
s
significant because his or her poems look like, sound like, or have a
similar effect to poet Y, who we are agree was a great and wonderful poet.
This leaves out innovation as a value.

No wonder, then, that Jackson Mac Low, whose poetry is very different from
anyone else's, keeps escaping official critical attention. His work is seen
as too eccentric. Yet Mac Low has had friendships and alliances with some
well-regarded contemporaries- David Antin, Jerome Rothenberg, Clayton
Eshleman- poets with some very different approaches to poetry, but all
admirers of his dedication and daring. He is a poet''s poet.

Influence upon other writers can be another factor in determining
importance. Has Mac Low had much influence? If he has, until recently it ha=
s
been the influence of an example, not of technique, theory or effect. He ha=
s
been the quintessential nonacademic, Bohemian poet, who has avoided the
popular with a vengeance, generating (it is rumored) trunkloads of poetry.
Slowly, however, it has begun to dawn on the younger generation of Language
poets that the freedom he forced upon his readers and performers in the for=
m
of an unflinching opacity of language is virtuous, perhaps profound, and
certainly worth following up.

Mac Low is a difficult poet, casting doubt upon certain conventions of
poetry and substituting premises of his own. Also, if the truth be known, a=
n
overall view of his oeuvre was always hard to come by. His output has been
extremely varied, and only sporadically available in print. In
*Representative Words*- which is not a volume of selected or collected
poems, but a sampling of the *kinds* of poems he has composed over almost
fifty years- we have at last a fine introduction to the pioneering work of
an American poet who is probably our most dedicated literary avant-gardist.
I use the term avant-garde advisedly. Mac Low is a pacifist and the term is
of military origins. Nevertheless, Mac Low's work is what used to be called
experimental, and does attempt to question poetry as personal expression, a=
s
printed text, and as static cultural product.

Although the spirit is quite different- more Buddhism than nihilism or
militarist anarchism- Mac Low's efforts are descended from Futurist,
Dadaist, and Constructivist sound poems invented early in this century. The
Dadaist Tristan Tzara, for instance, is celebrated for producing poems by
reading words written on slips of paper as they were pulled from a hat.
Furthermore, an understanding of Mac Low's work requires some knowledge of
fields outside of literature, most particularly the aleatory compositions o=
f
John Cage. Cage, now the grand old man of contemporary music, has
systematically applied chance procedures to musical compositions and
performance, using noise and silence as well as standard and altered musica=
l
instruments, allowing considerable leeway to performer-interpreters of his
nontraditional scores....

Now, however at the age of sixty-six, Mac Low seems to have abandoned or
modified his aleatory procedures in favor of "free" composition. This comes
just in time, for his earlier poems have begun to appear in poetry
anthologies. Certainly the respect with which he is treated by the Language
poetry group has had something to do with his new visibility. Endurance is
not its own reward..."

The review goes on to examine several poems in close detail and ends with a
discussion of Mac Low's recognition by the L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE poets, including
the fact that his work is lauded by Ron Silliman but not included in "In Th=
e
American Tree" ( that did not include poets "whose mature style and public
identity were firmly established prior to the publication of 'On Speech' [b=
y
Robert Grenier]".  Perreault notes sagely that "As far as I can see, Mac
Low's poetry is centered on oral language presentation, which if not
ordinary speech per se is certainly closely related to it, and relegates
print presentation to a secondary status....But...Mac Low challenges the
notion that words can be abstract or language-centered; even unconnected
strings of words and word-fragments will unavoidably refer to or at least
suggest things in the world, and create meaning. He proposes as a counter t=
o
the language-centered view of the new poetry the term perceiver-centered."

Catherine, I hate to think that the publisher, rather than the specifics of
the work, are going to be the arbiters of what is "safe." I think both
Armantrout's & Scalapino's work can be taught as considerably "unsafe."
Both of their practices are exploratory and exhibit creative/critical
thinking at a really high level. I like to support other presses that are
smaller and more innovative on a continual basis, but the fact of Wesleyan
publishing these two poets is in no way going to get me to stop reading or
(when I have the opportunity) teaching their work.

Given the discussion of Rae Armantrout, I thought I'd point out that =
she'll be reading at Rowan University in Glassboro, NJ (about 20 minutes =
outside of Philly) on Thursday, April 12 at 7:30. The reading will take =
place in Boyd Recital Hall in Wilson Hall and is free and open to the =
public. Refreshments and a book signing will follow.

B/C me with any questions.

Nick,

Perreault's sounds like a very perceptive review of Mac Low's language and
poetry, particularly, in way view , showing the "performance-centered" and
"perceiver-centered" aspects of his poetry.

I posted something a while ago related to the Han and
Manchu of China. I would have included the article in
its entirety, but the link leads one to both the
intended article and then some nice photos. I lived in
Heilongjiang for about two years, taking quick breaks
to explore Croatia and South America. A nice article,
though I would much disagree that Han and Manchu are
"indistinguishable by appearance" -- which is to say
that, for me, the statement reads clumsy (in part
because I lived in the area described and an old mate
is married to a woman of Manchu ancestory). But then
not all Han look alike, either -- and the Han, as some
can better state, because a few of us on this list
have ties to China, are then further divided. There
seem to be racial and ethnic hierarchies everywhere
one goes (and last night sat with two men from Somalia
and we talked about that). As an aside, the Machu did
not practice foot binding ("Golden Lillies").

hi all,

i guess what i find curious is how dissimilar my own experience of
armantrout's poetry (excepting the new book, which i've not yet read) is
from burt's. he finds the poems "a bummer," "they tell us we cannot find the
assurance we seek," they are "skeptical about almost every source of human
confidence, trust, hope, joy, strength or belief," "[s]he can't even see her
dreams as authentic," "[she] looks at minds and sees machines," finds that
"this life is never enough for us, and that the poet is contemplating death"
-- while this sort of all-pervasive hopelessness is quite opposite the
sustained engagement with the world and its contradictions, the small
victories in identifying those contradictions i find in armantrout's poetry.

and i don't see where burt's take -- which i'd hate to see become orthodoxy,
given especially the grim turn it appears to have taken since its boston
review incarnation -- is going to win armantrout a whole lot of new readers
unfortunately. i dunno, do most readers, of the nytimes or not, turn to
poetry in order to have their feelings of hopelessness, cheap
self-deception, bitterness anxiety and bafflement validated and reinforced?

I've encountered time and time again in mainstream programs the
embrace of *only* Scalapino and Armantrout (although, now Fanny Howe)
of the language-oriented writers; it seems plain to me that --
espcially Scalapino -- it is not that this is the "least difficult" of
the work, and it is not as though it can't be taught in its fullness,
but one wonders how it is -- and is is-- being taught and read as

Bernstein, Harryman, Watten, Perlman, Robinson, etc. etc.

A precious fluid        The lamp swings back and forth, raking its yellow light across my unwashed head. I tried to hold sleep in like a precious fluid, something I needed to breathe with; instead, cats howled through the morning. This goodie case contains all our shame. I make sure to eat your paprikas as soon as I jump out of bed, to slather my morning breath with onions. Without coffee, cigarettes taste brittle, acrid: paper dissolving to blister on the chafe of the lips. At the height of seeing these angles, seraphim measured out holograms of lovers long dead to sunshine, long morose like wetly-packed bread, and I laughed while tied to the bed, mussing softly her insides with a plugin or with messy code. How many times has something stopped working? Before these doors rattle open, along the slipperest of buttery etchings, tubers tie our eyes together just below the soil, and bulbs burst.
  Crazed with light, and not
 harder than pert alms.
 Yeast tempers our blood

If any poetry can be read/taught conservatively, then probably any poetry can be read/taught as innovative as well. But if that's so, is there really any conservative or innovative poetry? Or only conservative and innovative ways of reading?

Why not, indeed? Although the list of why nots goes way beyond
Language--why not MacLow, Schwerner, Owens, Spicer, Wieners, Dorn,
even Rothenberg, Meltzer, maybe a couple of dozen others of that
generation? (add the names that didn't come to mind) All of whom have
been around a lot longer, albeit sans brand name, and are rarely
taught. Even Olson is mostly famous in our neighborhood.

While we're at it, how about more than three or four poets British
poets, and maybe even more than a dozen from the rest of the world?

If we're going to get into complaining, in other words, why only
those maybe 10-15 years older than the average list member?

About Threads:

=93Inflection implicates us in family language we hardly understand, in =20=

old country we are also responsible for destroying and recreating in =20
a new world and word order whose mapping remains the task at hand. =20
These Threads work between the telling of a story and history to =20
inhabit such burdens of belated homecoming that stay the legacy of =20
conquest.=94
=97Ammiel Alcalay

=93In this delicate drawn/sewn/written book,/we are asked to =91feel a =20=

tension=92/where =91prayer has atrophied/as the grammar-muscle of =20
together.=92/Beautiful, poignant, her stuttering speech/=91on the other =20=

side of perhaps.=92=94
=97Cecilia Vicu=F1a

=93Some things can=92t be understood without turning to poetry, the =
genre =20
that allows observation, love, memory, confusion, and explanation to =20
intermix and play. Threads stitches all these things together. It =20
tells a complicated story of a father who is an Estonian refugee and =20
of a daughter who attempts to understand what this means by moving =20
through genres and mediums. It is a moving story of searching for =20
meaning and of an eventual arrival at a place of many meanings.=94
=97Juliana Spahr

=93Constituent parts of a person are discerned when memory, history and =20=

familial inquiry regroup to form and appreciate identity . . . . =20
These probings take the work into regions of cultural conflict and =20
reconnection, emotional shifts and aesthetic conveyances to arrive at =20=

nuanced perspectives that bridge former gaps and voids. The syntax =20
that delves there is sincere and soft as well as gritty in its =20
interpersonal realism.=94
=97Brenda Iijima
Jill Magi is a writer and artist living in Brooklyn, New York. She is =20=

the author of the chapbook Cadastral Map, published in 2005 by =20
Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs, as well as several self-published and =20
personally distributed small, handmade books. Her poetry, prose, and =20
visual work has been published in HOW2, The Brooklyn Rail, Jacket, =20
The New Review of Literature, Aufgabe, Chain, and Pierogi Press, and =20
exhibited at the Brooklyn Arts Council Gallery and the Brooklyn =20
Waterfront Artists Coalition. A 2006-07 writer-in-residence with the =20
Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, she also teaches at The City =20
College Center for Worker Education and runs Sona Books, a small =20
press dedicated to publishing risky, quiet, project-driven works in =20

Written Language is what I call a "Virtual Pluroma," and this relates to the theme of the grotesque in a number of ways,
but for
a political example of what this means, look at Adorno's last words.. Not sure, maybe Althusser. And I'll have to
paraphrase.. Basically what he said is that the field is "Too Open".. in terms of physics, and subjectivity, reality
is sort of the wild card, the Joker. If in the sense of Norman O. Brown's "The "is" is the original mistake in every
senstence,"
then what we arrive at is a solipsistic economy of signs masquerading as a method transubjective experience. We have
to fabricate that experience, like the piano player must must his fingers to the keys. Anything "might happen"..
The politics exists as an apriori organic structuring of the reader. Some texts have greater or lesser indexicality, but
only
on the surface, because potentially they all open back out into the pluroma of the chemical universe. This is really
just
a silly way of saying a number of things might happen because of a given text.. History hinges on these metanoias often
as socialisation as a text is involved in a subconscious polarisation of everything. A programme of non-dual thinking
seems
a positive or enlightened route, but at some further level out may actually be seen to have been part of a polarity
higher up
the granular chain.. this is a holoarchic topography, things change, words give the illusion of stasis like the tick
marks on
a rain gauge, but the universe is wholly fluid.. the word becomes something closer to a deadly game, the organic is
trapped
in the mechanism of the word externalized, of the externalized word internalized.. it is a wholly grotesque situation.
Either we're reordering potentials, or we're mutating a poison carapace. The path to vivification is the path to
nakedness
and integration with nature in wild and mutant prosthesis.. we should all be trance dancing in giant euglena exobodies
performing group meditation in a third space of organic communion.. instead, that higher organic organization we all
subjconsciously
long for has turned into a parodic prison world of jobs, books, relationships, etc.. we were meant to flame in molten
beauty
on a world of pure abundance.. That is the way I read it..

poetry accessible for the web?  or melo e castro's early digital works from 1968?

Yes to Chirot's thoughtful remarks about translation. Publication is definitely a process of translation.

The process of translation that occurs within a university press publishing house is considerable indeed. The acquisitions editor (who will herself, necessarily, be a person of at least as much range as depth) must translate (let that include lots of "convincing") the importance of each book to everyone who is responsible for it at each stage in-house, including the book publicist (who calls on the Times and lots of other media and may speak for every title in the catalog, which, at a publisher like UC Press, is a lot of books in many different fields) and the sales reps (ditto). They are "translating" the importance of each book with perhaps two sentences during brief appointments, and are often up against people who have no time, are too busy, and don't care much for poetry. It's systole and diastole to get each book to its core audience and, using different language, different frames, to see if more mainstream media can take it up and introduce it to new audiences.

Sometimes a book makes it to the pages of the Times because someone at the Times  translates the need for a review to others at the Times . . . A good publicist may even know and remember that a book review editor did a thesis in grad school on Language poets, and so she makes sure to bring a book to the attention of this editor, though it is known that the Times has almost no space for poetry. And if after all this, Language poetry is not mentioned in the review . . .

The mix of passion, knowledge, curiosity and serendipity, timing, the credibility of publishers and those selling the books, as well as the sheer hucksterism that goes into getting books reviewed variously and widely, all stand in stark contrast to much of the nuance and doxology one hears among poets speaking to other poets of a certain school.

The Times review will increase sales, will introduce people to Rae's poetry, will perhaps bring some readers to other Wesleyan poets, and will certainly trigger any number of people to Google Rae's name, which will lead to poems on-line by her and Hejinian and Howe and Owen and many others, and to sites about Language poetry, American poetry, Objectivist poetry, etc. And, and and, and and . . .

The Times review will, most importantly, get the book into libraries that would not otherwise order the book from a wholesaler. There, in the library, a person of whatever age and inclination, who may not know from Language poetry, might find it on a shelf near books by Ammons, Bly, and Bukowaki, and might borrow all in one day, and read them.

Scepticism, credulity, fabulation, and truth. Interesting issues concerning
Armantrout's poetry and, as has been intelligently pointed out on the list,
interesting also with regard to the nytimes review, which is 'too good to be
true'?

The plot thickens.

Somehow I'm reminded of the opening of "Politics and the English Language"
(1946) by Orwell:

"Our civilization is decadent, and our language--so the argument runs--must
inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle
against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring
candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies
the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an
instrument which we shape for our own purposes. Now, it is clear that the
decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes."

out. It is a page of Flaubert's notebook during his voyage to Carthage. But
it does look and read and feel like a poem. Most of his notes do in this
superb edition by Claire-Marie Delavoye, a Canadian scholar who scrupulousl=

performance and the audience was served homemade
dinner.  A sample list of these original performers
includes Philip Glass, Joan Jonas, Yvonne Rainer,
Richard Serra, and Hannah Wilke.

Dear Colleagues, As an editor of two journals that have tried hard to
"do something" about the many issues generated here by the NY Times
review (and I am reminded that this doesn't change, of Zukofsky's
telling me of efforts to get WCW reviewed in the same place), perhaps
I could make a few simple observations: 1. Glad to hear a prose
writer (Musil) referred to. The same situation obtains in that world,
can think of few presses of any sort trying to bring together the new
in both poetry and prose.  2.  My current publication has all the
"production values" of any journal, and a low price. Were it to
"succeed" it could affect the problems elaborated this last week.
Were it, for example, to attract subscriptions from (I will guess a
number) the 500 or so folks who see these lucubrations on the Times
BR, etc, it could afford to advertise, and thus perhaps to grow
faster.  3.  Assuming that my choices do represent the "us" mentioned
herein, I am amazed that NOT ONE of "us" comes up the $12/annum
necessary to subscribe. Not one.

So I'm wondering if this is the experience of other editors of
independent publications: an afflatus (to use LZ's word) of
discussion and lament, not much in the way of simple actions that
might make a difference.

The discussion of publicists and harried editors is to the point: if
you look at the conditions that obtain, you can work with them.

But not without the support of "us."

End of lament.  Best, Lou

Well, here's one that might serve, Heidi:

Flinch

A new season
sweeps across the merchandise.

Paper products suggest harvest,
then fear of the dark.

Rows of palms
in stanchions
abstain,

having little stake
in matter.

They flap their fronds weakly
as we revolve.

*

Is it true we deserve
any blow
we fail to anticipate?

A shadow
traveling down a wall

is a maternal hand

while a maternal hand
is lavender-suffusing
dusk

and dusk itself,
a great tissue
of lies,
suffused with blood.

*

Three things are placed
in safety

on a created plane:

twilight
and the stop-gap palms
bellwether palms

advance

with the transparent
cloud-scarves
of the nonexistent

fatalistic nomads
we half-dreamed
                 of being.

Dear Poetics subscribers,

Coach House Books is pleased to announce the publication of Human=20
Resources, the new collection by Rachel Zolf:

Human Resources

Write for buyers. Write for bosses. Think hyper. Think branding. Tell=20

	Poetry and =91plain language=92 collide in the writing machine =
that is=20
Human Resources. Here at the intersection of creation and repackaging,=20=

we experience the visceral and psychic cost of selling things with=20
depleted words. Pilfered rhetorics fed into the machine are spit out as=20=

bungled associations among money, shit, culture, work and=20
communication. With the help of online engines that numericize=20
language, Human Resources explores writing as a process of encryption.

	Deeply inflected by the polyvocality and encoded rhetorics of =
the=20
screen, Human Resources is perched at the limits of language,=20
irreverently making and breaking meaning. Navigating the crumbling=20
boundaries among page, screen, reader, engine, writer and database,=20
Human Resources investigates wasting words and words as waste =96 and =
the=20
creative potential of salvage.

	Written by Rachel Zolf (Masque), who works days as a corporate=20=

=91What=92s the use of Jews writing limericks? An archaeologist of=20

Rachel Zolf is the author of the poetry collections Masque (The Mercury=20=

Press, 2004), which was shortlisted for the 2005 Trillium Book Award=20
for Poetry, and Her absence, this wanderer (BuschekBooks, 1999), which=20=

was a finalist in the cbc Literary Competition. Zolf lives in Toronto=20

I've read this thread with great interest and chose to branch off of =
Barry's comment below. I would love to have seen a line like that =
myself; not only because it raises the
issue of language and interpretation, but because it also presents=20
the "positive" spin her doubting-work takes in the age of belief.

What I found most disappointing about the review - thinking of Murat's =
comment
on 'reception' - is his framing of aspects of her poetics - namely
the use of doubt, bitterness, ambiguity, juxtaposition - as negative
because they stem, apparently, from non-belief; they disrupt the
narrative of the soul.=20

Of course the reviewer must speak to his readers in a language they'll
understand, but simply saying Rae is not a soul-seeking, life-
affirming poet is not enough. To Burt, in the very least these poems =
reassure
is that someone out there is more doubtful than "we"!=20

The approach he takes, I think, will *not* help
his readers understand these poems; it rather enables them to see her =
work
as contrary to normative frames - of poetics, of belief. Thus easy to =
dismiss.=20

Lines quoted provide ample examples of her use of ambiguity and doubt
(questions, "or" driven phrases), but his reading of her doubt is =
misplaced
when he addresses the lines "Someone insists on forming sentences / on =
my pillow...";=20
these lines are less skeptical about the authenticity of dreams (?) than =
they
are wary of the powers (and the discourses) of "someones" and "others"=20
to infiltrate - no, inscribe them. "Uncomfortable domestic interiors" =
indeed -=20
Burt hits that one right on the head. =20

So three cheers for Rae for making poems that are hard for us to "make =
into
poetic wholes"!

Subject: Re: Armantrout review in Sunday Times Book Review

It's like a completely different writer. I wish he (or his editors) had =
more respect for the Times' readers. Why couldn't a sentence like this =
be published there?:
 =20
  "Many poets could portray a beleaguered housewife, an oil spill, the =
land of the dead, or a Homeric siren: Armantrout's trick is to do all =
four at once. In doing so she also asks how much her word choice, our =
word choice, creates the events and reactions we try to interpret. "

  That really says something about the way the poetry works, and in the =
process indicates something of its subject matter as well.

to pick up, in turn, on Linda's point:

[here I'm elaborating the sort of thing I take her as suggesting:]

the reviewer might have presented Armantrout as providing an antidote
to linguistic manipulation:  she's an anti-spin poet, and thus offers
crucial and timely work at this moment in the history of American
public language...

this would be to read her skepticism as politically constructive--

however, to qualify one of Linda's points:  it's hard for me to
imagine NYTBR readers taking this reading as _any less_ "contrary to
normative frames"--this alternate version of Armantrout's project is
_equally_ something poets aren't supposed to do.  Poets, for that
organ, are supposed to inhabit the spectrum between Billy Collins and
Elizabeth Bishop.  That's the norm in question, I think.

And if I'm right, then there is no choice _between_ understanding the
poems and seeing them as contrary to normative frames; rather, the
latter is essential to the former.

At which point, a critic only slightly more skeptical than I might
exclaim, "and therefore NYTBR readers will not understand the poems!"

I guess I'm cynical/pragmatic/sanguine enough about the limits of mainstream media, and hopeful enough about poetry itself, especially Rae Armantrout's, that I think ANY attention in the Times, no matter how misapprehending, is a good thing. Like I said, if it gets people looking for Rae's work online, and if it gets the book into libraries, readers will find out for themselves.

Don't forget that many of US are Times readers, and we all read it with a sense of its limited frames. Who's to say that there aren't plenty of Times readers who aren't on the poetics list, yet know how to read between the lines of a newspaper, and wouldn't have  heard about Rae's work otherwise?

I liked the point Lou made about understanding conditions and working with them.

By the way, I don't think I knew what Language poetry was when I first copied SIT-CALM out of one of Rae's books and put it up on my refrigerator. (I loved Bishop's poetry and we were publishing a biography of her, so she and the poets and critics who valorized her were much on my mind; but I could like other poetries, too.) Many years and apartments and refrigerators later, SIT-CALM is still with me.

I don't know how many poetics group people read ARTFORUM but its
certainly got a significant readership not only in the US but
internationally. Within the art magazine world it's pretty mainstream.
The March issue features Rae Armantrout's Top Ten. There are no ready
comparisons to be had between an art mainstream and a poetry one, but I
would say Armantrout's appearance in this magazine adds value to both.
While  these annotated lists are pretty much  everywhere now in the
magazine world and everywhere a sign of down marketing, Artforum's
frequently offer valuable pointers to the culturally out of the way and
interesting. Poets rarely feature either as lister or as listed, let
alone a poet of Armantrout's class.

She takes the opportunity to alert the art world to: Silliman's Blog (1)
Emily Dickinson (2) Francis Ponge (3)
Bob Perelman (4) Lydia Davis (8) Conjunctions (9) and Fanny Howe (10).
And her annotations are succinct, informative and informed, particular,
evocative, and her choices/judgements are interesting both in themselves
and as a snapshot of the writer herself.=20

I guess I'm cynical/pragmatic/sanguine enough about the limits of
mainstream media, and hopeful enough about poetry itself, especially Rae
Armantrout's, that I think ANY attention in the Times, no matter how
misapprehending, is a good thing. Like I said, if it gets people looking
for Rae's work online, and if it gets the book into libraries, readers
will find out for themselves.

Don't forget that many of US are Times readers, and we all read it with
a sense of its limited frames. Who's to say that there aren't plenty of
Times readers who aren't on the poetics list, yet know how to read
between the lines of a newspaper, and wouldn't have  heard about Rae's
work otherwise?=20

I liked the point Lou made about understanding conditions and working
with them.

By the way, I don't think I knew what Language poetry was when I first
copied SIT-CALM out of one of Rae's books and put it up on my
refrigerator. (I loved Bishop's poetry and we were publishing a
biography of her, so she and the poets and critics who valorized her
were much on my mind; but I could like other poetries, too.) Many years
and apartments and refrigerators later, SIT-CALM is still with me.

As an aside, there are some wonderful books on this
tradition. Too, it is interesting to note that there
is a lot of evidence to suggest that male prostitutes
would also have their feet bound -- which is to say
the arch of the foot quite literally destroyed.

Gabe,

That might be what was said, and who am I to disagree
or even debate the issue, but for sake of general
accuracy foot-binding was an erotic tradition
practiced by the Han or "Chinese" the words
synonymous.

As an aside, my wife and I own genuine pair of "lotus
shoes".

My first encounter with MacLow took place when I first moved to NYC in 1997.  Excited to be here, I wanted to do everything cool.  So I went to a a Pauline Oliveros' concert in something of a warehouse space located in Soho.  The seats were organized in an L shape around her equipment/instruments.  I sat in the forward-facing front row.  About midway through the concert, I noticed a man sitting in the front row across from me in the other leg of the L.  His face became distracting to the point that I was listening, trying to focus on Oliveros' physical movements while also returning to that face regularly.  Finally at the show's end, I approached the man.  His face up close struck me as quite open, and I suddenly doubted what I had by then determined was a familiarity -- he may just have that kind of friendly presence that makes people think he's someone they know.  Nonetheless, I boldly asked, Do I know you?  He answered, I don't know!  I didn't know how to proceed, so I
 fumbled with a few now embarrassed random questions, Do you live around here?  Do I look familiar?  Where do you
get your coffee?  etc. He was game for all of this, even amused, answering each one, until I finally asked, What do you do?  He replied, I'm a poet.  In that instant, it hit me and I blurted out, You slept in my bed!   He laughed, What??  I remembered just then and told him that when he had visited Buffalo to read some years before while I was living there.  I was going out of town during his visit, so my roommate, Anya Lewin, offered up my bed for his stay.  I remembered his face because I was reading his book before he arrived, primarily to see what kind of poet would be sleeping in my bed.  I remembered his face years later from the photograph.  This pleased MacLow, who expressed appreciation for the bed and the funny coincidence.  Small world.

Nick makes a good point - I did mean to suggest that understanding=20
her contrareity is necessary to understanding her
poetics. My gripe is that the reviewer does not clarify
that, thus framing her poetry as, well, not impending on our
understanding of what poetic language does. Thus easy to
dismiss rather than to engage as complication (And I know I'm=20
naive in my belief that the general reader wants her understanding=20
of poetry complicated!)

However, I'm not implying that the total effect
of the review is a negative sum - no new readers for Armantrout.
But it leaves us shy of understanding why we should read her - what's
to be gained from her doubt, other than a reassurance that=20
someone has got a worse case of it. It leaves us shy of understanding
because politics and language are avoided in a review that
constructs poetry as, by definition, a discourse that transcends
material actualities.=20

In Armantrout's poetry, the power of doubt, bitterness, & contrareity
does not merely address personal shortcomings (inauthentic
dreams) but those acts of "public language," as Nick puts it, that =
undermine=20
the imagination.

In the review, for example, a reference to a tradition of contrareity =
might
help frame Rae's project - a reference to Williams' Spring
and All, for example, where he "lets the imagination have its own way"=20
in order to redisover "reality itself," to create a new form for =
experience,
to rediscover "beauty" as a "state in which reality plays a part." (That
the imagination in Rae's work is so much less crisp, more laced with
ambiguity than Williams' is itself interesting). Though=20
of course that might be off the general reader's radar and require too =
much
explanation from an editor's perspective. So yes, I agree, it's the norm
that's the problem. And I don't discredit one reviewer for attempting to
present Rae's work to a general readership - I just wish her 'spin'=20
didn't get a negative rap.=20

Aren't we all, to some degree or other, great revisers of others' =
arguments.=20

[within a dirty shopping bag]

Psyche', the prettiest of the cheval-glasses is certainly the oval one from Compiègne, the frame
of which is fitted, low down, into the elegant counter-curve of the wings of the gilt sphoenixes
on each side, which support on their heads quivering tufts of bundled bronze arrows. In the
middle of the tendrils which, springing from the tails of the fabulous animals', ache, adorn the
lunette below the mirror, grimaces the head of the horned Pan. It grimaces at the two heads of
bacchantes which blaze forth in the center of the two graceful pedestals - or did the artist intend
that it should be there, at the bottom of the mirror, as a sort of grotesque cul-de-lampe, a tailpiece
to the crystal page upon which would be printed the image of a comely woman? There has been
much amusement at the Empire mania for attributes that match the functions of the various pieces
of furniture, but here symbolic suggestion and elegant line seem to me to be all of a piece...

Subject:      Re: Armantrout review in Sunday Times Book Review
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Many deepest thanks to Linda Norton for restoring to this discussion the
most important person of all, the reader:  "There, in the library, a person
of whatever age and incliintaion, who may not know from Language poetry,
might find it {Armantrout's book} on a shelf near books by Ammons, Bly and
Bukowski, and might borrow all in one day, and read them."

Isn't that what it's all about?

That a READER FINDS THE BOOKS????? and NOT JUST ONE BUT MANY!!!!

not just one reader, one book, one poet, one poetry-but many, many!

(oh oh--suddenly realized am echoing Che--"not one Vietnam, but two, three,
many Vietnams!")

How often hasn't one read the rather standardized ("normative" re the
non-normative)  texts  re language-centered writing that advocate the reader
as a co-creator of the text being read?  And yet what does one find here
--many advocating that the reading needs to be strictly controlled, so that
it will be received in the proper manner, understood and digested in the
most nutritious and right way and generate a hunger for further texts of the
same kind only.

(Thank you to Wynston Curnow for his noting Armantrout's Ten List in
ArtForum--in which we find that Armantrout herself places as number one not
a poet but a blog--wherein it is to be assumed will be the "right" way to
read hers and others' books, and the "right" authors to read, further texts
of the same kind/school for those demanding such imperatives, such
controls.)

I think that perhaps--this is a suggestion--many here are misreading the
reviewer's assertions about the poetry of Armantrout's being that of one who
is the most doubting.  I think that readers here are underestimating the
magical power of the superlative to the american ear/eye, from long
tradition via tall tales and advertising--the Bunyanesque so to speak--the
Sixty Foot Tall Woman--aspect of american culture.  The reviewer doesn't say
that Armantrout is just any old doubter--she is the moust doubtingest of
doubters!  If you re marketing or praising or recommedning something to an
audience, consumers or friends--you don't say--oh you will like so and so,
they are a trash or thrash band--you say--you will like this band--they are
the trashiest band there is, the thrasingest ones alive! If you're going to
doubt--be the best doubter! The most doubtingest!  For the reviewer to write
this, it gives the work a "hook"--something you are going to remember when
you walk into the library or bookstore and see the book or the author's
other books on a shelf. "Ah--there's the doubtingest poet! Go to check that
one out!"
     Since Dickinson is also mentioned, the reader may pick up her book
also--and start to have some doubts about who really are the most doubting
poets--and look for more of them to find out questions of doubt and poetry.
Poem, poem on the wall--who is the doubtingest of them all?
     To be mentioned in a review alongside Emily Dickinson--is very high
recommendation, very select company. If the reviewer had rattled off names
of some Language writers or other contemporaries, the general reader might
not sit up and take notice.  But Emily Dickinson?!  Talk about name
recognition!  Talk about some wide coat tails, hem lines to ride in on!
(Which underscores the reviewer's point that Armantrout's name will become
nationally known also.)

     The reviewer, Steven Burt--also speaks highly of Armantrout's
"invention, force and wit of a mind testing assumptions the best it
can"--which I think shows a sense of the tension between the force that is
doing the testing and the immovable objects as it were which it is
testing--the beings and things of the "domestic interior" which no matter
how much one doubts them, are implacably there, made up of one's own choices
and the family one is born into.  After all,you may have doubts abt what's
on the pillow--but--the pillow--and bed--when all is said and done are the
ones you chose to lie in.

       (Reminds me of Peter Sloterdjik's Critique of Cynical Reason--the
condition of people who are "well off and unhappy at the same time"--and
echoes of Thoreau's "lives of quiet desperation". Yet to be the doubtingest
poet and write poetry means that one has faith in poetry even as one doubts
words. Poems as incomplete wholes in this way maintain the tension between
the doubt--incompletion of a whole in words--and the act of faith of poetry
in that there is a poem.  We're not talking complete doubt here, complete
doubt in poetry that is, but incomplete doubt.  Complete doubt is
Rimbaud--stop writing poetry! And leave home! )

     Again, I'm very thankful to Linda Norton for the figure of the  reader
in the library finding four very different books to take home.   Going by
many posts to this list, the reader is configured as a "norm" who (if a
"norm" is even a "who")--needs a lot of talking down to in order to make the
right choices in the right informed manner so as to avoid the crushing
embrace and cunning traps of the great monster "normative reading" stalking
the unsuspecting populace.

       I'm not really sure what more could be asked for--the NY Times gives
a big review complete with author's foto, citing the poet's "invention,
force and wit" and being the doubtingest poet around, having affinities with
Emily Dickinson and guaranteed to be nationally known.  On top of that the
poet herself is in ArtForum citing as Number One on her favorites the
centcom blog wherein may be found al the desired and correct presentations
of her work and those of the group with whom she is desired by the list  to
be associated with--not only that, but the blog is AHEAD of Emily Dickinson,
who is a mere second place figure, among a group of other
Language-associated writers.

  And yet, and yet--so little happiness!  Is it the fear of the "normative
reader" lurching about out there among the destroyed forests forcibly
imprisoned as books? Great lumbering "normatives" who may be turned off by
the review?  Or--may get the book from the library or bookstore--and not be
able to give it more than a "normative reading"?  Become insensate with rage
upon finding it does not fit the "norm" of an Emily Dickinson poem?  Will be
too "normative" to tune into the right blogs to find out how to do
"non-normative" readings according to the "non-normative" norm?  Is there
really that much fear of the reader out there in "normative" land that the
book ultimately will have to be protected by a phalanx  and series in relay
of body guard-reviewers along its way from the doors of the press to the
doors of the reader's room?
    (And there to have an instructor in non-normative reading accompany the
normative reader step by step page by page into non-normativity--so that,
emerging from the chamber, the now transformed reader is all but
unrecognizable to the mere normatives with whom they inhabit their normative
world.  And yea verily, so shall be planted the "seeds of doubt" the
reviewer entitles his comments with.
     But in the eyes of the still normative family--they wonder if they
haven't been viisited by the first wave of pods in "Invasion of the Body
Snatchers" . . . Is the non-normative in their midst the new norm they will
all become? . . . A future of nothing more than more normativity in the
"next life"? . . Didn't Burroughs claim that language was a virus from outer
space? . . . )


         What if some "normative" loves the book--but for all the "wrong"
reasons?  or thinks it's a crock--incredibly for all the "right " reasons?
Won't that upset the "norm"?
          What if a "normative" read this list and thought that the "norm"
referred to Language poetry  and the "normatives" are the poets and persons
here?  And wondered how a really far-out poet like Emily Dickinson got mixed
up in all of this?

           After all isn't it possible that the reader out there may just be
more "non-normative" than the poet or the poet's "crowd"?  Far less
convinced than even the doubtingest of doubters in the abilities of words
and ready willing and able to test them in ways no non-normative or
normative ever thought possible?
          Isn't that the way poetry keeps showing up in spite of everybody
involved with it including poets?

         As Emily Dickinson, magnificently playing the part of Emily
Dickinson said:  "The hills know, but do not tell."

Can someone clear this up for me? Is this the correct quote?

"What do you see when you look out with your language?"

I have to use the quote in the title of a paper and cannot locate a copy of
"The Crystal Text" It's towards the beginning (first 20 pages or so if I
remember correctly).

At last, available from Small Press Distribution (and thus your local indep=
endent bookseller):

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s Open House, by Hannah Weiner. =20

Edited and with an introduction by Patrick F. Durgin. =20

POETRY/ART/PERFORMANCE=20

ISBN 0-9767364-1-1 $14.95=20

<a target=3D"_blank" href=3D"http://www.spdbooks.org/Details.asp?BookID=3D0=
976736411">Order from Small Press Distribution</a>

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s influence extends from the sixties New York avant-g=
arde, where she was part of an unprecedented confluence of poets, performan=
ce and visual artists including Phillip Glass, Andy Warhol, Carolee Schneem=
an, John Perrault, David Antin, and Bernadette Mayer.  Like fellow-traveler=
 Jackson Mac Low, she became an important part of the Language movement of =
the 70s and 80s, and her influence can be seen today in the so-called =E2=
=80=9CNew Narrative=E2=80=9D work stemming from the San Francisco Bay Area.=
  With other posthumous publications of late, her work is being discussed b=
y scholars in feminist studies, poetics, and disability studies.  But there=
 does not yet exist a representative selection spanning her decades of poet=
ic output.  Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s Open House aims to remedy this with pre=
viously uncollected (and mostly never-published) work, including performanc=
e texts, early New York School influenced lyric poems, odes and remembrance=
s to / of Mac Low and Ted Berrigan, and later =E2=80=9Cclair-style=E2=80=9D=
 works. =20

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s Open House beckons us into a realm of poetry that b=
ends consciousness in order to open the doors of perception. Weiner is one =
of the great American linguistic inventors of the last thirty years of the =
20th century. She created an alchemical poetry that transforms the material=
s of everyday life into a dimension beyond sensory perception. The pieces c=
ollected here are as much conceptual art as sprung prose, experimental myst=
icism as social realism, autobiography as egoless alyric. Patrick Durgin ha=
s brought together touchstone works, some familiar and some never before pu=
blished. Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s Open House provides the only single volume=
 introduction to the full range of Weiner=E2=80=99s vibrant, enthralling, a=
nd unique contribution to the poetry of the Americas.  =E2=80=94Charles Ber=
nstein =20

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s syncopated patterning uncovers a conversation so th=
rilling that I never want it to end. As Frank O=E2=80=99Hara had earlier sh=
ifted the stable lyric self into a multiplicity of positions (=E2=80=9CI do=
n=E2=80=99t know what blood=E2=80=99s in me=E2=80=9D), Weiner began in over=
drive and rocketed outward, inhabiting texts and communities with the same =
skill with which she herself was inhabited. =E2=80=9CI was also a pillow/ c=
ase,=E2=80=9D she wrote, in Spoke (1984). =E2=80=9C I was in the closet   I=
 was an iron [ . . .]  I was also sentence.=E2=80=9D Weiner makes haunting =
both spooky and hilarious. Messages billboard across the page, words bleed,=
 leap and wilt. Superscription and subscription join forces to destroy the =
hegemony of the poetic line, opening it up to pure energy.  =E2=80=94Dodie =
Bellamy =20

Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s work, so lovingly presented here, brought her into =
the exploration of new ways & means for making poetry =E2=80=93 a process b=
y which she would have left her mark under any circumstances on avant-garde=
 poetics & practice. The still more remarkable change in her later work cam=
e, spontaneously, with the onset of an experience, an ongoing alteration of=
 perception in which visible words entered her field of vision =E2=80=93 as=
 cause of wonder & as =E2=80=9Cmessages=E2=80=9D to be included in the poem=
s that followed. If her art both early & late insures her standing within t=
he twentieth-century avant-garde, it connects her as well to the experience=
 & writings of many traditional poet-mystics (clairvoyants in her word for =
them & for herself). It is, when taken as a whole, an achievement without p=
recedent or comparison among her sometimes better-known contemporaries. =E2=
=80=94Jerome Rothenberg =20

Poet and visionary, Hannah Weiner knit together the worlds of post New York=
 School poetry, performance and art. In the early 70s, she went on a three-=
week fast and let go of everything, resurfacing with a newly visceral, and =
visual, relation to letters and words. Exploring the joins between art and =
life, language and politics, she sought to =E2=80=9Cwork in poetic forms th=
at themselves alter consciousness.=E2=80=9D For Weiner, poetry became a way=
 to intertwine her own experience with that of others, to let more of the w=
orld into her art: =E2=80=9CI continue writing as a collaboration with WORD=
S I SEE.=E2=80=9D Rich with previously unpublished works and samples of key=
 works, Hannah Weiner=E2=80=99s Open House restores a crucial figure to the=
 present.  =E2=80=94Liz Kotz =20

Please join us for a reading by the renowned American poets Lyn Hejinaian and Barrett Watten next Thursday, 29 March, 6:30 PM, at Parasol Unit, London

      Lyn Hejinian is the author of many books, including Writing is An Aid to Memory (The Figures, 1978), My Life (third edition, Green Integer, 2002), Oxota: A Short Russian Novel (The Figures, 1991), and The Fatalist (Omnidawn, 2003). Her essays are collected in The Language of Inquiry (University of California Press, 2000). She was editor of Tuumba Press, 1976-84 and co-editor (with Barrett Watten) of Poetics Journal, 1981-99 and is now co-director of Atelos. A Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, she teaches at the University of California, Berkeley.

  Barrett Watten is a poet and a professor of literature and cultural studies at Wayne State University in Detroit. He has published two volumes of literary and cultural criticism, of which The Constructivist Moment: From Material Text to Cultural Poetics (Wesleyan, 2003) was awarded the René Wellek Prize in 2004. His published works of poetry include Frame (1971-1990), published by Sun and Moon in 1997; Bad History (Atelos, 1998); and Progress/Under Erasure (Green Integer, 2004). Watten edited This, one of the central little magazines of the experimental writers who would be known as the Language school, and co-edited Poetics Journal, one of its theoretical venues. The Grand Piano, a multi-authored "experiment in collective autobiography" of the period, began serial publication in November 2006. Recently, he spent time in Germany as a Fulbright Fellow, at the University of Tübingen and in Berlin, where he wrote on visual art, performance, and cultural politics.


      The readings at Parasol Unit are organized and introduced by Barry Schwabsky. Previous readers have been Tim Atkins, Guy Bennett, Peter Cole, Kelvin Corcoran, Linh Dinh, Carrie Etter, Allen Fisher, Mark Ford, Lee Harwood, Sue Hubbard, Vincent Katz, Tony Lopez, Drew Milne, Redell Olsen, Anthony Rudolf, Leslie Scalapino, Barry Schwabsky, John Seed, Simon Smith, Carol Szymanski, and Catherine Wagner.

About Threads:

=93Inflection implicates us in family language we hardly understand, in =20=

old country we are also responsible for destroying and recreating in =20
a new world and word order whose mapping remains the task at hand. =20
These Threads work between the telling of a story and history to =20
inhabit such burdens of belated homecoming that stay the legacy of =20

=93Some things can=92t be understood without turning to poetry, the =
genre =20
that allows observation, love, memory, confusion, and explanation to =20
intermix and play. Threads stitches all these things together. It =20
tells a complicated story of a father who is an Estonian refugee and =20
of a daughter who attempts to understand what this means by moving =20
through genres and mediums. It is a moving story of searching for =20
meaning and of an eventual arrival at a place of many meanings.=94
=97Juliana Spahr

=93Constituent parts of a person are discerned when memory, history and =20=

familial inquiry regroup to form and appreciate identity . . . . =20
These probings take the work into regions of cultural conflict and =20
reconnection, emotional shifts and aesthetic conveyances to arrive at =20=

nuanced perspectives that bridge former gaps and voids. The syntax =20
that delves there is sincere and soft as well as gritty in its =20

Jill Magi is a writer and artist living in Brooklyn, New York. She is =20=

the author of the chapbook Cadastral Map, published in 2005 by =20
Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs, as well as several self-published and =20

It was brought to my attention that a TOC might be useful to those who already know her work and own some of her books.  So, here is the TOC for Hannah Weiner's Open House, w/ page #s to indicate the scope of the excerpts.  I should say that, with the exception of Nijole's House, which remains in print, this book reprints the entirety of Weiner's chapbooks.  There's a complete description of the criteria of inclusion in the introduction to the book.  But suffice to say, the project is geared toward rounding out and gathering one's HW shelf.

No apology. Please. Silly who?! If anything, I can't
help but to think you are very lucky to have such an
interesting mom - and that must mean you're as well!

=3D93Some things can=3D92t be understood without turning to poetry, the =3D
genre =3D20
that allows observation, love, memory, confusion, and explanation to =3D20
intermix and play. Threads stitches all these things together. It =3D20
tells a complicated story of a father who is an Estonian refugee and =3D20
of a daughter who attempts to understand what this means by moving =3D20
through genres and mediums. It is a moving story of searching for =3D20
meaning and of an eventual arrival at a place of many meanings.=3D94

These probings take the work into regions of cultural conflict and =3D20
reconnection, emotional shifts and aesthetic conveyances to arrive at =3D20=

nuanced perspectives that bridge former gaps and voids. The syntax =3D20

The New Review of Literature, Aufgabe, Chain, and Pierogi Press, and =3D20
exhibited at the Brooklyn Arts Council Gallery and the Brooklyn =3D20

Subject: Hannah Weiner's Open House TOC

It was brought to my attention that a TOC might be useful to those who alre=
ady know her work and own some of her books.  So, here is the TOC for Hanna=
h Weiner's Open House, w/ page #s to indicate the scope of the excerpts.  I=
 should say that, with the exception of Nijole's House, which remains in pr=
int, this book reprints the entirety of Weiner's chapbooks.  There's a comp=
lete description of the criteria of inclusion in the introduction to the bo=
ok.  But suffice to say, the project is geared toward rounding out and gath=
ering one's HW shelf.

Hi!
Over at 21 Stars Review (http://sundress.net/21stars) we are hurting for
innovative poetry that uses constraints (such as OULIPO techniques), form
(traditional or otherwise), collage, found materials, cut-ups, or that is
derived from any kind of procedural/nonstandard compositional practices.
Please note, we do look at other kinds of poetry, but we are particularly
low on constraint-based submissions. Please take a look at our submission
guidelines (http://www.sundress.net/21stars/submit.htm) for more info. We'd
love to read your work!

bols

I don't know the bols. I play tabla. I play melody. I don't know where it
comes from or where it goes. My eyes are closed. I sense the skins. I
sense the rings. I sense the syahi. The puri is mine. The chutta are mine.
The tabla sit on chutta. The chutta offer them to me. The chutta offers
the dayan. The chutta offers the bayan. My eyes are closed. My fingers are
nervous. My fingers move. I am going deaf. My tinnitus grows. The world is
full of whine. The world is full of crickets. Of the dawn chorus. The dawn
chorus stops for no hour. I fill my ears with glycerine. I place ten drops
in each. In one I place twenty, My ears drip. My way is clear. My life is
clear. I hear poorly. I swab my ears with witch hazel, I swab them with
benzocaine. I am numb to the world. The world is a pretty picture. The
world goes still. But I feel the tabla. But I feel the dayan and bayan. I
feel the rhythm in the tips of my fingers. I feel the puri with my palms.
I sway backwards and forwards. I sway to the left and the right. There is
nothing to hear. There is nothing to hear in the world. There is nothing
to see either.

Sandwiches
(from the fever desk of a mad mind)

There are sandwiches that stave off disaster
like a slice of Our Father between two Hail Mary=92s

And then there are midnight sandwiches
that give you the creeps, or at the least gas,
one Wolfman or Mummy (if your tastes run dry),=20
between two slices of Frankenstein, how about adding=20
the gorgonzola Godzilla, for a run amuck=20
blue cheese experience

Then there are sandwiches made for luck, these we devour=20
and share in unlikely places, often with complete strangers,=20
these have even stranger ingredients, like the Casino Slot Sub=20
you can pull on it all day and never feel full,=20
or the Throwers Snake Eye Special,  made on Pita=20
with a filling of sevens and elevens, but nothing beats=20
the Royal Straight Flush Deluxe topped with melted=20
any colors any suite fuck you I win Monterey Jack=20

There are science sandwiches, thick and wondrous stuff
served up laser light and electric hot on fine wood tables,=20
the waiters wear white, the customers are polite,=20
they never order but reason,  eating vast universes of thought on pumpernic=
kel with polite, small bites, lost in contemplation,=20
they ignore the occasional spill that spoils the tie,=20
how about trying the quantum physics club, it=92s special, sliced really th=
in between the thick rye theories of relativity, good old fashioned German =
rye, it=92s guaranteed to blow your mind, or at least,=20
a small corner of the universe

There are war sandwiches, everyone agrees=20
we should not have these,=20
but they are always on the menu and available everywhere,
=93 Hey Joe, give me a Civil War, toast it if you will=94
=93Do you want that on American, Russian or Rye?=94=20
or how about the new Afro Cuban Special,=20
coming to a deli near you soon
There are the small sandwiches, we make from the cold cuts of chance,=20=20
leaps of true faith, on whole wheat, we take these in desperation=20
and eat them with mustards of loneliness,=20
these we secretly admire like sleek boots in a shop window,=20
but seldom do we dare to eat these ourselves,=20
we leave these for others to taste, vicariously taking in the aroma=20
of their bread, , on the occasion we do taste, we feel special, Princes or =
at least, swashbuckling pirates, ready to duel to the death,=20
ready to challenge the dull routine of ham and cheese on rye,=20
it excites us, it gives us life, like the night=20
you decide to grab your balls in hand and pass two semis in a row,=20=20
it feels like we=92re in control, the matador=92s tip toe mincing bites,=20
when he=92d rather gulp, as he eats=20
a slice of space between the bull and the cape
=20=20=20
How about sex sandwiches? we could do a lot with that
think of the variety of breads that would be used=20
(pumping pumpernickel, hmm, comes to mind)
and what of the spreads made of legs, and pubes and creams,=20
the munching sounds of moans and mounds, the groans and bones=20
(both jumped and jutting in a circus of impossible angles),=20
how about the meats, think breasts, butts and balls for sure
all served up, piping pee hot

And for your ultimate dining pleasure, consider the City Sandwich
served up big with neon lights and a skyscraper horizon,=20
think of thick juicy street size quarter pounder slices,=20
of your favorite block or avenue, plunked down=20
on a crisp bed of green lettuce parks, all slathered over=20
and topped with your choice of ethnic neighborhood mayo,=20
served hot, on a special multicultural sesame bun,=20=20
you even get your choice of special sauce,=20
try the NY Chinatown or the Chicago Polish Windy West
hey, no vacant lots in this  sandwich, baby

When my turn finally comes, when I make it all the way up=20
to the counter from the back of the line,=20
make mine one slice painless death=20
between two rebirths,=20
got to go now, lunch is almost over.

I watched the segment.  There were three Palestinian poets, all  men.  The
first two seemed rich, or at least comfortably & beautifully  well-set in
woodworked & terraced houses, which countered images we usually  see only of
war-torn housing.  Sami Al-Qasim (Ibis) has been to jail -- for  writing poetry (?)
-- he is probably the best poet (forgive me for thinking  this) and his reasons
for being a poet the most eloquent.  He said that he  wants to write love
poetry, that it is in him to do that, but that w/o the  freedom of survival, he
would continue along liberation lines.  The second  poet writes more safely,
one could tell; he is rooted in the small & in  beauty, the way western poets
tend to be, but in a different setting and also  serving as a journalist.  Taha
Muhammad Ali was the most approachable of  the three poets and seemingly the
poorest, doubling as a market-keeper and  poet.  He sells relics to Christians
in a Muslim neighborhood.  His  titles have humor:  "So What" and "Never
Mind."  He asserted that when  he writes, the countries are not present in the
poems.

Dear Friends and Neighbors,
New Dance Alliance presents my new 10minute solo, Yellin/gg/ravy, as pa=
rt
of Performance Mix Festival 2007. Bruce Andrews will be joining me on t=
ext
and sound assistance on music I selected.
Tuesday March 27
Joyce SoHo 155 Mercer Street (Houston), NYC
Pre-Performance Videos at 7:30 PM, Performances at 8:00 PM
$15 Admission
See www.el.net/nda for=A0 full festival schedule
Make your reservations now, before performances sell out! 212-334-7479
Reception with food and drink after.

My bill includes artists Nichole Canuso Dance Company, MOB Productions,=

Frederick Gravel, & Morgon Thorson.=A0 I'm fourth on the program.

Yellin/gg/ravy is the first draft of what will become a group work look=
ing
at race through the critical study of whiteness.

It often seems that race only refers to those who are not white.=A0 Can=
 I
make visible what is rendered invisible since it is considered the
normative state of existence: the (white) point in space from which we =
tend
to identify difference? I'm personalizing this question initially by a
first take in which I conjure an Appalachian white person as influenced=
 by
both black and white cultures.
Join us if you can!

in April at Diapason Sound Gallery with Bruce, composer/pianist Michael=

l be
performing in Yvonne Rainer's new work in the Performa Festival in NYC.=
 I
hope to make a larger group work of my own in 2008.

Subject:      March 31 deadline - Political Poems
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In March 2007, Wave Books (http://www.wavepoetry.com)
will consider poems for an anthology of political
poems to be published in the Fall of 2008.

Specifically, we're looking for poems that engage with
our current political climate.  We're interested in a
broad definition of a political poem and in expanding
the conversation about what a "political poem" can be
and do. So we're not limiting this to poems discussing
specific political issues, though those are welcome.
If you think it's political, send it to us.

***Guidelines***
Please send a cover letter and up to three poems, on
8.5 x 11 paper, printed on one side only.

In the cover letter, please include your name,
address, telephone, and e-mail, acknowledgments for
any of the poems which may be previously published, a
biographical note and a list of previous publications.


Also include a self-addressed, stamped, business-size
envelope for our response. Poems will not be returned;
submissions will be recycled after responses have been
made.

Submissions must be postmarked in March. We cannot
accept submissions at any other time.

At this time we are not able to consider submissions
of book-length manuscripts.

Mail your submission to:
The Editors
Wave Books
116 Pleasant Street, Suite 205
Easthampton, MA 01027

***Answers to Frequently Asked Questions***

Simultaneous submissions and previously published
poems are acceptable and encouraged. Please feel free
to submit the poems elsewhere while we are considering
them for the anthology.

We can't accept alterations or revisions of a
submission while it is under consideration. It's not
necessary to let us know if the poem is accepted by a
magazine or will appear in a book-length work before
we get back to you.

Please allow three to six months for a response; all
submissions are read by the Wave Books staff. We
cannot answer inquiries about the status of a
submission under consideration.

We will notify poets whose poems are chosen to appear
in the anthology; it's not possible for us to comment
on poems that didn't fit this particular project.

Ann,

Thank you. I had attended a reading by Taha Muhammad Ali about three years
ago, when his book had come out. He and Peter Cole were traveling together
in The States. Peter's translations had given a conversational feel to his
poetry. I do not remember him being particularly poor. Did he not live in
Nazareth?

I have read Sadder than Water. I think it is Sami Al Kassim's book. There
were wonderful poems in it, but I was not crazy about the long major piece
in it, with a title I can not recall at the moment. For me it had too much
the feel of a "major poem." It did not quite work for me. Of course, the
Palestinian suffering being the subject of the poem, my aesthetic response
to the poem may be irrelevant.

Thank you again for the report.

Ciao,

Murat

Subject:      Philip Terry's Oulipoems Available from Ahadada Books
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

"The title of Philip Terry's brilliant book pays explicit homage to the
Oulipo; but while he uses many of the group's methods, he invariably
goes his own way with them, making poems that are full of an original
sense of wit and wonder. He has taken the notion that poetry can emerge
from arbitrary procedures and transformed it into a sumptuous variety of
explosively novel delights."

        &#8212;Harry Mathews

Philip Terry was born in Belfast in 1962 and has been working with
Oulipian and related writing practices for over twenty years. His
lipogrammatic novel The Book of Bachelors (1999), was highly praised by
the Oulipo: "Enormous rigour, great virtuosity&#8212;but that's the
least of it." Currently he is Director of Creative Writing at the
University of Essex, where he teaches a graduate course on the poetics
of constraint. His work has been published in Panurge, PN Review, Oasis,
North American Review, and Onedit, and his books include the celebrated
anthology of short stories Ovid Metamorphosed (2000) and Fables of Aesop
(2006). His translation of Raymond Queneau's last book of poems,
Elementary Morality, is forthcoming from Carcanet. Oulipoems is his
first book of poetry.

Hi Murat,

You can watch the segments on both the Palestinian and Israeli poets if you

Subject:      What she did! Susan Stein at SPT
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Susan Stein - poet and performance artist - created what might be called "a
presence" (rather than a 'reading' or 'performance')  to an audience of
primarily poets last night (Friday) at Small Press Traffic. The event was a
combination of 'off-putting', 'embracing' and 'thought provoking.'
As all SPT events, this one took place in the Timken Lecture Hall on the San
Francisco Campus of the California College of Arts - the home of SPT since -
in the opinion of many - its sad departure from the much more 'user
friendly' neighborhood of New College on Valencia, which included the
occasional use of a theater space with a much kinder ambience for both poets
and audience.
Indeed, one of Susan's unfolding objectives came to deal with the
architectural limits of Timken Hall - a dark space (unless its full) that
sucks the energy out of both audience and whoever might be the poet who is
reading.  Listeners, poets and whatever language goes into the air of Timken
Hall have to work real hard to protect, hear and enjoy each other!  Indeed
the lecture hall must have been designed as an architectural afterthought
(Oh, yes, 'we should have a place for students to hear an occasional
lecture.")

But that's merely preface to circumstance. Susan did - what seems in
retrospect - a quite brave thing. Dressed in black, all the lighting was
turned off, the audience 'darkened', and one stage light was pointed at her
face. She announced she had 25 minutes, and that she would take questions.
Other than that, she gave no sense of agenda, objective or whatever.
The questions began to come forth. I should say it was an audience of poets
most of whom had some kind of association with Susan, from distant to
familiar. The questions from pedestrian to more complex - each one of which
she considered carefully or even admitted that she was unable to answer.
Some were predictable, "Are you working on a poem now," many forgettable.
Nobody asked anything stupidly personal. Yet, as things evolved - what was
most interesting to me anyway - were issues around how she was experiencing
the space and how other poets may or may not have been able to establish a
sense of presence in this particular space (which it was agreed between her
and us to be an historic problem). X poet with equipment was able to make it
work, and, by implication not poet a, b, or c.) Sporadically through the 25
minutes, persons would ask what she was feeling at the moment to which she
sometimes addressed as a sense of 'vulnerability'  - being exposed as such.
I asked what was the difference between 'vulnerability' and 'intimacy' - a
question, like each one, she honored as such, but questioned. But having a
'good answer' - one that would excite the audience did not seem to be the
objective in any case.

As a person in the audience, I felt back and forth 'impatient' and then
intrigued with a response here or there, or a particular question. Only
gradually - and this is the brave part - did it become clear what she was
doing, or so it seemed to me. What we witnessed was 'presence' in which the
the whole scaffolding normally implicit to a reading or performance was
stripped bare. As much as we in the audience waited for or called out
questions that might provoke a desired response, a 'stream called poetry',
(a narrative, an image, an epiphany!! anything!) nothing of the sort was
forthcoming beyond Susan's analysis of her ability to answer the question.
Her tone was neither judgmental or dismissive.

It was in that 'frustration' (no poetic goods) to 'hear something' that I
gradually (after) came to realize what Susan was stripping the architecture
off the condition/expectations/rhetoric of readings, performances, and - in
the darkness - the normal architecture of this most often dreadful space.
Maybe, thinking more about it, Susan's presence was a Barthian version of
'performing' instead of 'writing degree zero.  Ironically her "presence" had
an insistence to it, one in which, in its baldness, we were taken to a point
that precedes every conceivable apparatus of poem, performance and space.

Where one goes from there - particularly in Timken Hall - I am not about to
speculate. But it was timely, and, the day after, as I suggested, it seems
quite brave, as well as unique to my experience of poets and audiences in
shared spaces.

No doubt, and hopefully others who were there, will put their 'take' in
here.

In re Stephen Vincent's complaints on today's Poetics List about Timken Hall
and his nostalgia for SPT's days at New College on Valencia, I share many of
these feelings. However I would like to point out to one and all that this
move was a decision made by SPT's dedicated board in hopes of ensuring SPT's
future (a decision made just prior to my taking the ED job at SPT) and I can
tell you as the person who has done 95% of SPT's fundraising over the last 7
years, without being housed at CCA I am not sure we'd be where we are
(indeed how we'd exist if we had to pay rent in SF) and we certainly
wouldn't be in the position to pay poets as well as we do, as an autonomous
community organization. To clarify in case there is misunderstanding, as I
know there is, we are HOUSED at CCA but besides that are autonomous, both in
terms of programming and funding said programming. Donations from our
community are always helpful, appreciated, and tax-deductible. Am I wrong to
assume we all appreciate a little poetry infrastructure that actually can
pay poets a smidge and is not entirely tied to academia? If not, my job is
truly thankless.
Best regards,
Elizabeth

Thank you for your description of this event. Any attempt to get at what
people are really experiencing at a poetry reading (or any event for that
matter...) seems like an excellent idea to me.

Wish I had been there.

Murat,

The "long major piece" you may be referring to is the book's title poem
"Sadder than Water" (2001) by Samih al-Qasim. There is also another long
poem in the collection, though much shorter, titled "The Tragedy of Houdini
the Miraculous" (1984).

This Ibis Edition book, like some others, is very nicely done with modest
elegance. It fits nicely in the hands at 5x7. This is opposed to the Taha
Muhammed book is large, glossy, and has a close up photo on the cover. Yes,
he is a shopkeeper according to the blurb. Yes, al-Qasim has been jailed for
writing poetry. The books are dual language with facing page translations.

Nazih Kassis is the translator of *Sadder than Water - New & Selected
Poems*. Adina Hoffman introduces the collection.

I want to thank you Stephen for this report - for my vicarious
culture-fix - but also for raising this issue of the lack of "fit"=20
between poetry & dominant institutions, as Robert Kocik might call it.=20
It's interesting to hear of a Suzanne Stein's attempt to deal with
architectural issues, and to see, via Elizabeth's post, that these
issues derive from environing economic conditions. I've often felt that
poetry doesn't "fit" our public spaces because of the lack of foresight
to include poets since...  Plato. So it works in the interstices - in
churches, museums, cafes, bars, etc. And this brings me to remembering
working with Robert Kocik a few years ago to design a potential poetry
reading space - it was a great experience: he encouraged me to let my
imagination run wild: what shape would the space be? How would it
accommodate various needs? What other "services" would be offered along
with poetry? Space *for* poetry is what Robert calls a "missing social
service" indeed!=20

Subject: What she did! Susan Stein at SPT

Susan Stein - poet and performance artist - created what might be called
"a
presence" (rather than a 'reading' or 'performance')  to an audience of
primarily poets last night (Friday) at Small Press Traffic. The event
was a
combination of 'off-putting', 'embracing' and 'thought provoking.'
As all SPT events, this one took place in the Timken Lecture Hall on the
San
Francisco Campus of the California College of Arts - the home of SPT
since -
in the opinion of many - its sad departure from the much more 'user
friendly' neighborhood of New College on Valencia, which included the
occasional use of a theater space with a much kinder ambience for both
poets
and audience.=20
Indeed, one of Susan's unfolding objectives came to deal with the
architectural limits of Timken Hall - a dark space (unless its full)
that
sucks the energy out of both audience and whoever might be the poet who
is
reading.  Listeners, poets and whatever language goes into the air of
Timken
Hall have to work real hard to protect, hear and enjoy each other!
Indeed
the lecture hall must have been designed as an architectural
afterthought
(Oh, yes, 'we should have a place for students to hear an occasional
lecture.")=20

But that's merely preface to circumstance. Susan did - what seems in
retrospect - a quite brave thing. Dressed in black, all the lighting was
turned off, the audience 'darkened', and one stage light was pointed at
her
face. She announced she had 25 minutes, and that she would take
questions.
Other than that, she gave no sense of agenda, objective or whatever.
The questions began to come forth. I should say it was an audience of
poets
most of whom had some kind of association with Susan, from distant to
familiar. The questions from pedestrian to more complex - each one of
which
she considered carefully or even admitted that she was unable to answer.
Some were predictable, "Are you working on a poem now," many
forgettable.
Nobody asked anything stupidly personal. Yet, as things evolved - what
was
most interesting to me anyway - were issues around how she was
experiencing
the space and how other poets may or may not have been able to establish
a
sense of presence in this particular space (which it was agreed between
her
and us to be an historic problem). X poet with equipment was able to
make it
work, and, by implication not poet a, b, or c.) Sporadically through the
25
minutes, persons would ask what she was feeling at the moment to which
she
sometimes addressed as a sense of 'vulnerability'  - being exposed as
such.
I asked what was the difference between 'vulnerability' and 'intimacy' -
a
question, like each one, she honored as such, but questioned. But having
a
'good answer' - one that would excite the audience did not seem to be
the
objective in any case.

As a person in the audience, I felt back and forth 'impatient' and then
intrigued with a response here or there, or a particular question. Only
gradually - and this is the brave part - did it become clear what she
was
doing, or so it seemed to me. What we witnessed was 'presence' in which
the
the whole scaffolding normally implicit to a reading or performance was
stripped bare. As much as we in the audience waited for or called out
questions that might provoke a desired response, a 'stream called
poetry',
(a narrative, an image, an epiphany!! anything!) nothing of the sort was
forthcoming beyond Susan's analysis of her ability to answer the
question.
Her tone was neither judgmental or dismissive.

It was in that 'frustration' (no poetic goods) to 'hear something' that
I
gradually (after) came to realize what Susan was stripping the
architecture
off the condition/expectations/rhetoric of readings, performances, and -
in
the darkness - the normal architecture of this most often dreadful
space.
Maybe, thinking more about it, Susan's presence was a Barthian version
of
'performing' instead of 'writing degree zero.  Ironically her "presence"
had
an insistence to it, one in which, in its baldness, we were taken to a
point
that precedes every conceivable apparatus of poem, performance and
space.

Where one goes from there - particularly in Timken Hall - I am not about
to
speculate. But it was timely, and, the day after, as I suggested, it
seems
quite brave, as well as unique to my experience of poets and audiences
in
shared spaces.

No doubt, and hopefully others who were there, will put their 'take' in
here.=20

Today in my little city we had a poetry reading at one of the local coffee shops. Usually it is difficult to even get people to go to a poetry reading. In this case, a instructor colleague and I decided to have this for her literature students. We had no idea where we would read in the coffee shop, but figured that it wouldn't be much of a problem--accomodating us, and the owner knew we were going to do this. It was a busy afternoon, and so we were packed in tightly in the back, close to the bathroom. We had enough people there to have an audience-very unusual for this type of event. I was uncomfortable because it was just too informal and too close. Oh, I guess there were other things going on, like not enough people willing to read...everytime I have tried to make this happen, I have always had a general feeling of discomfort. Somehow, even though we weren't "professionals," the space did affect the performance. I was told that it was a "good beginning," but I would like
 to find a space that does fit..maybe it would work out better.

It's interesting to hear of a Suzanne Stein's attempt to deal with
architectural issues, and to see, via Elizabeth's post, that these
issues derive from environing economic conditions. I've often felt that
poetry doesn't "fit" our public spaces because of the lack of foresight
to include poets since... Plato. So it works in the interstices - in
churches, museums, cafes, bars, etc. And this brings me to remembering
working with Robert Kocik a few years ago to design a potential poetry
reading space - it was a great experience: he encouraged me to let my
imagination run wild: what shape would the space be? How would it
accommodate various needs? What other "services" would be offered along
with poetry? Space *for* poetry is what Robert calls a "missing social
service" indeed!

Subject: What she did! Susan Stein at SPT

Susan Stein - poet and performance artist - created what might be called
"a
presence" (rather than a 'reading' or 'performance') to an audience of
primarily poets last night (Friday) at Small Press Traffic. The event
was a
combination of 'off-putting', 'embracing' and 'thought provoking.'
As all SPT events, this one took place in the Timken Lecture Hall on the
San
Francisco Campus of the California College of Arts - the home of SPT
since -
in the opinion of many - its sad departure from the much more 'user
friendly' neighborhood of New College on Valencia, which included the
occasional use of a theater space with a much kinder ambience for both
poets
and audience.
Indeed, one of Susan's unfolding objectives came to deal with the
architectural limits of Timken Hall - a dark space (unless its full)
that
sucks the energy out of both audience and whoever might be the poet who
is
reading. Listeners, poets and whatever language goes into the air of
Timken
Hall have to work real hard to protect, hear and enjoy each other!
Indeed
the lecture hall must have been designed as an architectural
afterthought
(Oh, yes, 'we should have a place for students to hear an occasional
lecture.")

But that's merely preface to circumstance. Susan did - what seems in
retrospect - a quite brave thing. Dressed in black, all the lighting was
turned off, the audience 'darkened', and one stage light was pointed at
her
face. She announced she had 25 minutes, and that she would take
questions.
Other than that, she gave no sense of agenda, objective or whatever.
The questions began to come forth. I should say it was an audience of
poets
most of whom had some kind of association with Susan, from distant to
familiar. The questions from pedestrian to more complex - each one of
which
she considered carefully or even admitted that she was unable to answer.
Some were predictable, "Are you working on a poem now," many
forgettable.
Nobody asked anything stupidly personal. Yet, as things evolved - what
was
most interesting to me anyway - were issues around how she was
experiencing
the space and how other poets may or may not have been able to establish
a
sense of presence in this particular space (which it was agreed between
her
and us to be an historic problem). X poet with equipment was able to
make it
work, and, by implication not poet a, b, or c.) Sporadically through the
25
minutes, persons would ask what she was feeling at the moment to which
she
sometimes addressed as a sense of 'vulnerability' - being exposed as
such.
I asked what was the difference between 'vulnerability' and 'intimacy' -
a
question, like each one, she honored as such, but questioned. But having
a
'good answer' - one that would excite the audience did not seem to be
the
objective in any case.

As a person in the audience, I felt back and forth 'impatient' and then
intrigued with a response here or there, or a particular question. Only
gradually - and this is the brave part - did it become clear what she
was
doing, or so it seemed to me. What we witnessed was 'presence' in which
the
the whole scaffolding normally implicit to a reading or performance was
stripped bare. As much as we in the audience waited for or called out
questions that might provoke a desired response, a 'stream called
poetry',
(a narrative, an image, an epiphany!! anything!) nothing of the sort was
forthcoming beyond Susan's analysis of her ability to answer the
question.
Her tone was neither judgmental or dismissive.

It was in that 'frustration' (no poetic goods) to 'hear something' that
I
gradually (after) came to realize what Susan was stripping the
architecture
off the condition/expectations/rhetoric of readings, performances, and -
in
the darkness - the normal architecture of this most often dreadful
space.
Maybe, thinking more about it, Susan's presence was a Barthian version
of
'performing' instead of 'writing degree zero. Ironically her "presence"
had
an insistence to it, one in which, in its baldness, we were taken to a
point
that precedes every conceivable apparatus of poem, performance and
space.

Where one goes from there - particularly in Timken Hall - I am not about
to
speculate. But it was timely, and, the day after, as I suggested, it
seems
quite brave, as well as unique to my experience of poets and audiences
in
shared spaces.

No doubt, and hopefully others who were there, will put their 'take' in
here.

Subject: Re: What she did! Suzanne Stein at SPT

In re Stephen Vincent's complaints on today's Poetics List about Timken
Hall
and his nostalgia for SPT's days at New College on Valencia, I share
many of
these feelings. However I would like to point out to one and all that
this
move was a decision made by SPT's dedicated board in hopes of ensuring
SPT's
future (a decision made just prior to my taking the ED job at SPT) and I
can
tell you as the person who has done 95% of SPT's fundraising over the
last 7
years, without being housed at CCA I am not sure we'd be where we are
(indeed how we'd exist if we had to pay rent in SF) and we certainly
wouldn't be in the position to pay poets as well as we do, as an
autonomous
community organization. To clarify in case there is misunderstanding, as
I
know there is, we are HOUSED at CCA but besides that are autonomous,
both in
terms of programming and funding said programming. Donations from our
community are always helpful, appreciated, and tax-deductible. Am I
wrong to
assume we all appreciate a little poetry infrastructure that actually
can
pay poets a smidge and is not entirely tied to academia? If not, my job
is
truly thankless.

Elizabeth

Personally, I feel lucky to have witnessed two great in-person screenings
each by Hollis Frampton & Paul Sharits, both of whom had poetic connections
(Frampton referred to Pound as his "master" and Sharits collaborated with
David Franks).  I used to talk with Robert Creeley about both of them.
And a viewing of Tony Conrad's "Flicker" in a small screening room at the
Pacific Film Archive, even if not presented by the filmmaker himself, had to
have been one of the most "intense" aesthetic experiences of my life.
There's a catalogue forthcoming for this apparently exemplary exhibit of a
context in which these filmmakers existed (still exist):

Poets,

I have been happy--elated even--to see the News Hour's coverage of Israeli and Palestinian poetry, and Jeffrey Brown's interviews of them, not least because I am teaching a course on Palestinian and Israeli lits, with a particular focus on poetry.  For all the recent critiques of the Poetry Foundation (Dana Goodyear in TNY, Steve Evans in the Baffler), they deserve credit for funding this project.  Brown chose Israeli poets like Aharon Shabtai and Palestinian poets like Taha Muhammad Ali (both, no doubt, with glossy translated books in the U.S.) enables a representation of, on the one hand, Israeli intellectual resistance (Shabtai) to the AIPAC/"security" framing of the conflict (i.e. that those Arab terrorists are the cause for the conflict, not dispossession, occupation, land-grabbing, the wall, etc.), and on the other, the humane resistance of the everyday Palestinian (Ali).  There is no doubt that Brown probably should have chosen at least one Palestinian woman poet--I pr
o!
bably would have chosen Fadwa Tuqan--and it seems amazing that there is no Mahmoud Darwish.  Too bad Amichai is not alive.  He and Darwish are like twins separated at birth and by nation.

I like parts of this very much.  Certainly, if it is a first effort, it is very surprising.  But it needs editing, I suspect.  I found my mind wandering after the first several parts of it.  Still, whoever wrote this should be encouraged to write more.  Regards, Tom Savage

Sandwiches
(from the fever desk of a mad mind)

There are sandwiches that stave off disaster
like a slice of Our Father between two Hail Mary’s

And then there are midnight sandwiches
that give you the creeps, or at the least gas,
one Wolfman or Mummy (if your tastes run dry),
between two slices of Frankenstein, how about adding
the gorgonzola Godzilla, for a run amuck
blue cheese experience

Then there are sandwiches made for luck, these we devour
and share in unlikely places, often with complete strangers,
these have even stranger ingredients, like the Casino Slot Sub
you can pull on it all day and never feel full,
or the Throwers Snake Eye Special, made on Pita
with a filling of sevens and elevens, but nothing beats
the Royal Straight Flush Deluxe topped with melted
any colors any suite fuck you I win Monterey Jack

There are science sandwiches, thick and wondrous stuff
served up laser light and electric hot on fine wood tables,
the waiters wear white, the customers are polite,
they never order but reason, eating vast universes of thought on pumpernickel with polite, small bites, lost in contemplation,
they ignore the occasional spill that spoils the tie,
how about trying the quantum physics club, it’s special, sliced really thin between the thick rye theories of relativity, good old fashioned German rye, it’s guaranteed to blow your mind, or at least,
a small corner of the universe

There are war sandwiches, everyone agrees
we should not have these,
but they are always on the menu and available everywhere,
“ Hey Joe, give me a Civil War, toast it if you will”
“Do you want that on American, Russian or Rye?”
or how about the new Afro Cuban Special,
coming to a deli near you soon
There are the small sandwiches, we make from the cold cuts of chance,
leaps of true faith, on whole wheat, we take these in desperation
and eat them with mustards of loneliness,
these we secretly admire like sleek boots in a shop window,
but seldom do we dare to eat these ourselves,
we leave these for others to taste, vicariously taking in the aroma
of their bread, , on the occasion we do taste, we feel special, Princes or at least, swashbuckling pirates, ready to duel to the death,
ready to challenge the dull routine of ham and cheese on rye,
it excites us, it gives us life, like the night
you decide to grab your balls in hand and pass two semis in a row,
it feels like we’re in control, the matador’s tip toe mincing bites,
when he’d rather gulp, as he eats
a slice of space between the bull and the cape

How about sex sandwiches? we could do a lot with that
think of the variety of breads that would be used
(pumping pumpernickel, hmm, comes to mind)
and what of the spreads made of legs, and pubes and creams,
the munching sounds of moans and mounds, the groans and bones
(both jumped and jutting in a circus of impossible angles),
how about the meats, think breasts, butts and balls for sure
all served up, piping pee hot

And for your ultimate dining pleasure, consider the City Sandwich
served up big with neon lights and a skyscraper horizon,
think of thick juicy street size quarter pounder slices,
of your favorite block or avenue, plunked down
on a crisp bed of green lettuce parks, all slathered over
and topped with your choice of ethnic neighborhood mayo,
served hot, on a special multicultural sesame bun,
you even get your choice of special sauce,
try the NY Chinatown or the Chicago Polish Windy West
hey, no vacant lots in this sandwich, baby

When my turn finally comes, when I make it all the way up
to the counter from the back of the line,
make mine one slice painless death
between two rebirths,
got to go now, lunch is almost over.

Has anyone seen or read this book THE SECRET?  It's sort of
a condensed version of many different documents and teachings
shit directly from the bowels of New Age Hell.

This book has a Ring Around the Rosie quality (literally, meaning
to ward off pestilence).  While it claims ancient teachings of
certain magic practices known as glamouring, etc., though it
doesn't call it as such, it's built around the purpose of attracting
and holding onto STUFF, in particular wealth, in particular, a life
you've ALWAYS DREAMT WAS POSSIBLE.

When I lived in Albuquerque for a brief time to study herbalism
I was confronted nearly every single day, no matter where I
found myself, with wealthy people who had one spiritual excuse
after another for their wealth, and for deserving it, and for the
need to maintain a life of luxury.  It's not a new story of course.

Greed has no news to tell.  But LET ME SAY THIS to the
readers of THE SECRET.  If we are to implement and LIVE
forward (?) with the document, and set it into motion, we are
not only saying that it's up to us to attract these things into
our lives, but to say to those less fortunate (in my opinion) that
they simply aren't trying hard enough.  It's kind of like a game
of BLAME THE VICTIM!  "Oh those poor bastards in Baghdad
just aren't TRYING HARD enough!  Send them a box of
THE SECRET so they can all learn how THEY DESERVE to
have their houses bombed and their children murdered
for not USING THEIR dream life to bring happiness.  Happy-
happy, bring happy-happy.  Silly dumb people getting
bombed, what's the matter with them!?"

It's no secret why Oprah Winfrey took to THE SECRET.
Like all rich people she wants to feel AT PEACE with her
extraordinary wealth while a web of suffering continues
to spider its way across the planet.

I despise such crap!  It's times like the late America we
all live in that help me FULLY UNDERSTAND the olden
days of marching to the castle gates with torches
and pitchforks.

This is just a note to recommend the current issue of ATLANTA REVIEW, which is a a special one on the poetry ot Iraq.  This is the only collection of contemporary Iraqi poetry to cover the years since the American invasion.  The poems were collected and translated under conditions of great risk and hardship by poets living in Baghdad itself.   I highly recommend this to all wompos.

I'm having the same debate with my peers (in Graduate School for Pete's sak=
e!) about Nietzsche. "Why does Nietzsche feel that it's necessary to undo w=
hat came before? Isn't it just easier to leave everything in place, like it=
 is? It's totally impossible to destroy "the scaffolding", as Nietzsche say=
s; why don't we just suck it up and get on with our lives?" In the context =
of "The Secret", this "blame the victim" thing is akin to undoing what came=
 before us; it's not only about safety in what already exists, but in the r=
efusal to choose our own metaphors. Of course, my peers don't understand th=
e idea that a power structure (without our best interests)put these metapho=
rs into play for their own benefit. But what about my peers' complicity?=20

This is the kind of thing we all must have met with at some time or another=
 regarding our poetries. Why fix something (poetry) when it's so great! Loo=
k at the Goddamn top 100 list, for Pete's sake! Some people need to be toug=
ht why we do poetry. It's not about complicity, nor even about reaction...

I wasn't at the event, but Suzanne and I have had very intense long
talks once upon a time,
and I always felt a sense of solidarity. I also feel Treadwell's
point, and don't feel it's totally fair
to single out the SPT as what Suzanne was dealing with. My guess it
was something broader,
like the institution of 'proper' poetry readings and what that does
to writing, communities, friendships, etc
(but, I don't want to speak for Suzanne there, that's probably more
my issue, but I do think there's some solidarity)

PS--I have a feeling my message isn't getting sent to poetics list as
I'm transitioning to another email account
(i still receive on earthlink, but can't respond through them
regularly anymore, and will leave,
So please make note of my new email).

I don't think there was anything in my piece that singled out Elizabeth
Treadwell as being responsible for the frequently noted shortcomings of
Timken Hall!  The limits did emerge during Suzanne Stein's piece as various
questions were asked about her sense of her presence in the space. In fact,
what she was doing, had much larger intentions than being an architectural
critique. I hope my 'review' got at those intentions.

But, if one wants to just focus on Timken Hall as space, I think Linda Russo
is right. Non-profits of all sorts frequently float into places that are not
at the top of 'performance' or 'office' food chain. Indeed non-profits
(unless their bogey prop orgs for wealthy right wingers) maybe, by
definition, follow the money to the short, not rich end of the stick!

In my opinion, the beauty of poets and poetry readings - one series or
another - is to morph and variously adapt to the given conditions where the
combination of poets, the poems and the audience give a powerful shape to a
place or time. (I have seen poets give good and memorable readings off the
limbs of trees~) Some places are clearly legendary - in San Francisco the
Grand Piano (a coffee shop in the Haight) was one, but there have been many
others.  It's all part of risk, funk and charm of being on the margins. I am
sure we can all name places to which we would never go back.

It's when things go institutional and permanent that a series can get into a
weird stasis.  The physical and neighborhood circumstances of SPT at New
College auditorium  (as well as the writing happening during that period -
nineties) gave the place and readings a real juice.  SPT at Timken Hall at
CAA - no matter the liveliness of the poetry scene - has been an argument
from the start. The only thing that saves it is the loyalty of the audience
and good poets willing to rise above its gross darkness, as well as submit
to the isolation of the neighborhood.

Suzanne was another example of someone took Timken Hall on as
space/condition with a good audience and beat the odds in a provocative and
interesting way. But again, the piece was not about Timken Hall, but
something much more 'serious.'  Timken Hall was a prop!

Subject:      What she did! Suzanne Stein at SPT
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

    The conversation about Suzanne Stein’s performance caught my eye, as someone who knows Suzanne, attends many SPT events, and runs a reading series of my own.  Unfortunately, I was not able to be at last Friday’s performance but have heard favorable reviews from others in the community.  However my entrance into this subject then has more to do with “space” rather than Suzanne’s actual performance.
    It is no secret that CCA’s Timkin Hall is not the ideal space for intimate readings or performances due to its inferior architectural design.  It is dark, the stage lights are fixed & badly placed, and the acoustics are not the best, especially when the performer must compete with noise from the industrial shop above the hall.  Ironically, I believe it is the lecture hall for CCA’s architecture classes.  In any case, those are its faults.  However, it is a space, as Elizabeth has mentioned, that is open for SPT’s use, and that use is free from conditions as to the content of SPT’s programming as well as rent.  And that is no small thing.
    As most people are aware, space in the Bay Area (as well as many other places around the country) has become a rarity since the tech boom which more than doubled rents overnight (at least mine) and brought on the closures of many art spaces, studios, and lofts for more lucrative customers.  Unfortunately, institutional spaces have not necessarily opened their doors to already under-funded arts groups and organizations, and though galleries, coffee shops, bars, etc. sound like a nice alternative, they come with their own problems.  Of course this problem affects all art forms, but I am just going to be selfish & talk about writers here.
        Galleries & other closed spaces are great alternatives to loud cafes & bars; however, they are rarely free and sometimes carry with them aesthetic demands which can affect the actual programming.  Even if this only goes as far as “Hey, my cousin is a poet, I’d really love if he could read one of these days,” it’s a curator’s nightmare.  Of course, there are exceptions like the New Yipes Reading Series run by David Larsen at 21 Grand here in Oakland, though I believe they pay rent to the gallery in order to have their monthly Sunday readings.  There also used to be the Performance Writing Series at New Langton Arts run by Jocelyn Saidenberg and Brandon Brown, but that suddenly disappeared very recently.  Perhaps someone who knows a bit about that will jump in here…

This brings me to my experience with running the Artifact Reading Series, which Chana Morgenstern & I started in our victorian apartment in the Mission in November 2004.  That apartment had at one time been an artist collective.  It had a huge space that would hold lots of people fairly comfortably.  However, we lived with a bunch of musicians (all guys) who refused to clean & used the space as storage for their equipment (& anything else you can think of).  So we moved out to a very small 2 bedroom apartment just a few blocks away and continued having the readings there.  Thankfully, it had a long hallway & a back porch going out to a backyard, because a good deal of the time, there are people standing on the stairs listening through the back window while another group camps out in the hallway.  For a long time, we did not charge anything, but now ask for a $5 donation to give to the readers & to pay for drinks & snacks.  Even at the most packed (80-100 people) readings,
 I’ve never completely paid myself back for everything I’ve bought, & the readers have never gotten more than $25 a piece.
    The house reading seems to work for many reasons.  It’s a closed, intimate space.  The audience consists of nearly all writers who are attentive and engaged.  The space is small and therefore feels casual—I mean, generally, the reader is not further than 2 feet from an audience member.  I think there’s a strong sense of community that is pervasive.  Most of the time, I know most of the audience.  However, there have been times when I’ve known almost no one, which is a very strange experience.  These moments, and the readings where there are just too many people for anyone to be comfortable have had me thinking about moving the series to a more public venue.  A year or so ago, I started asking people what they felt about a possible move and most objected, feeling that the series would lose its ambiance if it was moved.  I decided to hold off on moving it, however, last October, I moved to the East Bay, and this summer Chana will be leaving for Rhode Island to study at
 Brown.  So, here I am again, wondering where to move the series, how it will fare in the transition, what it will look like on the other side.  At this point, I have not a clue to the answers of these questions.
    There has been talk of a traveling Bay Area reading and performance series, though nothing has been set in motion, as far as I know.  In the meantime, there are salons, reading/study groups, lecture series, and so on happening in people’s houses which has been integral to the current Bay Area innovative writing community’s close-knitness.  However, a performance like the one that Suzanne Stein gave at SPT, not to mention the survival of Poets Theater (also at SPT), as well as the wonderful events that used to take place at the Performance Writing Series at New Langton aren’t really able to happen in a house-setting (at least not in my house).  There’s not enough space & it is too intimate.  For instance, as respectful as Artifact audiences are, it’s not uncommon for an audience member to speak to the reader.  This would not happen at SPT because the divide is too great.  And that is then another factor for a performer to work with, as it sounds like Suzanne did.  It’s
 unlikely that performance would have translated itself to another venue in quite the same way.  So, at the very least, though SPT isn’t an ideal space, it has created performances that wouldn’t happen in other local venues, which is interesting, isn’t it?
    At the last Artifact, Bob Gluck mentioned before he began reading that he was reminded of the first incarnation of SPT, which was in a victorian somewhere between Castro & Noe (I think?), where one had to go up a few flights of stairs to a crowded back room where no one was comfortable but all were very present with the reading.  It was interesting to hear that since I have generally heard about SPT’s life at New College but not previous.  It also reminds me that all of this only moves forward.  Not to say that nostalgia has no place, but one day, people will likely (if we’re lucky) say the same thing about Artifact.
    On that note, if anyone knows of a place that wants to host Artifact, that can handle about 60 + people, is accessible to public transport, lets people drink & hang out, and won’t interfere with my programming, (enjoys long walks on the beach, etc.), I’m all ears.
    Cheers,
  Melissa Benham

*Call for papers - LEA Dispersive Anatomies*
*-------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Leonardo Electronic Almanac (ISSN No: 1071-4391) is inviting papers =
and
artworks that address dispersion - dispersion of bodies, objects,
landscapes, networks, virtual and real worlds.

A fundamental shift in the way we view the world is underway: the
abandonment of discrete objects, and objecthood itself. The world is now
plural, and the distinction between real and virtual is becoming
increasingly blurred, with troubling consequences within the geopolitical
register. This shift is related to a cultural change that emphasizes =
digital
deconstruction over analog construction: a photograph for example can be
accessed and transformed, pixel by pixel, cities can be taken apart by
gerrymandering or eminent domain, and our social networks are replete with
names and images that problematize friendship, sexuality, and culture
itself. One issue that emerges here: Are we networking or are we networked?=

Are we networks ourselves?

LEA is interested in texts and works that deal with this fundamental shift
in new and illuminating ways. Specifically, anything from essays through
multimedia through networks themselves may be considered. We're particularl=
y
interested in submissions that deal with the incoherency of the world, and
how to address it.
*Key topics of interest
---------------------------------

*Topics of interest might include (but are not limited to):
- Networked warfare in real and virtual worlds.
- The wounded/altered body in real and virtual worlds.
- Transgressive sexualities across borders, sexualities among body-parts,
dismemberments and groups, both real and virtual.

- Critical texts on the transformation of classical narrative - from its
emphasis on an omniscient narrator and coherent plots/characters, to
literatures of incoherency, dispersed narrations, and the jump-cut
exigencies of everyday life.

- Deleuze/Guattari, TAZ, and other phenomena at the border of networking.
- Internet visions and their abandonment or fulfillment.
- The haunting of the world by ghosts, virtual beings, dreams and =
nightmares
that never resolve.

- The geopolitical collapse of geopolitics.
- Military empires as scattershot entrepreneurial corporations.

Dispersion has two vectors: the breakup or breakdown of coherent objects;
and the subsequent attempt to corral, curtail, or recuperate from this
breakdown. How do we deal with networks that are constantly coalescing and
disappearing? Where are we in the midst of this? In an era of pre-emptive
culture, is guerilla warfare to be accompanied by guerilla culture as the
order of the day?

Like the fabled NY School of old, Amy King's new *I'M THE MAN Who Loves You*
(Blaze/Vox) is unafraid of the everyday, pausing to notice and respond to
the presence of others and things, passing on the strained lyricism of soap
opera surrealism. I don't know if this work is really a manifestation of an
emerging school, but I did go to school immediately on its quick fencer's
wit and steady, yet verbally lucious focus on the realities, pleasures and
perplexities of ongoing experience. I can't help it, like Amy, I've fallen
in love with the real world of things and people. How can she have mastered
this so early, when for most, youth is wasted on the Jung and other inflated
idealisms. It's not only a pleasure, but an actual relief to see daily
moments become remarkable again without becoming either flaccid or
hysterical. Don't screech at me, don't preach at me and please pass the
breadsticks:

"I had been invisible, untrained disappearing off the grid
for some time, until you asked me to pass the breadsticks
in that split moment of schizo-panic. To give up
a technicolor coat is a brave tragedy with many layers;
we're drawn to any labyrinth, perfection at the center
of artistry..." (*HOW TO GET THERE*)

But this poetry definitively is not about corny, not-so-new age glommy
affirmations either. No interest in

"Accordion adventures they're the best instrument
to windbag, to bleat, to push air through daisies
for an alphabet's sake. Androgyny and honesty
ought to play frozen roses on apocalyptic landscapes,
the landscape of Amy King's face fused
with artifical intelligence on which hers lies
infinitely predictable. Blindfolded books could do worse
than the diction of bedtime verse"

So much for stretched out poetry gimmicks and ceaseless and shameless
self-promotion.  If we're going to be childish, at least lets attempt be a
little like actual children. That's cool.  So, what *are* you interested in,
Amy?

"...but
lately I'm craving minimum cravings, dusty old records
that smell like a wood-paneled basement,
posters of Elvis on velvet, and the evolution
of ethnic foods on the Lower East Side.
We've gone from Indian to Choctaw.
Eccentric is out." (*MINIATURE DISASTERS*)

I get a whiff of Kim Lyons here,  and a dash of Sharon Mesmer there, with a
sprinkle of Nada Gordon : maybe that's where I got the Brooklyn School idea,
though I'm not claiming literal influences,
there's Kim's: "Who doesn't hear Robert Johnson
at this place
near King's Highway" (*Saline*)
or
"plastic infinite waterfall
the matched "Danish* living room "set" (*Saline*)

or Nada's: "the
lamb chop in the dryer,
the snow shovel
in the rumpus room, thinking
if i had a round horse" (*GORGEOUS*a vestibule* from *V. IMP.*)

Well, anyway, the basement's where the imagination is sometimes forced to
hide, especially in Brooklyn, my teen years Brooklyn of Bay Ridge,at my
parent's house on BR Parkway, with its cement floor cnvered in outdated
technology and turn-of-the-century French magazines.

Sure, I pledge allegiance to the books and the language of America as much
as the next gal, but after all, the way hour follows hour and day follows
day is not that much like a vocabulary exercise; it's more about trying not
to get depressed, even trying to renew not just your library card. but this
ceaselessly ironic daily life.

OK, not  easy but not pathetic either, if there's hope in the rarely
automatic quotidian promises of life:
at least that's what I'm getting from Amy King today.

"On top of my name, devotions, no woman
chain whips and lovers: coffee is how
I get other/ countries inside my body." (*ON THE OUNCE THAT SELLS US OUT*)

and:

"Marilyn as metaphor is
applepie modeled on
the grandmothers of invention" (*THE TEMPERATURE'S MOVIE LIFE*)

Am I not THAT old after all?

Thanks, Amy.

Dear Poetics Subscribers,

NeWest Press is pleased to announce the publication of

The Bindery by Shane Rhodes.


Scribbles at Mexican bus stops, meditations on street corners in Buenos
Aires, letters from friends in the Himalaya, The Bindery writes the travel
narrative through  experiments in language, in lyric, in place, in a history
of the new.  This is poetry that wanders, gets lost in the back pages, opens
the map and understands nothing. Deliciously off course and roving.


ISBN 978-1-897126-14-1 / 1-897126-14-X
$16.95 CDN / $12.95 USD


Shane Rhodes has published two previous books of poetry. The Wireless Room
(NeWest Press 2000) won the Alberta Book Award for poetry and Holding
Pattern (NeWest Press 2002) won the Archibald Lampman Award.  His most
recent chapbook can be seen at
http://www.greenboathouse.com/chapbooks/shane_rhodes.htm. Shane lives in
Ottawa, Canada and writes where ever.

    Dear David,
    Last
Friday's vote in the House was a small step toward ending the U.S. occupati=
on of Iraq.  While the supplemental war appropriations bill
passed by the House was disappointingly weak - it didn't include language t=
o
prevent an attack on Iran and included a year and a half timeline for
withdrawal with enough loopholes to drive about 60,000 U.S. troops through =
- it
did mark the first time that a majority of the House voted to remove U.S.
troops from Iraq by a specific date.=20



Now
the Senate is considering its version of the 2007 supplemental war
appropriations bill and time is running out to include a shorter timeline f=
or U.S. withdrawal from Iraq
and assurances that Bush can't attack Iran without specific Congressional
authorization into the final bill.  Call
your Senators NOW   and tell them to include these important provisions in =
the
2007 supplemental war appropriations bill.



Call
on your Senators  to bring our troops home in 2007 and to support the Webb
Amendment to prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran.  Th=
e Senate is currently set to stop adding
amendments at 2:30pm TODAY, so call NOW  to support adding the Webb amendme=
nt to
the 2007 Senate supplemental war appropriations bill.

P.S. Without

movement put on the House, a timeline for withdrawal (no matter how bad) wo=
uld
never have been passed by the House - keep the pressure up on the Senate.  =

Jerome McGann argues that contemporary=20

in the way we think about our poetic tradition on=20

as a crisis of the present rather than as a=20

The Heart of Mars
a novel
by Chuck Rosenthal

Smartly rich, observant and vital
-William H. Gass


In 2540 there are horses on Mars! Earth, ravaged by global warming, is occupied by an alien species of amphibians-the Nution-who have established a utopian society employing only biological tech-nology. They govern the solar system with a benign communism. A fish freighter carrying a load from the farms of Europa is hijacked and last seen heading toward Mars where some of the only holdouts of human culture still eke out a life. The detective, Marl, both human and Nution, is sent to investigate. He discovers the utopian dream of the Nution is not as it seems, and that the solar system is on the verge of revolution.

Part fantasy, part fabulism, part detective, Chuck Rosenthal's The Heart of Mars is a follow-up to his controversial environmental novel, My Mistress, Humanity. With his extraordinary literary sensibility, Rosenthal romps across genres, once more positing a possible future for humankind and all of the world.

Chuck Rosenthal has published six novels (Loop's Progress, Experiments With Life & Deaf, Loop's End, Elena of the Stars, Jack Kerouac's Avatar Angel: His Last Novel and My Mistress, Humanity), the memoir, Never Let Me Go, and some two dozen stories in such prestigious literary journals as the Chicago Review, The Santa Monica Review and The Denver Quarterly. He is on the faculty at Loyola Marymount University, and lives in Los Angeles with the poet Gail Wronsky.

Also from Chuck Rosenthal--

The Loop Trilogy is back in print.

Back after more than a dozen years and restored the author's original version, The Loop Trilogy sweeps from the wildest of inspired comedy to the darkest pathos in this Magic Realism vision of working-class America.

novelist, short story writer, and multimedia stylist
SHELLEY JACKSON

Friday March 30
7:00pm
Hallwalls (Cinema)
341 Delaware Avenue
Buffalo
Free and Open to the Public


For information about her new novel, Half Life:
http://ineradicablestain.com/half_life.html

SHELLEY JACKSON was extracted from the bum leg of a water buffalo in =
1963 in the Philippines and grew up complaining in Berkeley, California. =
She has spent most of her life in used bookstores, smearing unidentified =
substances on their spines, and is duly obsessed with books: paper, =
glue, and ink. Nonetheless, she is most widely recognized for an =
electronic text, Patchwork Girl, a hypertext reworking of the =
Frankenstein myth, and for SKIN, a story published in tattoos on the =
skin of volunteers. Meanwhile, her fiction has been appeared in =
Conjunctions, Fence, Grand Street, The Paris Review, and on many =
restaurant napkins. Her first book, The Melancholy of Anatomy, was =
published by Anchor in April 2002. Shelley Jackson also illustrates =
children's books, including two of her own, The Old Woman and the Wave =
and Sophia, the Alchemist's Dog. Her new novel, Half Life, was published =
by Harper Collins in 2006.

Shelley Jackson is a gifted writer . . . who, very playfully, very =
disturbingly, takes the body apart and puts it back together again, =
always in startlingly imaginative ways. These tales of the anatomy's =
ludicrous sorrows are deliciously crafted, maintaining always a fine =
balance between outrageous comedy and profound melancholy. She is . . . =
one of the most poised and original talents of her generation." -Robert =
Coover

6. Cautions

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation. The
current limits of the list are 75 messages per day, and a maximum of
four messages per subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to
change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.


2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We generally do not accept postings of creative work not directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is
not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or
journal entries. However, the Poetics List editor may occasionally
solicit or approve poems for posting on the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

All posts go out not only to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.

Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.


6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 4 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 75 or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be
changed at the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

SUNDAY, APRIL 1, 7:30
 Poetry Flash at Black Oak Books:
 BETSY ANDREWS & BRIAN TEARE
 This is a reading by two winners of the prestigious Brittingham Prize in Poetry from the University of Wisconsin Press. Betsy Andrews is this year's winner, selected by Linda Gregerson, for her book-length poem New Jersey. Anne Waldman writes, "The heart of darkness is alive and beating in Betsy Andrews's New Jersey.ŠWith its commitment to naming, to witnessing the machinations and degradations of our 'terror,' this is a brave poem, and a necessary one." Her poems, essays, and reviews have appeared in publications ranging from PRACTICE to the Yemeni newspaper Culture. Brian Teare won the Brittingham in 2003 for The Room Where I Was Born, selected by Kelly Cherry. D. A. Powell says of it, "Brian Teare's poetry is turning the lyric on its ear, along with the Southern Gothic, the fairy tale, the Old Testament---anything that gets in the way of this powerful voice gets pulled in, chewed up, spit out as a new and frightening (and sexy!) utterance." Brian Teare is a former
 Stegner fellow at Stanford University and has been widely published in such journals as Ploughshares and Boston Review.

I want to quote some things Harryette says in the great BOO (7) interview,
when I introduce her at the Arizona Quarterly Symposium this Saturday

I can't, finally, find my dog-eared copy after rummaging around my office.

any chance one of the original interviewers (BOO people) or someone else has
an electronic version of the interview you could send me?

would be VERY grateful

thanks,

Tenney

Theory of Orange   by Rachel M. Simon
from Pavement Saw Press
ISBN: 978-1-886350-45-8
  is now available

  "Improvisation" is a quintessential Poem of Our Moment: fast moving and declarative, wobbling on the balance beam between associative and dissociative, somewhat absurdist, and, indeed, cerebral. Much talent and skill are evident in it's making, in its pacing and management of gaps, the hints and sound bites which keep the reader reaching forward for the lynchpin of coherence. One admirable aspect of the poem is the way it seems capable of incorporating anything... even as the poem implies a world without sequence, the poem itself has no consequence, no center of gravity, no body, no assertion of emotional value.

--POETRY


  Hip, funny, moving and at times bizarre, this first outing from the Yonkers, N.Y.–based Simon stitches together the elegiac with the entertaining, the fragmentarily outré with the clearly autobiographical: they make an attractive weave. The poems (almost all shorter than one page) include, as she phrases it, "getting-to-know-you-games," multiple tributes to summer camp and "family funerals." Several elegies appear to lament the friend and writer, dead at 21, to whom Simon dedicates the book. "Neither bitter nor embittered,/ non-eponymous but partially self-referential," Simon is also partial to self-portraits composed in apparently unrelated sentences; to in-jokes against writing-workshop platitudes ("No surprise for the writer,/ no surprise behind door number three there is never a car"); and to baffling one-line quips ("My blood is completely cheese"). She can wring comedy from nostalgia, and nostalgia from the detritus of modern childhood: "I hoped that/ by sending a
 box of twinkies/ you'd remember to remember me." Yet her flirtatious advertisements for herself double as postmodern queries into the dangerous culture of advertising, where men and women risk disappearing unless they find something new to say. (Feb.)

  ------Publishers Weekly


In Theory of Orange, Rachel Simon aims her clear-eyed gaze at life’s odd, irresolvable circumstances and “tells it slant.”  Simon’s poems sparkle with freshness, verve, and above all, humanity.  Understated wit, wry intelligence, and honed language are hallmarks of this decidedly original first collection.

        The EMERGENCY Poetry Series

                presents

             THOMAS DEVANEY
              JOHN COLETTI

----------------------------------------
Wednesday, 4/4 at 6PM
Kelly Writers House
3805 Locust Walk
This event is free & open to the public
----------------------------------------

THOMAS DEVANEY is the author of "A Series of Small Boxes," forthcoming
from Fish Drum Press (May 2007). His books include "The American
Pragmatist Fell in Love" and "Letters to Ernesto Neto." His poems have
been published in The American Poetry Review, Jubilat, Fence, and
translated into French and published in Arsenal, Java, and Poesie.
Projects and collaborations with the Institute of Contemporary Art
include: a performance "No Silence Here, Enjoy the Silence," for the
"Locally Localized Gravity" exhibit (2007), and "The Empty House" tour at
the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site for "The Big Nothing" exhibit
(2004). He was program coordinator of the Kelly Writers House from 2001 to
2005. He is a Penn Senior Writing Fellow in the English Department at the
University of Pennsylvania. For more information visit:
http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~wh/devaney.html

JOHN COLETTI grew up in Santa Rosa, California and Portland, Oregon
before moving to New York City twelve years ago. He is the author of
"Physical Kind" (Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs/Boku Books 2005), "The New
Normalcy" (BoogLit 2002), and "Street Debris" (Fell Swoop 2005), a
collaboration with poet Greg Fuchs with whom he also co-edits Open 24
Hours Press.

About the Series

What does it mean to be an emerging poet in America today? Does Dana Gioia's
claim that "poetry has vanished as a cultural force in America" ring true for
poets at the cutting edge of literary production? Does today's emerging poet
face increasing isolation and shrinking audiences, or is a quiet renaissance
taking place, one centered around close-knit communities, long-distance
mentorships, new media, and chapbook exchange?Â How are theoretical stances and
aesthetic practices transmitted among poets at different stages in their
careers?

The Emergency Series at Kelly Writers House seeks to answer these questions,
highlighting perspectives on the current state of American poetry through the
diverse experiences of its practicing poets. By bringing together emerging and
established poets for readings and discussions, it aims to create an ongoing
dialogue about the role poetic lineage plays in a poet's development, and its
impact on the vitality of the craft.

The EMERGENCY poetry series is made possible in part by the Kerry
Sherin Wright Prize

Hey folks,

I'm going to be rolling through the Pittsburgh/Cleveland area around April
20th, and I wonder if anyone knows of any reading series/organizers up
there?

I was hoping to set something up for that date, but I'm also just curious
about what the scene is like up there cuz I don't know much about that area.

thanks,
Ken

The Moles Not Molar
Reading Series

PRESENTS A STAR-NOSED ENTOURAGE OF TRI-GENRED SAVANTS!

Friday, March 30th
7:30 pm
at the Powel House
located at 244 South 3rd Street (between Walnut and Locust)


Featuring
ERIC BAUS (Poet; Philadelphia)
SANDRA NEWMAN (Fiction Writer; New York City)
SARAH CHRISTMAN (Filmmaker, Philadelphia)


ERIC BAUS is the author of The To Sound (Wave Books) as well as  several
chapbooks including the forthcoming Tuned Droves  (Katalanche Press). His
poems have appeared in Hambone, Verse,  Fascicle, and elsewhere. He lives in
Philadelphia where he edits  Minus House chapbooks.

SANDRA NEWMAN is the author of two novels, The Only Good Thing  Anyone Has
Ever Done, and Cake (forthcoming from Chatto & Windus,  May 10) and various
works of short fiction, non-fiction and radio  talks. She is also
co-authoring a manual on writing with Howard  Mittelmark, How Not to Write a
Novel, which has been called  alternately the funniest and most offensive
book ever written on  writing. Her blog, 100 Autobiographies, containing the
true story  of how she aided Osama bin Laden in his escape from justice in
the  wake of 9/11, is now available at www.100autobiographies.blogspot.com.

SARAH CHRISTMAN is a Philadelphia-based independent media  producer.  Using
film, video, and the web, she explores the  personal and cultural impact of
media in everyday life.  Her award- winning films (Bush for Peace, Dear Bill
Gates) have screened  internationally, including at the Rotterdam Film
Festival and  Resfest.  Sarah received her MFA in Film & Media Arts at
Temple  University.  She is the co-founder of Memory Bank Media, a post-
production studio that specializes in the digital preservation of  home
movies and photographs. Sarah will be showing Dear Bill Gates,  in which a
simple correspondence evolves into a poetic visual essay  exploring the
ownership of our visual history and culture.  Combining original and
archival film, video and images from the  internet, it draws unexpected
connections among mining, memory and  Microsoft.

_________

The goal of Moles Not Molar is to put writers and artists pursuing
exciting, innovative and experimental textual projects into contact  and
dialogue with each other and their diverse audiences, creating  exposure and
engagement across regional and generic lines. Please  come out to our event
this month and also look out for upcoming  engagements in April, May and
beyond.

CA,=20

I used to work for a major New Age publisher -- your observations are
right on the $$ -- these books (largely) and related paraphernalia sell
the reader on their own specialness, perfectability if they aren't
fabulously wealthy and successful, and profitability if they are. it's a
form of ego-onanism.=20

haven't read THE SECRET, but I wonder if it's on the same wavelength as
Dianetics, Rosicrucianism, EST, Eckanckar? does anyone on the list know
where the authors got their material from? (and don't say they channeled
Jesus: I've already edited that book)

Subject: complicit actions dismissed in a frenzy of greed

Has anyone seen or read this book THE SECRET?  It's sort of
a condensed version of many different documents and teachings
shit directly from the bowels of New Age Hell.

This book has a Ring Around the Rosie quality (literally, meaning
to ward off pestilence).  While it claims ancient teachings of
certain magic practices known as glamouring, etc., though it
doesn't call it as such, it's built around the purpose of attracting
and holding onto STUFF, in particular wealth, in particular, a life
you've ALWAYS DREAMT WAS POSSIBLE.

When I lived in Albuquerque for a brief time to study herbalism
I was confronted nearly every single day, no matter where I
found myself, with wealthy people who had one spiritual excuse
after another for their wealth, and for deserving it, and for the
need to maintain a life of luxury.  It's not a new story of course.

Greed has no news to tell.  But LET ME SAY THIS to the
readers of THE SECRET.  If we are to implement and LIVE
forward (?) with the document, and set it into motion, we are
not only saying that it's up to us to attract these things into
our lives, but to say to those less fortunate (in my opinion) that
they simply aren't trying hard enough.  It's kind of like a game
of BLAME THE VICTIM!  "Oh those poor bastards in Baghdad
just aren't TRYING HARD enough!  Send them a box of
THE SECRET so they can all learn how THEY DESERVE to
have their houses bombed and their children murdered
for not USING THEIR dream life to bring happiness.  Happy-
happy, bring happy-happy.  Silly dumb people getting
bombed, what's the matter with them!?"

It's no secret why Oprah Winfrey took to THE SECRET.
Like all rich people she wants to feel AT PEACE with her
extraordinary wealth while a web of suffering continues
to spider its way across the planet.

I despise such crap!  It's times like the late America we
all live in that help me FULLY UNDERSTAND the olden
days of marching to the castle gates with torches
and pitchforks.

a cave in the mountains.  Or the Hall as a womb and a performance as a birt=
h.        I wondered if anyone else was struck in the description by Stpeh =
Vincent  of Suzanne Stein's performance by an entropy of the feeling of dej=
a vu all over again?  They run together a bit at this point, memories of ma=
ny performances very similar to this in gallerys, shows, spaces, lofts in t=
he '70's and very early '80's in NYC and Boston. Question everything!  The =
role of the performer, of the audience, of the space, of the system of such=
 set-ups, of the pedgogical relationship of performer-audience, power strug=
gles of performer-audience, the difference between paying for a ticket to s=
uch a performance and attending one for free, and so on and on. The influen=
ce of Punk at the time gave a more aggressive and energetic feeling to even=
 very static pieces--the audiences and performers seemed to have a sense of=
 excitement and risk that could generate at any moment the unexpected of an=
y variety--epiphany, diasaster, boredom, frustration, anger, joy, disgust, =
sober critique.  Or something just very plain and flat as a pair of worn ou=
t pumps. Which showed the signs of wear. Even in its tiredness there was so=
me life left.      The description by Stephen of Suzanne Stein's performanc=
e and her audience reads like a replay of the old performance ideas, basica=
lly a script out of a textbook for Performance 101 anymore, but with an ent=
ropy of energy and ideas on the part of performer and audience both that   =
is astonishing for sheer passivity.  (Maybe not so astonishing--recenlty he=
ard very powerful AIDS actvist speak of a "culture of non-involvement, non-=
activism". ) Since it was an audience of mostly fellow poets, maybe everyon=
e just being very polite, not wishing to hurt the poet on stage's feelings =
by asking a question that might burst the bubble.  Or the poet answer a que=
stion with something that might burst an audience member's bubble.  Twenty-=
five minutes of forced, awkward questions avoiding  anything impolite or di=
fficult, twenty-five minutes of everyone doing as little as possible to get=
 by and fill the time with empty gestures (NOT the "degree zero of performa=
nce" as Stephen suggests, but empty gestures gone through to fill the time =
that's been paid for by the polite audience, and that the performer has bee=
n paid for--and at a higher rate than previously, as Elizabeth notes, thank=
s to the new and more challenging Hall.)         I exagerate of course, esp=
. not having been there, yet going by the description there doesn't seem an=
ything "bold", as Stephen writes, going on, nothing or no one being challen=
ged in any way.  I keep thinking, my god what so many poet and musician fri=
ends and myself wouldn't give for a space like this!  Because it's an  exci=
ting challenge.  Performance degree zero in a sense is not looking at the s=
pace and seeing what it is not and basically critiquing and complaining abt=
 this--it is taking what is there in front of one as it is and putting the =
senses to work to find the endless possibilities hidden in plain site/sight=
/cite.  ("Carpe diem" m'f'er as people say--"When the going gets tough, the=
 tough get going".)      Acceleration from zero--not an entropy into a "bol=
d" "bald" almost zero which is  a reworked version of the cliched reaffirma=
tion of the survival of the Precious in the face of the overwhelmingly Vulg=
ar, a lone, lit visage floating in the vast, frightening, dark emptiness of=
 the Hall.   No, for:               "Our petrified idea of the theater is c=
onnected with our petrified idea of a culture without shadows, where, no ma=
tter which way it turns, our mind (esprit) encounters only emptiness, THOUG=
H SPACE IS FULL."   (my emphasis) --Antonin Artaud, Preface to The Theatre =

I understand they get them in brown paper bags left on the back porch step,
and their credit cards are billed by an agency in Schenectady.

the secret, in particular, seems to have more in common with some of
the 20s & 30s self-help books, a la Dale Carnegie:  what started
during the boom, when many were overspending their earnings, continued
during the bust; the books now have a more religious flavor, as it is
the temper of the time

all in all there's an idea of a moral and ethical justification to
success and failure, and of course fairly ingrained in the American
psyche

a roommate of mine in graduate school wrote his thesis on these books,
and it is sort of interesting that they werethe best sellers (one was
written by a Chinese immigrant!) when sinclair, dos passos, london,
were writing

in any case, specifically, a woman did channel the secret, and it was
stolen from her, and there is a lot of hullaballoo about the whole
thing

don't get me started on endemic victimhood and governmental responsibility

sounds like Urantia, sort of -- you always want to ask, if this person
was the recipient of such high knowledge, why wasn't she clued into the
people / powers who "stole" it from her? I'm sure there's an answer, but
it still makes me wonder about the nature of ultimate, cosmic knowledge
and all that rot.=20

My parents were into a lot of that stuff in the 70's, which didn't stop them from going broke in
the 80's btw, secret possession or not, but oh god how I hated Eckankar, in which my parents would
endlessly chant the most sacred tone in the universe, hyuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.

A short but most sincere note!

I've, this ol' man, and I've lived liked my grandpappy
and seen the world -- or that's what some might say.
And there's lots I don't know. But David is a class
act, a brilliant man, a devoted man -- as we all know.
I just want everyone to know how deeply and dearly I
feel honored to have met and to be able to earn his
friendship. This is the "!"

David - for not having been there - I think your queries and thoughts are
interesting (as usual). If I had not been at the Stein performance I might
have well expressed similar doubts. (I, too, went through, including
participating, a maxed out phase of most conceivable kinds of
art/poet/theater related 70's performances - from the veritably ecstatic to
intellectually provocative to the most the dull, infinitely endless,
pretentious events imaginable.) Of many probably limited possibilities, I
think Suzanne brought a strong and interesting 'arsenal' to the space.

To repeat - vis-=E0-vis the SPT/Timken Hall circumstance - the space is only
able to be successful when poet/ the poems/ and the audience join forces to
overcome the killing character of the theater's architecture and lighting.
(A friend of mine who use to teach in the building jokes about the Timken -
all lights on or dark - as a place where the singular resonant sound of
Mussolini's boots would fit right in. There is something terribly repressiv=
e
about the joint.) =20

Why the College instructors and students  - let alone poetry audiences and
SPT Board and Administration - don't push on the College's Board and
Administration to build a decent auditorium (especially in a college with
multi-media degree programs that would seem to require a state of the art
auditorium), I don't have a clue.  I think the Timken family might be a bit
pissed off at the reputation given to the Family name and insist on some
changes.

Who knows. Maybe now that people are more openly talking, something fresh
will happen.

Henri Maccheroni

Henri Maccheroni is a painter, photographer and poet. He was first
influenced by Surrealism and his famous _2000 photographies du sexe d'une
femme_ remain unequalled in their visual power. He became at the beginning
of the 70's the theorist and main protagonist of "art socio-critique". His
work has questioned the meaning and status of visual symbols in art and
society using painting, photography, photomontage and engraving. Co-founder
with Michel Butor of the Centre National d'Art Contemporain Villa Arson of
Nice, he has worked regularly with writers such as Butor, Jean-Pierre Faye
and Jean-Fran=E7ois Lyotard to create spectacular "cross-works" or books of
dialogue between writing and the visual arts. Several were recently shown
at the Biblioth=E8que Nationale de France. He exhibits regularly in France
and abroad, and in the UK a selection of his work was shown at the
Whitechapel Gallery in the autumn of 2006, together with works by Balthus,
Claude Cahun, Marcel Duchamp, Pierre Molinier and Unica Z=FCrn. The Wren
Library exhibition, curated by the main specialist of his work, Tessa
Tristan, will be his first retrospective exhibition in the country.

Michel Butor

Michel Butor is a novelist, poet and essayist. He became famous with
experimental novels such as _La Modification_, emblematic of the Nouveau
Roman's movement, but his poetic work, developed over half a century, is
equally considerable. Acutely attentive to the contemporary world he has
constantly invented new forms of representation. His regular collaboration
with painters has led to important critical essays about artists and the
notion of "cross-works", as well as the making of many such artists' books.
The French National Library paid homage to his prolific work in a major
exhibition, "Michel Butor, l'=E9criture nomade", in 2006. Butor has analyse=
d
Henri Maccheroni's work in _Probl=E8mes de l'art contemporain =E0 partir de=
s
travaux d'Henri Maccheroni_ (1983). With him he created a remarkable
trilogy of artist's books on New York. Other notable joint works are
_Tarot_ (1980), _In inctu oculi_ (1995), _R=E9capitulation 2000_ (2000) and
_Nymph=E9as_ (2002).

May Livory

May Livory is an eclectic artist and designer who mixes graphic design,

first, the former pope was a poet, now...

http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2398887.ece

perhaps Martha Ronk cn shed some light on this?

The poetry of Barack Obama, aged 19

Pop

Sitting in his seat, a seat broad and broken

In, sprinkled with ashes,

Pop switches channels, takes another

Shot of Seagrams, neat, and asks

What to do with me, a green young man

Who fails to consider the

Flim and flam of the world, since

Things have been easy for me;

I stare hard at his face, a stare

That deflects off his brow;

I'm sure he's unaware of his

Dark, watery eyes, that

Glance in different directions,

And his slow, unwelcome twitches,

Fail to pass.

I listen, nod,

Listen, open, till I cling to his pale,

Beige T-shirt, yelling,

Yelling in his ears, that hang

With heavy lobes, but he's still telling

His joke, so I ask why

He's so unhappy, to which he replies...

But I don't care anymore, cause

He took too damn long, and from

Under my seat, I pull out the

Mirror I've been saving; I'm laughing,

Laughing loud, the blood rushing from his face

To mine, as he grows small,

A spot in my brain, something

That may be squeezed out, like a

Watermelon seed between

Two fingers.

Pop takes another shot, neat,

Points out the same amber

Stain on his shorts that I've got on mine, and

Makes me smell his smell, coming

From me; he switches channels, recites an old poem

He wrote before his mother died,

Stands, shouts, and asks

For a hug, as I shink,* my

Arms barely reaching around

His thick, oily neck, and his broad back; 'cause

I see my face, framed within

Pop's black-framed glasses

And know he's laughing too.

Underground

Under water grottos, caverns

Filled with apes

That eat figs.

Stepping on the figs

That the apes

Eat, they crunch.

The apes howl, bare

Their fangs, dance,

Tumble in the

Rushing water,

Musty, wet pelts

Glistening in the blue.
--
All best,
Catherine Daly

I don't know how kosher it is to promote another poet (perhaps =
especially this poet) without his permission, but I just stumbled onto =
Bill Knott's wild blog: http://billknott.typepad.com/ . (I see that Ron =
Silliman's blog also has a link to it.) Lots and lots of his gorgeous, =
startling, virtuosic and sublime poems are posted there, along with some =
equally amazing commentary about the poetry business (and a collection =
of blurbs from bad reviews--surely some of them made up?). Knott's name =
came up recently on this list in connection with Russell Edson's, in a =
note to the effect that some poets are absolutely sui generis and cannot =
be placed in any school or category. I agree. Knott has been one of my =
favorite poets since I first heard him read in, I think, 1978, at Wally =
Butts' Newbury Book Gallery in Boston. I encourage everyone, especially =
any younger poets unfamiliar with his work, to take a look.

Hi everyone

I'll be passing through Chicago April 12-16 and was hoping to catch some
poetry events or meet up with some poets. Please contact me backchannel if
you have anything to share or want to meet up for coffee and musings.

All things awakened to the same end maintain this curiosity
All things apprehend the richness of their own order
Ask for that as truth - these times are unanswerable
Whatever can interrogate this great apparition?
Trust that perfection has no questions and no function,
Ask that whatever can be is this curiosity of life

Most state humanities councils have more money thn arts councils; this
is good because they have grants one can cleverly write for readings
as speaking, and are generally the ones who sponsor book fairs

here are the arizona deadlines; they have a nice book fair and a
particularly juicy mini grant that will pay for a weekend in phoenix
in style during the book fair; it is good to be listed in the speakers
bureau because then not very good curators who want to do something
will come across you instead of a puppet show, or come across YOUR
puppet show, etc.

A glowing, insightful review that was also very nicely written.

Elaine Equi gave a dynamite reading last night at Cue. She was preceded by a
theramin and guitar duet. She had specifically asked Bill Corbett, the
program coordinator, to invite a theramin player (the book party/readings
there usually include musicians). The humor of the duet, if not their
facility in playing. complemented her wit.

*IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF LANGUAGE SERIES =96 PART III
*Hosted by Grace Vajda and the Student Arts Council at Prescott College

Saturday, April 7th, 2007. 7pm. FREE AND OPEN TO THE PUBLIC! Granite
Performing Arts Center, 218 N. Granite St, Prescott AZ 86301.

THE NONSENSE COMPANY

The Nonsense Company is a group of performers that work in the fields of
contemporary music and theater. They are an experimental group that has
performed across the nation and internationally at festivals like the 2006
Minnesota Fringe Festival. An audience member from the Fringe Festival had
this to say: "Simply breathtaking. Certainly one of the most original,
inventive and compelling pieces of theatre I've seen in my life." The
Nonsense Company will be performing at Granite Performing Arts Center (218
Granite St.) on Saturday, April 7th at 7pm. The event is free of charge and
open to the public.

The Nonsense Company performs unique new works, focusing on the musical use
of speech in estranged contexts, the application in theatre of techniques
native to musical performance, and the effects of innovative aesthetic
practice on social and political thinking. The Company's name is borrowed
from Franz Schubert's ensemble, die Unsinn Gesellschaft, who with radically
spare resources spawned a revolution in the music and poetry of the
nineteenth century.

"One of the most interesting concerts of the festival... The Nonsense
Company [presented] one of the most solid, free and critical aesthetic
propositions, a reproof to the vast majority of ensembles that performed at
Darmstadt..." Alberto Bernal, Educaci=F3n

 It's no mistake the author of THE SECRET is
now doing seminars with Donald Trump.  Trump,
the bastard real estate tycoon who evicted more
artists than anyone in US history! FUCK THE
SECRET!  The only secrets worth uncovering in
this world are those that destroy us everyday.

There's much to be said for spiritualists who have
been interested in helping others, especially
healing others, like Cayce.  I've been to the
Edgar Cayce Institute many times, and the
library is open, and free, all the time.  In that
library are ALL of the giant binders filled with
endless amounts of information surrounding
Cayce's long and extraordinary history of
helping people overcome disease.  And he
did all this through trance.

Blavatsky headquarters was here in my
hometown of Philadelphia.  I've been to the
Lodge of Theosophy she helped start, located
in Rittenhouse Square.  That library is also open
to the public, and free, and has everything from
Krishnamurti to Simone Weil.

What I appreciate about the Theosophists is
that they do NOT encourage dogma of one type
or another taking hold, and prefer all theology
be looked at as forms of philosophy.  And they
challenge YOU to challenge them, them being
the elders.  And let me tell you, the elders at
the Philadelphia Lodge of Theosophy are endless
fonts of wisdom and very thick-skinned to anyone
walking in. You can't knock them off track because
they're never really ON track.

And as far as Blavatsky, let me first say I'm no
Blavatsky-ite, HOWEVER, she had guts and
courage that's rare for any generation!  Imagine being
a woman in conservative Philadelphia in 1875 who
sets up shop off the University of Pennsylvania campus
and starts mouthing off to every priest she comes in
contact with!  She's brilliant in her book THE KEY TO
THEOSOPHY, which is basically a book of transcriptions
of arguments with priests.  In particular I Love her one
argument she titles, "Prayer Kills Self Reliance."  While
books like THE SECRET would have us dream our homes
into wealth, Blavatsky would have us be as vulnerable and
alone as possible to rely on ourselves FIRST, then to
move forward to help bring this world into better awareness,
kindness, and health.  For instance in her argument the
priest demands she understand how The People need
prayer to be connected to God, etc.  She takes him off
guard by arguing, Yeah, well suppose God owned a shop,
and all the workers prayed to God to do all the
work in the shop for them.  Would that be fair?  No, and
we're not here for God to do our work for us.  We're here
to figure things out, not be spoon-fed. (my paraphrase)

THE SECRET, in like, promotes weakness.  And comes
at a time when many thousands of lives are lost and
countless more shattered by our Bush regime's atrocities
we all help finance every single time we pay our taxes.

Been trying my skin on for size many years now.

Seems its finally becoming a more perfect fit!

But then not all beautiful things are beautiful.

AGNI posted these remarks on the Foetry site recently regarding their
publication of a poet's (Jeffrey Levine's) poem. My response follows. I am
determined to publicize this to as many people in the poetry field as
possible.




 Posted: Sat Mar 31, 2007 12:03 pm    Post subject: Re: Levine's "Antonia
..."



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Quote: AGNI writes:



"AGNI accepted Jeffrey Levine's "Antonia Refuses the Nectarines" many months
ago -- long before the contest issue arose -- signed a contract with him,
and he approved the online galleys also before we knew of any problem. We
felt a strong ethical obligation to continue with the posting of this one
poem."



 My Response:

This is a SHOCKING post--the idea that AGNI editors would lower themselves
to post anything serious on this site, let alone imply that they might not
have published Jeffrey Levine's poem if the contest controversy were known
to them is astounding. I'm ashamed for whoever made this post and is seeking
to distance AGNI from a decision made about a poem, not a person, out of
what--fear? AGNI has validated a witch hunt and will forever be damaged for
doing so in my eyes. I intend to make sure as many others as possible know
about AGNI's publication policy as seen in this post--in summary, AGNI will
only publish poets who don't have any controversy attached to them (that
they KNOW about of course) since it might brush off on AGNI and tarnish them
in the eyes of a group of utterly talentless, bitter, conspiracy-driven,
destructive-minded, wannabe-poets. AGNI fears Foetry? AGNI apologizes for an
editorial decision because people are upset about a poet's actions in
another arena? AGNI feels the need to defend itself for selecting a poem
because the poet is under fire? And to the people HERE? It's beyond
comprehension. Who the hell is going to stand up to this? There has GOT to
be legal recourse to what these people are doing here, the casual and
constant defamation of character, the damage to the field of poetry itself.
Who NEEDS Foetry? What is it doing for poetry, other than systematically
destroying the handful of presses and people who care enough to dedicate
themselves to helping the art survive?
