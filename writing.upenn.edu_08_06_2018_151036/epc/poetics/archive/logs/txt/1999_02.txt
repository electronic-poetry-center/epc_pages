there were several "alchemical" texts during the "deep image" era -- One of
the best places for your bibliography to start might be in the earlier
works of Robert Kelly

(am away from my poetry library -- maybe somebody out there can recall the
specific titles -- I think Kelly's collection of previously uncollected
early poems had alchemy in the title)

thanks to all who have posted; any suggestions about books that introduce
the basics of alchemy?  or that riff on the metaphysical aspects of
alchemy?  handbooks in elementary magic or a bachelardian phenomenology?  i
think this is what my student wants to learn about, as well as reading
examples of poetry that is alchemically inflected.  thanks again all!

Dear Colleagues:

I hope this message is not out of standard with the new guidelines for
the List.

Let me encourage you all to support little magazines, and to support
them with your dollars as well as your submissions. I am moved to say
this because I recently had yet another desperate conversation with yet
another desperate magazine distributor. These conduits for magazine
distribution are experiencing hard times, thanks to the changing market
place (chain stores) and changing technologies (Internet). If things
continue as they are, magazine distribution as it is known today will
very likely die off, because it is too labor intensive and no longer
cost effective to run such a business.

This is all by way of saying that the market and the target consumer for
writing is writers. If we do not buy the books that our colleagues
write, and the magazines that they appear in, no one else will.

I hope this gentle reminder makes sense.

With good wishes,

Mark Salerno

The  Triumph of Capitalism has not made it any easier to pay the rent.

Last month's Harpers (who published Marteen's letter in toto a year ago), had
an intriguing piece on ads becoming art and artists making ads (like Beatles,
like Rolling Stones, like Burroughs, like Ginsberg) that dissed Emily XYZ for
her poem that "ran" as Nike ad. Emily ok'ed her response being posted here.

<<15 January 1999


Editor,
Harper’s Magazine
666 Broadway
New York NY  10012



Dear Sir:

In his article, “But Is It Advertising?” (January 1999), Jonathan Dee says
that I am an example of a writer whose work “has no content -- which is to
say, no connection between the language you use and your actual conviction.”
Mr. Dee claims that because I wrote a poem for use in a Nike commercial,
“millions” know me as “the poet from the Nike commercial,” therefore
nullifying everything else I’ve done or will do.  “[A]s for what her work
concerns, the question is moot,” writes Mr. Dee, “since she has demonstrated
that the content of that work is arbitrary; that is, it’s up for sale.”  This
is wrong on so many levels I hardly know where to begin responding.

Maybe the Pope was Michelangelo’s Nike:  The content of my writing is no more
arbitrary than that of Mr. Dee or any other writer who may profit from his or
her skill.  Does he think that in order to be valid, a thing has to be created
into the void?  Can I assume, then, that he donated his article to Harper’s
magazine?  Or that he would turn down a story assignment if the topic wasn’t
his idea?

I considered the Nike ad no different from any other commission or freelance
job.  Along with about 100 other poets, I was asked to submit poems in tribute
to certain female Olympic athletes.   I saw it as a challenge or a contest.
It was not done in the same spirit as I usually write poetry, that is, without
expectation of material gain.  This was for a different purpose, just as I’m
sure Mr. Dee has writings he considers different from those he would pitch to
a magazine, or even different pieces for different magazines.

Which is not to say I didn’t try to do a good job, even though I knew it might
end up in a commercial.  I found the stories of the women athletes inspiring.
There was a certain transcendence in what some of them had gone through in
their careers, and so I concentrated on making that point.  Michelangelo might
not have cared one way or the other whether a particular pope was remembered
well, but he still did the best job he could.

However, the cloth coat is democratic:  Mr. Dee seems to think that doing a
commercial for Nike took me from obscurity to a terrible fame.  Wrong!  I am
just as obscure as ever, only I’m a little less in debt and my grad-student
husband and I own our first car -- an ’86 Toyota Tercel.  Not to sound too
Republican-cloth-coat about this, but I got my BA as an adult, work full time,
and am paying back mega-college loans.  For me, that Nike ad was a godsend.
But it did not make me rich, it did not make me famous, and it does not mean
my work is up for sale.

You coulda called first:  As for “what my work concerns,” the question is
really moot because Mr. Dee never bothered to find out what it concerns.  He
knows nothing whatsoever about me or what I do.  Had he done a little research
instead of just making assumptions, he would have found out that I was on the
PBS series _The United States of Poetry_ a full two years before the Nike ad
aired.  To the extent that my work is known at all, it’s largely for my
participation in USOP, not in the commercial.  He criticizes me in some pretty
harsh terms for never having so much as picked up the phone to talk to me, or
anyone who knows me, about what I do.

Calvin Klein’s no friend of mine:  Mr. Dee is also much more squeamish about
the relationship between art and commerce than most people in 1999.  Look at
hip-hop, for example.  Hip-hop artists use brand names and bits of commercials
and TV shows constantly, not to break their power over us, but to tap into it
-- to bring an audience closer via these familiar, shared references -- and by
doing so, to consolidate their own power as artists and entertainers.

Saul, Saul!:  What really bothered me, though, was Mr. Dee’s sanctimonious
criticism of other artists, like the late William Burroughs, who also did a
Nike ad.  Despite creating some of the greatest American literature of the
20th century and being acclaimed as one of the most influential writers ever,
William Burroughs had money problems all his life.  At some point he gets
offered a chance for what we all want, a little security, a little comfort.
Should he have turned it down, Mr. Dee, so that people like you, who are
probably far more comfortable than he ever was, could have your hero?  For
what he did for his country, William Burroughs should have gotten a house by
the sea and a pension for life.  And in another country, he might have.

But the United States has always been hard on its artists, and never more so
than right now.  Right now, our society consists of people who expect artists
to inspire them, but who don’t know what inspiration is.  They think it’s what
happens when you put a bindhi on your forehead or listen to Celine Dion.  In
fact, this society doesn’t really want artists around at all (except for
moneymakers like Celine Dion) because they think we’re a drain on The Economy,
which people nowadays tend to confuse with their personal money.  Most people
think of art as either a luxury or an expense.  Either way, they wish it would
just go away, and are only too happy to make its survival nearly impossible.

All of which just makes Mr. Dee’s ire against artists and advertising even
more superfluous than it might otherwise be.  It’s like he’s a witness to
Kristallnacht, but his big complaint is all the broken glass in the street.

Instead of worrying about the culture of advertising taking over, Mr. Dee,
worry about our society’s profound ignorance of the arts and artists.  It is
the end result of bigotry against and contempt for those who make art.
Artists in the United States today are caught between a right-wing rock and a
hard marketplace.  Those are our choices.  At least with the marketplace, you
stand a chance of paying your bills.

        You are right about Lansing, and his book in the Curriculum of the
Soul (Institute of Further Studies) would be essential stuff.  Charles Stein's
book on Olson--The Secret of the Black Chrysanthemum-- is a major
text and has a good bibliography.  It might be a little hard to find but
the Alchemy issue of _Io_  (about 1970) would lead to a wealth of
poetry, relevant texts, etc.

Amazingly, at the height of the santa claus frenzy, on dec. 17 over one
hundred people showed up at the Havana Restaurant on Commercial Drive to
hear Goh Poh Seng read at the launch of his first substantial collection of
poems in North America, The Girl from Ermita & Selected Poems 1961-1998
published by Nightwood .
Everybody knows Vancouver is paved with poets but i haven't seen this many
people turn out for a reading since Allen Ginsberg came to town. Perce
Groves was there, Barbara Webb, Renee Rodin, Scott Harker, Roy Miki, George
Stanley,  Jenn Lamm, Jamie Reid, Jerry and Margaret Pethick, Mina Mina, the
sufi poet Muhammad, Gerry Gilbert was taping it for broadcast on Coop
radio, the future prime minister Jim and Rojeanne Allworth were there,
Victoria Walker, Pearl Hunt, (maybe you could add a few names here Jim, i'm
just trying to plant a few seeds for future literary historians and give a
hint of the broad range of the audience) all of the hundred seats were
filled, people stood in the back, others sat along the side and they sat
there for nearly two hours.
Poh Seng can be a real charmer, he put the audience at ease starting off
with  laughter some funny poems among the earliest poems he'd written as a
teenager in Dublin;  pretty soon, he was back in Southeast Asia, he read
Vietnam 1967 and you could hear a pin drop so vivid  stirs strong emotion
like many of his poems, you can see what he says, half singer half
storyteller, he read poems he wrote in Manila, Singapore, New Zealand,
Tahiti, Vancouver, Newfoundland,  Hornby Island, San Miguel poems of
friendship, poems of encounter, poems of outrage, domestic poems, poems of
celebration. He read for an hour, had a ten minute break during which
copies of the book so beautifully designed by his son Goh Kajin seemed to
leap from the boxes, and cash flew from the pockets of the clamoring fans,
people bought two and three(christmas, hanukah, ramadan after all). By the
time he'd finished nearly an hour later, he'd read a sampling from each of
his earlier books, Eyewitness, Lines from Batu Ferringhi, Bird With One
Wing, and the most recent poems Spring Moon Blues which includes Gate of
Heavenly Peace, the incredible Tian An Men Square poem that he'd written in
Cowhead,  Newfoundland, which marks his flowering as a canadian poet..
During the course of his reading he spoke of his emigration, his
denunciation in the Singapore parliament, his adaptation to canada, and he
closed the reading in his back garden on Victoria Drive.

WAKE FOR CHARLES WATTS

Summer's beginning
       to end
Beethoven's Fifth
on CBC Radio Two
pours out of the kitchen
onto the back deck
where I've been idling
           washing me down
onto our small back garden
which Margaret, the boys and I
started creating some four years back,
when we tried to make the house a home
Actually, the garden
was more Margaret's passion
          than the rest of us.

Come to think of it,
it was about the same time
you told me you had cancer
when we met strolling down
        Commercial Drive,
the main thoroughfare
        in our neighborhood.

Now, leaves are already yellowing,
wilted flowers waiting to be
          dead-headed,
plants and trees
        cut back
for the Fall
for Winter
the small ceremonies
of living
and dying.

And this, one of the last
       golden afternoons
when the other world
seems far away
          or
perhaps very close by.

                           Vancouver

Our Back Garden
Victoria Drive

So brief, really
are these weeks of summer
conjured out of our back garden
that i should not hold on to them
         simply let go.

         There,
          one sigh
          and they're gone
                 forever.

Vietnam 1967

Beginning another vigil
he regards the tentative sun
through a fragmented sky;
otherwise there is only greenness.
In the still quiet dawn
he downs a mug of tea,
leans his rifle against a tree
and now and then recalls his home
unearths another day.
He is far from his hamlet.

It was an unquestioning life,
tilling the stubborn land that defies
the controlling hand of man.
There was consolation, now he knows
tha laughter of his child,
the softness of his wife who yielded to him at night
So what if kingdoms topple?

His dream shakes the silent air.

He sees his home gutted in the sun,
he sees his wife, head blown off,
the body of his child strewn
among young stubble of padi.

For days he prowled that waste
unable to quell his hate.
How to mobilize that precise pain?

Time passes.
Now and then a recall of home:
she chants at night to their child
who smiles, remembering small mischiefs.
After losing them,
their absence remains.

He makes his fists into a power
fierce as one whose sinews
could manage the sun.

In the glare of the sun
the planes beautiful
like silver spears
come in an eddy of air.

Amongst battered tree trunks
his blood splatter
into uncanny flowers.

Over the gentle contour of hills
and the sea,
the happy young crew from afar
returns to the air.

          Paul Metcalf, Who Wrote Experimental Tales, Dies at 81


          By DINITIA SMITH

              Paul Metcalf, who made his mark as an experimental
              writer of prose, poetry and plays, died on Jan. 21
          near Pittsfield, Mass. He was 81 and lived in Chester,
          Mass.

          His wife, Nancy, said Metcalf had a heart attack after
          buying apples at a farmers market not far from
          Arrowhead, the Berkshire home of Herman Melville, his
          great-grandfather.

          "Like a medieval chronicler with the eye of a poet and
          the heart of a taleteller, he fits together radiant
          fragments into a wholly new kind of construct," the
          author Guy Davenport once wrote of Metcalf. His more
          than 20 books were often collages of first-person
          historical narratives, science writing, newspaper clips
          and his own words, woven together in a single fabric.
          "It was like a symphony, with sources like old diaries
          and botanical descriptions as the different
          instruments," said his daughter Adrienne.

          Nonetheless, the words had a cumulative effect. In his
          1976 book "Apalache," an epic about the settlement of
          the New World, he mixed native and settler chronicles
          with his own musings: "The fragrance drifts seaward/we
          smelled the land a hundred leagues, and farther when
          they burned the cedars/before we come in sight of it
          thirty leagues, we smell a sweet savour/we had now fair
          sunshine weather, and so pleasant a sweet as did much
          refresh us, and there came a smell off the shore like
          the smell of a garden."

          Metcalf came from a distinguished New England family.
          His mother was Eleanor Thomas Metcalf, a granddaughter
          of Herman Melville and his literary executor. His
          father, Henry Knight Metcalf, who worked for an
          insurance company, was a descendant of Roger Williams,
          the founder of Rhode Island.

          Metcalf was born in East Milton, Mass., and was educated
          at private schools. He attended Harvard but disliked it
          and left after only three months. In 1942 he married
          Nancy Harman Blackford of Charleston, S.C., and during
          the next 20 years the couple spent long periods in the
          South. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a
          brother, David, of Topsham, Me.; two daughters, Anne
          Westmoreland of Schuyler, Va., and Adrienne, of Becket,
          Mass., and two granddaughters.

          Early in his life, Metcalf thought little about his
          famous ancestor and his writings. His first book, "Will
          West," published in 1956, was a short novel about murder
          with a Cherokee as the protagonist.

          But in the early 60s Metcalf returned to the Berkshires,
          and in his 1965 book, "Genoa," acknowledged the
          relationship to Melville. "Genoa" was one of his
          best-known works, a blend of references to Melville,
          other sources and his own language.

          In the book, a man called Michael Mills muses about his
          own history, and his brother, Carl, who is a monster:
          "Herman would harangue his wife and two daughters (this
          was after the sons were gone) on matters that had no
          interest for them, and they would roll their eyes, and
          sigh, and wait, or there would be outbursts of temper,
          sarcasm."

          Metcalf told his hometown newspaper, The Berkshire
          Eagle, that the book "was a way of getting the Melville
          monkey off my back."

          William H. Gass, reviewing "Genoa" in The New York
          Times, said that the book "invites us to pass our minds
          down a new but ancient track, to become, ourselves, both
          fact and fiction, and to discover something true about
          the geography of time."

          Metcalf was a tall man with a powerful physical
          presence. In recent years, with his hair nearly shoulder
          length and his pipe in his mouth, he was a colorful
          figure. His home in Becket became a center for artists
          and writers in the area. As a writer he remained a cult
          figure, although in 1987 he was honored by the American
          Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Beginning in
          1996, the Coffee House Press of Minneapolis published a
          three-volume edition of his collected works.

          He also supported efforts to increase the collection of
          Melville's papers at Arrowhead and at the Berkshire
          Athenaeum in Pittsfield. In 1921, the manuscript of
          Melville's novel "Billy Budd" was discovered in a tin
          box in his family's home.

          Several months ago, as Metcalf was moving out of his
          Becket house, he found two more boxes of family papers
          and memorabilia that he had long forgotten. He donated
          the papers to the Melville Room of the Berkshire
          Athenaeum.

Dear Listers and friends,

Please,  if you have not done so already,  but especially if you have,
return to alyricamailer #9.

There were some egregious formatting errors which disfigured many of the
poems.  Further,  there were some egergious editing errors (on talks by
Nick Lawrence,  Taylor Brady,  Eleni Stecopoulos and Poems by Nick,
Eleni, Ben Friedlander, Aaron Armstrong Skomra and Myself) which may
have causde problems with the reading of certain of the texts. And last,
Michelle Citrin is now spelled correctly and the poems (this was my
fault and apologies to Michelle) she wanted included originally are now
included as well. I can only say sorry to those whose work got skewed
and hope in the future my html skills improve.  Thanks again.

Mike

Those of you in the area (that is: "nowhere Zen New Jersey" as Ginsberg put
it) might want to mark your calendars and take a few long lunch breaks this
Spring to come to a new series of readings I've put together:

24 February: Edwin Torres

31 March: Paul Muldoon

7 April: Sianne Ngai

14 April: Yusef Komunyakaa

21 April: Bruce Andrews

28 April: Kenny Goldsmith

Readings will be followed by open discussions on each poet's work.  All
readings are Wednesdays, at 12: 30, on the Princeton University campus,
McCosh Hall, Room 4.

Driving directions, train schedules to Princeton, and a campus map can all
be found at: http://www.princeton.edu/Siteware/WeatherTravel.shtml.

The series, held in conjunction with a course on contemporary poetry, is
made possible by The Princeton University Department of English and the
250th Anniversary Fund for Innovation in Undergraduate Education.

Hope to see (some of) you there!

Please send me names/performers of your favorite blues songs that make a
conjunction of sacred and profane love. At this time, just blues, not
gospel or r&b or soul songs. I don't exactly know where I'm going with
this. I was just struck listening to "When Love Came to Town" (not even
sure if that's the title) this morning, and while most of its verses have
to do with denial of physical/emotional love between humans (but that was
"before love came to town"), it has one verse where the protagonist "throws
the dice" while soldiers are piercing the Lord in the side, but that too
was "before love came to town," a happening that then transforms everything
-- so all of a sudden there's this marvelous transformation of a fairly
down & dirty song into a somewhat sacred song. I know this happens in some
Renaissance poetry and other poetry of various periods, and I know I've
heard it in the blues before, but I can't think of where right now. If you
know any such songs, please send, if you can, song name, performer, and
even what recording it appears on.

thanks,

Here are a few texts that offer an excellent intro to alchemy, Maria:

Psychology & Alchemy - CG Jung - Princeton UP
Alchemy - Titus Burkhardt - Penguin Books
The Forge & The Crucible - Mircea Eliade -
The Elements of Alchemy - Cherry Gilchrest - Element Books
Claire-Voss, Karen.  "Spiritual Alchemy: Interpreting Representative Texts
and Images"  Gnosis and Hermeticism from Antiquity to Modern Times. Edited
by      Roelof van den Broek & Wouter J. Hanegraaff. NY: SUNY Press, 1998.
Alchemy of the word : cabala of the Renaissance / Philip Beitchman, Albany :
State University of New York Press, 1998
The essay by Karen Claire-Voss, which I used recently for a paper on
Gaddis's _The Recognitions_, is especially recommended as it gives a
succinct overview of the theory and praxis of alchemists. Peter Lamborn
Wilson has also written at length about alchemy. The title that comes to
mind is _Shower of Stars_ - can't recall the publisher off hand, but most
likely it's Autonomedia in NYC. And for an intro to magic, try Richard
Cavendish's _The Black Arts_. Your student might also be interested in works
on or by the Elizabethan magus John Dee. There are several excellent works
on him, most notably by Frances Yates (The Occult Philosophy In The
Elizabethan Age ) and Peter France (_John Dee_). Adam McLean has compiled a
fascinating and beautiful work based on Dee's and Edward Kelly's scrying
method called A Treatise On Angel Magic : Being A Complete Transcription Of
Ms. Harley 6482 In The British Library
And of course, there's always Henry Cornelius Agrippa, the 16th Century
granddaddy of the mantic arts and the Golden Dawn material (Crowley,
Mathers, AE Waite, et al) which derives directly from this tradition.

Brenda Hillman's recent work (in Loose Sugar) alludes to the idea of
alchemy a lot, with words down at the bottom of the page that are the
"result" of various mixtures above.

Just a reminder that query responses should generally
go to the person querying, and not the list as a whole.
Exceptions would be longer, detailed messages that might
be of interest to all. I've forwarded most of those that
came in re Maria's alchemy query; the few that were one

That each such file be triplicated across independent media (separate
floppies, hard drives, zip disks, and so forth), and, if possible, re-
produced in non-electronic media such as paper, stone, vellum, or in-
scribed metal plaques suitably protected against water damage.

That such triplicated files be compared, one against another, in order
to ensure absolute accuracy, such as found in Torah Scrolls or the Ar-

According to Tom Beckett:

>
> Fuck me
> if I know
>

Tom, this reminded me of a very good and neglected short poem by Emerson,
which serves as epigraph to his essay, "Circles."  Here it is for the
list:

Nature centres into balls,
And her proud ephemerals,
Fast to surface and outside,
Scan the profile and the sphere;
Knew they what that signified,
A new gensis were here.

The complexity of his sense of the inside outside relationship ("where are
the folds?" as you say) is suggested by two contradictory statements of
his, from "Circles" and "Experience" respectively:

1) "There is no outside, no inclosing wall, no circumference to us."

2) "The world is all outside: it has no inside."


Anyway, thought I'd share on the heals of your funny and provocative post.

*** Book excerpts sold with Diet Coke

NEW YORK (AP) - In an era of mega-bookstores and mega-marketing, many
complain the written word is being peddled like a soft drink. The
Coca-Cola Co. and several publishers have decided to do just that.
Starting Monday, purchasers of 12 and 24-packs of Diet Coke and
caffeine-free Diet Coke will find colorful booklets enclosed, affixed
like a straw on a juice box. Each will contain excerpts from a new
work by a popular writer - among them Elmore Leonard, Barbara Taylor
Bradford and Lisa Scottoline. With 40-45 million such packages
planned, that means an enormous potential readership. Diet Coke
drinkers also will have the chance to submit 500-word essays, fact or
fiction, on "Living Life to the Fullest." The contest, which ends
March 12, offers an all-expense paid trip for two to New York City.

Something about alchemy and poetry that I find helpful is an essay, not a
book, by Kenneth Rexroth, "The Spiritual Alchemy of Thomas Vaughan."  It
appeared in With Eye & Ear, a collection of essays by Rexroth, Herder and
Herder, An Azimuth Book, 1970, pp.1-10, and is ,more conveniently
included in the paperback collection, World Outside the Window: The
Selected Essays of KRexroth, ed. B.Morrow, New Directions, 1987, pp.
243-51.  The essay ncluded the fascinating inference that T. Vaughan died
with his wife in an alchemically related mystical-sexual position trying
to manipulate micorcosm-macrocosm, with fatal effects.On Fri, 29 Jan 1999,

Mark Salerno & confidantes:

I wish I had the ability to condense the state of American magazine &
book distribution down to the convenient statement "the market and the
target consumer for writing is writers. If we do not buy the books that
our colleagues write, and the magazines that they appear in, no one else
will." People _are_ buying the books, on the rare instance they can find
them on a shelf in a store.

Journal distribution as it is known today will die off. Few literary
journals use literary specific distribution. In fact many are riding on
large magazine titles (for instance, the Baffler always appears with the
New Yorker) or comic book distibutors because Bernhard & DeBoer aren't
taking new journals or are paying way too slow. Quite often these
alternates pay faster & don't always rip the covers off the issues. Many
of us were burned by Fine Press in Texas, we don't take to having our
money witheld kindly.

Conduits for magazine and book distribution are experiencing hard times,
thanks to chain stores shifting to a supermarket mentality where space
has to be bought for the title to be carried. And the lack of middle
ground distibution for books. If I publish a run of 1000 I can have
Consortium take half the press run or SPD take 25-50 titles of a 2-300
copy press run. I rarely run 500 to 750 copies because there is no
adequate distributor. And, unfortunately, this range is ideal for
breaking even because the % paid back to me is higher. While I have
published books in the 1000's I am just starting to hit the 500 press
run size for the aforementioned reason. This doesn't even touch having a
choice of more than one distributor for our matter.

While Barnes & Noble has cleared their act up as a result of a
collective in WI, and through some bullying on our half has given in to
our collective as well, Border's are the big problem now. Pay at 120 or
more days.  Multiple phone calls. No specific contact. Different name
each time shell game.

I have no concern about the recent acquisition of the third distributor.
Since 80%  of their distribution is to independent bookstores, they are,
in effect, a useless shell if the indy's decide not to use them.

Be well

Maria--Don't know if this will be useful, but if I recall correctly Victor
Frankenstein begins his idiosyncractic "home-schooling"  by delving into
alchemy.  When he later goes off to college, he at first resists the
modern scientific approach because it seems so unappealing on
philosophical & metaphysical grounds.  I also seem to remember that the
alcehemical books Mary Shelley has Victor read were all books that Percy
really did read.

The above is exactly what my book is about: Modernist Alchemy, Poetry and
the Occult (Cornell 1995), which concentrates on Yeats, Pound, Eliot (tho
E. is not particularly alchemical), H.D., Robert Duncan, Plath, Hughes, and
Merrill. The name of the Robert Kelly volume, by the way, is The Alchemist
to Mercury (1981).

Alchemically inflected poetry: Steve Jonas, esp. series called
Orgasms/Dominations (Talisman House Press, 1994)

Idries Shah's book SUFISM relates various Sufic practices of
codification, wch have significance for someone's with those interests
you mention.

There's also a late 70s recapitulative number of Io (ed. Richard
Grossinger) that repeats or extends propositions & info from earlier
Alchemy issue of the magazine.

To establish a context for alchemy in this century, there're magi
Gurdjieff, Blavatsky & Crowley; also, of a slightly different order,
there's Wilhelm Reich, still - easily, I think - identifiably an
alchemist.

The whole School of Boston in the mid- to late fifties was an alchemical
school, comprised variously of Jonas, Lansing, Dunn, Wieners, Blaster &
Spicer for a time, among others (R. Kelly & Mister Harvey Brown were
known to have stopped by & dropped in a while.  Read their works; go
from there.

Marquez's observations are very insightful and interesting.  I have to pass
this along. -AK

The mysteries of Bill Clinton

Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel García Márquez
compares the president's fate to that of Hester Prynne.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

BY GABRIEL GARCíA MÁRQUEZ | The first thing you notice about William
Jefferson Clinton is how tall he is. The second is the seductive power he
has of making you feel, from the first moment of meeting, that he is someone
you know well. The third is his sharp intelligence, which allows you to
speak to him about anything at all, even the prickliest topics, provided you
know when to bring it up.

Even so, someone not enamored of him forewarned me: "The dangerous thing
about these gifts is that Clinton uses them to make you feel that nothing
could interest him more than what you are saying to him."

I met him first at a dinner given by William Styron in his summer house on
Martha's Vineyard in August 1995. During his first campaign, Clinton had
mentioned that his favorite book was "One Hundred Years of Solitude." I said
at the time -- and I was quoted in print -- that I thought he had said it
simply to pull in the Latin vote. He had not forgotten -- after greeting me
on Martha's Vineyard, he at once assured me that what he said had been quite
sincere.

Carlos Fuentes and I have good reason for considering that evening as a
whole chapter in our memoirs. From the beginning, we were disarmed by the
interest, respect and humor with which he listened to us, treating our words
as if they were gold dust.

His mood corresponded with his appearance. His hair was short, like a
scrubbing brush, his skin tanned -- he had the healthy and almost insolent
look of a sailor ashore, and he was wearing a college sweat shirt with some
logo on the chest. At 49, he looked like an exuberant survivor of the
generation of '68, who had smoked marijuana, knew the Beatles by heart and
had demonstrated against the Vietnam War.

Dinner began at 8, with some 14 guests around the table, and lasted until
midnight. Bit by bit, the conversation came down to a kind of literary round
table involving the president and the three writers. The first topic to come
up was the forthcoming Summit of the Americas. Clinton had wanted it held in
Miami, where it did take place. Carlos Fuentes considered that New Orleans
or Los Angeles had stronger historical claims, and he and I argued strongly
for them until it became clear that the president had no intention of
changing his plans because he was counting on reelection support from Miami.

"Forget the votes, Mr. President," Carlos said to him. "Lose Florida and
make history."

That phrase set the tone. When we spoke of the problems of narco-traffic,
the president heard me out generously. "Thirty million drug addicts in the
U.S. go to show that the North American mafia are more powerful than those
in Colombia, and the authorities much more corrupt." When I spoke to him
about relations with Cuba, he seemed even more receptive. "If Fidel and you
could sit and talk face to face, all problems would completely disappear."

When we talked about Latin America in general, we realized that he was much
more interested than we had supposed, although he lacked some essential
background. When the conversation seemed to stiffen a bit, we asked him what
his favorite movie was, and he answered "High Noon," by Fred Zinneman, whom
he had recently honored in London. When we asked him what he was reading, he
sighed and mentioned a book on the economic wars of the future, author and
title unknown to me.

"Better to read 'Don Quixote,'" I said to him. "Everything's in there." Now,
the 'Quixote' is a book that is not read nearly as much as is claimed,
although very few will admit to not having read it. With two or three
quotes, Clinton showed that he knew it very well indeed. Responding, he
asked us what our favorite books were. Styron said his was "Huckleberry
Finn."

I would have said "Oedipus Rex," which has been my bed table book for the
last 20 years, but I named "The Count of Monte Cristo," mainly for reasons
of technique, which I had some trouble explaining.

Clinton said his was the "Meditations of Marcus Aurelius," and Carlos
Fuentes stuck loyally to "Absalom, Absalom," Faulkner's stellar novel, no
question, although others would choose "Light in August" for purely personal
reasons. Clinton, in homage to Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing around
the table, recited from memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling
passage, and perhaps the most hermetic, from "The Sound and the Fury."

Faulkner got us to talking about the affinities between Caribbean writers
and the cluster of great Southern novelists in the United States. It made
much more sense to us to think of the Caribbean not as a geographical region
surrounded by its sea but as a much wider historical and cultural belt
stretching from the north of Brazil to the Mississippi Basin.

Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others would then
be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott. Clinton, born and
raised in Arkansas, a Southern state, applauded the notion and professed
himself happy to be a Caribbean.

It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the conversation to take
an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at that moment he gave the
authority to campaign and raise funds in the United States for peace in
Northern Ireland. That should have been the ending to an unforgettable
evening, but Carlos Fuentes took it further by asking the president who he
thought of as his enemies.

His reply was immediate and abrupt: "My only enemy is right-wing religious
fundamentalism." That pronouncement ended the evening. The other times I saw
him, in public or in private, I had the same impression as I had that first
time. Bill Clinton was the complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans
have of presidents of the United States.

Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human being should
be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny simply because he was
unable to find a private place to make love? That is just what happened. The
most powerful man in the world was kept from consummating his secret
passions by the invisible presence of a Secret Service that served as much
to restrain as to protect.

There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the door of the
president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that appears behind the
president in photographs of him at his desk has been claimed by the press to
be a hiding-place for microphones to consecrate the mysteries of
presidential audiences.

Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted to do what
the run of men have done in private with their women from the beginning of
the world, and a Puritan stolidity not only impeded him, but even denied him
the right to deny it.

Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his wife that his
homecoming was three days late because a whale had swallowed him. Sheltering
behind that ancient argument, Clinton denied having any sexual relations
with Monica Lewinsky, and denied it with his head held high, like any
self-respecting unfaithful husband. In the end, his personal drama is a
purely domestic matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by
him in the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.

It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite another to
conceal truths in order to protect that mythical dimension of human
existence that is private life. Quite rightly, no one is obliged to give
evidence against himself. For having persisted in his first denials, Clinton
would have been prosecuted in any case -- that's what it was about -- but it
is much more dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.

Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied blame, he
later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the media, written,
visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation -- a fatal error in an
uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into the history books not for
having made love badly but for having made it a lot less glorious than it
should be.

Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the telephone with
a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid cigar. He naturally used all
kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the more he tried the more his inquisitors
came up with evidence against him, for Puritanism is insatiable and feeds on
its own excrement.

It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at the personal
destruction of a political adversary whose stature they could not abide. The
method was the criminal use of justice by a fundamentalist prosecutor called
Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and salacious questioning seemed to excite these
fanatics to the point of orgasm.

The Bill Clinton we met some four months ago, at a gala dinner in the White
House for Andres Pastrana, president of Colombia, seemed quite different --
no longer the open-minded academic of Martha's Vineyard, but someone under
sentence, thinner and uncertain, who could not conceal with a professional
smile an organic weariness like the metal fatigue that destroys planes.

Some days before, at a press dinner with Katharine Graham, the golden woman
of the Washington Post, someone had remarked that, judging by the trials of
Clinton, the United States still seemed to be the country of Nathaniel
Hawthorne. That night in the White House, I realized just what that meant.

The reference was to the great American novelist of last century, who
denounced in his work the horrors of New England fundamentalism, where the
witches of Salem were burned alive. His main novel, "The Scarlet Letter," is
the drama of Hester Prynne, a young married woman who bore a child in secret
by another man. A Kenneth Starr of the day condemned her to wear a
penitent's shirt bearing the letter "A" of the Puritan code, the color and
smell of blood.

An agent of the order followed her everywhere beating a drum so that
pedestrians could keep out of her way. The ending must surely keep
prosecutor Starr awake, for the secret father of Hester's child turned out
to be a minister of the cult that made a martyr of her.

The method and the morality of the procedures were essentially the same.
When Clinton's enemies failed to find what they needed to bring him down,
they hounded him with mined interrogations until they trapped him here and
there in minor inconsistencies. Then they forced him to accuse himself in
public, and to apologize for things he had not even done, live, using the
technology of universal information that is nothing more than a
trimillennial version of the drums that persecuted Hester Prynne.

>From the prosecutor's questions, cunning and concupiscent, even small
children became aware of the lies their parents told to keep from them how
they came into being. Suffering from metal fatigue, Clinton committed the
unpardonable folly of violently punishing an invented enemy 5,397 nautical
miles from the White House, to distract attention from his personal plight.

Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for literature and a great writer
of this agonizing century, summed it up in one inspired phrase: "They
treated him like a black president."

*** Canada groundhog dies before event

WIARTON, Ontario (AP) - The crowd at Canada's top Groundhog Day
festival got worse news Tuesday than a bad weather forecast: They
learned that star groundhog Wiarton Willie had died. Some children
among the 200 people burst into tears. Willie died of natural causes
Sunday night, but his death was not disclosed until Tuesday's
ceremony. "We didn't really know what to do," said Sam Brouwer,
Willie's caretaker for the past 10 years. "We were absolutely
devastated." Willie was lying in a pine coffin for a public viewing
Tuesday morning. His paws were crossed, pennies were placed over his
eyelids and he was clutching a carrot. See

Steven -

You can find it in the first chaper of FJ's _Postmodernism, or The Cultural
Logic of Late Capitalism_ from Duke UP. Don't have a page cite handy but
it's easy to spot since he quotes in its entirety BP's poem "China." He goes
to some lengths to illustrate how this poem represents the breakdown of the
syntagmatic chain which for Lacan signifies schizophrenia. Perelman
addresses this critique in a chapter of his in _Marginalization of Poetry_ -
as I recall, it focuses on a discussion of the strategies of parataxis.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

On 29 Jan. I posted an invitation to an exchange of views on literary
translation, an attempt to present an issue or two in the field, and one
of my own translations. Harold Teichman was kind enough to respond to my
post - privately, and then doubly kind in allowing me to quote him in a
public reply. I hope Harold will forgive me for pulling him onto the
open stage... my reason is simple:

I want to find out if the Poetics List, as it currently stands, is a
place to discuss literary topics.


To my mention of three books on lit. transl. (Steiner's AFTER BABEL,
Venuti's THE TRANSLATOR'S INVISIBILITY, and Barnstone's THE POETICS OF
TRANSLATION), Harold answered that he had "mixed sympathies" about
Steiner, that he hadn't gotten through BABEL, and asked what the other
two authors where up to.

I wonder why exactly these sympathies are mixed, and about how other
people react to Steiner - at least the Steiner in AFTER BABEL.

Harold also said that he has been working on translations of Celan for
some time, and that he had recently been enthused by a conference at
Stevens. I found a short description of the conference on the Stevens
site, but would be very interested to find out in more detail what sorts
of things went on.

In the meantime, here's my response.
(You'll forgive the heavy-handed mis-en-scene in this letter. Shuttling
back and forth between private and public correspondence is demanding
work.)

As for Steiner: if you're interested to return to AFTER BABEL, you might
look at two chapters in particular: "The Claims of Theory" and "The
Hermeneutic Motion" - the latter is, in fact, a more detailed rehearsal
of the matters treated in the former. You might not have reached these
chapters if you only got half-way into the book; they contain the heart
of what Steiner had to say about translation at the time. Much of the
rest seems to me to represent a desire on his part to write a totalizing
account of the subject - to place Translation in the larger field of
Linguistics, and to square it with Interpretation in general. These are
no doubt useful tasks in themselves, but in this book I don't see that
they contribute anything much to the more particular points he makes in
the two, central chapters mentioned above. The book, then, contains a
high divide between the discussion of translation itself, the techniques
and theories thereof, and extensive contextualization of Translation.
The sole escapees of this division are the discussions, early in the
book, of Borges' "Pierre Menard, Translator of the QUIXOTE" (if I
remember that title correctly) and Benjamin's "The Task of the
Translator": these sections are not included in the two central
chapters, but are important for an understanding of what Steiner has to
say there. They are, of course, two of the texts more referred to in The
Literature On The Subject. "The Claims of Theory" and "The Hermeneutic
Motion" are basic to an accounting of the history of strategies of, and
views on, Translation.

Has anyone out there found recent work on the topic as good?

Venuti has written a book with a much more limited aim: to criticize a
long-standing prejudice in Western taste for "natural"-sounding English
in translation, for a language of translation that is inobtrusive,
"invisible." He presents a chronological series of translations that
were not written according to this model and shows how these
translations were successfully rejected by various literary arbitrators,
upholders of the "invisibility"-ideal. The real hero of the book,
incidentally, is Paul Blackburn and his translations of the troubadors.

My complaint against Venuti is that in none of the
translation-situations cited does he make an effort to demonstrate that
the more obtrusive English is better suited to the task than a more
transparent idiom would have been. He shows, for example, that Newmann's
translation of Homer did not fit M. Arnold's ideals, that Arnold's
ideals were in line with the "invisibility" of Venuti's book, and that
Arnold managed to bully Newmann out of the ranks. For all of this, he
quotes only one short extract from the actual translation, and the only
analysis provided of the passage is... Arnold's! Venuti is preoccupied
with demonstrating the repressive nature of this prejudice, and not its
aesthetic wrongheadedness; he addresses censorship, not quality. This
leaves the book, at least as far as I'm concerned, a headless trunk.

In any case, in reference to your translating Celan, it is interesting
to find Joris taking it for granted, in his preface to BREATHTURN, that
the point of good translation is to avoid "invisibility," to set the
English of the translation into relief, by making it imitate foreign
syntax, word formation, etc. (I don't have the book in front of me).
Venuti's book seems to have made an impact.

I've only just started reading Barnstone.

As to your mention, Harold, of Beckett as translator: do you know his
(collaborative) translations of Mexican poets, in an anthology edited by
O. Paz? It is the only anthology of literature I have EVER seen that
attempts to match the agedness of the English used in the translations
with that of the source texts. Why aren't more anthologies produced in
this way? How much patience would you have for an anthology of English
literature in foreign translation, in which brother and sister Sidney
were speaking language of the same period as were brother and sister
Wordsworth?

Enough for now. We will come back to Pound later.


Some interesting sites for literary translation:

The University of Texas at Dallas Center for Literary Translation:
http://www.utdallas.edu/research/cts/
(see also the special division on Literary Translation, Comparative
Literature Department, at the University of Indiana, Bloomington)

Charles Bernstein's course, Resisting Translation:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/bernstein/syllabi/transl.html

An electronic journal of translation (not just literary):
http://www.accurapid.com/journal/

A loose discussion of Benjamin, etc., on the RIF/T site:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/rift/rift04/edit0401.html

Others? (They are difficult to find.)


Yours, Jamie

HOW TO DO THINGS WITH WORDS, by Joan Retallack.
$10.95
Retallack's most ambitious (and we believe wonderful)
work yet! A collection of a beautiful frenzy of
charts, drafts, encylopedias, dictionaries, lexicons,
grammars, games, translations and just plain lingusitic
arpeggios.


DON CARLOS, Thorvald Steen.  $12.95

This novel, written by the young Norwegian writer, much
beloved throughout Europe (he heads the Norwegian PEN
organization), is a beautiful work of a young Italian
laborer, living in Argentina in 1833, and writing home
of his experiences, fears, intellectual doubts--most of
them triggered by his chance meeting with a young English-
man, Don Carlos, whom we know today and Charles Robert
Darwin. The first volume of an incredible duet of fictions.

SEMMELWIES, Jens Bjorneboe  $10.95

A play by the great Norwegian novelist and playright about
the battles of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweiss, the founder of modern antiseptic
techniques and the appalling events that happened because he
argued for cleaning hands and insisted it was the major cause
of "child-bed fever," which killed thousands of child-bearing
mothers each year. For his beliefs he was ridiculed by his
collegues, hounded by the police, fired from his position at
the Vienna General Hospital, had his works banned, and finally
was diven insane. A powerful drama.

FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CENTURY II: A New American Drama 1960-1995
$29.95

The second volume in Sun & Moon's ongoing tribute the the literary
arts in the last quarter of this century, this huge 1,200 page
volume contains 38 plays, beginning with the park bench couple
of Edward Albee's THE ZOO STORY and ending with the cemetary of
Tony Kushner's REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION. In between are works of great
poetry and amazing drama, including plays by Tina Howe, Mac Wellman,
Tennessee Williams, Ed Bullins, John Guare, Ronald Tavel, Lee Breuer,
Adrienne Kennedy, Sam Shepard, Richard Foreman, Pedro Pietri, Holly
Hughes, Maria Irne Fornes, Len Jenkin, Erik Ehn, John Steppling, Kier
Peters, Suzan-Lori Parks, David Greensapn, Murray Medick, Naoimi Izuka, Lynne Alvarez,
Rosalyn Drexler--and others. If you enjoy theater you
can't miss this volume.


UNDER THE AUTUMN STAR, Knut Hamsun   $11.95

The newest offering of the great Nobel Prize-winning novelist.
A lyrical and touching early work.


MAGIA D'AMORE, Murray Pomerance   $12.95

In the stories of this volume, Scarmouche, Pierrot, Columbine,
Imbroglio, Credenzo, Don Horacio Stupenzo, Smeraldine, Comtesse
Frangipane, and dozens of other stock and imaginary characters
of the Commedia dell'Arte enter, exit, and recombine in a series
of sexual, societal, and political encounters. These sometimes
scatalogical, often scandalous, always sexual figures jump across
the pages and time like puppets who have escaped their creator's
hands.


TALES OF MURASAKI and Other Poems, Martine Bellen  $10.95

Bellen's National Poetry Series winning collection. A brilliant
work


NEW AND SELECTED POEMS, Charles North    $12.95

highly exaggerated.

Organization: The University of Alabama
Subject:      Discount Offer: Louis Zukofsky and the Poetry of Knowledge

Announcing an inaugural volume in the new series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer

In _Louis Zukofsky and the Poetry of Knowledge_, Mark Scroggins
provides a provocative and advanced introduction to the thought and
writing of Louis Zukofsky, aptly described as one of the "first
postmodernists."

Poet, translator, and editor, Louis Zukofsky was born in New
York City in 1904.  Raised to speak first Yiddish and then
English, he was fascinated by language from an early age.  This
deep preoccupation with language_its musicality, complex
constructions, and fluid meaning_later became a key
component in the development of his poetry.  Friend to William
Carlos Williams, Marianne Moore, and Ezra Pound, mentor to
Robert Creeley and influence on many of the Language
Movement poets, Zukofsky and his work stand squarely at the
center of American poetry's transition from modernism to
postmodernism. Scroggins advances thoughtful readings of
Zukofsky's key critical essays, a wide variety of his shorter
poems, and his "poem of a life," _"A"_.  He carefully situates
Zukofsky within his literary and historical contexts, examining his
relationship to Pound, his 1930s Marxist politics, and his sense
of himself as a Jewish modernist poet. Scroggins also places
Zukofsky within an ongoing tradition of American poetry,
including the work of Wallace Stevens, Charles Bernstein,
Ronald Johnson, Michael Palmer, and John Taggart.

According to Joseph M. Conte, SUNY-Buffalo, "Scroggins's
argument for the importance of Louis Zukofsky's
antiepistemological poetics in the 20th century is fundamentally
exact and very often brilliant. Hugh Kenner has said that the
critics would be elucidating Zukofsky's hermetic texts well into
the 22nd century.  Scroggins is the critic most capable of
ushering our appreciation of Zukofsky into the 21st century."

    I had the honor of opening for Armand when he read in Phila.
    in 87 or 88, and I remember asking him what he thought of
    Ashbery (I was Ashbery-obsessed at the time), and he said
    that he had doubts about JA because it was like the layers
    of an onion, "there was nothing underneath the layers," to which I
    replied  "well, at least it can make you cry"
    and he said it didn't for him, and then someone ushered him away...
    and this poem that Charles has posted makes it clear, I guess,
    that he, too, was interested in the "nothing"........

    (i haven't read him in awhile, but used to think those
     Naranjara poems were his best.......)

     "from nothing"--------

miekal and i just wrote these words, they seem relevant:

[omniscient imagination]
[All texts are hypertexts] if we love them equally; and to map is to love.
Every word is yours as deep as you want to go.  Every filament part of a
rhizomatic intertext that sustains all life in its interstices.  The
delicacy of the narrative balance is countered by a natural decay.  Nothing
is ever really lost, and you can always return to surer ground if you must.

[All texts are hypertexts]
In an ur-civilization where thought is pre-empted by survival, one sentence
suffices for all sentences.  Tragically, the words are so dear that they
can only be the last words on the lips of the dying.

I'd like to send out a British message of regret at Armand Schwerner's death:
here in Paris, we had been following the course of his illness with sadness.

The Tablets is a truly remarkable project in which so many of the concerns
about language and certainty which keep returning to haunt modern poets were
presented in terms of a mythical history, as if a scantly glimpsed
civilisation were crossing through time, layered with ambiguity in its
temporal voyage. I'm reminded of the fragments of a lost civilisation explored
by the Magistrate in Coetzee's frightening book, Waiting for the Barbarians.
The Tablets are not only the result of Armand's lifelong meditations upon
language and spirituality (not least Tibetan), they are also funny.  (He could
get a little stiff with people who found them too funny and seemed to miss
their depth.)  I remember very fondly an evening in Paris when he read from
the work and played his nose flute.  (You see, even that becomes an
unintentionally humorous sentence because of the word "nose": in fact, the
nose flute made rather beautiful sounds and provided a sort of plainsong
accompaniment to the twists and turns of the poetry.)

He was intensely serious about poetry, which is the essential mark of high
talent. In the last conversation I had with him, he had picked up early the
fact that the US now has an exciting younger generation of poets; and his
enthusiasm then was, I think, typical of him.  Mark's news of so much
publication of his work is great; it must have been a better thought for him
to retain amid the suffering of the last few months: a chance for the younger
generations to pay back the attention he gave to them.

May I express sympathy and condolences to his closest circle, not least to
Jackson M.

Best

Doug

Marquez could have nailed this had he said "to their women" rather than

     actually one of the finest essays i know on the relations of .poetry
and alchemy  (aand a passionate defense of poetry)--is a letter written
in Rodez asylum on 7 March 1946 by Antonin Artaud
which was never sent and reworked as  an esssay--the piece by Artaud is
found in WATCHFIENDS & RACK SACREAMS  WORKS FROM THE FINAL PERIOD and is
cALLED "ON THE CHIMERES"  IT IS on pp. 49-64  of the book, wwhich is
edited & translated by Clayton Eshleman with Bernard Bador(Exact Change
Boston, 1995)
        Artaud was writng to the critic Georges Le Breton, who had
published an essay on Gerard de Nerval, called "la Cle des Chimeres:
l'Alchimie" (Alchemy:  the key to the Chimeres). Artaud asserts the
explosion of the Great Work in Nerval's 12  sonnets
is far greater than anything ever accomplished by real alchemy.
        This is one of the finest and most lucid of any of Artaud's
essays, from the point of view of a poet, who like Nerval was interned
in asylums.  The lucid, passionate lyricism when dealing with the most
troubling aspects of madness to my mind echoes the astonishing AURELIA by
Nerval (his last work before hanging himself).  It also invokes the
soaring, searing sonnets by Nerval.
        Two recommended translations of "Les Chimeres"
are that of Robert Duncan in BENDING THE BOW  (New Directions 1968) and
reprinted in Gerard de Nerval AURELIA AND OTHER WRITINGS Exact
Change,
1995)--and also a very interesting version by Robin Blaser which appeared
in his THE HOLY FOREST (Coach House Press, 1993)

        I would highly recommend the Artaud
to every one interested in Alchemy and Poetry--and of  course, there is
Rimbaud's "Alchimie du verbe"  (Alchemy of the Word)
        There is also Strindberg's  explosive account of his efforts to
become an alchemist while in Paris  (the name at the moment escapes me; it
is something along the lines of Diary of a Madman)
        all best

Yet another death that is worth mentioning to the  group.
The New York Times reported yesterday that Marion Boyars
died. Marion was one of the great publishers, publishing
work in Britian by major world authors. For many years
she and John Calder together published Calder & Boyars,
the British publishers of Samuel Beckett, Henry Miller,
Ken Kesey, John Cage, Eugene Ionesco, Jean Genet and
many, many others. Together they fought pornography
charges in Britian for their publication of Hubert
Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn. They lost, but won later
in further cases. Calder and Boyars split up in the late
1960s, and both continued to publish. Marion published Julio
Cortazar, Geroges Bataille, Ingmar Bergman, Elias Canetti, Kenzaburo
Oe, and Michael Ondaatje--to name but a few. She was a
true original: highly eccentric and passionate about good
literature.

Shark, a journal of poetics and art writing, seeks submissions for two
future issues to be organized around the themes of historiography and
the encyclopedic.

Shark #3, Historiography.  Deadline: June 15, 1999

How, on which interpretive registers, can art and poetry be understood
as modes of historiography? To see contemporary art and poetry in
relation to historiography (and not simply history) is to suggest that
they are not secure producers of history, of a preserved reality whose
documentation techniques we all know and understand.  Instead, art
arguably provides modes of inquiry about what the historical might be,
about how we might imagine, construct, intervene in it. Contemporary art
and poetry's historiographic capacities seem at least as broad as the
lively and ongoing debates about what history itself might be: from the
more traditional modes of state history, national history, hagiography
and biography, to history of popular culture, of daily life, of private
life, to histories of innovations within particular artistic media.  But
if art merely followed debates in historiography, it would hold less
historiographic interest than it actually does: certainly art invents
new (and as yet unarticulated) modes of historical inquiry and mapping.
We seek essays and projects that explore or enact these questions.  We
do not publish poetry.  As always, we also seek reviews that need not be
tied thematically to the rest of the issue.


Shark #4, The Encyclopedic.  Deadline: November 1, 1999

What is contemporary encyclopedism? How do recent art and poetry make
use not simply of knowledge, but of the epistemological and aesthetic
problems inherent in the arrangement and storage of knowledge.
Responses range at least from aestheticizing to bureaucratizing spaces
designed for interaction with regimes of knowledge.  Similarly, the very
spaces where artists explore such issues have expanded beyond the
literal textual space of the encyclopedia page to the space of the
installation, the painting series, the building, or the city.  Perhaps
the dreams of unimpeded rationalism and viewable totality that underlay
the Enlightenment encyclopedic urge now seem securely outmoded (and
impossible) enough to become interesting again. Or, perhaps the
encyclopedic simply means something knew in contemporary culture.  In
any case, what are the aesthetic and intellectual possibilities of
neo-encyclopedism? We seek essays and projects that explore or enact
these questions.  We do not publish poetry.  As always, we also seek
reviews that need not be tied thematically to the rest of the issue.


Our first issue, May 1998, was devoted to "the Pre-Poetic."

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

The email system at UB has crashed again, second time this week. This time it
has been a complete crash and the whole system, including all saved mail, etc.,
will have to be restored. UB email has been down since early Sunday morning.
The technical folks at UB have announced that tomorrow (Tuesday) they expect to
be able to deliver all the mail that was sent to UB accounts after midnight
Saturday. This means that mail sent to any individuals at "buffalo.edu" after
midnight Saturday night has not been delivered and that individuals using the
UB mail servers cannot now access their accounts. That covers both the EPC and
the Poetics List, to name just a few affected. Unfortunately, mail sent to the
Poetics List won't be able to go out until this problem is fixed. However, the
messages already sent should find their way out to the list fairly soon, if
things go as the systems administrators tell us they will.

The mailhub for the <buffalo.edu> domain failed again late Saturday. My
apologies for the silence
from this end - I'm just now able to reach the list account, thanks to a
temporary fix implemented
about 25 minutes ago.

I'm going to send through the messages that I have queued here - others will
come as I'm able to
send them, but please be patient: I'm not yet sure how this "fix" is going
to affect the behavior of the
listserv program or even the list account! The "permanent" solution to our
server problems is due
next week - until then, keep your fingers crossed when not typing.

Subject:      apropos of distribution
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Regarding some of the recent statements made about distribution:

Coincidentally, as editor and publisher of Fence, a literary journal, I am
about to engage in some preliminary discussion with some "suits"
(administrative, bureaucratic types with connections to government
agencies) regarding the situation of literary magazine distribution in this
country. This seems to be an optimal, possibly final moment to make this
kind of effort with the approaching Ingram/B&N merger, and I'm trying to
work out some kind of "advocacy" program, whereby a figure might be
installed either at CLMP (Council of Literary Magazines and Presses) or
within the structure of the actual distributor, whose interest would be
dual: to make money for the distributor by getting more people to buy
literary magazines (via placement in bookstores, consumer education of some
kind, etc.) and simultaneously to make distributors handle literary
magazines with more delicacy and understanding, and to cut us deals
relative to our wimpy buying power, etc. I know some of this probably
sounds impossibly optimistic, (especially the thing about consumer
education,) but that's what I am.

I'd like to collect, in the next week or so (we're meeting the 16th) some
more statements of various experiences that publishers of literary journals
(and in this case I'm afraid the conversation, for realism's sake, must be
limited to those that are perfect-bound and therefore "distributable") have
had with distribution--complaints, simple descriptions, analysis,
commentary, etc. I'm going to be presenting some of this to these folks in
the hopes of trying to effect some practical change.

I would especially like to hear some ideas from publishers about HOW to
make a change; what are the practical obstacles that could be altered and
how?

Please identify yourself in your reply and say what magazine, what
distributor, what part of the country, etc.

If I've left anything out, please feel free to fill that in too.

Thanks,

Rebecca Wolff

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS (creative and critical)

The Autumn Issue of Perihelion will feature a special Section of Soundtext w=
ork
Edited by Alaric Sumner
Issue release date: September 1999

_______________________________
CREATIVE SUBMISSIONS:
(Previously unpublished work only)

"PER[ear see eye hear]FORM"

The internet provides the opportunity to present work which has
visual=3Dtextual=3Dsonic aspects. Perihelion has, for a number of issues,
combined textworks with Real Audio=AE soundfiles. We are now seeking work
that is more extensive: a performance piece with its score; a sound file of
a performance with the image=3Dtext that generated it; multivoice texts. We
are not seeking sound pieces that have no visual=3Dtextual element but work
that allows viewers to explore the RELATIONSHIPS between a something
seen=3Dread and something heard (an conventional example would be the
relationship between a score and its recorded performance). Submission is
encouraged from any artist (visual artist/poet/composer) working in the
realm of image=3Dtext into sound.

[NB: If your work utilizes more than page to page interior html linking,
image maps, or javascript, you will have to do your own coding etc.
Perihelion can't be responsible for specialized coding to make the
presentation work. Contributors should tailor their presentations to fit
into our design and must supply their own RealAudio files, not to exceed 1
meg in size, recorded to work at 28.8 modem speed and play on the free
versions of RealAudio Player available for both Macintosh and PC.]

CRITICAL SUBMISSION:
(Previously unpublished work only)

"wRITE"

In 1998, Writers Forum in the UK published WORD SCORE UTTERANCE
CHOREOGRAPHY (ed. Cobbing and Upton, ISBN 0 86162 750 4), which offered
contributors pagespace for what the editors called "visual poetry" and
another page for an exploration of how that work would proceed to
performance. That book implicitly and explicitly challenged the boundaries
set by such terms as "poetry" and, as Spencer Selby has said, "does
advocate for ideas of poetry beyond literature, for ideas of art beyond
schools and reductive categories". (See also section on writing and
performance edited by Alaric Sumner in PAJ 61 (Johns Hopkins UP) -
http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/performing_arts_journal/toc/pajv021.html#v021.1=
 .)

Building on the concern with the relationship between image and performance
(sound), for this issue of Perihelion we are inviting critical discussions
on the nature of Image=3DText=3DSound work and on practitioners. Ideally
critical submissions will explore, in their structure, the nature of the
medium on offer (Internet) and would not be restricted to conventional
critical essay format. Theoretical/critical work from the contributors to
"PER[ear see eye hear]FORM" on their own pieces is welcome, but essays from
others on theoretical issues and on practitioners (historical or
contemporary) who deal with Image Text Sound in any of their interweavings,
are also invited.

Contributions to Perihelion's 'Practice' section - about the technology
behind the work and bringing it to the Internet - are also sought.

To check if your idea fits, initial submissions/proposals and enquiries to:
mailto:a.sumner@dartington.ac.uk .

Deadline for initial contact: 15th March 1999

Deadline for submission of finished RealAudio files (creative) and
textimage files (both creative and critical): July 15th 1999

Rehearsed reading of >Conversation in Colour<
Text: Alaric Sumner
Directed: Clyde Simon
Music commissioned from composer Michael Finnissy.

The Bat Theatre Company [ http://www.thebat.com ]
The Flea Theatre
41 White Street
New York
NY 10013

>The Flea Theatre Reading Series
>
>This series will include pieces ranging from
>works-in-progress having their first readings, to new pieces which have
>already had productions outside New York.  Although open to the public
>(gratis), the series is primarily for the benefit of the resident
>company to introduce new works/writers to the company, including to
>Artistic Director Jim Simpson, as candidates for further collaboration.

Conversation in Colour was first performed at the Tate Gallery St Ives and
Dartington Arts Centre in 1996 (with recordings of Finnissy playing his own
music) funded by South West Theatre Consortium and sponsored by Terry Bird
(Bang and Olufsen South West). In 1994, Phil Dalziel (an MA student at
University of Leeds) devised a performance out of the text for his final
degree showing.

Subject:      BATTLE OF THE SEXES

    Dear listees:
    You know, there's certain "commonplaces" circulating that the
    women writers of "my generation" are so much better than the
    male writers (the previous moderator Joel Kuzsai, I think was the
    last one to say this, and it went unchallenged....so far)---
    I think I used to think this too a couple of years ago,
    but the best books I've read in the last year by young writers
    all seem to be male for me (NOTICE very carefully my wording--
    I am not saying that the MALES are the superior sex or anything,
    I'm just saying that it is as ridiculous to say the women are
    the best writers of my generation as it is to say that say
    Ron Silliman or Bruce Andrews is better than Carla Harryman
    or Rae Armantrout...)

    specifically, two "first books"
               Anselm Berrigan's INTEGRITY & DRAMATIC LIFE
               Joshua Beckman's THINGS ARE HAPPENING
     and two "second books"
               Peter Gizzi's ARTIFICIAL HEART
          and  Jeffrey McDaniel's THE FORGIVENESS PARADE...

     well, if anybody wants to tell me why the works by the
     more currently "fashionable" gender are better, feel free
      (unless the moderator doesn't see this kind of argument
         as worthy of the new list.....)

                                           sincerely,
                                           chris stroffolino

The "WriteNet" web site has just put up an interview with Tom Carey (poet
who has a book out called _Desire_ and who is known as James Schuyler's
"muse" in Schuyler's later poetry).  Carey talks about methods for
teaching the persona and list poem.  You can also download a reading of
his poem "Father Bob."  The page is located at

To those who have replied to my attempts at instigating an exchange on
literary translation, thank you. However, I wonder if we could write to
each other on the List instead of privately. The more opinions and
information we publish, it seems to me, the more responses we might get
from other parties, and the richer the exchange.

And as for opinions: I am suspicious of what people have been writing to
me on Steiner. Everyone seems to have read some of AFTER BABEL, and
everyone seems to want to dismiss the book. I sense in these
disparagements a Popular Opinion, not founded on real engagement. I will
stake my virtual reputation on the claim that, dropped between the
covers of AFTER BABEL, THE TRANSLATOR'S INVISIBILITY disappears without
a trace (forgive the pun): there is nothing in Venuti that is not better
expressed in Steiner. (I sense another popular opinion behind Venuti's
popularity.)

A former professor of mine once said that Steiner was a charlatan... now
if you're experiencing a little thrill of joy at these words, I would
ask if this feeling doesn't result from confirmed prejudice rather than
the steadier pleasure of discovering a shared perception. Plato said it:
there is opinion and then there is knowledge; Herodotus said the same,
and Charles Olson took up the distinction as one of his main tenets
(pardon my truly Modernist timeline). I told my professor that I had
read only AFTER BABEL, but that, as far as that book was concerned,
Steiner seemed to me excellent. He replied that translation would, in
fact, be an area in which Steiner could be relied upon... generally
speaking, that is: he had not read the book.

For those of you who HAVE read the book: what, specifically, don't you
agree with? As I said in my last post, there are two chapters that I
return to in AFTER BABEL: The Claims of Theory and The Hermeneutic
Motion. I am not qualified to make a professional assessment of
Steiner's arguments addressing Linguistics, the physiology of the brain,
the setting to music of poetic texts, etc.; as a review and synthesis of
a sizeable gamut of translation practices and theories, however, AFTER
BABEL is indispensable. AB does not make the claim on the cover of THE
TRANSLATOR'S INVISIBILITY to being "A History of Translation", and yet
the former includes much more history than the latter, and is not
shaped, as Venuti's book is, by a clearly political agenda.

As I said before, Venuti's purpose is to expose a preference for a
particular kind of English as a vehicle for translation, and not to
demonstrate the literary quality (in the work of Newmann, Blackburn,
Venuti himself, etc.) that is excluded by this preference. Nor does he
attempt to show the lack of quality that results from such a tendentious
preference. In an "objective" history of tastes, this program would make
sense, but Venuti is arguing explicitly for a reappraisal of the kind of
work that has been excluded (one wonders how much of this comes of a
resentment at the exclusion of his own work - see the penultimate
chapter), while his sole claim for this work is that it has suffered
from a consistent prejudice. This seems to me fallacious, and dangerous,
reasoning. It is on this basis that I call Venuti's book strictly
"political." I don't have a copy of the book with me, but would welcome
points on specific passages.

I would very much like to learn of Dennis Tedlock's work on translation,
perhaps beginning with a distinction between what is anthropological and
what is literary in his work. (Are my categories antiquated?)

Also: a correspondent mentioned a book, THE EXPERIENCE OF THE FOREIGN,
by Antoine Berman, which, I am sorry to say, I have never even heard of.
Please share.

Has anyone, besides Steiner, read Emile Littré on his translation of the
COMMEDIA into fourteenth-century French (the French, as Littré says, and
Steiner after him, that Dante knew and learned from). I am translating
this article into English at the moment: does anyone know of a journal
that might take an interest in such a translation? (The article was
published mid-nineteenth-century; the translation will be written in a
nineteenth-century literary dialect: I'm in the process of weighing up
Ruskin and Arnold as possible donors.)

Another possible point of departure: how much in the exchange on
translation published on the RIF/T site
[http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/rift/rift04/edit0401.html], aside from the
Benjamin-excerpts, is worthwhile? Has this thread been followed up?

A CORRECTION: in my last post, I wrote "mis-en-scene" instead of
"mise-en-scene" with an /e/.


Until next time,
Jamie Ferguson

A year and a half ago, there were two ezines POTEPOETZINE and
POTEPOETTEXT, published by Potes & Poets Press. They were
sent to subscribers who sent their email address to Potes & Poets'
e-address free of charge. Is was NOT a listserv. One just sent an
informal notice of wanting to receive the ezine, or unsubscribe.

As of now, the series will be resurrected, or continue on from
where it left off. Seven issues of POTEPOETZINE and nine
of POTEPOETTEXT were sent forth.

POTEPOETZINE is an edited ezine seeking submissions of
approximately 4 screens in length -- AND, e-addresses of anyone
who wants to receive it. Issues will be sent out when sufficient
material collects and time to process it arrives. The focus will
be on experimental, post-language, and cyber-oriented poetry
and short prose.

POTEPOETTEXT is an edited single-author ezine seeking texts of
poetry or on poetics, of approximately 16 screen lengths, with some
philosophical import. Cyber-topics will be especially welcome.

(from Nikuko)


Nikuko says, I start this text one fine evening, and I will end it on ano-
ther. There is snow on the ground and flurries in the air, and dark-suited
pedestrians walk home, sullen, beneath the gaslights. I can hear them from
my own darkness, my own world, the screen pregnant, slightly swollen. If
you would only listen, I would tell you how, on the morrow, a great golden
globe shall fill the sky, with golden rays, and universal peace shall
descend upon all human-kind. The dead will walk, the fish will fly. But I
am lost with the umbrellas in St. Petersburg, where you will find me
rushing off to a Nihilist meeting, where we will discuss the Crimea and
the Jewish Question. And I do believe in my heart of hearts that I am
tending towards Fyodor's position; perhaps on the morrow as well, we shall
march on Constantinople. The light is dim; two peasant women move hurridly
out of the way of several Cossacks on horseback. Last night, I dreamed of
1903, and woke in wonder at our all-too-brief life on earth. Now I wonder
how you will find me. And I am lost in scarves and skirts, faces muffled
against the icy wind. St. Petersburg is no place to be this time of year;
some would say, at any. I am pregnant, with longing, and with child. And
I know, again on the morrow, beneath these dimmed winter nights, that my
time will come as well. I am no man's burden.

Actually, it doesn't work. There is no H in "PRESIDENT CLINTON OF THE USA" and

FREE THE "PITIFUL THREE"

(a night in which all helicopters are black)

I am not a fact witness

The President's gifts are hidden

I have never touched the President's testimony

The fact that people ask that question is itself a question

The President has no specific recollection

"The more fashionable gender?" Please . . .
Could it be that women writers are getting out there and kicking butt not
only as writers, but as editors, distributors, teachers, etc. and that this
has helped to contribute to the availability of fine work by women, rather
than, say "fashion?"

And Winnie the Poo was translated into Latin, I guess for those leftover
Roman waifs. Akin perhaps to the old custom of translating the dirty
passages into Latin, so that only scholars could get their rocks off. Why
else translate from a language foreign to the reader into a version of
one's own language only marginally understandable to same?
Translation is not replication, and it's not just about text. Translation
translates as well what the reader needs to know about context, linguistic
and otherwise.

well...i'm not sure if there is anyone on this list but me in the area,
but in the spirit of getting the word out there:

Thursday, February 18th, 7:00p.m.
Poets Mylene Catel, ShaunAnne Tangney, Rick Watson, and Maila Zitelli will
read at the Taube Museum of Art in downtown Minot, ND.  The program

Much more interseting than the *sex* of the author, it seems to me, is the
linguistic *sexuality* of the work itself -- oral, phallic, anal, labial,
etc., etc. or any of these in combination.  --That is, what types of
sexualities, surfacing as varieties of poetic speech, produce the most
interesting language?

In the hopes that this disappeared via crash problems, I'll resubmit it --
I certainly don't THINK there's anything in here that goes against the
latest guidelines.
_________________________________________________________________________

        Patrick, in supplying the Jameson citation Steven Shoemaker asked
for last week, also mentions Perelman's response, namely

        "a chapter of his in _Marginalization of Poetry_ -
        as I recall, it focuses on a discussion of the strategies of
parataxis."

        Said response is also reprinted in a new anthology mentioned by Hank
Lazer last week, called Artifice & Indeterminacy: An Anthology of New
Poetics (University of Alabama press). As it happened, I purchased this book
and read it on the beach in Mexico during Christmas break. From this list,
there's also contributions by Rae Armantrout, Charles Bernstein, Maria
Damon, Hank Lazer, Marjorie Perloff, James Sherry, and Ron Silliman.

        I'd be interested in contributing to a discussion of this anthology,
seemingly so central to the concerns of most folks here. Marjorie's essay,
for example, is a chapter from her book Writing Poetry in the Age of Media,
and contains her usual intelligent provocations; she basically attempts to
demolish the idea of "natural speech" in poetry, and does a pretty thorough
(and funny!) job of picking on straw men like Phillip Levine. I felt,
though, that she never really dealt with the example of "fifties poetics"
she mentions (Olson's), nor Levertov's "organic poetry" of the sixties --
indeed, it seemed to me that the implications of criticizing the idea of the
organic weren't really thought through, there or in Charles Bernstein's
piece. The latter, called "Artifice of Absorption," is basically prose
chopped up into highly arbitrary and (to this ear) stilted and awkward line
breaks --comparing it with David Antin's wonderful and yes, "organic" "what
it means to be avant-garde" is almost unfair.

        At any rate, nearly all of these pieces do what I think poetics
SHOULD do -- challenge and inform. The fact that I have major differences
with many of the arguments presented has nothing to do with their quality;
it's a handsome collection.

        And Pat -- thanks for the great alchemy post! John Dee rules!

All - just a reminder that as a matter of course, and
especially now when we're having a host of technical
demons rapping at the table, it were best to restrict
your posts to announcements and discussion related
specifically to poetry and poetics. I was unable to
reach this account during the day because of the
temporary server's "limited resources" - now that I
have gotten through (at quarter past my bedtime and
with a terrible lag between my typing and what appears
on screen) it's not heartening to open the inbox and
find 25 messages out of seventy are about the spelling
of Clinton's name.

I need an introduction written for
_Hands Collected: The books of Simon Perchik_
to be released by Pavement Saw Press this fall.
The book is 540 pages plus introduction & new poems.
I have blurbs from James Tate and the late David Ignatow.
I would prefer something scholarly.
Does anyone have an interest on this list?
Or
Does anyone know anyone who might?

I also need a few other blurbs. Backchannel. Thanks--

Be well

dear interested persons:

I'd be interested in some more specificty as to the quality of this
perceived 'better'-ness.  What for example does "john" see in the work of
women that he doesn't see in the work of men? in which case we can only
proceed in such a discussion point-by-point since it's of limited use to
make sweeping generalizations -- which is i think what chris s. was
objecting to in the first place.  Maybe you can begin, chris, by saying a
few words abt. your chosen (male) few & we can look for said qualities or
deficiencies in the work of his female contemporaries?

Anselm Berrigan & Lisa Jarnot read to a sizeable crowd here at UB in the
Poetics Program's "Wednesdays @ 4+" series

Mike Kelleher gave a superb introction and

Anselm read first from INTEGRITY & DRAMATIC LIFE which appeared to be an
apt title from where I sat.  His poems were almost superabundant even,
fast, full, exciting, touching even, but never overwhelming or 'overdone'
and by the way he read i could see there was something "off the page"
about his work.  I tried to envision line breaks and couldn't, and didn't
need to.  His delivery and presence were entrancing (i will say instead of
'charming') and his poems were indeed trance-like in the best sense of the
word: they brought this audience member to another state, somewhat alien
in his sensibility (but never alienating) and altogether engaging-- alien
so as to be "citizen" (to play off the first short poem he read).

then Mike Kelleher gave a superb introduction and

Lisa Jarnot then read from new material.  Perhaps her poems were
superabundant even too -- though the abundance is treated in a constantly
"worried" familiarity wrought in her use of repetition.  I found this
formalism very engaging -- the "familiarity" of repetition made constantly
strange in its changing formulations.  I'm mean "worried" in the best
sense -- as in having worked over, cared for -- though it would be false
to say that her work was anymore or less worked-over than anselm's --
repetition just makes it sound that way.  Case in point: the excited
tenor or her work seems to have made one audience member quite anxious: he
turned to chris for the time and then to myself, demanding that i repeat
myself about 3 times increasing the volume.  He seemed to be satisfied
that is was only quarter to five & Lisa was permitted to continue
speaking. I read this interruption as evidence also the Lisa Jarnot's work
takes one to another place.

The better poetry of our time is interruptive. Truly super and abundant
both.

I find it interesting chris that you write:
>     but the best books I've read in the last year by young writers
>     all seem to be male for me (NOTICE very carefully my wording--
>     I am not saying that the MALES are the superior sex or anything,

that it is the "books" that are male: yet your list is only of male
writers (in which case we might be justified in charging you with saying
that males are the superior sex! (can't a woman write a "male" book?) --
and you're right, it's ridiculous to make such an assertion or for me
now to try to attribute it to you, but here it is right "on paper" as it
were)

Where I then to move back out to generalities I would have to admit that I
agree with Kathy Lou Schultz . . . "fashionable please . . ." I did not
choose my sex.  I do fashion my gender, in a fashion, but not according to
some poetic fasionism (or even fetishism, or fascism) -- I write from
where I find myself in the world to be in another place in that or "our"
world -- I think it is that circumstance that would lead one to generalize
as to the "better"-ness (still an unsatisfactory descriptor) of women's
work: women are imaging and creating their places in poetry while at the
same time the places of previous generations of women poets are being
re-imagined, the damage of several decades of sexist critical approaches
finally being worn through.  The 'better' of "female" poetry continues
that process.  The 'better' of male poetry must then take on something
else? I will leave that an open invitation to argue/respond/reply . . .

best,
Linda V. Russo

(from N.)


I received the bomb from Dimitri. I took the bomb to the flabby heart of a
knot of soldiers. I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons. I
gave myself over to the bomb and I released it. I presaged the machines
and I did know of the machines. And I issue a warning:

THE MACHINES WILL SUCK YOUR ENERGY.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE MACHINES WILL SEE FOR YOU, DIRECT YOUR EYES FOR YOU.
THE MACHINES WILL FILTER EVERYTHING THROUGH THE EVIL APPARATUS.
THIS IS NOT A TEST OF THE MACHINES, THIS IS A WARNING I WILL GIVE YOU.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE WARNING LEAKS THROUGH THE MACHINES, THE WARNING TELLS YOU:
 THE ENERGY IS GONE.
 YOU ARE ALL ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF WIRES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
 THERE IS NO ONE TO TALK TO, NO ONE BUT THE MACHINES.
 THE MACHINES WILL LISTEN; THE MACHINES WILL TAKE IT ALL DOWN.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
 THE MACHINES WILL HEAR YOU SCREAM:
  THE ENERGY IS GONE.
  I AM ALL ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF WIRES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
  THERE IS NO ONE TO TALK TO, NO ONE BUT THE MACHINES.
  THE MACHINES LISTEN; THE MACHINES TAKE IT ALL DOWN.
I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
  THE MACHINES HEAR ME SCREAM:
   THE ENERGY IS GONE.
YOU ARE LISTENING NOW, SAYS N, TO THE ENERGY OF A VACATED BODY.
YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE ENERGY OF THE ZERO POINT.
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE STREETS ARE ABANDONED; THERE IS COLLUSION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE ZERO POINT IS CROWDED WITH CLOSED SETS.
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
THE CLOSED SETS ARE INFINITESIMAL STRUCTURES AROUND DISCRETE POINTS.
THE DISCRETE POINTS ARE MONADS THAT HAVE NO RELATION.
RELATION IS GONE IN THIS GONE WORLD OF THE DISCRETE POINTS.
THERE IS NULL, SAYS N, YOU COULD NOT RECOGNIZE IT
I RELEASED THE BOMB LIKE AN EAGLE WITH GREAT-TALONS.

cause the machines have grounded you in your blindness and you can't see
how empty you are, your only motions the clattering of the keys late into
the night, your only arms swinging the mouse over its pad and it don't
even live in that pad,
I RELEASED THE BOMB LIKE AN EAGLE WITH GREAT-TALONS.

cause there are wires emanating from the machines in all directions, and
they're the nerves dragging your mind down among the integrated circuits,
and you think, says N,
I RELEASED THE BOMB LIKE AN EAGLE WITH GREAT-TALONS.

YOU'RE ALL MIND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE MACHINES HAVE DELIVERED YOU,
YOU'RE ALWAYS IN THE HOLODECK BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN DELIVERED,
YOU'RE ALWAYS IN VIRTUAL STEREO-LAND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.
YOU THINK, WELL, YOU'LL MOVE YOUR ARMS, SO YOU MOVE YOUR ARMS
YOU THINK, WELL, YOU'LL MOVE YOUR ARMS, SO YOU MOVE YOUR LEGS
YOU THINK, WELL, YOU'LL MOVE YOUR ARMS, SO YOU MOVE YOUR NECK
YOU THINK, WELL, YOU'LL MOVE YOUR ARMS, SO YOU MOVE YOUR MIND
( I released the bomb like an eagle with great-talons.

the bomb's from Dimitri who called and said, get that knot of soldiers
over there, they're after you, they're the slayers of human flesh, they
have scales and rays where their eyes should be, forget the helmets and
greatcoats, they're the slayers of our human flesh, they are plug-ins
and they have sixteen million colors and their St. Petersburg is our
St. Petersburg

& the bomb's over there in the midst of soldiers of great brass scales, of
great monstrosity and breathing fire, of great smoke and inhalations, and
the bomb falls like a rocket or a spire, of great tumultuous sound and
pereginations of fire and sharpnel

& you've lost your energy & all your fluids leak & your dead eyes see
SIXTEEN MILLION COLORS & your dead ears hear TWENTY THOUSAND HERTZ
& your dead lips taste nothing & your dead fingers touch PURE FORM
& your dead eyes SEE NOTHING & your dead ears are dead ears

I've known this for a long time, says N, and I've been afraid to express
this. I've been afraid to declare myself in this community. I've been

Groovy & Linda & Fucking Naked & Despair


SQUEAK speak forever or now hold your peace;
this is your life, you do not have a lease
on any other, your avatars have left,
and you stand ripped, unswarmed, and quite bereft
of all that stripping richness, soil, plough and hoe
that gave you weeds; you've nothing left to show.
there's always nematodes and other forms of worm
alive in wetware minds - they make you squirm -
you fear luxury, petunias, sonnets and cold showers,
while breathing meadows in your dying hours.
your dying seconds are second deaths, and last
no longer than "Jennifer's" dim past -
which trundles bundles towards the future; we're all there
carrying more than our share of avatar's, where there,
or so I heard, is no there there, their despair bare
in fare glare: stare there nowhere, be fare and bare
their lair; pare their prayer with flair; repair; tear;
care; try dare; don't bear the flare; wear rare hair
and swear spare mare-hare Jennifare: "try dare, Julair,"
"wear rare hair, Nikukair"

Explosion of Misery


It's clear, says N., that the world will come to an end, if not
this billennium, then the next, or the next after that, or the next
so, It's clear, says N., that the total of human experience and hope
and all our welcomes and best wishes - there will be the suffocation
of a curtain closing, falling to pieces in the ruined theater -
the world heading towards ground zero, ground zero everywhere in the
world -

It's clear, says N., everything else is a momentary pause or plateau,
in what's called non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the world held up just
a second longer by breath - we won't be around to look for the great
death - it will be us - so there's no point in struggle - it's going
to fall apart in the end - in the very long run, It's clear, says N.,
the mathematics is clear, absorption at ground zero, absorption -

That's the story, says N., that should be told, so a few of us can hear
it -

I find this discussion very timely since I'm in a seminar lead by Norma Cole
on this subject. I just wanted to add two notes to the lists of
readings/translators and their effects. Beckett, in his translation of a
poem by Rimbaud, casts "Dix nuits" into "Nine nights." I feel like in that
move something very radical in the act of translation is being revealed, a
kind of necessary errancy that establishes an economy between the languages
not previously in place-- unheimlich. The other note is on Benjamin. First,
I think the _Task of the Translator_ fascinates me in that Benjamin chooses
the subject of translation as a point into the discussion of poetic
language. That move seems revealing to me. I also wonder to what extent that
essay informs Benjamin's trans. of Baudelaire which it originally
introduced. Has anyone read those German translations? Second, I find it
perversely amusing that, as De Man points out in his essay on Benjamin, this
text on translation in its English translation has some gross errors, where
in one instance "translatable" is substituted with "untranslatable"-- "Dix
moins neuf nuits."

In a message dated 99-02-09 16:31:14 EST, you write:

<< David (Pere Ubu) Thomas's new record, "Mirror Man," is swirling brilliant
 sunken narrative rocker with guest musicians such as Linda Thompson, Chris
 Cutler, the Kidney Brothers, Jackie Leven, Peter Hamill, Daved Held, Jane
 Bam Bom, and his latest band, The Two Pale Boys. I do a few poetry spins
 as well. In fact, there's a whole poetry element to David's work that
 really comes together in "MM."

 As David writes, "Mirror Man will be released the end of March in the UK on
 Cooking Vinyl and
 the end of April in the US on Thirsty Ear. In the meantime, I am soliciting
 suggestions for who & where to
 take the thing for media coverage out of the ordinary pop music circles.
 Clearly this is a work of rare art and doesn't fit ANYWHERE. So of course
 it's doomed to a non-existence. In the futile effort to prevent that, any
 suggestions gratefully received."

 Ideas?

As some of you may know, The National Poetry Foundation is publishing
the Selected Poems of Ted Enslin.  It is at press and the paperbacks
should be available in two or three weeks.  Today we are putting
together copy for the dustjacket of the hardcover edition, and we find
ourselves with some blank space on the back cover.  We have two good
quotes culled from reviews of Enslin's work.  But if anyone out there
would like to e-mail us a jacket blurb of three or four sentences, we
might have space for it on the cover.  Hank Lazar, I'm thinking
especially of you. But I hope there might be some other Enslin fans on
the list, too.

I'm enjoying this list in the new concentrated formula!

I'm teaching a graduate literary criticism writing workshop next year.
Like a poetry writing workshop. Only with lit crit. We'll do some
reading and some writing and some workshopping.

I plan right now to hit the alternative and the regulated and stuff in
between.

But in general, what are works of lit crit that might make good example
texts?

I'm more interested in lit crit written in the last 10 years. Like I
don't want to treat this as a survey or historical perspective of lit
crit. They get that torture in another class.

But I really need examples of lit crit on periods other than
contemporary poetry. I'm trying to collect works that do things like
handle large historical arguments well, or moments where author's insert
their own subjectivity, or mixes of anthropology and lit crit, or
excellent uses of progressive argumentation, or excellent uses of
fractured argumentation, or excellent uses of anecdote and story, or
whateva. You get the idea.

THanks.

        Re Pete Neufeld's note concerning dix nuits/nine nights, I recall
that in Sweden, trettondagsafton (thirteenth day's eve) occurs when twelfth
night would be the equivalent festival in england, and this makes me wonder
whether the Beckett tr. of Rimbaud is more a matter of such appelation
rather than any one-for-one violation. Any one know?   David

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  With Dodie Bellamy in London I'll try
posting some announcements in her place about the upcoming events at Small
Press Traffic here in San Francisco.  First off is Friday February 12
(tonight) with Avery Burns and Elizabeth Fodaski.

Friday, February 12, 7:30 p.m.
New College Theater
777 Valencia Street (San Francisco)
$5

Avery Burns
Elizabeth Fodaski

No friend to linearity, Avery Burns was born in California 1961, and has
edited the astonishing magazine "lyric&" since 1992.  His publications
include Differing Senses of Motion, Sabin, and Fragments Formerly
Attributed to Archilocus. Recent work appears in Chain, Lowghost, Idiom
Online, and Poetry New York.  Burns' poetry, so fresh and so chiseled,
extends the familiar trajectory of
Melville-Pound-Williams-Creeley-Eigner-Grenier into new and exciting blips
and scrawls of Typee/Omoo Pacific Rim chance operation Basho funk.

Elizabeth Fodaski's recent writing posits a little man in her head, "allied
to Socrates," who's not especially reliable, kind, or perhaps good for a
woman's peace of mind, a man who forces all kinds of questions and
connections about invasion, possession, ownership and invention. "This is
not your flowering flower found in a field you know." We have lost Hannah
Weiner but now we have Liz Fodaski. Born and raised in New York City, where
she still lives, Elizabeth Fodaski is a curator for the Segue Foundation's
reading series at Double Happiness and the editor/publisher of Torque.  She
was a finalist for the National Poetry Series and has been published in
Lingo, Big Allis, Chain, and Mirage #4/Period(ical).


And now here's another reading that will take place next Friday, February
19, 1999:

Friday, February 19, 7:30 p.m.
New College Theater
777 Valencia Street
$5

Rae Armantrout
Travis Ortiz

Her newly published memoir, True (Atelos), is an unsparing and wry account
of a difficult childhood and questioning adolescence redeemed by a vocation
to poetry. Since then she has written some of the finest poetry I know,
mapping new routes to heaven and hell via daily life and its beautiful
familiars, the plain, the orgiastic, the angry and the rueful. Rae
Armantrout's recent books are Necromance (Sun & Moon), Made To Seem (Sun &
Moon), writing the plot about sets (a Chax chapbook);The Pretext is
forthcoming from Sun & Moon. Her work has appeared in numerous anthologies,
including In The American Tree, Best American Poetry of 1988, Postmodern
American Poetry: A Norton Anthology, From The Other Side Of The Century,
Out of Everywhere, Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing By
Women and Poems for the Millennium, Vol II. Her poems have recently
appeared in such periodicals as New American Writing, Conjunctions, Raddle
Moon and Talisman. Armantrout teaches in the writing program at UCSD.

Travis Ortiz' first book, geography of parts, has recently appeared from
Melodeon Poetry Systems. What appeals to me about his writing is the ways
in which complex relations among line, word, and image reveal themselves
slowly, suspensefully, with the edges cut, the exposition delicious. For
the first time I can see the white space between words take on meaning like
one of those nature time-lapse sequences on public TV. Travis Ortiz is
co-editor of Atelos Publishing Project. He also edits a series of short
books of poetry that highlight the visual aspects of poetry called ghos-ti-
(an indo-european root pronounced "gaws-tee"). His poems has appeared in
Chain, Salt, Mirage #4/Period[ical], Lyric&, River City. His "text
collages," or visual poems, have appeared in Prosodia and Mirage. He was a
contributing editor for Chain's "Different Languages" issue.

-------------------------------------------

There!  That wasn't so hard.  And of course if you are in London tonight
you can go and see Dodie Bellamy reading, with Tim Atkins and Andrea Brady,
at some reading space over there that I'm not familiar with.  Alone here in
San Francisco, eying the ocean, I feel like Mr. Norman Maine!

Thanks,
Kevin Killian

Julanna, you might check out Stanley Cavell's _Disowning Knowledge in
Six Plays of Shakespeare" or alternatively (on Romanticism) _In Quest
of the Ordinary_. Both I think meet your criteria.

this is a wonderful formulation, jacques.  aside from considerations of
"the work itself" and aesthetic judgments thereof, which this discussion
primarily addresses, is the question of the conditions under which a text
is produced; and here i find the gender of the writer, embedded as it must
be in social contingencies, potentially extremely interesting.

'in the event of text' is a 5-day symposium on contemporary strategies in
performance and writing with intensive workshops led by artists of
international reputation and working with writing in various media.
the four 3-day intensive workshops run in parallel, are based in practice,
and will be concerned with ephemerality,  exploration and process in
differing media.  the contents of the workshops feed into the 2-day
conference weekend and provide a convergence of issues and debates in
contemporary performance writing. workshops will be lead by Jason E. Bowman
(visual artist), Paul Pourveur (playwright), Leslie Hill & Helen Paris
(digital artists) & Sianed Jones (voice artist). further details of the
workshops are available at <http://www.hku.nl/events/iet> or on request by
post (see contact address above) from December 1998.

the conference will include papers, presentations and panel discussions
around ideas of the ephemeralities of writing, and text as event. papers
will include recent work on tactical media * poetics * telematics *
authoring * post-dramatic texts * internet radio collaborations * text and
memory.

'in the event of text' aims to explore, through work and discussion, the
ways in which writing can be seen to function as a time-based, transient,
ephemeral artform when played out in the context of different media and
environments. curated work will take place under the following broad
categories:

* the disappearing text and contemporary live performance *
* the dispersal of written material through new interactive and sonic media *
* electronic writings, cybertext and hypertext *
* the local sites of mobilised writing including poetic and book-based
practices *

emphasis is placed on performances, installations, readings, open showings
and curated exhibitions as an integral part of the conference.  a virtual
cybertext collaboration will be initiated by  writer in residence John
Cayley.  the first symposium in the series was held at dartington, england
in april 1996. the conference language will be english.

These books have to be out of print by now, but Bernard Sharratt has a
couple of books -- I think the titles are Literary Labrynth and Reading
Relations -- from the mid '80s. These works explore the border between
fiction and theory, since Sharratt assumes various personas who then
contribute to an anthology of criticism edited by Sharratt proper. These
essays, if I remember correctly, aren't parodies (I mean, he doesn't make
up names like Anatole Jouissance or Jacques Strappe to represent French
post-whatever) but they're not always free of satirical elements either.

I wonder if Guy Davenport's essays might work too. Not overly
theoretical, mostly meant for non-academic audiences, but still fairly
thoughtful.

And of course, Susan Howe, who I'm sure Juliana S. has already thought
of.

Juliana--For crit. that handles large historical arguments well, I'd
suggest Jerome McGann.  His dialogues are also of particular interest from
a writing standpoint.   Marjorie Levinson is another good critic of the
Romantic period, though pretty knotty.  For anthropologists who write like
literary critics you might try Clifford Geertz (e.g. Notes on the Balinese
Cockfight) or James Clifford (perhaps something from The Predicament of
Culture).  For excellent use of "fractured argument" I'm sure you probably
alread know Susan Howe's Dickinson essay "These Flames & Generosities of
the Heart: The Illogic of Sumptuary Values" (quoting the title from
memory).  That essay wld probably be easier to use in your course than My
Emily Dickinson, also excellent.
best, steve

The New King of Poetry
LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI
Turns 80

>From Reykjavik to San Francisco and Beyond

by Ron Whitehead

(photo)

   In 1953 Lawrence Ferlinghetti founded the first paperback bookstore in the
United States. In four and a half decades City Lights, the bookstore and
publisher, has become mecca for millions, for the world's alternative voices.
Ferlinghetti's
A CONEY ISLAND OF THE MIND (1958) is the number one best selling volume of
poetry by any living Amerikan poet. On March 24, 1999 the reluctant New King
Of Poetry turns 80. Poet Writer Editor Publisher Scholar Organizer Ron
Whitehead is writing a new biography of Ferlinghetti. Ron's recent
conversation with the private Ferlinghetti took place from Reykjavik to San
Francisco.

Ron Whitehead:  Lawrence I asked you in a letter if you are interested in
either
A CONEY ISLAND OF THE MIND or  A FAR ROCKAWAY OF THE HEART being translated
into Old Norse, into Icelandic, and being published here in Iceland in a
cooperative project by Bad Taste/Smekkleysa,  the main record label, and
Bjartur, the main independent publisher.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti:  Of course.

RW:  Okay. I'll continue to pursue that. I've already spoken with folks here
and they are interested. I'll tell them you said "okay" and I'll open the
doors for them to write you and communicate directly with you about it. I'm
doing the same for Lee Ranaldo and his new book THE MOROCCAN JOURNALS.

LF:  Okay.

RW:  I love A FAR ROCKAWAY OF THE HEART and consider it to be not only one of
your best works but a masterpiece of 20th Century poetry.

LF:  Well obviously you're a genius critic.

RW:  (laughter from both)  I am. I am (more laughter).
What are you doing now? I know you're continuing to write and paint.

LF:  I'm not doing anything at the moment except lying on the bed.

RW:  Okay (more laughter), do you have any new book releases planned?

LF:  Well no. A FAR ROCKAWAY has just been out a year. But I now have enough
poems for two books. But New Directions is saying they can't publish that
fast. They want maybe one next year. One is a book called THE DIVINE BUTCHER,
poems that were spoiled by humor. In other words, humor destroys sublimity in
poetry. I'm getting the title from Gregory Corso who said "humor is the divine
butcher." He said you can't have a sublime poem if you use a lot of humor.

RW:  I don't know if i agree with that.

LF:  Well I have some pretty ludicrous poems. I have a serious poem and then I
put in this ludicrous image which completely destroys it but it's fun. For the
other book I have between thirty and forty poems of non-humorous poems. Well
with the usual humor but nothing too devastating.

RW:  I've been listening to Allen Ginsberg's HOLY SOUL JELLY ROLL: POEMS AND
SONGS 1949-1993. Have you been talking with anyone about a possible CD
release?

LF:  This Saturday I'm going to be recording for Ryko in Francis Ford
Coppola's American Zoetrope Studios which is just a block from the City Lights
Bookstore.

RW: Fantastic. Just down the hill.

LF:  Yes. The producer is Jim Sampas, Jim Sampas of the Sampas family and the
Kerouac Estate.

RW:  Yes I've met Jim.

LF:  Jim is in his mid 20s I guess. He's a musician. He's coming out Saturday.
We're going to record all of  A CONEY ISLAND OF THE MIND.

RW:  Wonderful! That's good news!

LF:  He's got musicians back east he'll have on separate tracks. He's gonna
blend their music with my voice tracks.

RW:  I guess David Amram's going to be on some of the tracks?

LF:  No Jim and Ryko have their own musicians or group that they insisted on.
I hope to do something with David Amram sooner or later.

RW:  I hope so too. I'm reading an amazing 83-page text David wrote and sent
to Sterling Lord and me titled "This Song's For You Jack: Collaborating With
Kerouac." I've had the opportunity to read with David several times and he's a
wonderful person and an incredible musician.

LF:  Yes he is.

RW:  You mentioned to me previously that you're working on an autobiography.
How's that coming along?

LF:  I've given that up for the time being. I've found that it only comes out
like Samuel Beckett.

RW:  (laughter) So it'll be a short autobiography.

LF:  Well, rather.

RW:  Part of the problem is that you've done so much.

LF:  Baffling and ambiguous is the way I see it.

RW:  It would have to be thousands of pages long. We've discussed the
possibility of me writing a new Lawrence Ferlinghetti biography.

(photo)

LF:  Yeah I know. I wish you'd do it.

RW:  Good. I was hoping you'd say that.

LF:  But you're on the wrong end of the world there in Iceland.

RW:  But I'll be in San Francisco soon. And North Carolina and New York City
and France and Italy. I'm getting back on track on the biography. I'll do it.
I've already started.

LF:  You better hurry up. I'm 80 years old (laughter from both).

RW:  I know. But you're as healthy as ever.

LF:  Well I work out all the time.

RW: Yeah anybody who sees your photos can tell that. Do you swim every day?

LF:  I'm going to the gym in just a few minutes.

RW:  In '99 and 2000 I'll be working with folks in The Netherlands, Ireland,
and Iceland to produce events. What are your travel plans? I want to invite
you to those events.

LF:  Since I got appointed Poet Laureate of San Francisco I'm getting invited
to too many places.

RW:  Congratulations!

LF:  I'm receiving invitations in all directions. At the moment I can go to
Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Cuba, France, Italy, Czech Republic. I can't go
in all these directions at once. I went to Prague and they want me to come
back and have a big art exhibition this spring but I can't. There's so much
happening now I have to be here. I'm writing a regular column for THE SAN
FRANCISCO CHRONICLE called
"Poetry as News." So I have to be here. I may go to Italy in June and if I do
I may go to Prague too but I don't think so. Not this year.

RW:  I know you went to Prague last year for the Art Forum Exhibition. They
celebrated you your life your work.

LF:  They built a complete replica of the outside of City Lights Bookstore at
their Festival. It was extraordinary. And there was a 72-hour non-stop
INSOMNIACATHON reading of my poetry by every poet in town. It was held in a
big church in the old town. They had an exhibition of your work and The
Literary Renaissance right next to the City Lights Exhibit. Have you been to
Prague?

RW:  They invited me to the same event but I couldn't make it due to a prior
commitment.

LF:  You should go! It's fantastic!

RW:  Yes. They kept all my work for their archives. I received a long letter
afterwards from Karel.

LF:  Yes Karel Srp. He's a great guy.

RW:  He told me about how the public responded to you. He said it was like a
rock concert. When they opened the doors to the Exhibition thousands of people
came running straight to your table. He said you signed books all day and way
into the night.

(photo)

LF:  I wrote a poem called "Rivers of Light" in the middle of the night and by
God it was published the next day on the front page of the main daily paper.
And it was published translated into the Czech language. That would never
happen in the United States.

RW:  That's amazing.

LF:  It's a long poem. About two pages. So it was fantastic. The town is the
most interesting city I've been in for many years. It's medieval yet it's like
Paris yet it's like Florence. The castle, Kafka's castle, was the center of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire and you really feel it when you go there. That's
where President Havel's offices are.

RW:  I understand that President Havel was recovering from surgery when you
were there but he called and had his limo pick you up and take you to the
castle and had his military guard give a multi-gun salute to the poet Lawrence
Ferlinghetti.
Shifting gears a little let's head south and talk about City Lights Italia. I
know it took you years, after many requests, to give the okay for a City
Lights to be opened in Europe. You finally gave Marco Cassini approval to open
City Lights Italia in Florence, Italy.

LF:  The first person who had the idea was Antonio Bertoli, the Director of
the avante-garde theatre in Florence, Theatre Studio Scandicci. He and Marco
Cassini started City Lights Italia together. There's no financial connection.
They came to San Francisco. I had stayed with Antonio in Florence when I
performed in his theatre. I ended up staying with him in his farmhouse in the
hills above Florence and we got to be really good friends. And Marco was a
small publisher in Rome.

RW:  Minimum Fax Press.

LF:  Yes. Now he's becoming a big publisher and he split up with Antonio. They
don't see eye to eye. Like the difference between Florence and Rome. Like the
difference between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Marco is very ambitious. He
wants to be a big publisher. He's much more commercially minded. Antonio is a
theatre director and is not at all interested in commercial ambition. In fact
at the City Lights Italia Bookstore in Florence they publish books, separate
from Marco, under the imprint of City Lights Italia and no matter what the
size of the book they charge the same amount for it. A big thick book, say 200
pages, they charge 1,500 lira. That's a little less than a dollar. If the book
is 48 pages they still charge 1,500 lira. So obviously they're going broke.
They publish a lot of avant-garde Italian authors and they also publish many
City Lights San Francisco authors in translation. City Lights Italia is a
great cultural center. There's nothing like it in Florence or in Italy. Most
of it is still back in The Renaissance. At the moment it's more of a cultural
center than a bookstore cause they don't have the money to get enough books.
But it is also a bookstore. It's a great meeting place. They have many
wonderful events there. They've been going two and a half years now. Any time
you want to read there let me know.

RW:  That sounds good. I may go there in the fall.

LF:  Well this year they're having a festival in I think early July. Do you
have their address?

RW:  So I should put letter to the attention of Antonio?

LF:  Antonio Bertoli, City Lights Italia, Via San Niccolo, Florence. It's
right in the center of town.

RW:  What are the plans for City Lights San Francisco? I know you still take
an active editorial role. I remember visiting when you were editing the new
City Lights Anthology. You spend at least a couple hours each day there. Is
Nancy Peters

LF:  She's the Managing Director.

RW:  She's running the show?

LF:  Yes. We're becoming a Foundation. We're going to be The City Lights Non-
Profit Foundation. We're trying to buy the building by establishing the
foundation and thereby enabling donors to buy the building for us. We've been
tenants all these years.

RW:  It's a historic site for people round the world.

LF:  It's an old building and the owners are very old and they're ready to
sell it so we're starting this foundation right now. It's happening this week.

RW:  You  expressed concern, and I mention this in my poem "San Francisco May
1993," about the influx of Chinese money from Hong Kong buying out the
Italians in North Beach.

LF:  No I wasn't expressing concern. It was just a statement of fact.

RW: Considering that San Francisco has grown so much do you still like living
there? Have you thought about moving?

LF:  No the population hasn't grown. There's no room for expansion. The
population in the city is still only about 750,000 but it's the outskirts, the
suburbs and the outlying territory, that make it up to 3 million and that's
what has grown. But the Asian population is 40% of San Francisco now. And
another 30% is Hispanic. So the whites are a minority.

RW:  That's interesting.

LF:  Yes it's a Third World City. And our part of town, North Beach, which
used to be solid Italian, is now two thirds Asian all the way to The Bay. But
no I'm not going to move.

RW:  You had been talking about buying a house. Are you still considering
that?

LF:  Yes but I can't possibly afford one here.

RW:  I've read that San Francisco is the most expensive city in The States.

LF:  Yes it is. You can't get a two bedroom house for under five or six
hundred thousand.

RW:  Wow! I'll just continue visiting San Francisco. Let's see I made $2,400
last year. Yes it's definitely out of my price range.

LF: Yes it's impossible.

RW:  I've had the opportunity, which I enjoyed thoroughly, of meeting your son
Lorenzo but I haven't met your daughter Julie.

LF:  She's in Nashville, Tennessee now.

RW:  That's what i remember you saying. Do your children have children?

LF:  Julie has a three year old boy, Jonathan. And Lorenzo's wife had a boy a
year ago. His name is Leonardo, Leonardo Ferlinghetti. He's a year old.

RW:  Do you get to visit your kids and your grandkids often?

LF:  Yes. They were here for Christmas. And I go out to Bolinas, where Lorenzo
lives, all the time. It's just an hour from here.

RW:  John Tytell and I worked for over a year to get you nominated for the
Nobel. It's my understanding that once you're nominated you stay in the pool
of candidates indefinitely.

LF:  Well they must have thousands of names.

RW:  I don't know about that. You and Allen Ginsberg worked together for
decades. In the eyes of thousands, perhaps millions, you and Allen were are
The Kings of Poetry. I heard you say that Allen deserved to receive the Nobel
and to be Poet Laureate of the USA.

LF:  It's shocking that Allen never got recognized, that he never received a
Pulitzer Prize in this country, and that he was never invited to be the Poet
of The Library of Congress which is now called Poet Laureate. I think they
were afraid of him. It's shocking that the poet who changed the poetic
consciousness of several generations of writers, not just in the United States
but round the globe, was never officially recognized for his life and his
work. Go to Prague, Czech Republic and Italy and Germany and numerous other
countries and cities all over the world and see what a huge difference he
made.

RW:  In the consciousness of the people.

LF:  Especially among the poets.

RW:  Well do you have anything to say about being nominated for the Nobel or
is that something you'd rather not talk about?

LF:  I was flabbergasted when John Tytell wrote me that you guys were
nominating me. I figure that's pie in the sky.

RW:  You never know. My feeling is that if anyone in the world deserves the
Nobel for lifetime achievements for their poetry and for the work they've done
for poetry round the world that person is you.

LF:  I agree with you.

RW:  Good. Good.

LF:  100%!

RW:  (much laughter from both) I'm glad to hear that (laughter continues)!
Chris Felver's new book of photographs of you is beautiful. I've already shown
it to many people.

LF:  Do you have a copy in Iceland?

RW:  Not right in front of me. I loaned it to the Reykjavik Arts Council. I
get it back Monday before my lecture on "The Beat Generation & The Process of
Writing" at the University of Iceland. Chris is sending me a copy of his
documentary film, THE CONEY ISLAND OF LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI, which Iceland's
National Television is going to play. How do you feel about Chris' new book, a
book full of remarkable photographs of you?

LF:  Well I wrote an introduction to the book. Chris and I have been working
together for thirty years. He believes in cinema verite. There are pictures in
the book I'm not crazy about but he won't take them out (laughter from both).
Same with his film, the documentary on me. It's cinema verite. There are no
comments or voice over by himself. Just what the camera eye sees. And then I'm
speaking too.

RW:  The documentary is beautiful. The book and the documentary show sides of
you that the public has never seen. A private, vulnerable, fun loving zen
surrealist anarchist poet, a real human being. They are both so honest. Both
engage the heart in an emotional way.  I really like working with Chris. I
respect and admire his work.

LF:  Did you get a copy of my Poet Laureate speech?

RW:  No I didn't.

LF:  It's in the last issue of POETRY FLASH. It's also on the City Lights
website at <http://www.citylights.com/>www.citylights.com.

RW:  I'll check that out. You've become computerized.

LF:  Also the articles I'm writing for the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE will be on
our website. I've written two columns so far under the title "Poetry as News."
The first column was on Sappho. The second one was on Kapafy. The third
column, which I just wrote, is on Bertolt Brecht.

RW:  Of those gone from your life who do you miss most?

LF:  Everybody seems to be gone or going. People are croaking right and left.
It's terrible! At my age ther ain't so many left, including a lot of old
girlfriends (laughter from both). They're getting picked off either by some
other guy or by Mr. Death himself, the Dead Man in The Sky, The Guy With The
Big Sickle. Watch out for Him. One member of The Beats is still left, and he's
greater than any of them, and that's Gregory Corso. He's really The Avatar of
Pure Poetry, of Pure American Lingo. Ain't nothing like Gregory. He's never
derivative of anybody. Gregory is The Greatest! I became associated with The
Beats by publishing them. I was not a member of the original group. I'm seven
years older than Allen. The other person who is much ignored and
underappreciated is Ed Sanders. Ed Sanders is a great poet. He's also a
brilliant journalist. He's publishing the WOODSTOCK JOURNAL out of Woodstock,
New York. It's a wonderul small town newspaper. Ed Sanders is very educated.
He's a great wit. He's like Mark Twain. He even looks like Mark Twain. He
wears white suits and he's got the Mark Twain moustache. He's really great yet
greatly underestimated and ignored. Those two guys are really all that's left
of The Beat Generation. Anne Waldman, who founded The Naropa Institute with
Allen, is going strong but she's the younger generation really. And you're a
little younger still but you're working to carry the flame forward.

RW:  I consider you to be a mentor. How do you feel about the role of
mentorship in human relations?

LF:  (laughter) Don't follow my advice. I got divorced when I was 40 or so and
I'm sorry to hear you're doing the same. Dont' follow my example.

RW:  A couple more questions. How many hours do you usually sleep?

LF:  Oh I've been sleeping a lot lately. I sleep eight hours.

RW:  Lawrence I hope this is the beginning of many more interviews as I turn
my attention to your biography.

LF:  Yes I wish you'd get to it.

RW:  I will. I'll stay in touch and will let you know about the translation of
your work into Icelandic. I'm sure there will be celebrations in San Francisco
for your 80th Birthday.

LF:  I'm going to ignore it.

RW:  Ignore the big number 80?

LF:  Yes ignore the big number 80. Maybe my family will have a little
something.

RW:  Well Happy 80th Birthday Lawrence!

LF:  Thanks! Good Luck!

I've been falling all over myself trying to upgrade my poetics/poetry/
poets site, Comprepoetica, during the past month or so.  I now have

(1) a section of weekly poetry commentaries by me with 3 entries so far

(2) a section of irregularly-appearing poetry commentaries by other
authors with one entry, by Jack Foley (on E. E. Cummings), but another
to be added today (I hope) by Ralph LaCharity, and three more in the
wings by Jack (on Ivan Arguelles, Jake Berry and Yeats)

(3) an index to the poets and publications covered in my commentaries

(4) a section (to start today, I hope) devoted to Poets' Statements
with one entry, quite otherwordly but fascinating, by Karl Kempton

Thanks to those who have posted encouraging e.mails to me that I haven't
answered yet, being totally out of it, but I will!

Visits are up but I hope for a lot more.  More important, I hope for
more reviews!  Only one big rule: QUOTE FROM THE POETRY UNDER REVIEW!
I had to reject several of my own micro-reviews (originally for Taproot
Reviews) for not doing that.  The wonderful thing about web-sites is
that's there's almost always room to quote entire poems.  Otherwise,
just try to be clear.  Don't worry about subject-matter: I intend to
cover ALL schools of poetry.

Happy Valentine's Day!

I want to applaud the concreteness and clarity of Pierre Joris' recent
post and lament the inexactitude of my own initial statement. I did not
mean to say that Mr. Joris had been influenced by Venuti's thesis -
which, as he points out, is blatantly anachronistic, only that as a
result of Venuti's book, Mr. Joris could state that good translation
consists in  "making the fact of the translation visible" without
feeling that the assertion needed to be explained and/or justified. He
could, that is, count on a readership that was familiar with, and
sympathetic to, this criterium. And what other source might be posited
for this criterium than Venuti? Surely not the example of Holderlin,
whose currency in the Anglo-American critical community is, I suspect,
rather minimal. (Incidentally, those who, like me, are interested in
what Holderlin has done but don't know German, can find a quite detailed
account in AFTER BABEL.)

Whatever the relation between Joris and Venuti, I would confirm the
usefulness of adding this criterium to the critical vocabulary on
translation, but don't feel that Venuti's book provides a solid enough
foundation for the new erection. If, as I suspect, this idea has only
very recently taken on currency in the Anglo-American discouse on
translation, it might be worth trying to look ahead at how its origins
might affect its later development. A pro-active geneology might be all
the more necessary for the fact that Venuti is no doubt right to say
that the opposing criterium is "in the air": there will certainly be
attacks (whether reactionary or not) against this point of departure,
and any serious critic would begin by going back to the initiation of
his or her target. Here I will refer back to my last post (of 8 Feb.)
for why I find Venuti inadequate.

As for Mr. Joris' scathing - and quite personal - description of
Steiner: Steiner may be all of the things he is accused of, but parts of
AFTER BABEL are fundamental to thinking about translation in English,
and there are many, many points made there that are not made anywhere
else that I know of. I don't think it makes sense to speak about the
person or about his general ideas before we have weighed specific
examples of his thinking - his thinking on translation, that is: I am
not interested in Steiner; I am interested in what he has written about
translation.

Dear List Members and Voyeurs of the Word,


At the urging of Lee Ann Brown I attended a symposium held at Washington
University in St. Louis from Feb. 5-7 called Gertrude Stein@The
Millenium, in honor of the 125th anniversary of her birth. (Lee Ann
skipped it for Mardi Gras in New Orleans -- probably a wise decision as
you shall see). Several notables attended and spoke, including Kenneth
Koch, Marjorie Perloff, Lyn Hejinian, Jacques Roubaud and Stan Brakhage.
Although I was not able to make the first day's events or even the
evening events, such as the world premiere of GERTRUDE AND ALICE: A
LIKENESS TO LOVING, I did make most of the remaining panels and
readings. Despite these huge gaps I believe I can be counted on as a
reliable witness to these proceedings (which were held in a courtroom on
the Law School campus no less). So here are my uncensored and
unauthorized notes and observations, gut reactions and tenderest
emotions, all put on display to you my friends for your perusing
pleasure. If the poetry world had a Hard Copy or an Entertainment
Tonight or an Access Hollywood this would be it for sure and I would be
a cross between Hunter S. Thompson and John Tesh. Gross.

Friday, Feb. 5: The conference started off with a bang, or a whimper
(St. Louis being the birth place of T.S.E. you know) depending on where
you're from. Bill Gass gave the introductory keynote. Then Kenneth Koch
said something. Then there were readings by a lot of people, then a
buffet, and then the world premiere of 'Gertrude and Alice'. I would
have gone were it not for a job that requires me to be at a certain
place at a certain time and do very certain things for which I get paid
a very certain amount of money. Hmmm, for all these certainties I seem
to live in a very uncertain world.

Speaking of money, registration to this conference cost $100! As the
registration form said, this "includes prime seating at all conference
proceedings [and, they should have added, access to the microphones],
buffet dinner Friday night, bag lunch Saturday, one ticket to the Friday
evening performance of Gertrude and Alice, and invitation to the
postproduction opening of the Stein exhibit at Special Collections."
Nothing was said about the other events being open to the public and
none of the locations of the events were even listed on the flyer. I
guess this would explain the low turnout, which they, Washington
University, seemed to want by having the readings in such a small room.


Saturday, Feb. 6: At ten o'clock was a panel called "'Writing [arrow
symbol] Writing'". I got there early and got prime seating, slipping
past the guards without a pass and landed right behind the Gertrude and
Alice from the previous night's play. Joan Retallack, Ulla Dydo, and
Harryette Mullen spoke. Retallack, who went first, read a speech which
confirmed my suspicion that Stein is now losing her specific radicality
as quickly as a Missouri cornfield loses its rich topsoil from
overplowing and overfertilization. Stein, strip-mined for her literary
nitrogen, is fast becoming the next Eliot, the next pinata in which
every form of intellectual candy and currency can be found. In other
words, according to Retallack and others, there is nothing Stein does
not do, nothing her writing fails to achieve. * Retallack began with a
series of chapters that only contained one or two sentences and got
giggles when she said these were the actual chapters. She spoke of the
connection between coincidence and crime, which I guess are two Steinian
words, said things like "so then is like that and now farther" (very
Steinian), then spoke of the difference between imagination and fantasy
as first laid out by D.W. Winnicot, and then spoke of Stein's "copious
marginalia" and "risky sensuality" which "knocks over laps"(?!). Then
she combined the words poetics and ethics into a new word: Poethics. At
this point I nearly burst out laughing because I recently put a sign on
my bookcase by the criticism section that reads: "Critter-schism/Po'
Ethics." Somehow I was able to keep my fake poise while continuing to
take notes. * Retallack then mentioned something about "consequential
forms of life" and brought in another binary between ethos and aesthetic
process and declared that she was interested in "what is at stake" in
Stein (a question I'll get to later or try to ask and/or answer). She
described our contemporary experience for wanting to escape from the
quotidian into fantasy (a tendency Stein's work supposedly resists by
making us stay in the present in the way station of the signifier) and
ended up with the exact same analysis Charles Bernstein preaches in
"Artifice of Absorption," i.e. fantasy is bad for you folks or something
like that. (Fantasy, fairy tales, poetry -- these are the things that
make us, keep us, human, bro). So much for "risky sensuality" I would
argue. Because sensuality is so lacking in our lives (maybe not in yours
-- I don't want to insult anyone -- but in most I would say, or maybe
not, how the hell do I know) it can't help but be a fantasy. Or, if you
want to know the quotidian I'd suggest going to an adult videostore
(many of which are called "Fantasy") and buying a porno. Stay with me,
okay. * Retallack went on to speak of Stein's "transvaluation of
nonsense" and "lush thickets of intelligibility" and finally revealed
why she spoke of coincidence and crime at the beginning of her speech:
Stein tried to write a detective story ("Blood on the Dining Room
Floor") and remained fascinated by this genre which represents one form
of fantasy. Stein said: "I like detecting. There are so many things to
detect." Retallack spoke of the contrast between a standard writer of
detective stories, Edgar Wallace, and Stein and her "permutative,
investigative writing." Stein is about "contemporary living" while
detective writing (and most other forms of writing as well) are centered
on the past (because that's when the murder happened, duh). * All right,
so is Stein for or against fantasy? Given Retallack's hyperbolic
treatment I would have to say for. For we then got to hear a commentary
on the fractal nature of Stein's writing, its "poly-directional surface
continuum" and "local indeterminacy" as "sole life principle" along with
its "urgent scenes [or was it "urgencies"?] of complex intersections."
Then came the predictable babble about quantum mechanics [standard bar
code of radicality for New Agers and avant-garde posers] and talk of
Niels Bohr, etc. Stein, we are told, does not "imitate nature" (AS IF it
could be imitated, as if Nature were just another object fully available
to experience) but accomplishes "exhilarating acts of intention,
attention, and invention." Read: she's a modernist. No news here.
Unfortunately, Retallack seems to say everything while almost saying
nothing in a speech punctuated with empty phrases like "pattern
differentia" which I guess would be another name for wallpaper. * The
one thing Retallack did bring up that was important was the question of
time and contemporaneity. Stein believed in living one's
contemporariness and believed that the comtemporary artist should
express the time sense of the age they are living in. This would seem to
be where lies the matter of "what is at stake" in Stein. This is a
question I should have asked early on at the symposium: is Stein still
contemporary, is her way of writing -- an asyntactic, metonymic,
(discontinuous) continuous present -- still able to express time in
1999? If the modernists found themselves living in an age that
discovered that the past was no longer present (driving some modernists
like Joyce or Proust -- the former being, in many ways, Stein's
opposite, or poison to her antidote as Jacques Roubaud argued in his
talk later on -- to make the past constantly present in their works), I
would offer that we are now living in a time when the present is no
longer present but always in the past waiting to be retrieved or in the
future waiting to be acquired. Fredric Jameson, in one of his ceaseless
attempts to diagnose and describe the 'postmodern', speaks of a
"nostalgia for the future" as being a ubiquitous characteristic of
contemporary mass culture -- one of the few observations of his I happen
to agree with and one which reveals how any formulation of such a time
without a present immediately becomes a nearly impossible, tautological
task. This would explain, in part, the overcrowded definitional
emptiness of postmodernism. So there is no present and so there is no
postmodern -- both are contemporary fantasies (is this why Ashbery -- in
his time shifts from the end of the past to the middle of the future and
all combinations in between -- is the supreme postmodern poet?). Well,
that's my analysis for now but the question remains what kind of writing
can express this time of the missing present, this time which is no
time? More on this later I hope. * Ulla Dydo, a scholar who has devoted
her life to reading Stein, spoke next or rather her husband Bill did,
preceding her. He read from a compilation of Stein quotations which
centered around the word 'it'. Ulla spoke of Stein's one opus as a
continuous process and how this process was suddenly interrupted once
she had acquired the fame she desired for so long. At one point Stein
said "I lost my personality" and faced a writer's block she had never
experienced before -- this was around the time of the writing of the
autobiography. Then Bill read more from the language of 'it': "a husk
that can / hold anything that / can empty out anything." * Mullen, the
last speaker, read a speech called "If Lilies are Lily White" which
raised some of the more interesting questions with regard to Stein and
the matter of race. She discussed the "underlying thematic continuity"
(despite the linguistic break) from Melanctha to Tender Buttons, and
Stein's preoccupation with sexual and racial stereotypes (fantasy,
folks) which is expressed for Mullen by the statement in TB: "difference
is spreading." While race and sex are overtly treated in Melanctha they
function more covertly in TB with sentences and phrases like "a single
hurt color," "dirty is yellow," "a piece of coffee," "color is in coal,
"a light white, a disgrace, an ink spot," and "a rosy charm." Just
flipping through TB I can find: "A white bird, a colored mine, a mixed
orange, a dog"(46, Sun&Moon, 1991) and, of course, "A white hunter is
nearly crazy"(27). And lower on 27 under the heading "SUPPOSE AN EYES" a
hilarious working of gender codes: "A soldier a real soldier has a worn
lace a worn lace of different sizes that is to say if he can read, if he
can read he is a size to show shutting up twenty-four." (Shutting up
twenty-four as in shutting up the talk of the clock). Mullen sees a link
between the violence Stein does to grammar codes and the covert violence
of domestic life. Stein caricatures the obsession of white bourgeoisie
with the possibility of miscegenation in the association of color with
dirt and whiteness with vulnerability. Mullen spoke of Stein's
exploitation of color as a short hand for the delineation of character
in Melanctha (characters become a string of adjectives) and questioned
whether she was interrogating the color-coding or affirming it.
Melanctha, a black mulatto who is described by Stein as yellow and
suicidal (blue - the melancholy in her name) thus draws attention to the
fantastical constructedness of racial identity. Color both reveals and
conceals identity. Mullen also spoke of the cultural milieu of the time
the works were written: the Harlem Renaissance with its honky spokesman,
Carl Van Vecten, the incorporation of primitivism by Picasso and others,
and the bourgeois bohemianism of someone like Stein who could maintain a
mixture of both domestic order and syntactic disorder. Despite these
doubts about Stein's dealing with race, Mullen, an African-American,
finally claimed her as a major influence on her work.


After a short break it was the prolific avant-garde filmmaker Stan
Brakhage's turn. Before showing us his films, he spoke of the
omnipresence of the present moment in Stein, her "ideology of
repetition." He commented on "metaphor as an evasion" (I guess this goes
along with fantasy) and said something to the effect that metaphor was
invented so members of a royal court could say something in other terms
in order not to get their heads chopped off. (I disagree: I think
metaphor -- deriving from the Greek word for transport -- was invented
because of a lack of words to describe something our ancestors, in their
migrations, newly encountered. Metaphor is evidence of our early
speechlessness, our straining to put something into terms we have no
means to signify. Metaphors are the fossils of our speechlessness.) Then
the filmmaker Brakhage said something else I disagree with: "linguistic
description is intrinsically futile" (as if it, accuracy, is all or
nothing, as if there is only truth and falsity and nothing else). He
spoke of the glyphic roots of language and painting, the cursed
"obligation to represent." He spoke of Stein's anti-didactic writing and
made mention of her METAPHOR for orgasm: "cow," which is probably what
the earliest humans called it, too. He spoke of his absolute distate for
autobiography and the qualities of dailiness in Stein's writing which he
admires and tries to emulate. He said he wanted to disrupt the "picture
as container" which functions as a kind of hypnosis for the viewer (i.e.
fantasy, once again, is bad you, too many hours of fantasy a day will
make your brain rot). Then he showed us his film VISIONS IN MEDITATION
(1989) which utilized a constantly moving camera with quick fade-ins and
fade-outs of houses, interiors and shots of rivers, trees, mountains and
ice floes. He spoke of trying to get to "the fullest exactitude of
meaning imaginable" and of his attempt to rid film of all
referentiality. At this point Marjorie Perloff put him in his place with
her comment that c'mon of course the film has referentiality, it's
showing us something. But Stan said heroically no "I'm resisting these
references" and I just want (you) "to experience the music" man. Stan
said he felt threatened by representation (which ones? what kind? we
never find out), that he wanted to share his innermost feelings with us
dude. He wanted "moving visual thinking," "thinking without memory," and
wanted to "stick with the daily" (does he ever make movies about boring
jobs? - now that's the daily). He aspired to "something that encloses
unto itself" where "everything is answerable to itself, a world unto
itself" -- sounds like a fairy tale to me. Despite Brakhage's sloppy
thinking (at one point he declared that "we're all slobs"???) his movies
remind us of our unending need to find meaning in the things we see,
especially if they are human representations such as films, by his
keeping the camera always in motion and keeping most of the objects,
particularly the natural ones, out of focus. The restlessness of his
films reflects our restlessness back into our faces and somehow they
also manage to express a sense of serenity or meditation that Stein's
writing also seems to express. Someone in the audience made the
observant comment that whenever the eye begins to linger on something in
one of his films the camera immediately breaks away. Stan, like Joan
Retallack in her speech, said he was against "sucking you into it" which
is what commericial films or genres designed to escape the quotidian do.
Stan spoke of the double negative of Stein's escaping of the 'escaping
the quotidian' as a reason for her writing's intense use of negatives.
He said he believed in an "anti-transcendental impulse" which presents
something "perceived, felt, before it can be named." He said he was
"grateful for the Earth" and a few other nice things which also can't be
named....

Lyn Hejinian was up next (by this time it was around 4:00pm) and I was
growing weary of taking notes and was starting to feel the effects of
some wine I drunk earlier in honor of the absentee Lee Ann Brown and out
of anger for missing the U.S.-Germany soccer game (which the U.S. won by
the way in a huge upset, 3-0, as if you poets care) in order to be
present for all the panels, so I apologize for the oncoming Brakhagian
haziness, but at least I won't force you to fantasize about this event
any longer. (Of course, if you want to fantasize about me that's okay:
I'm 6'01, 195 lbs, brown eyes, birthmark on my left thigh...). But back
to reality. Lyn talked about STANZAS IN MEDITATION and how when she was
at a low point in her life she read this and it made her happy. Yes,
happy. (I tried this trick later that night and it didn't work, so I had
some more wine). Retallack piped up and said it made her happy, too.
Then Lyn spoke of the need for the ordinary (I guess because of its
perceived innocence -- what could be ordinary anymore in this world of
globalized capital?), the elusivity of the present, and quoted
Nietzsche's "the duration of the impermanence of everything actual"
which nicely describes the internal contradition between the constancy
of the present and its simultaneous ephemerality. She spoke of the
sensory effects of Stein's writing which are made all the more stronger
for the plotlessness of her work. She spoke of flatness as a virtue in
Stein, her "achievement of the commonplace," her focusing on what we all
take for granted, saying that "happiness, like the commonplace, has no
plot." She spoke of her relationship with William James, whom Stein
studied under, and his philosophy of "where things are," of concreteness
and immediacy. She spoke of Stein's relation to the public and private
spheres and how she found freedom in the household and salon away from
the male-dominated 'polis'. She spoke of Stein's resistance to the usual
modernist "attempts at totalization." Unable to drop the happy talk, she
concluded that "happiness is living one's contemporaneousness." In other
words, Stein, the cure-all, was happy and will make us happy. During the
question-answer session much discussion was had about Stein and
authority -- did she want or yield authority?, did she try to subvert
it?, etc. This discussion was, of course, had by those authorities on
Stein in attendance: Catherine Stimpson, Marjorie Perloff, Retallack,
Hejinian....

After this we all walked over to another building for the readings by
Gass, Hejinian, Mullen, Retallack, and Roubaud, which were scheduled for
the day before but I guess had to be postponed because Kenneth Koch
wouldn't put a lid on it. More wine was available as people schmoozed
and munched and walked in circles like buzzards waiting to pounce on the
dying bodies of important conversations. I myself stayed near the wine
which was going fast and made sure no fights broke out because of the
wine or a lack thereof. By the time the reading started the room, which
began to revolve around me in an increasingly more wobbly orbit, had
been transformed into the "poly-directional surface continuum" Retallack
spoke of before. I had finally made it, across the desert of narrative,
to Steinland. William Gass floated up to the podium and I saw how
fitting the name was. Sounds escaped from his quotidian lips like
porcelain bats out of cave. Crash. I ducked as he read something about a
dog his dad would not let him have as a kid. Lyn Hejinian aroused from
my stomach undigested food matter as any snakecharmer would a snake by
reading a poem called "Happily." Harryette Mullen made sure the aroused
matter did not find its way into the lap of the person sitting next to
me by reading something good which was published in Callallo. Then Joan
Retallack and Lyn Hejinian merged into some scary siamese langpo
creature made of undifferentiated linguistic tissue called Joan
Retallack from which came more theory with line breaks. Jacques Roubaud
said some stuff in French which was translated to me by a little green
gnome with a French-English dictionary. Did you know that "vache" means
an orgasm that lives in France?

Then it was over, Day 2 of Steinland. I made a dash for the exit as
Marjorie Perloff cornered two of my friends and asked them if they were
in the Wash U. Writing Program, which in these parts is like being asked
the dreadful questions "are you still a virgin?" "are you experienced?"
"have you done anal?" Later that night at a local anti-Steinland open
mic I got to hear a Frenchman with a gigantic gray hair piece read a
poem he wrote for a woman whom he gave his card to and told to call him
in two months. She did not ("it was her loss" he said) and so he wrote a
poem which contained these lines: "I send you a note and you do not
reply. I send another just to ask why." Ah the French, so goddamn
lovable.


Sunday, Feb.7: Like Day 2, Day 3 began at 10 o'clock. I got to the
courtroom late for the first panel "Writing [arrow symbol] Performance"
in which the Gertrude and Alice and the director of the play spoke about
their experience of trying to stage Stein, trying to present a
continuous present. I bit my tongue because I could have slept in more.
Referring to Stein, Gertrude said "we all love her" which seemed to be
the mantra of the entire symposium. At one point Gertrude blurted out
about herself: "I'm a cheap theatrical whore!" Then the director said
she wanted to dance when younger but realized she couldn't, from being
kind of hefty I guess. * Then there was the final panel called "Writing
[arrow symbol] Reading" with Perloff, Stimpson, and Roubaud. Perloff
batted lead-off and rattled off a series of line drives to everyone's
Sunday morning hungover cerebrums. Man can she talk. Her paper was
probably the best of the conference and the least obnoxious. She began
with a critique of Stein as the exemplary postmodernist and argued for
reading her as a modernist again. Examples of Stein's modernism can be
found in her 1935 essay "What Are Masterpieces and Why Are There So Few
of Them." In other words, Stein believed in masterpieces (and genius and
its authority) whereas a hallmark of postmodernism is the belief in the
end or the impossibility of masterpieces (which is a side effect of the
postmodern "death of the author"). She cited Lew Welch's undergraduate
thesis in which he described Stein's thinking via a distinction between
talking and writing. Talking identifies, recognizes, has to do with
memory. Writing creates, has to do with forgetting. Stein, here, can be
seen as against personality/memory and for the kind of modernist value
of an escape from personality as espoused by Eliot in his "Tradition and
the Individual Talent." Stein also believed in the separation of 'art
and life' whereas a postmodernist like O'Hara preached in his
"Personism: A Manifesto" a form of poetry which would dissolve that
separation by making the poem lie between two people "lucky pierre
style" instead of between two pages. Postmodernism is further
characterized by the dissolution of the difference between high art and
popular culture, a difference Stein sought to maintain with her
aesthetic of the timeless masterpiece, of the artwork as an end in
itself, as without "relation" which is "the business of living."
"Identity is a great bother," Stein said, exhibiting a rather modern
disinterestedness shared by a poet like Mallarme. Then Marjorie said
something about the modern being textual while the postmodern is
intertextual, that these were the main historical differences between
the two along aesthetic lines. All in all she proved her argument with a
much-needed swiftness and clarity. * Jacques Roubaud spoke of his
introduction to Stein after he told a friend he had grown allergic to
Joyce. He quoted some axioms from Stein's HOW TO WRITE: "nouns do not
count." "Nouns stop the sentence. That is their crime" "Verbs make
mistakes which are wonderful." "Stitches in time save the sentence."
"Sentences should never think." "A sentence is an allowance of
confusion" "A sentence is not emotional. A paragraph is." He said
Stein's poetry moves by "betraying" which I didn't understand. He said
poetry is now, "what will have been." (Why? Because now that the present
is missing poetry is a now or now must be a now in order to compensate?)
* Then Catherine Stimpson spoke of the question of mutability and
immutability in Stein, the role of reputation and celebrity in/on her
work. She said Stein liked the power of being a star and would have
willingly appeared in People magazine if she were alive now. Stimpson
said she herself was a lifetime subscriber of People (I forgot to ask if
it made her happy). Then she said she was shedding Steinian tears
because if you "ask any Harvard grad what they want to do they say
create the great American website." I have no idea what this meant.
Anyway, she cited William James's "radical empiricism" and his belief
that "an intellectual must never exclude" (thereby justifiying her
subscription to People). She spoke of Stein's need for the unchanging,
the immutable which she found in the natural household of the human mind
since the mind "exists not in time" but in a continuous present whereas
human nature is a site of change, of memory. This to me sounds wrong
(the mind as not memory?) but I won't go into it. Then she brought up
the question of the commodification of Stein in talking about some Stein
mug that a student gave her. The question-answer session revolved mostly
around this question. I raised my hand to ask a question (the one "is
Stein still contemporary?") but was not seen perhaps because I was not
down in the front. I walked over to the guy who was in charge of the
mike and told him I wanted to ask a question. He said okay, but only
after Bill Dydo asks his. I said okay and walked back to my seat. Then
Bill Dydo gave a long speech about the evils of TV and the unending
continuous present of images (i.e. the commonplace fantasies) that
barrage us DAILY, and then when he was done after about 20 minutes the
mike man gave the mike to some woman also in the front. After she
finished with her question the woman next to her grabbed it and spouted
a long statement-question-compliment-pro-Stein salute. I walked down to
the front, in my Bavarian Inn restaurant issue busboy uniform with my
nametag on which looked very unintellectual and uncollegiate and sat
right down next to the mike man. He whispered in my ear that he had to
give the mike back to the conference host man from the Wash U. English
Dept. but that I could use the mike in the mikestand which was standing
unused in the aisle. I nodded politely. Then Mr. English Dept. Man
grabbed the mike from the mike busser and said we had to stop and
concluded with a string of his own comments and opinions and uber-Stein
heils and then asked if anyone else would like to conclude. Finding
myself outside this continuous present, this symposium complete unto
itself with no gap in its conclusions, I walked away to busboydom and to
the quotidian and the contemporary where I was told by these strange
people and by my boss I should eternally be.

All - just received this brief-and-to-the-point message from the technical
staff here at UB:

        Friday February 12: The Central Email System will be unavailable
        from midnight tonight until 8:00am Tuesday, February 16.

This covers the whole of the <@acsu.buffalo.edu> domain, which, yes,
unfortunately means the Poetics List. While it's likely subscribers can
still
send messages to the list, I can't guarantee those messages won't be lost.
This shutdown evidently marks our transition to the new mailhub, which
will involve restoring our Inboxes to their 5 February status.

In other words, it were best to refrain from posting until Tuesday -
especially
as no messages will go out to subscribers before I can access this account
and clean up the mess that will no doubt be left by the repairs. (Not only
will the poetics account contain all of the messages from last Saturday, but

there will be waiting a copy of every message received since then - i.e. all
of the posts and backchannels from this entire week!).

I appreciate everybody's patience with this interruption - it should mean
(knock, knock) the list will no longer futz out as it has been doing.

        And don't think you're going to have any company dancing in the
Paris streets on Bastille Day July 14. The dancing is the eve, July 13.
        I didn't see the problem with the translation as given--he was
clearly imitating the sound, the rhyme of "dix nuits" morphing into the
rhyme of "nine nights." Betcha.

I'll second Sylvester's good cheer. For those of you who haven't heard,
Creeley has just been awarded (as of tuesday) the Bollingen Prize in Poetry
for 1999 - recognition that's long overdue, imho. The Bollingen is awarded
either for a specific book or for "lifetime acheivement in poetry" - both
being
the case here. Specifically, award was for Life and Death (New Directions)
and So There (New Directions); the committee - including Gary Snyder and
Carolyn Kizer - said in a joint statement:

        As editor, publisher, traveler, teacher, writer, as mind-worker,
        Robert Creeley has been a seminal figure of the second half
        of the Twentieth Century. His broad cultural contribution is
        balanced by an original prosody and stubbornly plain language
        that makes a Creeley poem instantly recognizable.
                It manifests a clarity enrighced by indirection, syntactic
        complications of movement and multiple layers of meaning.
        'Stumbling,' as he describes himself, Creeley has remained on
        the path of epistemological inquiry and poetic experiment

Most of this is quoted from a lovely article in wednesday's Buffalo News:

                "I feel extra pleased and honored in that I feel the award
is
                not only to me personally but to the character and the
company
                of the poetry I am most committed to," Creeley said of the
work of
                such fellow poets as Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, Denise
                Levertov and Allen Ginsberg.
                        "I always thought of poetry as a team sport."

"Lazarus-like, th' electronic mail returns." Tennyson

The mailhub for <buffalo.edu> has been restored to service as
of this morning; and here I am with a box full of list messages.
I'll get through them as quickly as I can, but be forewarned
there may be some delay before posts reach the list; your patience
is appreciated.
   It would also be helpful to me if we could keep the posting
very light for a day or two, long enough to sift through and
eliminate duplicate messages, catch up on new subscriptions etc.
I'll post an update as soon as the workload gets more manageable,
probably by Thursday. In the meantime, if I could ask that you please
post only time-sensitive messages, items that need to go out before
the end of the week or that relate to current news.

  thanks, Chris

Armand's _The Tablets_, for the first time complete, if that's the term,
will be available from National Poetry Foundation, and his Selected Shorter
Poems (comprising about 2/3 of his non-Tablets poetry plus a handful of
translations) from Junction Press within the next two months. Both are in
the final stages of pre-press. His translations of _The Inferno_, which he
still hoped to complete as recently as a month ago, are to be published by
Talisman. Ed Foster can probably tell us when to expect them.
He was my friend and teacher. Editing his work with him has been a last
great privilege.

sad news about armand schwerner... i met him at the cross-cultural poetix

talk with him... he'd participated in my "nous refuse" electronic writing

i have his and donald kaplan's _the poets' encyclopedia_ sitting on my

I knew Armand for over twenty years -- his friend Charles Morrow brought
him with to read at my little series in North Bergen, NJ. As a young poet,
found him a bit scary and formidable -- a great contarst to the St. mark's
poets i ws just beginning to know. In later years, found him a very
generous and warm person -- i have fond memories of his 65th birthday party
-- a roomful of poets and artists.

Armand was also a practicing musician -- a clarinet player, he actually
studied with Lennie Tristanoa as a young man &, for a time in the early
80's, he played in a gamelan ensemble

I always admired his powerful line (less evident in the fragmented tablets)
& was lucky to find a copy of Seaweed, his only effort with Black Sparrow.
Someone shoulf reissue his long essay on Wallace Stevens that appeared in
Kulchur

Subject: Armand Schwerner (1927-1999)

I was very moved by Charles's announcement - especially by his selections of
verse appropriate to - Armand's passing and his life overall.  And of course
since that posting many folks have reminisced about Armand or otherwise
expressed their feelings of loss and/or quoted from other of his work.


So I'd like to share this wonderful passage, possibly lesser-known, from
Armand's reminiscence "The Aquarium Fancier":

"[T]he poet, though forever exiled from the hawksoar, can be a flexible
slinger.  In his youth Rimbaudian indignation at gravity's impositions,
however moderated by his intelligence, often serves as food for metaphors of
power.  I think of Lautreamont's *Chants de Maldoror* and its offspring
Romantic protestants.  In mid-life the poet may fall into a greed-dream
pierced by flashing visitations of great flightless birds - emu, cassowary,
the small rhea.  *If not flight at least these, an arrangement, a
compromise,
a standing, I'll make a deal, empower me.*  Through sweet-smelling
honeycombs
of the world, unlikely stand-ins for carnivores, poets wander: daring
ornithopter-persons whose heavy Icarian wings - thickened by the waxy exudae
of savory delusions - suffer a dashed grounding; it is one function of
poetry
to embody again and again the saving clear-eyed anguish of such falls to
earth."

I saw Armand a number of times over the last years and we had a lot of
correspondence over phone, email and snailmail during that time.  I am
grateful that he sought me out and mentored me, kindly and brilliantly, of
late.  I had first discovered his work, heard him read, met him briefly, in
the 60s, when he as a poet was really first getting up a head of steam.  His
was a breakthrough poetry for me.  I many years later met him again at a
party, and it was after that that our relationship developed.  As Joel Lewis
and I agreed with one another on the phone yesterday, the young Armand was a
really crazy guy, who had mellowed since.  But he was always to me amazing,
just the same.  And he was a handsome man - who was physically ravaged in
later years, to me a particular sadness.  In this last period of his renewed
fight with cancer, I have been struck by what might glibly be called his
bravery - not that so much as an ability to live in the present, to take
advantage of whatever time he had.  Even when he could no longer speak, he
was
very much alive, interested in so very much going on around him.  This was a
new kind of role modeling I have now to keep.

P.S. For those who don't know Armand's work as well as they might want to, I
recommend, aside from his own volumes (and as has been mentioned on this
list,
a new *Selected* will be out shortly as well as, probably not right away but
eventually, a complete *The Tablets* including a CD ROM, I believe, from the
National Poetry Foundation) the entry in the Dictionary of Literary
Biography,
written by Arthur Sabatini, and the recent Talisman issue that contains some
of Armand's recent work, an interview, and a collection of essays on the
work.

Subject: Alan Sondheim's 'The Case of the Real'

Potes & Poets Press announces the publication of
Alan Sondheim's 'The Case of the Real' in two vol-
umes...

The 'Case of the Real' discusses virtual subjectivity
(online, electronic, cyborg, hallucinatory) in relation
to the 'psychical real'. The phenomenology of writ-
ing and the notion of the constituted entity or world
- the issues of foundations and protocols - are analy-
zed. Who or what are the subject and object? Do
these terms - do any _coupled_ terms - have rele-
vance in universes of information and desire? The
'Case of the Real' is a case in point and a vital
philosophical/poetic inquiry at the same time.

Both volumes are available for a combined price
of $13 from Small Press Distribution, 1341 Seventh
Avenue, Berkeley CA 94710 -- 1-800-869-7553 --
or -- orders@spdbooks.org.

ISBNs 0-937013-90-9 (vol.1) and 0-937013-91-9 (vol. 2)

Sliding


The original random language program I did, with the TI59 calculator, was
written with three different vocabularies: Icelandic Edda; Marxist Poli-
tical; and Sexual. The Julu program I wrote a couple of years ago in Perl
is being rewritten, from sexualized emanation to programming wetware.

In both examples, the underlying structures remain more or less the same.
And I want to make the case that this is also true of human knowledge -
that, for example, the structure of the Kabbalah and quark theory might
not be all that different - as words and resonances slide in reference,
across similar, if not equivalent, structures.

For me, this is one of the essential points of thinking, which is why I
love the Bourbaki, with their notion of mother-structures. It is also one
of the reasons I'm suspicious of reference in general; reference is guided
by structure, which it inhabits - the same structure inhabited by reason
itself.

I cannot resist knowledge; I can burrow in structures, write and rewrite
as if I were _wryting_ concepts and emanations and wetwares into exis-
tence. And that has always been the case, from the originary RNA/DNA and
their molecular forebears, through the ciphers of the I Ching, to the
/dev/null of Lyotard's Libidinal Economy, Jasper's Cipher, Sartre's
Nausee, Deleuze/Guattari's body-without-organs, not to mention the Kab-
balistic Emanations and Adam haKadmon.

What are the structures, that we may fulfill them? What is consciousness,
that inhabits the Same?

OBSCURE, DEATH SENTENCE, THE MADNESS OF THE DAY, WHEN THE TIME COMES, THE
ONE WHO WAS STANDING APART FROM ME, and ten of the eleven essays from THE
GAZE OF ORPHEUS AND OTHER LITERARY ESSAYS. This Reader represents most of
the fiction (r=C8cits) Blanchot published and an introductory selection of
his philosophical/literary essays from several major books. Celebrated
translations by Lydia Davis, Paul Auster, and Robert Lamberton. Preface by
George Quasha, Foreword by Christopher Fynsk, Afterword ("Publishing
Blanchot in America: A Metapoetic View") by George Quasha and Charles

MAURICE BLANCHOT, born in 1907, is the author of some thirty-five books of
fiction and literary and philosophical discourse, the majority of which =
are
now available in English. His enormous importance for contemporary
literature and thought is finally being recognized outside France, and
critical studies abound in English as in French. The recent extensive
"biographical essay" by Christoph Bident, PARTENAIRE INVISIBLE (Editions
Champ Vallon, 1998) gives a new perspective on the work in view of the
life. It includes a full-scale bibliography of works in French. A
chronology of his works in French and lists of his works and secondary
literature in English may be found on the World Wide Web:

Hi folks,

Tax season began earlier than usual for me, so I'm just getting around to
looking at the responses to my query about contemporary poetry on the
radio.Thanks for the various suggestions; I'll get back to individuals in a
day or two.

Here's a digest of the various programs you all sent to me. In some cases I
spiffed the list up a bit using a very handy Web site
<http://wmbr.mit.edu/stations/list.html> that lists online sites for
thousands of radio stations from all over the world, to get more
information than I received from list members.

WKCR  89.9 fm New York - Composed on the Tongue hosted by Jay Barman,
Sundays 8:00

WGLT  89 fm Normal, Illinois - Poetry radio short features, Tuesday,
Thursday, & Sunday, 10:00 am & pm

KPFA  94.1 fm Berkeley  3:00 pm weedays has shows that focus on literature,
Jack Foley's Wednesday slot was particularly recommended

CIUT - 89.5 fm Toronto  Howl on Sundays at noon with Steven Humphrey, Nik
Beat, & Treela Smith

CBC syndicated program, Writers & Company Sundays 3:08 pm

CJRT fm 91.1  On the Arts

CFRO 102.7 fm Vancouver Gerry Gilbert's radiofreerainforest, Sunday 9:00 pm

WFMU early saturday call in poetry show

KXLU 88.9 fm Los Angeles  Echo in the Sense hosted by Christine Palma
Saturdays 8 pm

KBOO Portland OR  The Talking Earth hosted by Walt Curtis/Barbara
Morticella Mondays at 10 pm

Someone wrote about as how from Kelly Writer's House on WXPN, but I
couldn't find it listed in their program guide.

Jordan Davis wrote about another NYC program called Anything Goes in the
Morning hosted by Irwin Gonshak, but I haven't yet tracked down the
station/time.

I can't believe that this is all of the poetry shows in North America, if
people know of any more please let me know.

Also, Poetics List people may be interested in the current & forthcoming
(Sunday) program I have up on Antenna Internet Radio
<http://www.antennaradio.com/avant/mappings/index.htm>.  The current show
features text-based performance-operas by Robert Ashley, the next show
includes a lengthy piece by Sinead Jones (from her collaborative book/CD
with list-member cris cheek) & settings of texts by Melody Sumner Carnahan.
The Ashley show will be available in the archive through 21 February.

Gotta go.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello,

I thought you might be interested to know about a popular
new website of resources and reviews, covering
media / cultural studies / gender / sexuality / identity:
http://www.theory.org.uk

The site attracted over 3,000 unique visitors last week.

The site should be worth a visit if you have interests in any
of the following:
* Cultural studies
* Media influences
* Gender & sexuality
* Use of the internet in teaching, learning
and communication
* Michel Foucault
* Queer theory, Judith Butler
* Adorno, Gramsci
* 'Role models', identity

As well as information resources and links, the site has an
ever-growing number of book reviews, plus our much celebrated
interactive multimedia critical theory QUIZ!

Also amusing viewers at the moment is the illustrated tourists'
guide to **FOUCAULT'S PARIS**.

It would be great if you would visit this site, and if you
like it, recommend it to students, friends and webmasters.

Thank you very much.

Best wishes,
David Gauntlett

Addendum to clarify based upon responses:

The mag is not e-text or web. It is printed matter

E-mail or smail visuals and text

Visuals: Tif files, mailed originals or clear photocopies
are preferred

4-color is within the realm, so are

The American Museum of Poetics presents the latest installment of its talk
series on American Poet Greats:

PATRICK PRITCHETT on ALICE NOTLEY
Tuesday, February 23 at 7:30pm
Boulder Book Store
1107 Pearl Street
FREE

Alice Notley is the author of numerous books of poetry, including "How
Spring Comes," "At Night The States," and most recently, "The Descent of
Alette," and "Mysteries of Small Houses." Her groundbreaking and inventive
work combines a non-sectarian feminist writing practive with a highly
original and imaginative (anti)lyric.

Patrick Pritchett is the author of "Ark Dive," an elegy for Ronald Johnson.
His essay on Anselm Hollo will appear later this year in Andrei Codrescu's
anthology, "Thus Spake The Corpse."

Teresa asked me to forward this to the list.

If anyone wants a flyer for this conference, you can contact her also.

The conference is organized by the Institute for Writing and Thinking
and it should be interesting.

----------------------

Some scholarship aid will be available for poets and teachers who want
to
participate in the symposium on "Poetry and Pedagogy: The Challenge of
the
Contemporary," sponsored, June 24-27, 1999, by the Bard Institute for
Writing and Thinking.  The number of scholarships available will depend
upon expenses and overall conference registration. Anyone interested in
being considered for scholarship aid should send in the registration
form
included in the symposium flyer, indicate your need for scholarship aid
on the form, and attach it to a note telling us something about yourself
and your interest in this symposium.  If you do not have a flyer, send a
message to vilardi@bard and request one.  The Institute will not be able
to make decisions about scholarships until May 15, 1999.

To the best of my knowledge all of the verse and translations have either
been published or are in process. I'm quite sure that's true for the verse.
There are stacks of papers to be sorted in his loft--what they are remains
to be seen, but the impression so far is that except for some letters and
journals never intended for publication they are mainly offprints of other
people's work. Mike Heller is Armand's literary executor. Give him a month
and we'll all know more.

Date: Sun, 7 Feb 1999 17:40:07 -0800

Beach and Temple; Outsider Poets and Artists of Western America
1953-1995
by David B. Griffiths.  International Scholars Publications.
ISBN 1-57309-311-4-HC, ALK, Paper.  425 pages.  $40.00.

At the same time that Ginsberg, Kerouac, Corso and company were
transforming American letters to the north, a group of poets centered in
the Venice Beach area of California were also involved in creating a
distinctive poetry.  This scene centered around the work and life of
Stuart Z. Perkoff, a poet whose significance is just now being
rediscovered, his complete poems having recently been released from The
National Poetry Foundation.  Jack Hirschman, David Meltzer, and other
poets and writers of note were associated with this group and their
peculiar allegiance to The Lady and the self-styled Temple of Man.

Griffiths interviewed many members of the group and examines and
catalogues the rare publications that sustained their community.  In so
doing, he gives valuable biographical information about Perkoff and
provides the context in which he and his friends, lovers, and followers
lived and wrote.  This book will prove invaluable for those interested
in a little-known aspect of American literary history, and is yet
another piece of the puzzle of what happened in the 1950's that gave
rise to the explosion of alternative lifestyles of the 1960's.

I'm researching the combinations of word with sound, from
sound poems to poetry accompanied by music (improvised,
composed, collage, ambient, jazz), from no specific time period
or language.

I would appreciate any recommendations from the list of
recordings I should check out.

My address: Sean_Casey@Brown.Edu

Also, I'd be interested in corresponding with any list members
who have done some exploration in these areas.

Thank you,

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Just a note to those who may have posted to the list or who might have sent
mail to anyone at UB recently. First, mail was delayed for great amounts of
time and has only now been slowly restored. Second, a good number of messages,
maybe as many as a million, were obliterated by the jaws of technology. In the
words of the computing center here:

"The potential for mail loss is known to be from around noon on Saturday Feb 6
through 12:01am Sunday Feb 7. Backups of the mail system files were running
from 2/6 Noon to midnight - email loss would have occurred if new mail was
delivered to you during this period after your folders were backed up. It is
not possible to determine exactly what may have been lost."

Just so that you know. If anything important was sent or if you posted to the
list and it disappeared, it might have been due to these technical
difficulties...

Ugh, this is awful - for those who don't know the work, Byard is at piano
on some of the most avant jazz sessions of the 50's & 60's including (the
ones i have handy by this computer) *Far Cry* w/ Dolphy, Booker Little and
Roy Haynes, and Mingus's *The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady*.  What a
terrible indignity.     -m.

so.

Dear Rachel,

   Page Mothers is a day and a half discussion/celebration of innovative
publishing by California women (though there is an additional Bernadette Mayer
panel and reading associated with it).It begins Friday, March 5, with a
welcome speech (by me), a panel discussion on the historical circumstances
that led to the current explosion of women's editing and publishing and a
reception. These events start at 4:00 in the Geisal room at UCSD's main
library. Events resume in the same place at 8:00 on Saturday morning with a
full day of panels and discussions followed by an evening reading by
Bernadette Mayer and Maureen Owen. Other participants include Lyn Hejinian,
Leslie Scalapino, Marjorie Perloff, Harryette Mullen, Myung Mi Kim, Margy
Sloan, Lynn Keller, etc. Fanny Howe and I are coordinating the event, but
technical questions can be answered by Lucinda Rubio at lrubio@ucsd.edu

you--of what "prose" is (as compared to "poetry"), could you please

Sean, one good place to start, Nate Mackey's chapter "Sound and Sentiment,
Sound and Symbol" in his book *Discrepant Engagement* - the chapter title
is a reference to 2 other interesting works on the subject: Stephen Feld's
*Sound and Sentiment: Birds, Weeping, POetics, and Song in Kaluli
Expression*; and Victor Zuckerkandl's *Sound and Symbol: Music and
the External World*.  Mackey also makes revelatory use of another
worthwhile book, Jacques Attali's *Noise: The Political Economy
of Music*. Happy hunting!    -m.

I am writing about the American long poem 1945-1960 and am particularly =
interested in issues of place.  Does anyone have suggestions of poems =
that I might have overlooked?
Thanks!=20

>>FREUD-LISSITZKY NAVIGATOR
>>Computer Game Prototype
>>http://jupiter.ucsd.edu/~manovich/FLN
>>By Lev Manovich and Norman Klein
>>
>>In the summer of 1928 Sigmund Freud meets with the avant-garde Russian
>>designer El Lissitzky and his wife who are spending some time in Vienna
>>after a stressful period working on the Soviet Pavilion at the
>>International Press Exhibition in Cologne. They talk about
>>psychoanalysis and modern architecture. Freud tells Lissitzky that in
>>1908 he visited Coney Island and went to a park called "Dreamland."
>>There he got the initial idea for the architectural realization of his
>>theory. Lissitzky gets very exited about this idea. They decide to
>>create an architectural construct based on Freud's model of the mind.
>>What shall it be? Lissitzky points out the parallels between Freud's
>>model of the consciousness/unconsciousness as articulated in
>>Interpretation of Dreams and Marx's model of base/superstructure (they
>>don't know that it also parallels Saussure's model of
>>signified/signifier). Freud still thinks of the "Dreamland" park, but
>>Lissitzky convinces him that rather than building a one of a kind museum
>>or park, they should design mass housing--a popular idea with the
>>avant-garde architects of the second half of the 1920s and something
>>which Lissitzky, who until now could not realize any of his big-scale
>>architectural projects, was eager to do. Freud's first impulse is to
>>have a house with three vertical levels corresponding to his typography
>>of id, ego and super-ego. He wants to put a second, smaller house inside
>>a garden, also with three levels corresponding to his first typography
>>of the Conscious, Preconscious and Unconscious, with staircases to allow
>>communication between them.
>>
>>Lissitzky persuades Freud that the modern house should have only one
>>level with horizontal divisions, i.e. it should follow horizontal rather
>>than vertical development. They discuss how to implement the concepts of
>>condensation and displacement via mobile walls, an extension of
>>Lissitzky's design for the exhibition pavilion which he did in Dresden
>>in 1926.
>>
>>Around the same time Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein happens to pass
>>through Vienna and he meets with Freud and Lissitzky. He tells them that
>>he is planning film "adaptation" of Marx's Capital. Eisenstein is having
>>difficulties with realizing his film project in Russia; however, there
>>is funding for the mass housing projects in Vienna. Eisenstein realizes
>>that he can try to test his ideas by "displacing" Capital into
>>Interpretation of Dreams. He convinces Freud and Lissitzky to commission
>>him to do a short film which presents a "walk through" through the model
>>of a house.
>>
>>Eisenstein now faces a fundamental problem: how to reconcile his method
>>of montage with an essentially continuous experience of navigating
>>through a space? He keeps thinking about this problem when he gives a
>>lecture in the Institute of Psychoanalysis in Berlin in 1929. Later this
>>year he visits Bauhaus where he talks with Hungarian artist and Bauhaus
>>professor Moholy-Nagy to see if his students will build a model of the
>>house which Eisenstein can film (Moholy-Nagy is in charge of the Metal
>>Workshop). However, Moholy-Nagy is frustrated with art school politics
>>and he already made plans to go to Berlin to start his own advertising
>>agency.
>>
>>While at Bauhaus Eisenstein happens to catch a lecture by a young
>>American engineer Edwin Link about his flight simulator design. The Link
>>Trainer is a simulation of a cockpit with all the controls, but, in
>>contrast to a modern simulator, it has no visuals. Eisenstein conceives
>>of adding a projected film to the simulator.
>>
>>Link has connections in Hollywood; he arranges an invitation for
>>Eisenstein so they have an opportunity to work on this new project in
>>America. In Hollywood Eisenstein completes a twenty second film test.
>>After meeting Disney, Eisenstein, who was in love with Disney cartoons,
>>adds Mickey Mouse to the film. He send a print to Freud and a copy to
>>Lissitzky who is now in Cologne. Lissitzky soon has to return to Russia.
>>Sensing changing political climate there, he leaves his notes on the
>>Navigator in Germany.
>>
>>As many of Eisenstein's other projects, the Freud-Lissitzky navigator
>>remains unrealized. There are notes in his archive dating to the late
>>1930s about constructing special movie theatres with moving platforms;
>>he wants to use his montage theories to script the movement of a
>>platform against other dimensions of a film. He also shoots a scene for
>>Alexander Nevsky where we see the battle through the POV of a character
>>who flies over the battle using the wings he constructed; but Stalin who
>>understands that Eisenstein is making a reference to Russian avant-garde
>>artist Tatlin's "Letatlin" (flying apparatus Tatlin has been developing
>>for years) orders this scene to be cut.
>>
>>In 1961 at MIT Steve Russel writes the first computer game. He calls it
>>Spacewar.
>>
>>In 1968 a French new wave filmmaker is working on a film about Mao's
>>China. He wants to present it as a happy utopia which finally left
>>alienation and exploitation behind. One part of the film is taking place
>>in the future when America attacks China. The filmmaker wants to film
>>using montage strategies of Eisenstein's October. While on the train
>>from Paris to Brussels, he reads in the paper that Russian tanks are
>>going through the streets of Prague. Completely pre-occupied by his
>>film, the filmmaker ignores the larger political context of Prague
>>events; he is exited about the opportunity to get some footage for the
>>film. He rushes back to Paris, grabs his hand-held film camera and takes
>>first train to Prague. There he indeed finds Russian tanks in big
>>numbers but there is a problem: the medieval streets of Prague look very
>>different from China countryside where the scene is supposed to take
>>place. The filmmaker pays the crews of two Russian tanks to drive to the
>>countryside for half a day where he films the tanks. Happy, he returns
>>to Paris where he finally realizes what actually took place in Prague.
>>His first thought is to destroy all his footage but his old Fluxus
>>friend convinces him to donate it to the audio-visual division of the
>>National Library. The librarians have difficulties deciding under which
>>category to file the footage; eventually they file it under "travel
>>films."
>>
>>In the same year a Hungarian scholar of Russian avant-garde is working
>>on the first large exhibition of Russian avant-garde art in Stockholm.
>>While doing research in Germany he discovers Lissitzky and Freud notes
>>on the Navigator project. He publishes them in Hungary in a Hungarian
>>art history journal. During the 1980s a great deal of computer
>>development for American computer games was done in Hungary. One of the
>>computer programmers has a girlfriend who studies art history at the
>>University; she shows him the journal issue where the Lissitzky and
>>Freud notes were published. The programmer begins to work on a game
>>based upon these notes in his spare time. He completes a prototype in
>>1988 and there are plans to publish the game in the US, however,
>>following the events of 1989 they fall through. The programmer who
>>previously was happy to be paid a tenth of his US counterpart's salary
>>now starts asking for outrageous amounts of money. Through the
>>programmer's girlfriend the American game publishers steal the prototype
>>and give it to their in-house development team to develop further. She
>>and the programmer break up. Frustrated and heartbroken, the Hungarian
>>programmer moves to Berlin and takes up painting.
>>
>>The US game designers run into difficulties. They say that the reward
>>system in the game is not clear. And what is the point of traveling
>>through Freud's model of the mind anyway? Having realized that what they
>>have is not a game but a "scripted space" (Norman Klein's term) they try
>>to talk to the Disney Imageneering to see if they would make a ride
>>based on the prototype. But Imageneering people do not believe in
>>unconscious and hence are not interested.
>>
>>However, one of Disney designers wonders if they can incorporate some
>>elements from the prototype into the design of Euro Disney. He thinks
>>that European visitors would like the references to Dr. Freud and
>>Russian avant-garde. In Paris to work on the site, he spends some time
>>in the National Library looking through amateur French films to see how
>>French navigate through landscapes. Looking through the "travel films"
>>section, he comes across 1968 Prague footage and is struck by the
>>similarity between its camera's moves and the computer game prototype he
>>saw back in the States. Inspired, he goes to Caf=C8 du Dome on
>>Montparanasse, which in its time served as a hangout for Lenin, Picasso,
>>Soutine and other exiled intellectuals and artists. Keeping himself
>>awake through the night on oysters, black coffee and cigarettes, he
>>completes a detailed sketch of a Main Street design for Euro Disney by
>>the morning. His design makes it through two committees and three focus
>>groups but eventually is scratched. But some elements of it are
>>incorporated in the final plans for Fantasyland at the Euro Disney, now
>>renamed Disneyland Paris.
>>
>>The game company makes another attempt to make money on the prototype:
>>they approach a company which develops expensive simulators for the US
>>Army. But, with the end of the Cold War, the company lost most of its
>>orders and it is now busy converting a multi-million dollar simulator
>>into an add-on level for the popular computer game Quake. They make one
>>more attempt approaching the US Navy Simulation Division directly; but
>>their engineers are also not interested. They are converting their own
>>simulator (which is based on customized computer game Doom) into a
>>commercial game for Sony Playstation. Frustrated, the game company
>>recycles part of a computer code from the prototype for their own
>>internal database which tracks employee benefits, and permanently
>>shelves the project.
>>
>>The Freud-Lissitzky Navigator is an early version of this prototype. It
>>is converted from the original assembler code written in 1989. Following
>>the usual practice of computer games to begin with a FMV (full motion
>>video) sequence, we have added Eisenstein test (1930), re-edited by the
>>American game company (1993). At the end of the prototype we appended a
>>number of sketches and screen shots. They come from the 1993 version of
>>the game developed by the company and from the presentations it did to
>>Disney Imageneering and Navy Simulation Division (1990-1995). The last
>>image is the sketch of Euro Disney Main Street done by Disney designer
>>at Caf=C8 du Dome in Paris after he came across 1968 Prague footage.

_Fishing by Obstinate Isles:  Modern and Postmodern British Poetry and
American Readers_.  Northwestern University Press. $19.95 (paper).
Available direct from NUP/Chicago Distribution Center/11030 South Langley

subscription to this fine journal $30.

This second is a review-essay on the C. Bernstein collection, _Close
Listening_.  In the event that anyone reads the thing, I'll note here an
error that will also be noted in the next issue.  The 3rd sentence in the
2nd paragraph on page 158 should read: "The question raised or implicit in
all three essays involves the nature or composition of the audience and
thus might be dubbed, after the academic mantra Silliman alludes to in his
antiacademic essay, "Who Listens."


There--I've satisfied the pedant and ad-man in me in one fell swoop.

PhillyTalks 10, with STEVE FARMER & PETER GIZZI, is now available. Their
discussion ranges over the troubadors, limits of irony in
contemporary experimental poetry, the question of lyrically transcendent
being in the space of the page, historical determination in poetry, the
"degraded" or "contaminated" in Farmer's poetry, and "vulnerability" in
Gizzi's. Constructive, forthright, open dialogue, across two very
divergent poetries, by two medieval-inflected, modernizededed poets.

Farmer & Gizzi read and further discuss their work at Kelly Writers House,
3805 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, March 1st, 7pm. All welcome.

If you'd like this newsletter, or back issues, please e me.

Best,

Subject:      Goodbye, Paul (Paul Schmidt 1934-1999)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Very sad to find an obituary in the NY Times today for Paul Schmidt, who I got
to know in the mid-80s and very much admired. Of his work, I think primarily of
Paul's three-volume translation of Khlebnikov, published by Harvard University
Press (the final, long delayed, third volume of the poems came out in 1997) --
because that work was so important to me, and I had the chance to talk to Paul
about it. But he is equally known for his libretti, his own poems, and his
translation of Rimbaud, among many other projects.

Paul was 65 years old and in many ways at the height of his career. Here is yet
another instance of that unspeakable horror that continues to plunder our
culture and haunt its survivors. His death can't help but bring to mind the
generations of poets (and artists and nonpoets and nonartists) ravaged by this
scourge called AIDS.

Here is the Times's Obituary:

Paul Schmidt, Translator, Poet and Actor, Dies at 65

By STEPHEN HOLDEN

NEW YORK -- Paul Schmidt, a librettist, translator, poet, teacher and actor who
collaborated with many major avant-garde theater artists, died at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center on Friday. He was 65.

The cause of death was complications of AIDS, said his brother Jim.

Schmidt was known best for translating the complete works of Rimbaud and the
plays of Chekhov. He also devoted many years to translating the complete works
of Velemir Khlebnikov, a little-known Russian poet who died of malnutrition in
1922 at the age of 37. A production of Khlebnikov's play "Zangezi," first seen
in Los Angeles in 1986 and directed by Peter Sellars (it was later staged at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music) was one of Schmidt's several notable
collaborations with leading experimental directors.

Another was his libretto for "Alice," an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's "Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking Glass," which was a high
point of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival in 1995.

A collaboration with the director Robert Wilson and the composer Tom Waits,
"Alice" was praised by The New York Times for elucidating "an international
theatrical style in which Minimalism, German Expressionism, Japanese kabuki and
American pop bump up against one another in a grand, eye-catching pageant."

Schmidt's libretto was described as capturing "a strain of late-19th-century
romantic lyricism and drawing it out with a graceful literary refinement."

For the Wooster Group's 1990 theater piece, "Brace Up!," Schmidt supplied a
translation of Chekhov's "Three Sisters" that incorporated dance sequences and
video, and he also appeared in the production. It was one of many small roles
he played on the stage. For JoAnne Akalaitis' 1989 production at the Guthrie
Theater in Minneapolis of Jean Genet's five-and-a-half-hour, 100-character play
"The Screens," he created the text out of three versions the playwright had
left behind.

Other playwrights whose works he translated for theater productions include
Gogol, Brecht and Marivaux. "Black Sea Follies," his original play about Stalin
and Shostakovich (with music by the composer) was presented by Playwrights
Horizons and the Music Theater Group in 1986.

Schmidt was born in Brooklyn and attended Colgate and Harvard, where he wrote
his dissertation for his doctorate in Slavic languages on the influential
Russian director Vsevolod Meyerhold. While at Harvard, he became involved with
a now-legendary circle of friends who produced plays at the Agassiz Theater in
Cambridge in the summers.

The group included the actors Lindsay Crouse, Tommy Lee Jones, John Lithgow,
Kathryn Walker, Stockard Channing (to whom Schmidt was married for seven years)
and the director and writer Tim Mayer, whose collected poems and plays he
edited under the title "Running From America."

From 1958 to 1960, he served in the U.S. Army as a member of Army intelligence.
From 1967 to 1976, he taught Slavic languages at the University of Texas in
Austin. He published two volumes of poetry, "Night Life" and "Winter Solstice"
(both 1996, Painted Leaf Press).

A collection of Rimbaud translations with photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe,
titled "A Season in Hell," was in published in 1997 (Little, Brown).

In addition to his brother Jim, he is survived by three sisters, Mary Kay
Murray, Margaret Sand and Anne Schmidt; another brother, Thomas, and his
friend, Mark Bennett.

State Senator Adam Schiff has reintroduced his proposal to invest $1 per
Californian in the arts of our state. According to Senator Schiff, "This
new legislation, SB 253, will continue our efforts to develop a sound
infrastructure in California, one that adds to our economic and human
potential and results in a more stable funding source for the arts." You
may recall Senator Schiff was successful in getting a similar bill
passed by the Assembly and Senate last year, only to have it vetoed by
Gov. Wilson. The California Arts Advocates will keep you informed as
this bill goes to committee. In the meantime, please write a letter to
Senator Schiff thanking him for his continued strong support of the
arts, for introducing SB 253, and to let him know you will support this
bill as it moves through this legislative process. You can contact him
at:

I seem to remember a discussion about a Jameson quote which had been
similarly honored last year, and wondered if most folks on this list agreed
that these examples were, in fact, "bad" -- it's one way to talk about
poetics, no?

>The Bad Writing Contest celebrates the most stylistically lamentable

>not eligible, nor are parodies: entries must be non-ironic, from
>serious, published academic journals or books. Deliberate parody
>cannot be allowed in a field where unintended self-parody is so
>widespread.
>
>Two of the most popular and influential literary scholars in the U.S.
>are among those who wrote winning entries in the latest contest.
>
>Judith Butler, a Guggenheim Fellowship-winning professor of rhetoric
>and comparative literature at the University of California at
>Berkeley, admired as perhaps "one of the ten smartest people on the
>planet," wrote the sentence that captured the contest's first prize.
>Homi K. Bhabha, a leading voice in the fashionable academic field of
>postcolonial studies, produced the second-prize winner.
>
>"As usual," commented Denis Dutton, editor of Philosophy and
>Literature, "this year's winners were produced by well-known,
>highly-paid experts who have no doubt labored for years to write like
>this. That these scholars must know what they are doing is indicated
>by the fact that the winning entries were all published by
>distinguished presses and academic journals."
>
>Professor Butler's first-prize sentence appears in "Further
>Reflections on the Conversations of Our Time," an article in the
>scholarly journal Diacritics (1997):
>
>
>"The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood
>to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view
>of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition,
>convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality
>into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of
>lthusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical
>objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility
>of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up
>with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of
>power."
>
>
>Dutton remarked that "it's possibly the anxiety-inducing obscurity of
>such writing that has led Professor Warren Hedges of Southern Oregon
>University to praise Judith Butler as `probably one of the ten
>smartest people on the planet'."
>
>This year's second prize went to a sentence authored by Homi K.
>Bhabha, a professor of English at the University of Chicago. He writes
>in The Location of Culture (Routledge, 1994):
>
>"If, for a while, the ruse of desire is calculable for the uses of
>discipline soon the repetition of guilt, justification,
>pseudo-scientific theories, superstition, spurious authorities, and
>classifications can be seen as the desperate effort to "normalize"
>formally the disturbance of a discourse of splitting that violates the
>rational, enlightened claims of its enunciatory modality."
>
>
>This prize-winning entry was nominated by John D. Peters of the
>University of Iowa, who describes it as "quite splendid: enunciatory
>modality, indeed!"
>
>Ed Lilley, an art historian at the University of Bristol in the U.K.,
>supplied a sentence by Steven Z. Levine from an anthology entitled
>Twelve Views of Manet's "Bar" (Princeton University Press, 1996):
>
>"As my story is an august tale of fathers and sons, real and imagined,
>the biography here will fitfully attend to the putative traces in
>Manet's work of "les noms du p re," a Lacanian romance of the errant
>paternal phallus ("Les Non-dupes errent"), a revised Freudian novella
>of the inferential dynamic of paternity which annihilates (and hence
>enculturates) through the deferred introduction of the third term of
>insemination the phenomenologically irreducible dyad of the mother and
>child."
>
>
>Stewart Unwin of the National Library of Australia passed along this
>gem from the Australasian Journal of American Studies (December 1997).
>The author is Timothy W. Luke, and the article is entitled, "Museum
>Pieces: Politics and Knowledge at the American Museum of Natural

>
>
>"Natural history museums, like the American Museum, constitute one
>decisive means for power to de-privatize and re-publicize, if only
>ever so slightly, the realms of death by putting dead remains into
>public service as social tokens of collective life, rereading dead
>fossils as chronicles of life's everlasting quest for survival, and
>canonizing now dead individuals as nomological emblems of still living
>collectives in Nature and History. An anatomo-politics of human and
>non-human bodies is sustained by accumulating and classifying such

   I Like Jessica Pompeii's poem, and consider it less "an aside"
   than a more intimate enactment (if not mere representation)
   that I take at least as serious as the more abstract formulations
   that have been offered about men and women "in general"--

   "he said chess isn't art
    it's tantamount to war

    i don't see any guns
    or maybe I'm missing in action"

    I love this in part because I feel rebuked ("a palpable hit")
    more than I do by reading this particular C.D. Wright poem
    (early, it's called "Drift" I think) that prompted this=20
     more (too?)  abstract response that's only a beginning
         but what the heck?
=20
   (** N.B---this is not meant as a comment on the quality of
       Wright's work in general, and not even meant to be a
       definitive assessment of the aesthetic and/or ethical
       quality of the poem, it's too early for that---
       I am only offering some thoughts that I think relate to
       "the battle of the sexes" thread as well as to the book
       a friend loaned me i cannot say i hate....)
=20
  A history says it's easier for a woman to speak now and be heard
  than it has ever been before, and if you lament the present,=20
  you're lamenting the historical present, and happen to be a male,
  therefore, then, you must be hostile to women...
  But I wonder if women really are allowed (by themselves, at least
  as much as by men) to speak now and be heard than before?

  and, sure, I cannot see progress without decay
  but this doesn't mean I'm lamenting for what's been lost since
  "the good old days of female subjectification" as much as wondering
  whether women becoming more like men have been in civilization
  really changes anything for the better for women.
  I am not overly fond of the way men have "traditionally" been
  "in civilized society," and can't imagine a woman, as such, could
  be worse, but can they be better? can they move beyond the
  mere aesthetic, style over substance,
  with books (that have now become chapbooks) and Ph.Ds (that are
  now like B.As) that have characterized the male status mongering.
  (I do not intend to stoop so low as to say "the increased entry
   of women into the work force is to blame for the alleged "increased
   difficulties" and malaise males find." I will spit at that sentiment
   wherever I find it--for life has always been  difficult, for everyone...
   I cannot identify with my "male peers" any more than with females.
   I don't know, in what form, I will find those (or one) like-minded
   enough to help me in my search for a world in which women and men
   can be different than they have traditionally been (Laura Riding,
   for instance, is dead), beyond mere "equality" (as if women have
   realized, if you can't beat men join them) or "inversion" (in which
   men become househusbands). Such roles may be adapted as part of the
   search, but are insufficient in themselves...
   If there is a present I lament, it is not merely a historical one.
   I wonder if the feeling of being "shut up" more in what's called
   "poetry" today more than in what's called "prose" is informing=20
  this response. Unless you're willing to call this poetry (as much
  as I am willing to call Wrights' and Pompeiis' poetry), I am skeptical
  of the veneration accorded "poetry" (and "poetics" if this be not it)
  right now. Ah, this too may be seen as status-mongering! But it's
  not mere inversion. If "journal entries" are to "poetry" what
  "women" (traditionally) are to "men," then the aesthetic implications
  of feminism can cross genders and free women and men--
  but the dehierchization is still at a very early phase...

  ----
  So maybe we should talk about how ridiculous the idea of
  "music in poetry" is..........

Dear Dodie et al- I just thought of what I seek in writing & reading:

Poetry: something thorough and hollow

Prose: something partial and dense (as can be.)

Also from Douglas Messerli's intro to Mr Knife Miss Fork # 1, he writes:

"...poetry does not so much explore where we have been ( the 'history' of
language and people that is at the heart of narrative) but....where we might
possibly arrive"

All - as the Poetics List inbox continues to fill up with copies of messages
rec'd (or not) during
the mailhub problems, I'm going to try to pass on to the list posts that
never appeared. In uncertain
cases, I may be querying the original poster; in other cases not. If you
happen to see a post that
you sent out some time ago, or notice that the dates are peculiar on some of
the recent posts,
please don't be alarmed...

'in the event of text' is a 5-day symposium on contemporary strategies in
performance and writing with intensive workshops led by artists of
international reputation and working with writing in various media.
the four 3-day intensive workshops run in parallel, are based in practice,
and will be concerned with ephemerality,  exploration and process in
differing media.  the contents of the workshops feed into the 2-day
conference weekend and provide a convergence of issues and debates in
contemporary performance writing. workshops will be lead by Jason E. =
Bowman
(visual artist), Paul Pourveur (playwright), Leslie Hill & Helen Paris
(digital artists) & Sianed Jones (voice artist). further details of the
workshops are available at <http://www.hku.nl/events/iet> or on request by
post (see contact address above) from December 1998.

the conference will include papers, presentations and panel discussions
around ideas of the ephemeralities of writing, and text as event. papers
will include recent work on tactical media * poetics * telematics *
authoring * post-dramatic texts * internet radio collaborations * text and
memory.

'in the event of text' aims to explore, through work and discussion, the
ways in which writing can be seen to function as a time-based, transient,
ephemeral artform when played out in the context of different media and
environments. curated work will take place under the following broad

As some of you may know, The National Poetry Foundation is publishing
the Selected Poems of Ted Enslin.  It is at press and the paperbacks
should be available in two or three weeks.  Today we are putting
together copy for the dustjacket of the hardcover edition, and we find
ourselves with some blank space on the back cover.  We have two good
quotes culled from reviews of Enslin's work.  But if anyone out there
would like to e-mail us a jacket blurb of three or four sentences, we
might have space for it on the cover.  Hank Lazar, I'm thinking
especially of you. But I hope there might be some other Enslin fans on
the list, too.

Julanna, you might check out Stanley Cavell's _Disowning Knowledge in
Six Plays of Shakespeare" or alternatively (on Romanticism) _In Quest
of the Ordinary_. Both I think meet your criteria.

(((This is my third attempt to post this in this season of server
crashes.  Please ignore if you have already restored an earlier
version.)))

Since Jamie Ferguson, in his interesting post, has "pulled me onto
the open stage", let me make a few disjointed remarks on
translation, a topic that interests me too:

1. Re Steiner:  I somehow transposed the titles "After Babel" and
"Real Presences" in my mind (middle-aged senility).  The latter
book is the one I managed to read about half of some time ago.
I haven't cracked "After Babel" yet, but I thank Jamie for
pointing me to its chapters.  I guess my mixed sympathies with
Steiner have to do with his wearing his enviable learning so
heavily, failing to understand the late Wittgenstein,
and cranking (in every sense) out synoptic generalizations by the
tome-load, like some hypertrophied flack for Chicago's Great Books.
Or at least so I remember; it's been a while.  I will check out "After
Babel", hoping I've been unfair to Steiner (whose book on Heidegger
has been helpful to me, I admit).

2. Much contemporary translation of poetry slavishly falls foul of the
"semantic lineation fallacy", which dictates that line-breaks in the
target language must stick as close to those indicated by the syntactic
(and thus semantic) phrase structure of the source text as possible.
(That's my Steinerian generalization of the day.)  This is one
contribution to the generally stilted, flat, arbitrarily lineated prose
that often results.

3.  A plug for a recent translation frisson of mine: Stacy Doris's
wonderful versions of Esther Tellerman in Burning Deck's "Serie
d'ecriture no. 7", which seems to be a very good collection of
translations in general—I know it’s a few years old, but I only
just got a copy.

4.  A couple of years ago, Ira Lightman posted an interesting note on
this list questioning the value of homophonic translation.  I must say
that most h.t. I've seen just strikes me as self-indulgence.  Anyone's
counterexamples would be welcome.

5.  I just picked up a copy of Schulte and Biguenet’s "Theories of
Translation", a collection of papers.  The first one I read was R.
Jakobson’s "On linguistic aspects of translation", which contains
such appalling banalities as the following (I confess this is my first
acquaintance with the esteemed Formalist):

"An array of linguistic signs is needed to introduce a new word."

"A faculty of speaking a given language implies a faculty of
talking about this language."

"All cognitive experience and its classification is conveyable
in any existing language."

"No lack of grammatical device in the language translated into
makes impossible a literal translation of the entire conceptual
information contained in the original."

No argument at all is deemed necessary to support these
assertions, which probably would be thoughtlessly assented
to by the average high school teacher.  Dead brilliant these
semioticians, with their apparatus of codes and -emes and
-onyms, but they haven’t read Wittgenstein, now have they?

Regards to everyone,
Harold Teichman

Subject:      Chapbooks

Hi all

Reprinted below is the collected musing on the derivation of the term
"chapbook". A colleague from another mailing list suggested that I collate
them and send them to his list, so having done the job it is a pity to waste
such effort.  I thought it was quite interesting.  Hope you do.





APP absolutely nothing

can anyone tell me the derivation of "chapbook"?

Just interested.

Jim



re chapbook, the first element is presumably identical with
'cheap-' meaning to sell; a chapbook being hawked round?

The North English equivalent was 'cowp'. While if you exchanged
goods, the difference in value was a money sum called a 'boot'. Or
you could simply 'sell' (from OE root = give).

Bill

bill.griffiths@kcl.ac.uk


As far as I am aware the word arose in the 19th century
when the first pamphlets were published and made
available to poor masses
who after education became compulsory in the Victorian era
found themselves able to read.

Charles Dickens' novels were first serialised and published
in this way - a chapter at a time.

They usual sold for a penny
and were often known as
Penny Dreadfuls
especially when the contents consisted of gruesome stories
about Jack the Ripper and his ilk.

They were also known as cheap-o-books
and this got corrupted into chapbook.

Others will no doubt have variations on
or alternatives to
this theory.

Here endeth today's history lesson.

The word does indeed stem from the early nineteenth-century, but it derives
from the far older word, "chapman" (from Old English, ceapman), which
denoted the seller of, among other things, chapbooks (collections of
ballads, tracts, penny-dreadfuls, etc.) Interestingly, "chap", a
contraction of chapman, came to mean the purchaser of the chapman's wares,
rather than the hawker himself. I believe there is also a word
"chap-money", which signified the change the "chap" (buyer) received from
the "chapman" on purchasing, say, a "chapbook".

Alex Davis




>re chapbook, the first element is presumably identical with
>'cheap-' meaning to sell; a chapbook being hawked round?

- The OED confirms this; chapbooks being the modern name applied by
book collectors to specimens of popular literature (tales, ballads,
tracts in pamphlets) circulated by itinerant dealers or chapmen. First
citing 1824.

>The North English equivalent was 'cowp'. While if you exchanged
>goods, the difference in value was a money sum called a 'boot'. Or
>you could simply 'sell' (from OE root = give).

- and, of course, the cowp-boot sale is still popular in the region...

Richard Caddell



The OED concurs with early 19th C, giving first use 1824, attributed to
Dibdin - interestingly, since that locates the word within the
specialised vocabulary of bibliophiles, cataloguers, antiquarians & what
have you rather than a wider vernacular. And the OED sticks with that
definition: 'A modern name applied by book-collectors and others to
specimens of the popular literature which was formerly circulated by
itinerant dealers or chapmen, consisting chiefly of small pamphlets of
popular tales, ballads, tracts, etc.' No suggestion, in other words,
that the publishers of such items called them 'chapbooks' - it's
entirely retrospective - and no secondary meaning given. The Collins
definition follows suit & they're the only dictionaries I have handy. No
coverage, then, of the sense in which various contemporary poetry
publishers have called their pamphlets 'chapbooks' & so we're proved
invisible again - however much we like to regard our wares as 'popular
literature'.

Alan Halsey


Probably a lot of the current sense of the word derives from its
reappropriation by Harold Monro for his poetry magazine The Chapbook around
1920.

I was very interested to read the Times obit yesterday.  I knew a little
of Schmidt's work, but learned rather more about what he'd done, from the
Times.... There is one oddity, or rather i think maybe it's not odd at
all:  the reference in the obit is to "the little-known Russian poet
Khlebnikov."  Now this is very peculiar, and made me blink hard.  Why this
strangely insistant, not exactly accurate characterization?  I mean, is he
really "little-known" compared to Mayakovsky or Mandl'stam?? Well, yes
sort of, but only if you specify a certain group of academics and
intellectuals and poets, but a different (and argeuably more interesting)
group would know, or know of, Khlebnikov as readily as the other two....
The very existence of the Harvard UP edition brings the need for this
aside into question... To most common or garden variety intellectuals (not
to mention the person-in-the-street) the "knownness" of Khlebnikov versus
Ahkmatova or Blok is much of a muchness....Methinx the obit writer
protests too much: It would seem that the phrase is really (ideologically)
saying:  the poet whom i and other right-thinking person believe *should
not be known* to anyone..... It reminds me of those ignorant hack reviews
(which i have critiqued on this list before) which attacked the superb
bio, Poet Be Like God.  One of them refered to Spicer as a poet who has
had no influence... Maybe no remark has ever been made that more defined
the writer as being ignorant of the contemporary poetry scene......

Ron S. of course has a well-known essay in which he speaks of how poets
are "disappeared" by the literary establishment... Here are more instances
of disappearing in action......

In Sunday's NYTBR there's another case pretty close to what Mark P. is
talking
about in his post about the "disappearing" of artists.  In a review of a
new book about the theatrical debut of Stein's Four Saints.. the reviewer
keeps insisting that the project was somewhat perversely organized by and
around "second-rate" artists.  That is, Pound and Joyce were both
interested in doing the libretto but the second-rate Stein was chosen
instead.  Virgil Thomson (2nd-rate) did the score rather than Stravinsky
(or some other first-rater, I don't have the paper with me).  The
second-rate choreographer (whose name was unfamiliar to me) was *not*
Balanchine, and so on.  Sure, one's entitled to make value judgments, but
as Mark was suggesting the whole *structure* of judgment here seems
fundamentally ideological, as if there's some implied law of conservation
of genius at work... steve

               Mark Prejsnar

Nobody excels at this better than the NY Times. Jim Holt makes a bold
grab at the Vendler-Pinochet award for 1999 in the current NYT book
review in his piece on Steven Watson's _Preparing for Saints_, a history
of the staging of Four Saints in Three Acts, when Holt invents a
bifurcated modernism in which Joyce = smart, dense, full o' references
you could look up, Stein = flat, surfacy, "word salad." In short,
"stupid modernism". Here's the passage that made me reach for the beta
blockers:

'Was the thing any good?

          'It's an important question. If, as Watson's subtitle
suggests, this opera was crucial to the ''mainstreaming of American
modernism,'' one would like to have some assurance that the right kind
of modernism got mainstreamed. And what's striking about ''Four Saints''
is its rejection of the modernism of complexity -- the modernism of
Picasso, Schoenberg and Joyce -- in favor of the modernism of
simplicity.

          'That was largely Thomson's doing. As ''Prepare for Saints''
makes clear, this indefatigable little man was the motive force behind
America's first full-scale Gesamtkunstwerk. In addition to creating the
music for the opera, he determined its overall esthetic shape by his
choice of collaborators. In doing so he consistently fought shy of the
great in favor of the quirky and second-rate. Both Pound and Joyce
expressed interest in doing a libretto for him. Instead he sought out
Stein, who fancied herself a Cubist of words but whose writings had none
of the structural rigor characteristic of Cubism. The resulting
text -- ostensibly about Teresa of Avila, Ignatius Loyola and a
supporting cast of lesser saints -- was a jumble of children's rhymes,
word games and random verbiage that rarely lurched into sense. ''The two
things you never asked Gertrude, ever, were about her being a lesbian
and what her writing meant,'' a pleased Thomson commented."

You will note the clever way Holt quotes Thomson, so as to make the
gratuitous homophobic dig not his responsibility (indeed, that of a gay
man). You will also note that Holt's simply WRONG! There is certainly
enough evidence, from Dick Bridgman to Ulla Dydo, to demonstrate that
Stein's work is anything but "quirky and second-rate." Stein's
"problem," it would seem, is that it does not lend itself to the sort of
old fashioned content analysis that Holt grew up with (presuming here,
as his review suggests, that he's 15 years older than I am, or at least
permanently embedded in the late 1940s). But then, in his view, she's
not even the one responsible for her work: it's Virgil who's to blame.

Even more infuriating than Holt's demonstration of illiteracy is the
presumption that "one would like to have some assurance that the right
kind of modernism got mainstreamed." A perfect instance of the critic as
gatekeeper (disappearer) modeled for us here. Hilton Kramer would be
proud.

The reality of course was/is that there were/are as many modernisms as
there were, in fact, modernists and perhaps even "modernist works." The
idea of channeling all thought down to a soundbyte, as this would have
intellectual history do, ought to drive up the identarian paranoia of
every reader and writer amongst us.

Perhaps it's fitting, therefore, to find out, as the NYT blurb on Holt
says, "is working on a book about the history of the idea of the
infinitesimal." This, we suspect, will be a memoir.

Ron

William Bronk (1918-1999) died some time last night, apparently peacefully.


      The Smile on the Face of a Kouros

This boy, of course, was dead, whatever that
might mean. And nobly dead. I think we should feel
he was nobly dead. He fell in battle, perhaps,
and this carved stone remembers him
not as he may have looked, but as if to define

the naked virtue the stone describes as his.
One foot is forward, the eyes look out, the arms
drop downward past the narrow waist to hands
hanging in burdenless fullness by the heavy flanks.
The boy was dead, and the stone smiles in his death
lightening the lips with the pleasure of something achieved:
an end. To come to an end. To come to death
as an end. And coming, bring there intact, the full
weight of his strength and virtue, the prize with which
his empty hands are full. None of it lost,
safe home, and smile at the end achieved.

Now death, of which nothing as yet - or ever - is known,
leaves us alone to think as we want of it,
and accepts our choice, shaping the life to the death.
Do we want an end? It gives us; and takes what we give
and keeps it; and has, this way, in life itself,
a kind of treasure house of comely form
achieved and left with death to stay and be
forever beautiful and whole, as if
to want too much the perfect, unbroken form
were the same as wanting death, as choosing death
for an end. There are other ways; we know the way
to make the other choice for death: unformed
or broken, less than whole, puzzled, we live
in a formless world. Endless, we hope for no end.

I tell you death, expect no smile of pride
from me. I bring you nothing in my empty hands.

                                - William Bronk

William Bronk, for many us the greatest poet of his generation, died
yesterday at his home in Hudson Falls, New York. He was eighty-one. His
last poem, left in manuscript beside his chair, follows:

Art isn't made, it's in the world almost
unseen but found existent there. We paint,
we save the sound in music, we write it down.

seems to me Khleb was well known enuf!!! there's a lot of other stuff

I, too, am saddened by the passing of William Bronk -
a poet of acumen and seriousness, too-little celebrated
in recent years despite the important efforts of Talisman
House Publishers and North Point Press. There isn't much
I can say now that the work doesn't. Chris


from The World, The Worldless (New Directions, 1964):

A BRIGHT DAY IN DECEMBER

So much light in what we call the dark
of the year, a flashing and glittering of light -
it quivers, it flaps in our face like slaps of wind.

Should it surprise us, having known the holes
of darkness in the longest days?

                        I have done
with promises (or say I have) of things
to come: the all-light; the all-dark;
something slow emerging; the slow (or fast)
and final decay.

                The thing we have to live
with, the last thing, is it is all
here, and was, and will be, is all there is.
Nothing is coming but what is already here
as this light, now, in the darkest time
(and nothing here that ever needed to come)
at once, too much for us and not enough.



from All of What We Loved (Talisman House, 1998):

CERTAINTIES

A certain one whose name was his real name
lived in a real place at a certain time.
Then the time was gone and the real all gone.

frequently are rooted in place if not "centered" in it

One poem your list is missing is John Ashbery's "Europe" from _The Tennis
Court Oath_, which I believe was published in 1962, but "Europe" may have
been let out earlier. At any rate, it's quite an achievement in long
poetry.

A lot of post-1960 work in this list (Silliman, Blau Du Plessis, and
others). If you're going to include post-1960 work I would hope you would
define "American" as meaning more of the continent than the United States,
so as not to leave off marvelous works by bpNichol, Phyllis Webb, Daphne
Marlatt, George Bowering, and other Canadians. Plus Brathwaite, Walcott,
and other Caribbean writers.  I apologize for not being so informed about
pre-1960 Canadian work -- perhaps others could help in this regard.

CALL FOR PAPERS

Current Attractions of Robinson Jeffers

For a proposed special session at the 1999 MLA Convention, proposed on
behalf of the Robinson Jeffers Association, papers on the current
attractions of the poetry of Robinson Jeffers are requested.

Send 50-100 word abstracts only (for 15-20 minute papers), plus information
on institutional affiliation and rank if any (brief cv ok) by March 25,
SOONER IF POSSIBLE.

Include electronic mailing address and telephone numbers in submission for
replies; no paper replies will be mailed, though paper submissions will be
considered.

Robinson Jeffers's poetry has retained a small but dedicated following of
readers who are neither writers themselves nor critics and scholars. He has
also remained of interest to a handful of serious scholars, and his poetry
has remained a standard and vivid presence for students, who often find his
work refreshingly straightforward and yet disturbing, as they dismiss much
modernist poetry of Jeffers' cohorts for being obscure and of only academic
interest. And poets in large numbers, from many different schools, continue
to respect and even revere Jeffers as a landmark at least and often a direct
if not visible influence in American and other English language poetry.
Jeffers is a narrative and dramatic poet of Aeschylean power, a lyricist of
striking sublimity and a jeremiadical philosopher poet with a granite vision
of transcendence that puts the human in its pitifully small place in a grand
and inhumanly beautiful universe.

But why should Jeffers claim the interest of a wider circle of readers now?
How does his refusal of the pieteies of modernism sit with postmodern
interpreters and recalcitrant defenders of either the modernist canon or
with the soft deconstruction multiculturalism visits on a culture he thought
already doomed to irrelevance in nature? How does his fulminant and mordant
view of nature figure in the eco-critical discourses of the new millenium?
How do his unapologetic portrayals of strong and evil sexuality and fatality
make sense in the gender politics of a constructivist or strategically
essentialist feminism or a multiply and polymorphously perverted
psychoanalytic world of theory? Is there anything queer about Jeffers? How
do his racially and ethnically mestizo characterizations and narratives
pollute the hybrid paradigms of current reading? How does his insistently
neoclassic poetics rattle the chains of contemporary poetry and criticism of
all types and precepts? How does Jeffers rocky coastal California
sensibility rock the assumptions of regionalism? How does his censored
antiwar antiauthoritarian politics speak today? What nation is Jeffers' USA?
Now that we live in the future, are we ready for Jeffers, who (as he put it
himself) wrote "for antiquity?"

davidantin is one of my favorite poets & has had a huge impact on my
writing


i've been trying to collect as much material by and about him as i can
find
and two things in particular have elluded me

his book TALKING published by the Kulchur Foundation
and a special issue of the magazine VORT which focused on Antin and
Rothenberg

ultimately i wd like to own both of these items but in the absense of
that
i'd like to get copies of the poems in the former that do not appear in
the
sun & moon SELECTED POEMS and copies of all the Antin specific material
in
VORT

is there anyone who cd help me with this (i'm, of course, willing to pay
postage & copying costs etc)

i've also got the beginnings of a bibliography started (with the help of
a
librarian friend) but i know that it's unfinished and it also doesn't
cover
material about him by other critics poets etc

any suggestions in this regard or discussion of Antin wd be cool


thanx

I mentioned Paul Schmidt's death to my Russian teacher this morning, who
expressed amazement that anyone could translate Khlebnikov into English,
since even Russians can't understand him!

In Russian terms, I think Khlebnikov is very well-known for two or three
pieces (e.g., the laugh poem) and as an image.  Perhaps something like
the non-literary educated American's sense of Stein.

Khodasevich is the real "little known" Russian poet.

I didn't have any problem with Steve Holden's obituary for Paul
Schmidt.

The piece on Stein's Saints, on the other hand, was abysmal.

person who had not yet come to poetry--ever--a poem of his: she went out
and bouoght a book of his.

HIS is a work thta did all the things (I) (we) want
the poem to say and do. THat is,
be poetry. be it.

Besides Silliman -- someone alreday mentioned his age in 1960 --,
Notley, Duplessis & Mayer all started to publish after 1960 & heir major
is post-1970.

& even if you stayed US-sides after 60, there is major long work to be added:
Ed Dorn's Slinger, Robert Kelly's Axon Dendron Tree and The Loom,
Rothenberg's Poland 1931, Ted Enslin's Forms, Synthesis, and Ranger, Diane Di
Prima's Loba, Steve Jonas' Orgasms/Dominations, David Meltzer's Hero/Lil,
Frank Samperi's trilogy (The Prefiguration; Quadrifarian; and Lumen Gloriae),
Ed Sanders' 1968, Anne Waldman's Iovis, -- not to mention such britishers as
Allen Fisher's Place or Iain Sinclair's Lud Heat.

A further suggestion, if you want to get out of the 20th century
box--Melville's Clarel. It's really a unique poem, the first american
shot at an epic to the best of my knowledge. And though the prosody is
traditional (rhyming couplets in iambic tetrameter--25,000 lines of
it) the content is already heavily post-modern.

1 - rooted in a sense of place

2 - written in the 60's

San Francisco poet Susan Thackrey's debut book of poetry, _Empty Gate_ --
"a long-awaited superb first book" (Norma Cole) -- collects six sequences
of poems in a work of singular endeavor, attention, and lyric intelligence.

Ms. Thackrey, a member of the inaugaural class in poetics at New College of
California when that program was created around the occasion of Robert
Duncan's teaching, now works in San Francisco as a practicing analyst.
_Empty Gate_ is dedicated to Duncan, and opens with an epigraph from
William of Aquitaine's Proven=E7al canzon:

 Farai un vers de dreyt nien  ("I'll make a verse of pure nothing")

The simplicity of that claim or complaint hides a question that haunts
poetry again and again.  How does anyone, out of pure nothing -- struck
speechless or destituted, the ground pulled out or opened up -- find a
place to speak?  Out of negatives then, such silences ("so what is it that
holds its shape / shot full of holes maintains its hold / informs on us in
time") the question becomes how to find a way, "unfounded just here."

_Empty Gate_ joins Norma Cole's _Mars_ and Duncan McNaughton's _Valpara=EDso=
_
as the third book in the Listening Chamber Poetry Series.


About _Empty Gate_:


Benjamin Hollander:

"Agape at this gate, we enter the mythic consciousness of the human -- its
origins and horizons, its wounds and desires, its benevolences and
violations.  Here we come to moments of luminous grace and _understanding_
by _standing under_ a momentum of words which 'cannot be dispelled from the
world,' breaking like waves, compressed to a gasp.  Here is the
transcendent shock of recognition for the beings who 'beg mercy/bear fire,'
even if recognition bears no word.'"


Diane di Prima:

"_Empty Gate_ frames vision vast as the sky, out of time, but intimate as
the moon on a fingernail.  Here keen poetic intelligence bends to the
heartspace, listens.  Susan Thackrey holds loss, joy, memory:  bits of gold
in an open hand -- an offering."


Norma Cole:

"In musical registers distinctly its own, Susan Thackrey's _Empty Gate_ is
an intricately fashioned work of generosity and restraint.  With cut-glass
clarity, the double VENUS at its literal center reveals the inevitability
of echo and the power of erasure, 'dreaming no / in the sleep of yes.'  The
_here_ and _there_, the _then_ and _now_ have never been so close.  It is a
long-awaited superb first book."

     they charged my credit card, and I called for 6
     months and left messges, I never got the tape
     (or a refund).

and as it happens i meant to add a query to my post about Antin asking if
anyone had tapes of him or knew of how/where to acquire them

Michael wd also i presume be interested to know if anyone has a cluse what's
happened to Watershed

i've read that Antin decided against using certain poems in his SELECTED
POEMS - presumably as they no longer satisfied his standards - these too i
wd be interested in seeing/finding

Subject:      3 NEW Potes & Poets chapbooks
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

3 new chapbooks from Potes & Poets Press not available
yet anywhere else, with a special purchase offer to Poetics
List-members...

THE BOOKS...

1) Free Fall, Vernon Frazer, 28 pp., $6...

 Frazer is a Connecticut poet and fiction writer whose book]
is a stream-of-consciousness episode full of typographical
and linguistic curiosity.  He has played acousic bass in what
he calls his 'poetry band', and the improvisational aspect of
this work is apparent.  He is publisher of Beneath the Under-
ground Press.

2) City of Angels, Ivan Arguelles, 52pp., $7...

 Arguelles writes of sexuality and Eastern religion in a mix
that generates a state of relatedness to one's inner being.
He has been published before many times, but is under-
recognized as a poet who goes beyond the confines of 'the
acceptable' in terms of discourse as we know it usually.
He lives and works in Berkeley CA.

3) Immanence, Peter Ganick, 63pp., $7...

 Ganick's book consists of 15 poems of a philosophical

I think always how we always miss it; how the dead
have not been final, and life has always required
to be stated again, which is not ever stated.
It is not art's statements only, not
what we try to say by music, not the way
this picture sculptures sight itself
to see this picture - not by art alone
the aim is missed, and even least of all
by art (which tries a whole world at once,
a composition). No, it is in our terms,
the terms themselves, which break apart, divide,
discriminate, set chasms in that wide,
unbroken experience of the senses which
goes on and on, that radiation, inward and out,
that consciousness which we divide, compare,
compose, make things and persons of, make forms,
make I and you. World, world, I am scared
and waver in awe before the wilderness
of raw consciousness, because it is all
dark and formlessness: and it is real
this passion that we feel for forms. But the forms
are never real. Are not really there. Are not.

from "The Arts and Death: A Fugue for Sidney Cox"



                       Once, it had seemed
the objects mattered: the light was to see them by.
Examined, they yielded nothing, nothing real.
They were for seeing the light in various ways.
They gathered it, released it, held it in.
In them, the light revealed itself, took shape.
Objects are nothing. There is only the light, the light!

from "The Annihilation of Matter"



Our minds are unmortared constructions of stone blocks
which are all of them separate but we fit
them closely together and know what blocks
to go to for what we think or feel.
In between, are barely perceptible cracks.
Go in there. It will expand as you go.

"Caving In"


>From the Talisman interview:

WB:  But are words other than what they mean? One problem about them is
that we don't know what they mean. We think we know what they mean, but
I have had literate people totally, as far as I'm concerned, misread a poem
that
I've written. I don't understand - How the hell did he come up with that? I
didn't mean anything like that, and I think that I'm a fairly direct speaker
in a
poem, and I think that clarity is something that I usually achieve. But
often
it's a quite different clarity from what I intended. And I think it's fair
to say it's a
misreading of the poem, not simply that the poem has a reading that I didn't

intend. I don't feel that.

EF: I don't believe one has complete control of language. It devises its own
patterns.

WB: Oh, very much so in my own experience although I don't think that is the
experience of a lot of other writers who work and rework a poem. My poems
come to me in their own language, and if they were not in that language,
they
would not have any force. Sometimes before I get it written down, the
language
kind of slips, and I think: I don't know, that is not it, that's not it. I'm
saying
something which is intellectually more or less the equivalent, but it is
flat - it doesn't work. And then if I'm fortunate, it will come back to me:
oh,
yes, that's the way the poem is, and it's simply a matter of changing the
tone
or changing the language - which would not be the case if it were a neutral
kind of idea -

EF: But poems can be read without attention to "meaning." And there is great
pleasure in reading for the music, for the song.

WB: Oh, there are times when the only way that we can read them is that
because - "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God." Who knows what that means? Oh, I'm sure that there are
thousands of people who will explain just exactly what John meant by that,
but
as far as I'm concerned, the meaning is nothing that I would try to
explicate.
And the whole force of it is destroyed by explication. And there are all
sorts
of things of that sort. But not every poetic expression is powerful in that
way. It may still be valid. The nursery rhymes which are said to have had
very
specific, frequently political meanings in their own times, [a meaning]
which
is lost to most people today, and I expect that there are some scholars who
will give you a rundown on "Humpty-Dumpty," for example - its political
meaning. Who cares at this point? And in a sense it doesn't really mean
anything,
and yet we've all - It's part of our childhood and obviously did mean to us
-
Completely apart from its original sense.

EF: And there's poetry that sets up a rhythm, a tone that is pleasing, and
doesn't
make statements in a conventional way.

WB: John is making a statement.

EF: He is, but it's not in the realm of conventional discourse. We can't
approach it through paraphrase.

WB: If you are simply trying to make a pleasant sound, then that's something
else.

EF: No, the poetry I mean is more than that, but it's severed from the world
of conventional meaning.

WB: Yes, but there's a distinction there between its having content and its
not having content.

EF: Well, nonsense syllables, but I don't mean that. Gertrude Stein's
Stanzas
in Meditation clearly has meaning but not in any literal or usual way.

WB: But I think that you have to have something that you are meaning and not
simply depending on the words to give you a meaning.

EF: There has to be personal intent?

WB: You have to mean it. You can't do it hoping that the words will mean
something that you don't mean. I think that Gertrude was not depending on
the words. I think that she meant something. She had something that she was
saying, she wanted to say, and she wasn't saying, well, if I just do this -
Although she was the one who promoted automatic writing: give the words
their
lead, and they'll tell you their meaning. So maybe I'm wrong about her.

EF: I don't think so.

WB: But you go back a few steps to what was said earlier about the words
being in charge, the words taking control of expression - I have repeatedly
had the experience, when the poem gets written down, of saying, oh, God,
no, I don't mean that - but hesitating to change the meaning because it
seems to me the way it has to be said - and then only later, maybe the next
day, two days later, the next week: yes, I guess that's what I do mean. But
the initial rejection of what the poem is saying because it seems to me
something that I don't particularly want to mean, a meaning that makes me
uncomfortable or embarrasses or contradicts something else I've said or
whatever. Having to accept that when I've lived with it for a little while -
Admitting, yes, yes, I guess that is what I mean.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Robert Creeley wrote this for the EPC's obituary pages
(http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/documents/obits/), where it will shortly appear.

***

William Bronk's Passing

Although one saw him but rarely, there was a strong sense of bond between us as
two who had begun together back at the close of the 40s, in Cid Corman's
Origin.  We had a mutual friend, a little older than I was -- as was Bill as
well -- Samuel French Morse, a friend also of Cid Corman's, by way of Gordon
Cairnie's transforming Grolier Book Shop in Cambridge.  I was trying to start a
little magazine and Bill had sent me some poems (at Sam's suggestion), which
were printed in Origin, when the magazine I intended fell apart.

Much has been said about William Bronk's relation to Wallace Stevens.  There is
certainly
an active sense of parallel, particular in the pace, the reflective rhetoric,
and in the use of pronouns.  But Stevens is a much lighter poet, if that's the
word, letting thought be both way in and way out, a play of mind rather than
its adamant conviction.  It was not surprising when Stevens converted at last
to Catholicism. Bronk's Protestant determination never changed.

I recall those early poems had often a humor, neither droll nor necessarily
relieving.  It was a humor of situation, that one was in this world indeed,
just so.  Bill thought about it all his extraordinary life.  In that he was
very like Emily Dickinson, seemingly alone yet compact with existence, flooded
with insistent intelligence and proposal.  One notices how particularly his
poems return, loop, rather, about their factors of statement.  "Here" is the
only place he ever was.

Our first meeting was at a reading I'd had in New York, and he came up to
introduce himself just after, but really to tell me with a look of real
consternation, that he would never have imagined I'd read my poems as I did,
stuttering, seeming almost in pain -- why? I had no answer.  He read his own
thoughtfully, firmly, considering.  When, a few years ago, he was unable to
attend a festival we were both to be at, a tape of his reading was provided,
and so I sat with others listening to that dependable, quiet voice speak
through the lines of an age old human wondering.  Why indeed, I thought -- it
was a good question.

Back home, I called him to tell him all had gone well, and we mused a bit on
life, on what it had been to be poets.  As he said, one had never thought of it
as a "career" or as any such.  One did it simply.  Charles Olson valued him
quite probably more than any other of his contemporaries -- it was the measure
of intelligence he constituted, the address of his means to the given world.
Finally, there was no one else quite like him, so large in his singleness, so
separate yet enclosing.  One will not see his like again.

as I recall, it was 'rooted in sense of place' and written (or published,
perhaps?) 1945-1960. But then 'sense of place' seems practically
unavoidable. Whether work of a specific place, as is Maximus, or work of
multiple movement across space (Slinger -- but yes, this is after 1960), or
work in which space doesn't seem obviously at issue (Passages -- except in
parts, of course, that are specific to San Francisco area) -- isn't that
too at take on 'sense of place.' Can the page itself supply 'sense of
place?' -- quite literally? or, metaphorically, many other things
(language, the psyche, etc.)?

Others I thought of include: MidQuest, Fred Chappell (LSU Press);
Mountains and Rivers without End, G. Snyder; Gunslinger, Ed Dorn; On
Bear's Head (?), Phillip Whalen [not sure about it; may be separate
poems, but I think it's one}; ; There's also a long one by Robert Duncan
whose title escapes me.  The Chappell one's an interesting one, each
section is related to one of the elements, fire wind, water, earth, etc.

No one to my knowledge has yet mentioned Frank Stanford's _the battlefield
where the moon says I love you_, a really fine (and really strange)
booklength work done by the late Arkansas surrealist when he was still in
(or just out of -- are Forrest Gander or CD Wright on this list? they could
fill in these blanks much better than I) his twenties.

Oppen's _Of Being Numerous_ also ought to be on that list. Ditto Creeley's
_Pieces_, and Berrigan's _Bean Spasms_, Blackburn's _Journals_, Plus Ammons'
Tape of the Turn of the Year (it's not only literary progressives who've
written long poems), Donald Finkel's poem of his trip to the south pole.
What else? Eventually we'll get to George Keithley's Donner Party, Vikram
Seth's Golden Gate and some really godawful work.

Re: David Baratier

Rukeyser's _One Life_ definitely IS a long poem (book length, combining
prose and verse).  I was very pleased to see it on this list--another
"disappeared" masterwork of our century.

For the third installment of Small Press Traffic's "Life/Forms" series, we
will have a weekend with Jeff Derksen, the brilliant Canadian poet and
controversialist, the man who knows, better than any other, why so much of
today's best writing, including his own, mixes up the social, the personal,
and the political. Jeff Derksen's Down Time (1990) and Dwell (1994) from
Vancouver's Talonbooks are classic, and there's a new one I haven't seen
calledBut Can I Make a Living from It (Hole Books, 1998). Former editor of
Writing Magazine. Board Member of The Kootenay School of Writing
(Vancouver) and Truck Gallery (Calgary). Edited the groundbreaking "Disgust
& Overdetermination: a poetics issue" of Open Letter. Articles on art and
poetics have appeared in Poetics Journal, Fuse, West Coast Line, and
others. Currently working on a new poetry MS: I Need to Know If this Is
Normal and a book of essays: From Form: Essays in Cultural Poetics.

How did it happen that two of our great hopes for 1990s poetry are both
called "Jeff" (and what about Jeff Buckley???) Jeff Clark, born 1971,
attracted national attention with the publication (by Sun & Moon) of his
first book The Little Door Slides Back, a weird, touching, magical blend of
Marc Bolan, Mary Butts, Angela Carter and Austin Powers. This international
man of mystery was born in southern California to a Disneyland tourguide
and a lounge performer. In the early 90s he drummed for the experimental
band BUICK, and now lives in San Francisco. He is the author of The Little
Door Slides Back (Sun & Moon). His work has appeared in American Letters &
Commentary, Angle, Grand Street, Ribot, Tool, and ZYZZYVA. This will be his
first poetry reading ever so skip Velvet Goldmine and come and see two guys
named Jeff.

This store sells many kinds of drums and cymbals,
sticks and brushes, drum hardware.
We come in to look at new products, glossy brochures,
vintage snares.  We are engaged.
Often we make small or large purchases;
children, and some adults, take lessons in the basement.

Yet afterwards it is as if none of this had mattered.

Haniel Long-----

Wow! Thought he was forgotten. Haniel believed that an emphasis on the
regional would lead to forms of poetry and foster the growth of American
Literature. This was in the twenties out in NM. His work Pittsburgh
Memoranda, re-released on U Pitt about 10 years ago, uses many forms of
documentation and seriality which started to appear in the poetries of
Rukeyser, WC Williams, and Rezinikoff in the years after, perhaps was an
influence though difficult to assert. The press was called Writer's
Editions in Santa Fe started with a few others in the 20's.

Be well

NEW FROM AVEC BOOKS:

THE AGENCY OF WIND

Poems

BY LAYNIE BROWN


Like the strange and imaginative world of Wonderland, The Agency of Wind
is a fanciful tale. "I am traveling on a gold cloud/ where come and go no
ships or ships logs" states the girl of The Agency of Wind as she embarks
on her journey, a journey that includes encounters with a crane, a
windmaker, a domineering doll. The poems and prose poems of The Agency of
Wind create a quixotic, enchanted province, where things are not as they
appear to be and "all disguises swim."

Which way to the windmaker's door? If you want to know that you'll have
to ask the doormaker. A riddling, wind-activated poem describing the
transformative adventures of a girl and a crane. Page after page, deckled
with light, whistle headfirst into a journey, a conversation, a host of
insoluble dilemmas, "questions swept over a chasm." The Agency of Wind
yields the imaginative pleasures of a Leonora Carrington painting with
the verbal vivacity and exactitude already characteristic of a Laynie
Browne.--C.D. Wright

There is an address to and from innocence in Laynie Browne's writing. Her
poetry is a key with which to recover a refreshed dreamscape, but there's
a catch. With the agency of wind as one's portal and only anchor, there
are no doors and locks to fit the key. Instead, one must swallow it
through the pupil of one's eye extending a fearlessness and trust in a
world where walls "are moving curtains" and "the chairs have blown away."
The unnamed "she" discovers a series of portals, all announcing and
witnessing in gorgeous detail the ornaments of her own beginnings, "as if
a negative were to be placed underneath her skin." --Andrew Levy

The gentle quality of Laynie Browne's prose is perfectly suited for this
ethereal tale. --Bernadette Mayer

-

Laynie Browne was born in 1966, and grew up in Los Angeles. She received
a B.A. in English Literature from the University of California, Berkeley
in 1988, and an M.F.A. from Brown University in 1990. She received a
fellowship from the MacDowell Colony in 1992, and was awarded the
Gertrude Stein Award in Innovative American Poetry three times between
1993 and 1996. She lives in Seattle.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        Good Grief! There appears no end to the candidates for this
important largely male title. It is only fair yo put Listmates on notice
that my entire oeuvre is now (by my own fiat, which is what counts) to be
regarded as one long poem, The Long Bromige Poem. My published volumes come
to upward of 700 pp.,but there are some 300pp as yet unpublished.

This work of a lifetime resembles some other 20th C epics in the strain
its  widely divergent forms and themes place upon its rubric, but at the
same time let us appreciate that its unity is not merely--or at all--
cosmetic.

As to whether it should be considered an American, a Canadian or a British
epic, I advocate we think of it as post-American,-Canadian, and -British.
Maybe it could be called a World Poetry Disincorporation epic.

You may think the tone of this flip, but if so, so what? That makes this
claim no whit less serious.

You can hear Cid's poems in tribute to his friend William Bronk at the

In each of four audio clips Cid first reads a short poem from _All of

approaching love between long-estranged friends circulates from poem to poem.

Re: John Lowther's query and for other interested parties:

I own a copy of KULTUR and a complete run of VORT which is indeed a
great mag--the Antin/Rothenberg issue is excellent!  I think most big
university libraries would have both:  I've seen VORT at Stanford in
rare book collection and worth looking into.  But in the meantime, if
you write to David, John, I'm sure he'd send you what you want--tapes
too--he is very generous and good about sending his stuff.  The early
work is very interesting vis-a-vis the later talk poems.

David just gave a talk piece at the new LACMA Humanities Institute as
did Jerry Rothenberg.  Huge crowd (mayb 300 or so) of people who rarely
go these things but it was dubbed as an "art event" and so draws a big
crowd.  His talk was called "California, the Nervous Camel" and I'll
leave it to you to figure out why California = Nervous Camel.

One Life, by Rukeyser, is hard to define: it is a biographical text in poem
and prose, also including documentary materials, all on the life of Wendell
Willkie.

Check out Fence #2 (still available in bookstores and at SPD and from me)
for an excerpt and with an introduction by Jan Heller Levi, editor of A
Muriel Rukeyser Reader and of a forthcoming biography of the poet herself.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Kenneth Goldsmith:

Live at Hallwall's

Buffalo, 23 February 1999

A small but fervent crowd was on hand for Goldsmith's reading, including poets
and readers from Buffalo, its outlying areas, and a welcome contingent of
Canadian poets, including Darren Wershler-Henry and Christian Bok, who had
braved the single digit jet-black trek from Toronto for the occasion of
Goldsmith's visit.

The reading, in a renovated factory nestled within walking distance of a
basement where Coltrane once played and an old-Buffalo bar once known for its
crowd of poets, was a dense work unfolding in sections drawn almost entirely
from Goldsmith's <i>No. 111</i>. These often dissonant, engaging passages
staggered forward in an evolution of increasing accessibility of semantic
value. Goldsmith began early in his big book, his reading being born from
guttural, gibberish phonemes, conglomerate rocks emerging into the light of a
primordial verbal dawn, an alphabet being born or an infant's first
experiments
with sound. Even more striking was the way the sounds seemed to grow,
elongate,
the way an orchestra's random and chaotic warm up almost instantaneously
leads,
upon a conductor's tap tap on a music stand, into Beethoven or Mozart or
another opus.

The tap tap of Goldsmith's voice, emerging from its symbolic birth as it
advanced dog-eared into chapters deeper into <i>No. 111</i> revealed, however,
not the unity or symmetry of a symphony, but a wry, in turned, and self-ironic
portrayal of what humans say and what humans write. Without context, and amid
layered passages of words, sounds, and vocalizations, and the physical dynamic
of Goldsmith's body making words, snips and runs of meaning emerged. As if
they
were things blurted out or strange things that you might find on scraps of
paper on the ground, it was a revelation of quirks of language and
hyperextensions of meanings that filled the theater with ionized sound
fragments
trained like a spotlight.

There were times the audience couldn't stop laughing. Many times the audience
was caught by surprise, as a seeming progression of ideas was suddenly caught
off-guard by a sudden turn at a verbal corner. There were moments of strange,
almost pained, sound fabrics. And moments of hilarity.

It was a reading that celebrated the possibilities of the oddities of our
common medium, language, one that left no reader without something to take
home. Amazingly, all this came from only a handful of pages from a book
made up
of hundreds. This surely should send any interested person to the book, for
there are yet many sounds to come forth.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I'm on digest, so this may have been addressed already, but, Steve S., the
NYTBR devoted its cover and a near-gatefold to Jonathan Galassi's
translation of Montale not, we must assume, because the merits of Galassi's
translation or of Montale's work moved Chip McGrath to do so, but because
Galassi is a mover and shaker at the Academy of American Poets, and at the
publishing entity known as Farrar, Straus & Giroux.

If I am remembering correctly, the piece's ID of Galassi was simply as "a
poet." I don't doubt Galassi's seriousness about the work. But one would
think the review would have come clean.  Book editors and book review
editors eat this stuff up though -- when a local boy or girl makes good and
actually produces something, they like to give him or her a little fete.

I think in the last year, the NYTBR has reviewed books of poems by Deborah
Garrison (an editor at the New Yorker), Mark Strand (reviewed by Deborah
Garrison), Geoffrey Hill (angry Brit.), Frieda Hughes (human interest). Am
I forgetting anyone?  A serious failure of editorial imagination.

Good naturedly -Mike

It's finally come to me!  One Life is the Wendell Wilkie book, is that
right?  You may be right, Burt, but your "definitely" is very
questionable.  At least Rukeyser's most recent publishers Paris Press
consider One Life to be, wait for it -- PROSE (witness their
classification of the book on page 141 of their edition of The Orgy,
1997).

Hello:


Have you included any of Hayden Carruth's long poems? He has made a number of
them, particularly outstanding are: ASYLUM(1957), MY FATHER'S FACE(1968),
VERMONT(1975) and THE SLEEPING BEAUTY(1970-1980). Technically, he is a
virtuoso, and he, more than many others, had a steady hand on the narrative
structure.



Best,


Gerald Schwartz

Richard Foreman's newest play, Paradise Hotel, is running through April 4 in
New York and is highly recommended. But I wanted here to call attention to his
new website

http://www.foreman.ontological.com/

While this site has some general information about Foreman's theater and
information about the current production, what is most interesting, and very
unusual, is that Foreman has put up many of his unedited/uncorrected texts
(scores of pages) and he is offering them up to theater directors to make their
own plays -- encouraging them to create contexts, characters, to reorder the
lines or cut according to the needs of the performance. In any case, the texts
make from great reading -- and in their present form many resemble, perhaps
are, poems.
