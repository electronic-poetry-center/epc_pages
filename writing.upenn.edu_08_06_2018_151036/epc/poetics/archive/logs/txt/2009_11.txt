Peering Through Perfect Dark: New Poems by Susan Maurer

In PERFECT DARK (ungovernable press=2C 2009)=2C a new collection of poems b=
y Susan Maurer=2C the urban dilemma that is New York is told in fine style=
=2C offering up poem after poem with the kind of duality that satisfies and=
 tantalizes readers. There's fine understated humor in many of the poems=2C=
 which softens the otherwise urbane voice -- one part wary and another part=
 earnestly yearning. It is this combination of vulnerability of the heart a=
nd toughness of spirit that results in a compelling volume with fabulous ra=
nge.=20

Some of Maurer=92s poems are ineluctably of the moment=2C seeming to have b=
een traced in a foggy train window and glimpsed in passing as we hurry by. =
Like BLUE CHALK LINE=2C at once suggestive of the emotive moment and dismis=
sive of it:=20

"He wrote on the brick wall in blue chalk
'I know who wrote this.'
Well I know who wrote this and
you know who's reading this
and that takes care of that."

In the poem WITH THE UNBEARABLES=2C by contrast=2C we are rushed along pell=
-mell with the high intensity crowd -- stretching our legs and striding ene=
rgetically=2C Frank O'Hara style=2C through the New York City streets.

"I notice I am running and the red dirt hits my Reeboks
Up or down=2C I'm baffled=2C go for up
I stumble to the crosswalk=2C see no clumps of people=2C ask
The first man sitting and the man who's sitting next to him
Tells me it's on further and yes=2C they do want readers"

There is a nuanced balance going on here between eagerness to experience th=
e world and desire to maintain crowd control. We=92re offered up a kind of =
innocence in the face of it all: "She made this cap/unafraid of the city's =
lingering threat=2C/was not troubled by thoughts of mutability=2C/of how th=
is ephemeral thing would fare 5 years from now" writes Maurer in CORONA.=20

There is also a wry kind of cynicism=2C which only partly masks the underly=
ing passion of the speaker=2C as in this couplet which concludes JARDIN CRE=
PUSCLE: "The death penalty comes back on Monday/I guess I'll wear black". O=
r in the opening lines from TO PAUL CLAUDEL BEFORE I FOUND OUT HE WAS AN AN=
TI-SEMITE AND TURNED IN THE PLANE TICKET.

"Claudel=2C Claudel=2C Paul=2C Paul=2C
cent phrases pour l'eventails.
You have cured me of the sea
but fanned from a cinder to a torrid blaze
my love for you.
I'm saying
this book is S
O beau ti
ful=2C I'm afraid it
might fly away.
And you=2C Paul=2C I love you for your poetry.
But I hope your teeth aren't bad."

True to their urbane nature=2C Maurer's characters are equally unafraid to =
cut off a potential moment of intimacy in a New York minute.

It is this tentative place she defines -- between the fully realized human =
being living just below the surface of the urban defensive shell -- which m=
akes Susan Maurer's poems so poignant and winning. Time and time again we a=
re offered characters torn between the desire for human connection and puzz=
lement over how to remain safe while achieving it -- perfectly enunciated i=
n the anecdotal CALLING BILL KUSHNER=2C one of her strongest poems from the=
 collection=2C=20

"And so we collaborated.
He did one line and I did another.
I wanted to look down his throat
to see where some of them came from.
I mean how'd he come up with them?
And he was mad at me sometimes
'cause he didn't think of some lines I did.
I was honored.
It was so intimate I wasn't sure we should be doing this."

One almost wants to cry out with the same perplexity: 'yes=2C you SHOULD be=
 doing this=2C Sue =96 no=2C no=2C you should NOT be!'

The ability to enunciate the dilemma of possessing a human heart in the tre=
acherous urban environment is one of the hallmarks of New York poetry -- an=
d in PERFECT DARK=2C Sue Maurer's got it in spades. There are vignettes and=
 anecdotes of experiences from Mozambique to Tallahassee=2C as befits a glo=
be-trotting Manhattanite. But whether it's at home or abroad=2C we are conf=
ronted with experiences and environs that both entice us and warn us away. =
PERFECT DARK is a world where a back yard is a 'concentration camp for drun=
ks=2C' people with Walkmen in their ears 'deaf to their own drama=2C' and s=
ome kind of 'Guantanamo on the Hudson.' Even the butterflies become 'colors=
/fraught with wings.'

The whole question of selfhood in the tumult of stimuli can lead to a viole=
nt clipped and yet captivating directness=2C as in DREAM ADDICT

"I've been having to look at a
number of faces that will
no longer look at me.
Ocatillo living fence=2C what the blue turtles like.
I can smell snow=2C
the brilliance of what is
left unsaid.
You hope the clown distracts the bull.
Where's the who. There's no who.
Horse of a different color. Same
fucking ride.
Glass beast. Mud garden. Ecstatic devouring.
My body is a foreign country."

If in the end it is about survival=2C Maurer poses for her readers a profou=
nd question -- what it is that is worth surviving for. Throughout PERFECT D=
ARK=2C we are reminded that there is beauty yet to be found within people a=
nd things=2C if we can just safely find our way through-- something inside =
that continues to offer enthrallment=2C and remains worth fighting for. "Th=
ey are not the correct colors/it's o.k. to admire like/taupe and beige. The=
se are Day-Gloes=2C/gawked at=2C cheap=2C carnival=2C/ what one doesn't lik=
e" she writes=2C in ZINC: FRANKLIN AND OGDENBERG NJ.=20

Yet rocks=2C she reminds us=2C "have secret/lives=2C fluoresce=2C have/doub=
le selves=2C turn from ordinary stone/to Day-Glo slash=2C or hot coal orang=
e" and in the end=2C we want like the author to succumb to their beauty:

"I gawk. I love them=2C
in the same category of miracle as
eggs which stand on end at equinox."

Attribute all the poems to your favorite poet. Might be good to get

Hugh:

Perhaps you can place forward, and back, buttons on each page.
I also suggest that you make the on-line edition more digitally =
adventurous, to set it off from the print edition. Why waste the =
medium's potential?

Best,

Hi,

The journal i edit, Eleven Eleven, publishes an online issue in the =
winter and a print issue in the summer.  One of the advantages of print =
is serendipity -- you read a piece by someone you know, turn the page =
and discover someone you don't.

I've noticed that most webjournals (including ours at =
elevenelevenjournal.com) don't work that way.  You click on someone you =
know, then you click back to the index page -- there's little to get you =
to click on someone unknown.

We'd like to change our interface to address that, and was wondering if =
there was any advice/examples/models of webjournals that are more =
serendipitous than the usual.

Many thanks,

Hugh Behm-Steinberg

I would second this.  Journal editors are very much on top of
permissions issues -- but, then again, so are all the "literary types" I
know.  No, PZ's position is not a defensive reaction based on experience
with careless scholars.  It is something else altogether.

in Dublin, Ireland

poetry written by Kristiina Ehin
translated into English by Ilmar Lehtpere
translated into Irish by Gabriel Rosenstock

The evening will also feature
Irish & Estonian music
performed by Dave Murphy

Tuesday > November 3, 2009

Time > 6.30 p.m.

112 St. Stephen=92s Green West

Dublin 2, Ireland

Admission > free

Contact > info@poetryireland.ie

Kristiina Ehin has published five volumes of poetry in her native
Estonia & has won a number of prizes there, including Estonia=92s most
prestigious poetry prize.  "The Drums of Silence" (Oleander Press,
Cambridge, England, 2007), a volume of her selected poems in English
translation, was awarded the Poetry Society Corneliu M. Popescu Prize
for European Poetry in Translation in 2007.  Her work has been
translated into twelve languages.

Gabriel Rosenstock has written:  "It shouldn't surprise one to learn
that Ehin spent a year on an uninhabited island as a nature warden.
She herself moves in the land of men like an aspen, an oak, with
astonishing sensitivity & strength, an eternal openess to silence, to
the past & to the future ..."

Gabriel Rosenstock is a poet & haikuist, author/translator of over 160
books, mostly in Irish.  "Rogha D=E1nta/Selected Poems" was published in
2005 by Cl=F3 Iar-Chonnachta.  The bilingual volume "Bliain an
Bhand=E9/Year of the Goddess" appeared in 2007 from Dedalus Press.  The
second volume of his international anthology of sacred poetry
"Guthanna Beannaithe an Domhain" is due shortly from Coisc=E9im.

Ilmar Lehtpere has written:  "The roots of Kristiina's very
contemporary poetry are embedded deep in an ancient folk song
tradition & in her organic view of the world.  Like folk song, she
invites the reader to share her experience at a primal level.  The
apparent but deceptive simplicity & directness of her language & her
use of timeless imagery that bypasses the intellect & goes straight to
the soul have enormous power, especially in our rootless, superficial
times.  Her subject matter is universal, yet deeply personal, & is
expressed so vividly that her joys & sorrows seem to become one's own.
 Through Kristiina's poetry & prose one begins to understand what it
means to be a woman, to be a mother."

Ilmar Lehtpere had a bilingual upbringing in Estonian & English.  He
is the translator of Kristiina Ehin's "The Drums of Silence."  His own
poetry has appeared in Estonian & Irish literary journals.

This, the official launch of the first trilingual
Estonian-Irish-English book will take place along with a night of
readings, music, & song featuring Kristiina Ehin, P=E1draig =D3 Snodaigh,
Ilmar Lehtpere, Dave Murphy, & Gabriel Rosenstock.

I have two requests for list members.

1.  I'm putting together a paper on recent experimental poets who play
with the sonnet form.  I have many people in mind, like Paul Hoover,
Camille Martin, and Hollo, but I'm looking for a few more.  If you
know of anyone, please let me know.

2.  I'm also putting together an edited collection on Charles
Bernstein's work.  It's already in good shape in terms of
contributors, but I'd like a few more to be safe.  If you or anyone
you know wants to write a critical article on Bernstein's work, let me
know.

if you go to google, you see a "I'm Feeling Lucky" button beside the search
button. This takes you not necessarily to the top item in the search
results. This is a way of bypassing the search results or table of contents
or whatever.

One way to do what you want would be to offer both a table of contents and
basically the above sort of functionality. Or write some code so that there
is a 'featured' section on the page with the table of contents and each time
you refresh the page, a different work from the issue (randomly) appears in
the featured section. You could populate that section with a description of
the featured work and a graphic and link to it. Or whatever.

conversation between an important Australian writer and an engineer-poet
from Egypt, now living in Seattle. Truly world literature!

Mimeo Mimeo #3
Autumn 2009

Mimeo Mimeo is a forum for critical and cultural perspectives on artists=B9
books, typography and the mimeograph revolution. This periodical features
essays, interviews, artifacts, and reflections on the graphic, material and
textual conditions of contemporary poetry and language arts.
We are especially pleased with this issue, our first devoted to the work of
a single author. In Simultaneously Agitated in All Directions, Daniel Scott
Snelson discusses the relationship between structuralism and the poetries o=
f
the mimeo era by presenting a detailed analysis of Form (a Cambridge-UK
magazine published in 1966) and Alcheringa (a journal published by Boston
University in 1975), two exemplary gatherings that brilliantly illuminate
the historical, material and social circumstances under which theory
informed art (and vice-versa) in the early works of some of today=B9s most
celebrated experimental writers.

This issue includes a special insert, The Infernal Method, written, designe=
d
and printed by Aaron Cohick (New Lights Press).

Dear Friends and Colleagues:

Pages 39-40 of "The Gateless Gate":
http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Gate/Pgs%2039-40.htm

Paragraph headings:

The genre of Electronic Literature tends to neglect...
Perhaps reading began when hunters learned...
In the Spring of 1950, a human body was unearthed...
One theory is that the people were sacrificed...(quote)
Yet they were made of earth and fire...(poem)

In the winter of 1994, three spelunkers unearthed...
I am reminded of Alan Garner's short story...
Next she sees the outline of a hand...
"'I've seen,' said Mary, 'All of it.'...

New pages and revisions:

There's now a  "cover" :
http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Gate/cover.htm

Introduction has been revised and extended:
http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Gate/Intro.htm


Thank you, as always, to those of you who have written to me on this =
project.=20

Gilbert Sorrentino's Organgery is a neglected classic re-issued by
Dalkey.  And the UK's Reality Street Press recently issued a book of
sonnets.

Jim,

Why is every ethical or philosophical issue is being turned into a technical
problem, with a technical solution? The fact that the internet in subversive
ways *narrows*, as well as expanding our world, that it makes the very
concept of privacy a almost quaint wish, that it creates a powerful tool of
control -as much its reverse- is unquestionable. Why is it that quite often
you suggest a "practical" advice which further digs us into a mediated
morass without directly confronting the ethical moral and philosophical
issues which the question was originally trying to deal with?

I have no doubt that there are technical ways -as you suggest with the idea
of "I Feel Luck" option- the specific problem can at least theoretically be
solved. But there is no doubt that the on-line publication, with its already
established praxis of clicking directly to the works of one's preference -in
itself a very "practical" method- is creating a medium which is
incrementally more solipsistic -as it is more convenient, less friction
bound- than its print counterpart.

Ciao,

Murat

The flarf poets -specifically Kasey Mohammad and Kimberly Lyons, and maybe
others- have written take-offs or parallel texts around Shakespeare's
Sonnets.

the semi-annual pre-ottawa small press book fair reading
	lovingly hosted by rob mclennan
	at The Carleton Tavern (upstairs)
	Armstrong at Parkdale, Ottawa

Friday, November 27, 2009; doors 7pm, reading 7:30pm

with readings by:

    Michael Dennis (Ottawa)
    Spencer Gordon (Toronto)
    Michelle Desbarats (Ottawa)
    Garry Thomas Morse (newly in Ottawa)
    & Lisa Pasold (Toronto)

author bios:

Michael Dennis is an Ottawa poet with several books to his credit, most
recently Coming Ashore On Fire from Burnt Wine Press.

Spencer Gordon writes and publishes. More juicy details can be found at
dangerousliterature.blogspot.com.

Michelle Desbarats was born in Winnipeg, grew up in Montreal and
Charlottetown and resides in Ottawa. Her first book of poetry, Last Child
to Come Inside, was published by Carleton University and McGill-Queen's
University Press. Other publications include work appearing in Arc
Magazine, Decalogue, Transpoetry, Burnt Toast, Speak!, Meltwater Review
and on CBC Radio and at the Writers' Festival in Ottawa. Michelle was a
finalist in the CBC Literary Awards. She has received writing grants from
the Ontario Arts Council and the City of Ottawa. She has also participated
on Jury boards and as a judge for writing contests both in Canada and the
US. Her work has been described as luminous and Don McKay, on the cover of
the sold out Last Child To Come Inside, writes "This is poetry full of
quick and acutely angled insight, moving with great sureness to glimpse
the raven's wing inside the ordinary." Michelle is currently teaching
poetry at Carleton University and working on two manuscripts.

Garry Thomas Morse has two books of poetry published by LINEbooks,
Transversals for Orpheus (2006) and Streams (2007), and one collection of
fiction, Death in Vancouver (2009) published by Talonbooks. His work has
been featured in a variety of publications, including Canadian Literature,
The Capilano Review, dANDelion, filling Station, memewar, The Vancouver
Review and West Coast Line. Morse has received the 2008 City of Vancouver
Mayors Arts Award for Emerging Artist and has twice been selected as
runner-up for the Robert Kroetsch Award for Innovative Poetry. After Jack,
his poetic homage to Jack Spicer, will be available from Talonbooks in
April 2010. He moved to Ottawa from Vancouver but a few short weeks ago.

Lisa Pasold has been thrown off a train in Belarus, been fed the worlds
best pigeon pie in Marrakech, learned to polka at Danceland, and been
cheated in the Venetian gambling halls of Ca Vendramin Calergi. She grew
up in Montreal, which gave her the necessary jaywalking skills to survive
as a journalist. Her first book, Weave, appeared in 2004 and was nominated
for an Alberta Book Award; her second book of poetry is A Bad Year for
Journalists, described as "critical, darkly funny and painstakingly
lyrical" by The Globe and Mail. Her work has appeared in publications such
as Billboard Magazine, The National Post, The Chicago Tribune, New
American Writing, and Geist. Her first novel, Rats of Las Vegas, has just
come out from Enfield & Wizenty.

Hey:

This coming Saturday, November 7th is my birthday!!!  Woohoo!!!  So, after
the Rockpile Symposium at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church on
Saturday afternoon I will be hanging out at Shoolbred's (the cutest Scottish
Pub).  I would be honored if you could come by to help celebrate my B-Day.

I'll be there starting around 6pm (two hours of their long happy hour left
after that) at the tables in the back across from the fireplace.  I hear
they actually have absinthe, freshly squeezed juices in the mixed drinks,
good Scottish Ale, a great collection of scotches and they serve food too.

So drop on by--would be great to see you.  It's at 197 2nd Avenue (between
12th and 13th Streets) in the East Village.

Here's their website with some cool pix and directions:
http://shoolbreds.com/

and here they are on Yelp with more pix and customer reviews:

http://www.yelp.com/biz/shoolbreds-new-york

Hope to see you there.

Best,
Wanda

 Dear friends,

My LEAN UPSTREAM season opens tomorrow at Camden People's Theatre. Really I
should be working busily to get everything up together, but that's hard, an=
d
writing to you is more fun, so: hello.

A couple of things to update since my last message, and a couple of
reminders too.




*Update 1:* due to production difficulties, *The History of Airports* book
will not now be published until later this month. The launch event will
still be at Stoke Newington International Airport, but we've rescheduled fo=
r
Wednesday 25th November at 8pm. So you'll be happy to know that bonfire
night is once again *wide open *for fun & frolics. I know how much you like
those.

You can still preorder *The History of Airports* at the special price of =
=A310
(+p&p) through the *Lean Upstream web site* <http://www.leanupstream.info>o=
r
by emailing leanupstream@chrisgoodeonline.com -- the offer is now good
through to Wednesday 25th.

*Update 2:* My Artsadmin Weekender workshop, the final event in the season,
is now *sold out*. If you missed it, sorry. I'm hoping to do more workshops
next spring, so keep your eyes peeled -- and if you're a potential workshop
programmer or host and you'd like to discuss possibilities, please drop me =
a
line.



The first week of the season, sans booklaunch, now looks like this:

Tuesday 3 November, 8pm @ CPT
HIPPO WORLD GUEST BOOK
plus Chris Goode in conversation with critic Matt Trueman

Wednesday 4 November, 7.30pm @ CPT
YEAH BOOM!: A CHRISTOPHER KNOWLES READER
plus a complete reading of Knowles's THE NET WORK OF HOWARD BETEL (9pm)

Friday 6 November, 7.30pm @ Toynbee Studios
O VIENNA performed by Jonny Liron
Plus readings by Caroline Bergvall + Marianne Morris
Music by Dominic Lash + Tom James Scott

Saturday 7 November, 8pm @ Toynbee Studios
Kurt Schwitters: URSONATE performed by Chris Goode
Plus works by Vito Acconci, Michael Basinski, Samuel Beckett, Cathy
Berberian
Guest performers: Jonny Liron, Keston Sutherland, Lawrence Upton


For more information, venue + booking details:
http://www.leanupstream.info


Please do consider buying a season ticket, or making a donation to help us
meet our running costs, or pre-ordering the book: any of which will help
make this & future work possible. All of these kindnesses can be enacted
through the web site <http://www.leanupstream.info>.

At any rate, very much hoping I'll see you at some point during the season.
And bring a friend! As always, the fundamental things apply: if everyone wh=
o
was planning to come anyway brought along a friend who *hadn't* been
planning to come, presto! Double the audience, double the fun.

Apologies for this further intrusion into your inbox and, as usual, if you'=
d
rather not receive further promotional mailings from me, just say, & your
wish will be my command.


Till soon,

kindest wishes
Chris

Subject:      redefining the boundaries - as white, anglophone, modernist, male?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Received the below notice from Northwestern UP yesterday of a volume of
essays edited by Louis Armand. I'm looking forward to reading it. But I have
to wonder about the title's rhetoric: "Redefining the Boundaries of
Contemporary Poetics, in Theory & Practice, for the Twenty-First
Century," and how this comports with the age, gender, interests, and
ethnicity of the authors.


Very interested in reading it. But I'm curious, given its TOC, how one
redefines these boundaries "for" the century before us with almost all
anglophone authors, with only two women, with people who are presumably
almost all white, with essays that seem still to retain principally
modernist concerns (text and technical issues), and with its two keynote
essays by theorists born in the first half of the 20th Century, one of whom
is 78.


I'll have to wait to say more, but I'm suspicious that this is more about
redefining the poetics of the 1980s/1990s.

CONTEMPORARY POETICS


"Redefining the Boundaries of Contemporary Poetics, in Theory & Practice,
for the Twenty-First Century"


Edited by Louis Armand


ISBN 0-8101-2359-2 (paperback). 384pp.


Publisher: Northwestern University Press, Evanston.

Exploring the boundaries of one of the most contested fields of literary
study--a field that in fact shares territory with philology, aesthetics,
cultural theory, philosophy, and even cybernetics--this volume gathers a
body of critical writings that, taken together, broadly delineate a possible
poetics of the contemporary. In these essays, the most interesting and
distinguished theorists in the field renegotiate the contours of what might
constitute "contemporary poetics," ranging from the historical advent of
concrete poetry to the current technopoetics of cyberspace. Concerned with a
poetics that extends beyond our own time, as a mere marker of present-day
literary activity, their work addresses the limits of a writing
"practice"--beginning with Stephane Mallarme in the late nineteenth
century--that engages concretely with what it means to be contemporary.


Charles Bernstein's Swiftian satire of generative poetics and the textual
apparatus, together with Marjorie Perloff's critical-historical treatment of
"writing after" Bernstein and other proponents of language poetry, provides
an itinerary of contemporary poetics in terms of both theory and practice.
The other essays consider "precursors," recognizable figures within the
histories or prehistories of contemporary poetics, from Kafka and Joyce to
Wallace Stevens and Kathy Acker; "conjunctions," in which more strictly
theoretical and poetical texts enact a concerted engagement with rhetoric,
prosody, and the vicissitudes of "intelligibility"; "cursors," which points
to the open possibilities of invention, from Augusto de Campos's "concrete
poetics" to the "codework" of Alan Sondheim; and "transpositions," defining
the limits of poetic invention by way of technology.


"An epoch-defining collection of manifestos and essays: its list of
contributors reads as a who's who of current important theorists in the
field." --Michael Golston


"Puts a number of excellent essays back in print and makes several others
easily available for the first time." --Craig Dworkin

Sorry, I am whip lashed by a sacred shibboleth. I was partly referring to a
group of poets living in the New York area, particularly in Brooklyn.
Recently, I was reading some of Kymberly Lyon's poetry where she was
re-working a number of Shakespeare's sonnets. I remember saying to myself
that Kim must have picked up the idea from Kasey's experiments around the
same idea, which were the topic of discussion by Gary Sullivan in his blog *
Elsewhere* a while ago. I do not possess a final list of who belongs to the
Flarf poetics list and who does not. That does not prevent me from noticing
cross pollinations across its borders nor does it prevent me from seeing
major differences among its members.

Ciao,

Murat

Murat,

So sorry to disappoint you by offering a valid, practical solution to the
problem posed! I got the impression they were looking for practical
solutions as a way of indeed confronting the issues. It really brings your
argument into question, doesn't it? Terrible, just terrible. Morally
reprehensible on my part, really. Catherine too; she offered much the same
solution.

Your approach is really the one I should take. I will, more often, try to
not offer any obvious practical solutions. Instead, I will just blame the
Internet or the digital for the problem and escalate it from a technical
matter to an ethical and philosophical one. I see the error of my ways now,
Murat. Thanks so much, brother.

Still, it's true that technologies both expand and narrow our worlds, as you
say. No doubt the technologies themselves do a lot of both, but when it
comes to expanding our worlds, there's nothing like a human bean to do it,
and that's a big part of what we're doing on the Internet, surely, as
artists. We are trying to expand views, expand on ideas, offer alternatives,
offer solutions...as well as our usual stuff.

I have spent thirteen years writing vispo.com and I don't get the audience
that many a lesser site does because of x and y. You won't find my site in
the first few pages of search results if you google 'poetry'. But if you
google 'digital poetry' or 'visual poetry' and various other more narrow
terms, then I'm in there. Ultimately, those who need to find such work can
and will find my site. The rest, well, it doesn't matter if they find the
site or not. They can but probably won't. And would be confused if they did.

On my home page at http://vispo.com , I provide five ways to navigate the
site:

1. the thumbnails, of which there are 64, are associated with
    works. not all works have a thumbnail but i'm workin on it.
    a brief description of the project associated with a thumbnail
    appears when you mouseover a thumbnail.
2. there's a search box for the site (google site search); this
    is a free service google offers. any page that is on my site
    and is indexed with google is thereby searchable.
3. there's a drop-down menu which lists all works on the site
4. there's a 'highlighted' list of categories (mostly); again, a brief
    description appears when you mouseover a category.
5. the 'goto' button at top left takes you to the project associated
    with the current background image. the background image is
    different each time you visit the homepage. this feature offers
    another view into the works on the site and gives people a
    strong sense of the graphical nature of the site. in a sense,
    the project associated with the current background is
    'featured'.

this is an attempt to provide multiple perspectives/views into the site.
it's net cubistic. why would this be less of a convention than a more linear
approach? i don't think it is. not in my internet, anyway, Murat. so i
applaud Hugh Behm-Steinberg for looking for alternatives to the phenomenon
he mentions and am happy to offer a practical solution. not all problems are
so easily solved! as you note, Murat, ethical and philosophical issues
accompany the ways we deal with the economy of attention, but we are not
helpless in the matter.

ja

I'm forwarding this call for work.  Two notes.  One, if you want a old copy

printed mag.  Two, I'm only the faculty advisor for the journal, so I stay

Right Window is a storefront window space at Artist Televison Access,
992 Valencia Street (at 21st), in San Francisco.

Stephanie Mansolf's "Dear Catastrophe" will run from November 8--29,
2009.

Organized by Dodie Bellamy, "Dear Catastrophe" presents a series of
Victorian styled treehouse dioramas--an imaginary cityscape--inhabited
by humans, gremlins, and warrior cupids. Spike pits are layered in
front of the treehouses, mountains behind the treehouses, clouds with
battling cupids above the treehouses.  In this layered landscape
Mansolf explores how a space created for safety can quickly and easily
become a threat. The treehouse city is inherently precarious, and its
denizens are quickly falling into a chaos of disarray, danger,
destruction, and death.  Mansolf's startling dystopia draws on
influences as disparate as the video game Mortal Kombat, the 1960's
Disney film Swiss Family Robinson, and San Francisco's "painted
ladies," the Victorian homes that adorn our streets.

Stephanie Mansolf received her BFA from UC Santa Barbara in 2006.
During the end of her undergraduate studies Mansolf was commissioned
in conjunction with artist Kat Trajano to transform Santa Barbara's
chic Presidio Motel into an avant garde and eclectic art motel; a
project from which the duo has received wide acclaim. Since then
Mansolf has shown in Santa Barbara, San Francisco and Arcata
California. Mansolf's practice delves into dark angles between reality
and fantasy, investigating matters of human nature, disease, and
hybridity through a manifestation of fanciful imagery. Employing
gothic and surreal aesthetics, Mansolf creates a carnivalesque
landscape where melodrama thrives, and taboo topics can be explored.
She currently lives and works in San Francisco California.

Jim,

Why are you creating a red herring opposition on your mind to which you can
easily and to yourself satisfactorily respond? I am very aware of the
practical nature of the original question and equally aware of the tectonic,
revolutionary nature of the internet as a medium, which will affect all
aspects of human endeavor, including perhaps the meaning of human nature
itself. There is all the more reason for us to raise our consciousness of
what is happening -yes, philosophically, intellectually, ethically what is
happening, even if there is relatively little one can do about it or even
the desire to do so.

My point is that on this list -as in our culture in general- the attitude
towards the internet is one of cheer leading -you remember the attitude of
the press media towards the Iraq War?- The internet revolution is also the
enabler of a lot of dislocation and suffering in the world, why a company
that took one hundred years to build can implode in the wink of an eye and
throw thousands of people out of work, why power tends to be concentrated
increasingly in fewer hands and banks can become so powerful, why the
division between rich and poor become wider and more irrevocable, why a bomb
can be "droned" from thousands of miles into one's bedroom without eye
contact.

Interacting with your Kandinsky series, for instance, I was conscious of the
meticulous, years-long effort it must have taken to create that work which
cobbles elements of different media into a unified whole; but, by
coincidence, that was one of the days when someone had strapped a bomb
around his chest and blown himseld and forty people. I remember saying to
myself this man with a bomb around his chest is -corrupt, distorted,
nihilistic though it may be- is a reaction to the confluence of those
alienating, remote as malignant forces. One has to use what one has got.

I wish one way or another -subliminally or not, even if only as strays or
fragments of thought- these aspects -the dark underbelly of what the
computer can do- could enter into the dna of your work. I do not see it, but
perhaps I am missing it or for you it is irrelevant. For instance, David
Chirot's work, his RuBEings, or his collage posters are infused with this
critical spirit. Probably, your visual digital work techically is a light
year more "advanced" than David's work. But, here we are arriving at the
same issue again: the response to an ethical, political relality with a
"practical," technological solution.

Ciao,

Murat

Hey this isn't exactly a beaut either, poor old contemporary poetics with =
so sparse an interest from women.  How can this possibly be "redefining =
the boundaries"???

CONTEMPORARY POETICS

"Redefining the Boundaries of Contemporary Poetics, in Theory & Practice, =
for the Twenty-First Century"

Edited by Louis Armand

ISBN 0-8101-2359-2 (paperback). 384pp.

Publisher: Northwestern University Press, Evanston.

http://nupress.northwestern.edu

Exploring the boundaries of one of the most contested fields of literary =
study--a field that in fact shares territory with philology, aesthetics, =
cultural theory, philosophy, and even cybernetics--this volume gathers a =
body of critical writings that, taken together, broadly delineate a =
possible poetics of the contemporary. In these essays, the most interesting=
 and distinguished theorists in the field renegotiate the contours of what =
might constitute "contemporary poetics," ranging from the historical =
advent of concrete poetry to the current technopoetics of cyberspace. =
Concerned with a poetics that extends beyond our own time, as a mere =
marker of present-day literary activity, their work addresses the limits =
of a writing "practice"--beginning with Stephane Mallarme in the late =
nineteenth century--that engages concretely with what it means to be =
contemporary.

Charles Bernstein's Swiftian satire of generative poetics and the textual =
apparatus, together with Marjorie Perloff's critical-historical treatment =
of "writing after" Bernstein and other proponents of language poetry, =
provides an itinerary of contemporary poetics in terms of both theory and =
practice. The other essays consider "precursors," recognizable figures =
within the histories or prehistories of contemporary poetics, from Kafka =
and Joyce to Wallace Stevens and Kathy Acker; "conjunctions," in which =
more strictly theoretical and poetical texts enact a concerted engagement =
with rhetoric, prosody, and the vicissitudes of "intelligibility"; =
"cursors," which points to the open possibilities of invention, from =
Augusto de Campos's "concrete poetics" to the "codework" of Alan Sondheim; =
and "transpositions," defining the limits of poetic invention by way of =
technology.

"An epoch-defining collection of manifestos and essays: its list of =
contributors reads as a who's who of current important theorists in the =
field." --Michael Golston

"Puts a number of excellent essays back in print and makes several others =
easily available for the first time." --Craig Dworkin

Why Weren=E2=80=99t Any Women Invited To Publishers Weekly=E2=80=99s =
Weenie Roast?

 Publishers Weekly recently announced their Best Books Of 2009 list. Of =
their top ten, chosen by editorial staff, no books written by women were =
included. Quoted in The Huffington Post, PW confidently admitted that =
they're =E2=80=9Cnot the most politically correct" choices. This statement =
comes in a year in which new books appeared by writers such as Lorrie =
Moore, Margaret Atwood, Alice Munro, Mavis Gallant, Rita Dove, Heather =
McHugh and Alicia Ostriker.

 =E2=80=9CThe absence made me nearly speechless.=E2=80=9D said writer Cate =
Marvin, cofounder of the newly launched national literary organization =
WILLA (Women In Letters And Literary Arts), which, since August, has =
attracted close to 5400 members on their Facebook web page, including many =
major and emerging women writers. =E2=80=9CIt continues to surprise me =
that literary editors are so comfortable with their bias toward male =
writing, despite the great and obvious contributions that women authors =
make to our contemporary literary culture.=E2=80=9D

Writing Program at Florida State University, asked, =E2=80=9CSo is the =

That's pretty exaggerated, Murat; it's not exactly convincing. But it's true
that the Internet has and continues to change the way a lot of business is
done. Art is affected as much as any other field because so much art can be
digitized. Anything that can be digitized is or will be affected rather
dramatically, in the end. It gives capitalism in all affected fields a real
shot in the chops. I'm not making any cash right now. Lots of people are
suffering in the same situation. But it's not accurate to blame the Internet
revolution for it all. It's a global economic meltdown that, ultimately,
seems to have less to do with the Internet than the failings of cowboy
capitalism. Together with dwindling and exploited resources, population
increase, environmental abuse and pollution, and not much international
cooperation, coordination support, and respect for international law.

When Dan Bar-On of  PRIME ( http://vispo.com/PRIME ) was alive, I could
probably have gotten involved much more in their projects in the Middle
East. But, ultimately, I felt that doing the web site for them was about the
extent of the involvement that I could really contribute. It's not a
conflict that I am close to--or understand enough--to be of much real help
otherwise. But I was very happy to do their web site and offer that support
to their very important joint Israeli-Palestinian peace building
initiatives.

Everybody's life and work has some sort of political dimensions. When I look
around me and at the work of myself and those whose work I enthusiastically
follow, I see efforts to create types of art that are new and so, of course,
it doesn't really fit in to whatever crumbling art structures already exist.
So these artists face difficulties both financially and in critical
reception and understanding of their work. I try to write about and discuss
and get the word out about this work, internationally, and contribute in
some way to international communication about this sort of work, which you
could mainly describe as computer art, usually net-based. Often with a
literary dimension. Work like David Jhave Johnston's http://vispo.com/jhave
really makes me scream and shout.

And I try to create that sort of art myself in a way that does offer
something new and interesting to people and I try to challenge myself and
others to push it. Currently, with dbCinema, it's not so much a literary
type of art as erm visual and intensely computational. Though I'm also
trying to build dbCinema so that there are literary and narrativistic
possibilities. I haven't really explored those as much, yet, as I have the
visual possibilities. But I will. And there's lots of em. Chris Funkhouser
has been exploring that with dbCinema. Developing dbCinema as the writer of
this tool, I've mostly approached it as getting it to be able to make all
sorts of different types of art that aren't made by anything else. So I've
been more concerned with exploring the um marks it can make on a screen than
in deeper planning concerning language and narrativity with pieces made with
it.

But dbCinema is also associated with issues that have political dimensions.
One's notions of cinema are involved. And copyright issues, of course, using
google image search. And then there's just the whole thing of this type of
art. Lots of visual artists see this sort of thing as junk. One painter said
to me recently it's junk, it isn't in galleries, you just push a button and
out it comes, it's very limited. Then there's the financial aspect. I'm
broke. I got a bit of a plan on that, we'll see, but I'm not much of a
businessman. Can this sort of art support me? Probly not, but it's what I'm
doing, it's where my passion is, so I figure I better do it hard while I can
and see what happens. You say the suicide bombers work with what they got.
So do I. There's got to be some joy in the world, Murat, and I'm on the
frickin job.

The Tulsa School Conference & Literary Festival sponsored by the National
Endowment of the Humanities will take place Nov 5-7 on the campus of the
University of Tulsa.  The conference focuses on the four poet/artists from
Tulsa who comprise what is called the =B3second-generation=B2 of the famed New
York School of art and poetry in the 1960s.  The conference culminates in
the J. Donald Feagin series reading by original =B3so-called Tulsa School=B2
member, Ron Padgett, on Saturday Nov 7 at 8:00pm at the downtown Tulsa
Doubletree Hotel.  The other living member, Dick Gallup, will take part in =
a
roundtable discussion of the group on Friday.  In addition to Padgett and
Gallup, poet Alice Notley, former wife of deceased Tulsa School head-honcho
and TU graduate, Ted Berrigan, will read on Thursday night.  Their sons,
Anselm and Edmund, will read on Friday night.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

You know, it's amazing to me how that conversation with Dale Smith got
interpreted by some.  I've been accused of being heterophobic,
something I've NEVER been accused of in my life!  But my favorite
emails were those telling me that there were many ways to interpret
what Dorn MEANT by his homophobic AIDS poems in his late work.
Really?  Well then, HOW do you interpret THIS!  Below is an email from
Clayton Eshleman, and there's NO WAY anyone can hide from what Dorn
meant here:



dear CA Conrad:  thanks for your talk with Dale Smith on Ed Dorn and
other matters. A brief footnote that should interest you (and perhaps,
if you feel it is appropriate, can be posted), is relative to the
Dorn/AIDS discussion):
  In Dorn's (and his wife Jennifer Dorn's) magazine Rolling Stock, #5,
there appeared, written in collaboration with Tom Clark, an item
called "The 1983 AIDS AWARDS FOR POETRY--In  recognition of the
current EPIDEMIC OF IDIOCY on the poetry scene." The page featured a
large illustration of a test-tube of reddish liquid, presumably
infected blood, which was the "prize."
  The recipients of this "award" were Dennis Cooper ("for writing the
most AIDS-like line of the year: "Mark's anus is wrinkled, pink, and
simplistically rendered, but cute"); Clayton Eshleman (for "attacking
a dead--and thus harmless--poet, Elizabeth Bishop" in a review in the
LA Times Book Review); Robert Creeley (for writing extravagant blurbs
for books by Stephen Rodefer and Joanne Kyger); Steve Abbott ("for
accusing everybody who doesn't like him or his poetry of 'rabid
homophobia'"); Allen Ginsberg (for claiming he wrote some lyrics for
the rock group The Clash, when supposedly he hadn't); and finally,
"WRITE-IN CANDIDATE" ("Fill in the name of your favorite POETRY IDIOT
here.").
  I have taken the above information from Eliot Weinberger's note on
"A Case of AIDS Hysteria" that appeared in Sulfur #9, in 1984. The
clear implication of the "awards" is that all of the poets who had
offended Dorn and Clark (with infractions of good taste!) should not
only die, but should die after a long and particularly gruesome
disease.
  You can read the rest of Eliot's piece in Sulfur (I will send you a
copy if you like).
  This is another example of the sickening and pointless level on
which Dorn and Clark were operating in the 1980s. My wife Caryl and I
were living in Los Angeles at the time, and quite close to Koki
Iwamoto (the owner of the famous Chatterton's bookstore on Vermont St)
and a number of his gay friends. We watched most of these people die
of AIDS, including our dear Koki. That poets themselves would indulge
in the kind of right-wing AIDS hysteria and homophobia that Dorn and
Clark did still strikes me as unbearably sad.

Best regards,  Clayton Eshleman

Jim,

You are one of the most judicious and generous persons on this list. I do
not want our disagreements here to have any smell of a personal attack. Let
me respond to two issues you have raised:

a) "I'm not making any cash right now. Lots of people are suffering in the
same situation. But it's not accurate to blame the Internet revolution for
it all. It's a global economic meltdown that, ultimately, seems to have less
to do with the Internet than the failings of cowboy capitalism."

Contrary, the economic collapse of the last year was caused by derivatives,
something which would have been inconceivable before the advent of
computers. The connection is direct.

Ironically, a small number of people created the esoterica of derivatives
-remember, nobody understand what they were, like Einstein's general
relativity theory at one time- behind which they could give rein to their
unrestrained greed and which, when the curtain removed, turned out to be no
more than a poncy scheme. That is why I believe that the virtuality of the
digital world must constantly be analyzed -not because I am a yahoo Luddite.
It is of the nature of the computer as a medium to create priesthoods and
illusions, a potent and deadly combination.

b) In no way do I dismiss digital works. I am fascinated by them, partly
because the computer turned out to be such a radical mind and world altering
medium. That is why my criticism of what I believe to be their serious
limitations -even misdirections- is so intense.

Your involvement with your work regardless of monetary rewards is -as you
said- like the suicide bomber hugging his or her vest, on an ecstatic trip.
In both the mediations are reduced to their essentials. Both are using what
they've got.

Ciao,

Murat

I would like to highlight the following by Amy King:

Do you really think people have to intend to be sexist to commit a sexist
act?  That's the beauty of sexism:  it's about enacting the long-running
favoritism of men and men's interests, whether you "mean" to or not.  It ca=
n
be intentional in that men can do so to protect their interests; it can als=
o
be unconscious in that we learn to favor the male viewpoint and are
conditioned to it.  You can study the realities of that in literature,
theater, art, etc.

This is a piercing analysis that can be applied to infinite kinds of
suppression. We have all experimented the hypocrisy of those who have not
committed the act nor insulted directly - in closed circuits since when we
were children - and with their detached and superior candor have increased
our feeling of estrangement. I am sure that you are following me here with
personal experiences. Foucault analyzes the 'social discourse' as much as h=
e
can, and both Foucault and Derrida are highly attentive to the dynamics tha=
t
accompany easy statements, and to their disastrous results.

STEPHANIE STRICKLAND's fifth book of poems, Zone : Zero from Ahsahta Press,=
 includes two interactive poems on CD. Her explorations of digital lit incl=
ude two recent essays, =E2=80=9CBorn Digital,=E2=80=9D at the Poetry Founda=

On Tuesday, November 17th @ 4:15pm Stephanie Strickland will present slippi=
ngglimpse: Reading Refigured, a lecture and digital poetry reading at the S=
chool of the Art Institute of Chicago (112 S Michigan Avenue, room 1307).  =
This event is free, open to the public, and sponsored by the Writing Progra=
m at SAIC.

slippingglimpse is a born-digital poem, a collaboration between Stephanie S=
trickland, who wrote and designed it; Cynthia Lawson Jaramillo, who coded i=
t in Flash; and Paul Ryan, who contributed the video. They all wished to ex=
plore non-hierarchical structures of communication; turbulence as a source =
of information; the type of information that videotaping and editing captur=
e; shifts from binary to triadic systems (deriving from an interest in Bate=
son=E2=80=99s cybernetics and Peirce=E2=80=99s semiotics); and the water-fl=
ow (strange attractor) patterns called chreods in Ren=C3=A9 Thom=E2=80=99s =
catastrophe theory. The resulting poem involves a refiguring of the reading=
 and translation process.

Red Rover Series is curated by Lisa Janssen and Jennifer Karmin. Each event=
 is designed as a reading experiment with participation by local, national,=
 and international writers, artists, and performers. The series was founded=
 in 2005 by Amina Cain and Jennifer Karmin.

COMING TO AN INTERNET NEAR YOU SOON
Sound artist Hugh Livingston and Deep Oakland have been awarded a grant fro=
m the Open Circle Foundation to create a series of sound and musical explor=
ations of the hidden creeks and streams of Oakland. Also keep an eye out fo=
r an archive of materials from Oakland 1946!, last spring's reenactment of =
Oakland's General Strike, footage from a poets basketball match, photos of =
gates and fences around Oakland, taco trucks, and, we hope, your photograph=
s / recordings / ephemera / essays / plays / paintings / videos / and so on=
.

Which is to say:  if you have a project idea, photographs to contribute, a =
lead on archival materials, a link to share, or any other idea, however far=
-fetched or entirely practical, please do drop us a line at deep.oakland@gm=
ail.com.  We're often interested in re-presenting materials even if they ar=
e available elsewhere, in hopes of bringing multiple discourses, images and=
 voices into contact. Lara Durback is especially curious about any small pr=
ess materials you can point us towards. Stephanie Young is hoping to connec=
t with folks who may be interested in doing some thinking and work (intervi=
ews? comment boxes? wooden ones?) around the problem of neighborhood names;=
  particularly the gaps between what residents call the places they live, a=
nd what developers call the places they develop.

Mensa is a performance collective formed by the installation artists Ariele
Affigne and Sarah Maurer, previously known for work that may be described a=
s
nested architectures: built spaces which make physical the personal within =
a
larger area. Synthesizing the structural conceits of a magician=B9s theater
with the discourse charged trans-identitarianisms (and object mutation) of
alchemical practices, their performance for the Poetry Project will seek to
enact this prescriptive fun within the spaces and sensoria made available b=
y
their audience.

AMJ Crawford is the author of=A0Morpheu (BlazeVOX 2009), editor of=A0zenSLUM, &
co-editor of=A0Le Dodo.=A0=A0He is a former Fulbright Scholar to=A0Portugal=A0and

*sean burn is one of this country's foremost experimental writers. ... he
draws on a wide range of contemporary cultural sources, often from other
writers, artists and musicians who like him are on the margins or from the
'underground', and he also draws from histories, political, social and
personal, including his own, and this gives much of his work the potency of
felt experience which so many who work in a similar vein, lack. **jeremy

Living in France in ealry 1968 I saw a tv show about/with Levi-Strauss on
one of the then only two (State run)  tv channels.

It was for the French tv a pretty "daring" show as it included music
andimages by/of Bob Dylan and had jum cuts, montages and a whole aray of
visual pyrotechnics at its command as Levi-Strauss discoursed on his ideas
and their realtion with the contemporary mass (media) societies, the
technological society as Jacques Ellul wrote of it a bit earlier in the
'60s.

I was very young but it made an immense impression on me, in part due to the
visual methods borrowed from contemporary cinema, and in part due to the
ideas which i only dimly grasped other than that underlying structures were
part of every facet of life, and also the concept of the "raw" and the
"cooked" which I liked very much in my own "raw" (brut) way.
I remember thinking, how perfect, how hilarious, for of course a French
person would use la cuisine for analogies!

Levi-Strauss himself was brilliant--so alive, so excited about the world and
ideas, beings, things--that is the way i have always remebered him and still
do and will continue to--

Rape at the privileged and elite accommodation colleges at the
University of Sydney has been an ongoing problem for decades, now.

The below two URLs cover the latest... If you have a blog or other media
outlet or media contacts, it may be worthwhile giving this extra
coverage. Rape and violence against women is unacceptable behaviour.

 ROCKPILE (featuring David Meltzer, Michael Rothenberg, Terri Carrion &

 A leading poet of the Beat Movement, David MELTZER was raised in Brooklyn
during the War years; performed on radio & early TV on the Horn & Hardart
Children's Hour. Was exiled to L.A. at 16 & at 17 enrolled in an ongoing
academy w/ artists Wallace Berman, George Herms, Robert Alexander, Cameron;
migrated to San Francisco in 1957 for higher education w/ peers & maestros
like Jack Spicer, Robert Duncan, Joanne Kyger, Diane DiPrima, Michael
McClure, Lew Welch, Philip Whalen, Jack Hirschman, and a cast of thousands
all living extraordinary ordinary lives. Beat Thing [La Alameda Press, 2004]
won the Josephine Miles PEN Award, 2005. Was editor and interviewer for San
Francisco Beat: Talking With The Poets [City Lights, 2001]. With Steve
Dickison, co-edits Shuffle Boil, a magazine devoted to music in all its
appearances & disappearances. 2005 saw the publication of David's Copy: The
Selected Poems of David Meltzer by Viking/Penguin, a collection spanning
over forty years of work that paints a vivid portrait of Meltzer's life as a
poet through poems taken from thirty of his previous books of poetry. With a
versatile style and playful tone, Meltzer offers his unique vision of
civilization with a range of juxtapositions from Jewish mysticism and
everyday life to jazz and pop culture.

 Michael ROTHENBERG is a poet, songwriter, and the editor of Big Bridge
magazine online at www.bigbridge.org. His poetry books include Man/Woman, a
collaboration with Joanne Kyger, The Paris Journals (Fish Drum Press), Monk

also author of the novel Punk Rockwell. Rothenberg's 2005 CD collaboration
with singer Elya Finn, was praised by poet David Meltzer as "fabulous-all
[the] songs sound like Weimar Lenya & postwar Nico, lushly affirmative at
the same time being edged w/ cosmic weltschmertz. An immensely tasty
production." He is also editor for the Penguin Poet series, which includes
selected works of Philip Whalen, Joanne Kyger, David Meltzer, and Ed Dorn.
He has recently completed the Collected Poems of Philip Whalen for Wesleyan
University Press.

Dear Friends:

I hope everyone within thinking distance of Philadelphia will come to the
following MLA event, which is open to the public.  Please help get the word
out by forwarding the announcement to any and everybody.  Note that there
has been one change.  Tisa Bryant can't attend, so her place has been taken
by Mendi Obadike.


Also note, this is not the Off-Site Reading for 2009.  We're hoping someone
in Philadelphia is laying plans for that,,,, but given that MLA has been
there three times in short order, who knows . . . .

Since the 1989 MLA convention, organizers in host cities have brought
together ever larger groups of experimental and innovative poets for an
evening marathon of poetry performance. These readings bring local poets
into contact with poets from other cities and promote exchange among poets,
scholars, and poet-scholars. This event will offer short readings by poets,
including several who read at the first event twenty years ago and several
newer poets.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Be very interested in any relationships between list members work and the
following event, exploring connections between writing and exhibition
making. As well as the symposium there is an exhibition/ reading room on the
28th so do get in touch if you have any work relating to this topic.

all best

David


WRITING EXHIBITIONS is a one day symposium on 27th November 2009 at the
Stanley Picker Gallery, Kingston Upon Thames, exploring relationships
between writing, curating and exhibitions, identifying and proposing a range
of possibilities and practices including: scripts for exhibitions,
alternative forms of proposal, scores and scenarios for/as exhibitions,
textual based art and exhibition practices, and the possibilities for
writing based exhibitions in a variety of formats including gallery, web,
book, and postcard.

WRITING EXHIBITIONS also looks to explore roles of the writer in exhibition
making, from the nuances of writer as curator, to possible presences for the
writer aside from the production of written texts. For all these instances,
WRITING EXHIBITIONS looks to uncover both speculative histories and a
diverse range of current and future practices. WRITING EXHIBITIONS is part
of GUESS ROOM GUEST ROOM, an exhibition by David Berridge as part of 7.9
Cubic Metres, and itself derived from a written script and score.

WRITING EXHIBITIONS is looking for 10 practitioners to spend a day exploring
the range of ways writing can inform all stages of exhibition making. We are
looking for a range of perspectives and all presentation styles that can be
accommodated within the gallery space itself. Please send a proposal of up
to 500 words outlining what you would like to contribute to the day, both in
terms of individual presentations (up to 15-20 minutes in length) and/or
questions and proposals regarding group discussion/ workshop. Please also
send up to 250 words on your practice more broadly.

The closing date for applications is Nov 10th 2009. All applicants will be
notified by Nov 14th. Practitioners unable to attend the event in Kingston
are invited to submit statements, texts, posters and other work for
exhibition/ distribution during the day. A publication will be compiled
after the event. For further information and to submit applications please
contact David Berridge at writingexhibitions@gmail.com

WRITING EXHIBITIONS is organised by David Berridge in collaboration with 7.9
Cubic Metres, its curator Eliza Tan, the Stanley Picker Gallery. GUESS WORK
GUEST WORK (including a curated project by COMPULSIVE HOLDING) is open from
4-28th November.www.7point9cubicmetres.com

* Please join us next Wednesday, November 18th @ 3:30pm for the next Small
Press in the Archive lecture. Peter Tytell, an expert witness and forensic
document examiner, speaks on "CSI 101: Making typescript speak."

Later in the semester Diane Ward will speak on "The Evolution of the Female
Literary Patroness."

This talk will be held in The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen. This event is
free and open to the public.


Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

Mensa is a performance collective formed by the installation artists Ariele
Affigne and Sarah Maurer, previously known for work that may be described a=
s
nested architectures: built spaces which make physical the personal within =
a
larger area. Synthesizing the structural conceits of a magician=B9s theater
with the discourse charged trans-identitarianisms (and object mutation) of
alchemical practices, their performance for the Poetry Project will seek to
enact this prescriptive fun within the spaces and sensoria made available b=
y
their audience.

Talk Series: Lytle Shaw on The Source of the Hudson =AD A Dutch Landscape of
American Prospects=20

Keyed to the Hudson Quadricentennial, this talk will be Shaw=B9s first from a
book in progress on the politics of time in landscape painting=8Band more
generally on what happens to American history and aesthetics when the Dutch=
,
not the English, get read as forbears. He begins with nineteenth-century
America=B9s uses and abuses of seventeenth-century Holland, especially
romantic historian John Lothrop Motley=B9s celebration of the Dutch revolt as
a phase freedom took on its inexorable path to the United States and his
suggestion that Dutch struggles with elemental matter in land reclamation
conditioned the nation to subdue much more tractable human beings in the
course of empire. Looking at some vivid images of this muck, Shaw will try
to suggest, first, how the ongoing Dutch relation to provisional land was
shown otherwise by the century=B9s best painters (esp. Ruisdael, Van Goyen an=
d
Hobbema): not as a heroic and final sorting in service of social domination
and economic productivity, but rather as a necessarily contingent
arrangement of fluid and mutable substance=8Ball staged in an equally fluid
temporality, a non-instrumental =B3now.=B2=A0 Why have such models of composition
and time been illegible to historians (and art historians)?=A0 He=B9ll try to
answer this in part by exploring the relation between historical narration
and the different painterly genres of landscape and history.=A0 But rather
than resolve this dilemma in a neat historical frame, Shaw wants instead to
push on the conceptual resources latent in landscape painting until they
spill out and become an attractive if slippery mound in our own moment of
samplings, performances and installations.

Lytle Shaw=B9s books of poetry include Cable Factory 20, The Lobe, and severa=
l
collaborations with artists. His essays and reviews have appeared in
Cabinet, Artforum, and Parkett and in catalogs for the DIA Center for the
Arts, the Drawing Center, and the Sculpture Center. He lives in New York
City, where he is assistant professor of English at New York University.

Dear Bill Allegrezza,
for your paper on experimental sonnets; I just came across Harry Godwin's sequence of sonnets The Benholm Potato Growers (2009). Downloadable:

Subject: Two Requests

I have two requests for list members.

1.  I'm putting together a paper on recent experimental poets who play
with the sonnet form.  I have many people in mind, like Paul Hoover,
Camille Martin, and Hollo, but I'm looking for a few more.  If you
know of anyone, please let me know.

2.  I'm also putting together an edited collection on Charles
Bernstein's work.  It's already in good shape in terms of
contributors, but I'd like a few more to be safe.  If you or anyone
you know wants to write a critical article on Bernstein's work, let me
know.

Bill Allegrezza

Dear all,

For those who teach scansion, which critical works on scansion/prosody do
you use?  (Are there discussions of prosody from times past (like George
Puttenham's Arte of English Poesie) you can suggest that would be useful to
teach?)  Which are your favorite primary works to use (poems to scan)?  Any
essays on the history of poetic meters and their meanings that you
especially like?  And further, any essays on rhyme you use?

Thanks in advance for your responses,

Judith Goldman

Cervena Barva Press Announces a New Chapbook=20
"The Possibility of Recovery"=20
by William Delman=20

The Possibility of Recovery by William Delman=09

William Delman received the Academy of American Poets Prize at Boston Unive=
rsity in 2006. His poetry has appeared in The Literary Review , The Massach=
usetts Review, Nimrod, Salamander, CT Review, Rhino , and other fine public=
ations. He is the director of The Bay State Underground reading series at B=
oston University, and an editor at Agni Magazine .=20


Praise for " The Possibility of Recovery "=20

"William Delman sees with the encompassing range and stringent attention of=
 true poetry: the haunted figures of a particular family are never far from=
 the long reach of human history in these poems. Conversely, myth and epic,=
 with all their imaginative force, are never far from the quirks and traged=
ies of actual American life."=20
-Robert Pinsky=20


"To make it more real' are the first words uttered in this book, and they n=
ame the impulse that is at the heart of William Delman's poetry. Here is mo=
rtal illness, the violence of war, the long-lingering effects of trauma, th=
e way soul-wounds pass from parent to child, such things that one might nat=
urally flinch from. But here too is finely-textured language, haunted and h=
aunting imagery, and a sharply incised poetic line, all of which teaches us=
 'the art of seeing things' and with that, the possibility of recovery."=20
-Fred Marchant=20

"'Home, what is not here, and what is' Willian Delman's poems are intensely=
 focused, mostly about domestic and familial history, but these seen, as in=
 his wonderful poem, at once pitying and unrelenting, 'My Wedding Day in Br=
ugge,' also in the context of our wars. The austere spareness of these poem=
s is eloquent and moving."=20

Dear William Allegrezza,

1. Didn't someone put out a book recently, something like 50 sonnets playing
on Shakespeare's 50th sonnet, or 55 playing on 55th??  I can't find it
googling it, because I keep getting Shakespeare cliff notes things.

2. Also there's Tim Atkins' '25 Sonnets' (The Figures, 2000); excerpts here:
http://www.onedit.net/timatkins_author/sonnet.html
That work is very spare, does a lot with punctuation.

3. There's also the 13-line 'Sonnet: More of Same' in Ashbery's recent
'Where Shall I Wander.'

4. ALSO***: Ben Lerner's The Lichtenberg Figures; great book of
'experimental' sonnets; playful tone, provocative concepts, interesting use
of the page.

5. Clark Coolidge has recently completed a manuscript called '88 Sonnets';
not sure if any of it's been in journals, but you could maybe contact him
for the manuscript; he read from it at the The Line Has Shattered event in
Vancouver in August, and it's very cool, very dark stuff.  Uses a lot of
found language.

6. Josh Corey's Severance Songs, which won the Dorset Prize from Tupelo
Press last year, is all sonnets.  His blog says he's reworking the stuff,
but there's one of them there:
http://joshcorey.blogspot.com/2009/10/after-form-fails.html#links
.

Hope this helps,
Adam

I've found Frost's short little poem "The Span of Life" to be to be a
great introduction to prosody:
"The old dog barks backward without getting up.
I can remember when he was a pup."

Fussell's Poetic Meter and Poetic Form is full of great examples useful
in the classroom. Robert Bridges' Milton's Prosody is also quite wonderful.

Not quite the same thing but the GPS site encourages you to find a poem and=
 link
it in:

http://gps.southbankcentre.co.uk/

This is part of the 'about' blurb:

"Global Poetry System is a Southbank Centre project to explore and map the =
poetry
of the world. It=E2=80=99s based on the idea that poetry is all around us, =
from
gravestones to graffiti, from birthday cards to blogs, in the landscape and=
 in
our memories. GPS invites you to take a fresh look at where you are and fin=
d the
poetry that inspires you. Photograph it, video it, audio record it or write=
 it
down - tell the world where it is on the map."

I've joined up but it's too hot here in Adelaide at the moment to go lookin=
g for
anything.

Cheers,
Jill

"po" is more than night, in hawaiian anyway.  it's the place where all
creation begins, the dark, formlessness.

Dear Stephen,
very interested in this project.
Some students @ VUB were working on an i-phone application with paintings
and I know there are some site related poems in Belgium by the official Cit=
y
Poets. Not really hidden in a box or container. But some of these poems
(painted on walls or carved in marble...) are used in City Geo Games.
Would be great to make a global poetry project of this, I think.

Looking forward to more information.
Have a great day,

Philip

Never did teach scansion in any formal way, but made sure we all got to
recognise quantity and pace, and what effects quantitative disruptions /
accelerations / etc. have [and the means to achieve them] -- lots of
listening to poems, therefore, preferably NOT read by actors (who usually
real quite ill); also, investigated the effect of breaking the line in
different places, and HEARING the results, noting and figuring what habits
(or whatever) might drive (say) Dickinson and Williamsand Howe and Olson and
Pound and Creeley and Niedecker to break the line where they do. As for
essay-textbooks,  Campion and his, um, attacks on Rhyme still seem to me
crucial in any consideration of scansion, because they train the ear -- by
train, I mean, teach you to listen (not to agree necessarily -- given the
shifts in English pronunciation, he often seems wrong) -- the same goes for
Spenser's crucial correspondenc with Harvey. The more poetry you read,
students (and I) learned, the more you start to count, measure, weigh; and
then the more you figure out where to find out stuff on your own. No point
shoving it down (up?) anyone's throats.

Dear all,

For those who teach scansion, which critical works on scansion/prosody do
you use?  (Are there discussions of prosody from times past (like George
Puttenham's Arte of English Poesie) you can suggest that would be useful to
teach?)  Which are your favorite primary works to use (poems to scan)?  Any
essays on the history of poetic meters and their meanings that you
especially like?  And further, any essays on rhyme you use?

Thanks in advance for your responses,

Judith Goldman

Hi Judith,=20

I recently had my students utilize this interactive scansion tool which =
is being developed by faculty at the University of Virginia. My students =
very much enjoyed using it and found it to be quite useful and =
informative. Here's the link:

I've found Frost's short little poem "The Span of Life" to be to be a
great introduction to prosody:
"The old dog barks backward without getting up.
I can remember when he was a pup."

Fussell's Poetic Meter and Poetic Form is full of great examples useful
in the classroom. Robert Bridges' Milton's Prosody is also quite =
wonderful.

It is good to see Eve Sedgwick's writings on the structure of
homophobia, based on the exchange of women and the universalising
tendency homophobia has, being taken up and discussed further.

One can go back only to 1988 when Dorothy Porter asked me for a poem on
HIV/AIDS, "Loose White Tee Shirts", for a prestigious poetry journal of
which she was a guest editor, and the fact that she had to fight for the
inclusion of this poem which the journal editors wanted removed because
of the explicit gay content. Apparently poetry journals are not covered
by the anti-discrimination act in New South Wales.

Noel Sanders, who supervised my grad thesis, "Queer Aesthetics" and was
my cultural studies lecturer was forced to leave Harvard and his PhD in
the 70s when it became known he was having an affair with another male
grad student.

As an aside, aside from being one of the important founders of
Australian cultural studies Noel is also a classical composer who has
composed scores on HIV/AIDS. You can find more from below:

Apologies, what I have written seems disconnected. I still cry and have
anxiety attacks when I type HIV/AIDS and when combined with other small
stresses; my kitten went to the vet yesterday to be spayed and I have
spent the pass four hours trying to buy a Mamiya RB67 camera which I
hope to use for black and white landscape montages. As a gay man, must I
now include a male nude? Going back to the silver gelatin print and
photographic art book, am I a sell-out on my avant-garde media arts
aesthetics; it has been implied.

The doctors say I will never recover. Take more sedatives and breathe
slowly through a handkerchief. The other embarrassing side of AIDS;
activists whose health has been destroyed by the struggles, forced into
medical retirement on a disability pension. And opiate narcotics for the
chronic pain. High on pills, out of the road, living in the country.

In the 70s a gay socialist wrote an article criticising the limits of
formalism and Language Poetry. (I can't get hold of this article, nor
Jack the Modernist, no matter.) Derrida wrote; ... and in the homosexual
phase which would follow Eurydice's death... Orpheus sings no more, he
writes. It would be interesting to revisit Language poetry with these
writings. I suspect it would help to solve some aesthetic/poetic
problems I have. But not now... when I have more strength.

This was only meant to be a short response in support of Sedgwick, but
anyways, best wishes, Chris Jones.

I like to make my students chant one line over and over and swap out
words...jazz improv style.  It works well to help students hear the
beats...

but I never did figure out what the next step would be (since we don't
know when to break the rhythms based on that, or how to work with
rhyme and line).

the projects people have mentioned are, among other things, examples of how
net art is expanding. certainly they're net art projects if you think of net
art as art in which a computer network is crucial. it doesn't have to be the
www.

with the advent of gps in cellphones, they can be set to beep when one is
within 100 feet of a point that contains either some artifact in the project
or another person involved in the project carrying their cellphone, or
whatever. one can also use a map to navigate points in the project. the
'domain' of the 'site' is now sometimes both conceptual and physical.

I believe the term most commonly used to describe this concept is
"locative art." It's a major theme in Gibson's novel Spook Country.

* Please join us --TOMORROW-- Wednesday, November 18th @ 3:30pm for the next
Small Press in the Archive lecture. Peter Tytell, an expert witness and
forensic document examiner, speaks on "CSI 101: Making typescript speak."

Best,
Margaret

This talk will be held in The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen (SUNY Buffalo).
This event is free and open to the public.


Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

Call for Artwork/Poetry/Text Hybrid Experiments.

Creative Responses : The work of Arakawa and Gins has been extremely
influential for poets and artists. At the Second International
Conference in 2008, a number of distinguished poets, performance
artists, and media artists contributed to the program. We invite new
creative responses that develop, investigate, explore and inflect
aspects of Arakawa and Gins' written, drawn, built and unbuilt works.
We can accept creative responses in the following forms: textual or
graphic (which could include poetry in any form, visual works and/or
image/text hybrids); net-based interactive works (flash, etc.);
net-based video. In addition to the web exhibit, University of New
Orleans Press has committed to publish a collection of the creative
responses in book form.

Proposal Website:  http://netpoetic.com/ag3art/call.html

AG3-Online will run from March 12-26, 2010.

Submit proposals by December 1, 2009, with final projects due February 1, 2010.

Proposals should be emailed to <ag3art@gmail.com> and should include:

1. A 100-200 word description of the work, including how the work fits
the theme. Please include links to relevant or past works.
2. If the work is already complete, include either a url to the work
or an attachment (open office, MS word, PDF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.).
Net based video should include a link to a preview version on youtube
or some other location. Do not attach files larger than 5 mb to the
proposal submission.
3. A short bio .

If you=92re in the Bay area, join the Nonsite Collective this Saturday,
November 21, at 3:30 PM for work by Marcus Civin (performance and talk) in
discussion with Chris Nagler and Real Time Ethics.


935 Natoma Street, San Francisco

between 10th and 11th Streets

and between Mission and Howard

close to the Civic Center BART Station

and the Van Ness MUNI station



From Chris Nagler:


Marcus Civin=92s performance work asks questions about bodily politics, and
puts together serial kinetic phrases about his own. He reframes that old
contested territory, the ordinary, or =91pedestrian=92 body. His teacher, t=
he
choreographer and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer, wrote, in 1968, of her own work
as =93a control that seems geared to the actual time it takes the actual
weight of the body to go through the prescribed motions, rather than an
adherence to an imposed ordering of time. In other words, the demands made
on the body=92s (actual) energy resources appear to be commensurate with th=
e
task . . .=94 Does this equation balance in the ordinary body of today, whe=
n
the =91prescribed motions=92 are often obscure, charged with impossible
simultaneities, or shamed with distant, mechanized heroism. And what to do
with all that =91seeming=92 ?

In his words:


My everyday life reveals my cowardice, my normalcy, my difficulty.

Every time I do my ritual, it is slightly different. I think about what

I would do in an extreme situation. I assume, I would know what to do

in an extreme situation, but I need practice.


Some possible issues and questions that may arise:

What kind of athlete or non-athlete is the contemporary American citizen?

The slapstick histories of multitasking

Do the body=92s economies (sexual, affective, energetic) reflect/counter/re=
act
to/empty into The Economy? How. specifically?

Is =91survival=92 a performance, a fetish, a nostalgia, an ordinary reality=
?
Which for whom?

Is represented labor still labor and is labored representation still
representation? Who says so?

___


From Marcus Civin:


"I had been so confident and now I had an awful feeling that the war had
gotten out of my hands"

                                    --Gertrude Stein as Alice B. Toklas (Th=
e
Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas)


With the Nonsite Collective, Marcus Civin will project, re-build, perform
gestures and utterances that riff on themes from his recent performance wor=
k
=97 performance work that lands a poor, rough tramp behind enemy lines and
forces the poor, rough tramp to decide: am I a killer, OR am I a clown?


Or: "In a series, objects become undefined simulacra one of the other. And
so, along with the objects, do the people that produce them." -- Jean
Baudrillard (Simulations)


I handle an ax, matches, a deck of cards, a spear, drips of water. I make a
bathtub. Am I a bathtub. Or: I make a small black painting.

Very sad. And very strange that he's been missing since "2008/2009":

      http://sites.google.com/site/philipagre/

On another list, someone pointed out this writing of Agre's, which
he described as a cri de coeur, from late '98:

      I don't normally get emotional about political issues.  I don't
      know why, but I don't.  Nonetheless, in October 1997 I heard
      something that I found so disturbing that I haven't been able to
      write about it until now.  At the Telecommunications Policy
      Research Conference, the conference organizers put together a
      plenary panel presentation about so-called cyber war.  The
      presenters were all US military guys, both officers and military
      academy intellectuals, who have developed what is apparently an
      entirely new US military doctrine for the cyber world.  I judged
      these guys to be honest about their reasoning, and I was hardly
      alone in finding everything they said to be astonishing.

More:

      That's bad enough, but it's just the start.  In the new world,
      the military guys said, warfare is no longer conducted along
      borders and boundaries, with front lines and supply lines and all
      of that. Warfare, in fact, can no longer be comprehended in
      spatial terms. To the contrary, in a world where communications
      infrastructure is everywhere and every element of communications
      infrastructure is a sensitive military target, war has no spatial
      limits.  And when terrorists can use public communications
      networks to conduct endless low-level attacks anywhere in the
      world from anywhere else in the world, war has no temporal limits
      -- they actually used the phrase "permanent war".

And more:

      War, on these guys' conception, is now conducted in every aspect
      of society.  Foreign manipulation of the content of American news
      media, for example, is "cultural war".  Taken all together, the
      result is -- and this is their term -- "total war". You might
      have thought that the Soviet Union had fallen, that the United
      States was by far the greatest military power on earth, that the
      heavy cloud of the Cold War had lifted, and that it was time for
      the United States to stand down from its total mobilization,
      disband the national security state, end the culture of secrecy,
      reshape the military in some reasonable proportion to its
      plausible adversaries, and get to work on the rest of society's
      problems.  You might think all of that, but you would be wrong.
      In the world of the Internet, it would seem, things have only
      gotten worse.  We are now in a world of permanent, total,
      omnipresent, pervasive war.  Cold War plus plus: all war, all the
      time.  They said this.

      The military guys' view of the emerging nature of war has
      numerous consequences, and they spelled some of them out.  They
      stated, for example, that in the event of war it would create no
      precedent for the government to take control of facilities that
      are sensitive from a military perspective.  But they asserted
      that war is no longer an event but a permanent state, and they
      had also asserted that virtually the entire productive
      infrastructure of the country was relevant to war as it is now
      defined.  During the question period, therefore, I asked them
      where the boundary between military and non-military facilities
      could be found, and they answered, with seemingly genuine
      distress, that the boundary does not exist.  The consequence,
      which they did not spell out, is that the emerging economics of
      information infrastructure have required the United States
      government to adopt as official policy an authoritarian variety
      of communism.

The whole thing's well worth reading, as is just about everything Agre
wrote:

      http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/notes/98-12-16.html

And that was eleven years ago. For context, it's also worth a glance of what
was afoot on this list at the time:

      http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-9812/threads.html

Naturally, my eye was drawn to the two messages I sent:

      http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-9812/msg00005.html
      http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-9812/msg00064.html

As Vuk used to say: bingo.

I've been thinking a lot lately about the relationship between individual
biographies and the mood of the broad trends and discourses that people
recognize and articulate. I hope that Agre doesn't turn out to be a victim
of his own formidable intelligence; he wouldn't be the first, and he
certainly won't be the last in the coming years.

Not cheers,
T

Thanks for letting us know of this volume. I'm interested in hearing  from
anyone who has written or read in "disability poetics" as I prepare for an
upcoming panel at AWP.  The panel's title is "Beauty is a Verb." One  of the
panelists is presenting on Larry Eigner.  I have worked on  Weiner myself
and have Michael Davidson's Concerto for the Left  Hand.

*Reimagining the Poet-Critic: Practice, Pedagogy, Poetics*

March 12-13 in Humanities 210, UCSC



We welcome you to participate in our discussions and investigations
surrounding the role of the poet-scholar in this two-day conference at
UCSC.  As a practitioner of both the arts of poetry or other =93imaginative=
=94
writing and more theoretical or critical work, the poet-critic or
poet-scholar inhabits a compelling space both inside and outside the
university.   We are interested in the relationships between these two
activities and the ways they come together to affect the reading and writin=
g
practices of the poet-critics themselves and their readership.  As many
poet-critics are read within college classrooms or are themselves professor=
s
or teachers, we are interested in the relationship between such
critical/creative writing practices and their pedagogical implications. Thi=
s
conference will provide an occasion for dialogue across genres, disciplines=
,
readerships and pedagogical practices that will focus on the potential for
creative and critical thinking both inside and outside the classroom that
practices of the poet-critic can invigorate.



The conference will consist of six panels across March 12th and 13th.  We
will have three papers for each panel and only one panel in session at a
time each day.  Each panel will feature an invited respondent and three
papers. The conference will also include a pedagogy colloquium and short
paper workshop as well as multiple poetry readings on and off campus.



Panel topics include:

Historicizing the Poet as Intellectual

Poetics and Reading Methodologies

Poetic Epistemologies and Alternative forms of Scholarship

Writing and Thinking Between Genre

Poetic Conceptualisms and Poetic Productions

Poetry and Pedagogy





Confirmed panel respondents so far: Craig Dworkin, Sina Queyras, Juliana
Spahr and Vanessa Place.



Instructions for paper submissions and pedagogy colloquium mini-papers: sen=
d
350 word abstracts to *both* organizers jbeard@ucsc.edu and aquaid@ucsc.edu
by Dec 17th. Accepted papers will be notified by December 22nd and complete=
d
papers must be sent to conference organizers by Feb 15th.

A photo essay on homeless blankets in and around Dolores Park, San Francisco. A project I have been with a few years. Photos, my way of exploring objects, when the language comes up way short. A poetry without words but a poetry, nevertheless.

Appreciate any comments -

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Palm Press is pleased to announce the publication of One by Jen Hofer:

ONE is necessarily engaged, engagingly necessary. As so much =
contemporary American poetry takes the witless witticism of "no ideas =
except as refracted in other ideas" to its logical conclusion, using =
Stevens as willful instrument to hollow out Dickinson's interiority, =
flying as far as possible from Whitman, Williams and Pound in some =
desperately whimsical, whimsically desperate attempt to escape (still, =
at this late date!) 20th century modernisms, it's wonderfully refreshing =
to treat oneself to the singular drama in Jen Hofer's open field verse, =
refractory through purposive theater, flicking with deconstruction, =
declension and interrogation. Her sage 'insistence' flares into the =
continuous present that is our own.=20
-Sesshu Foster

Now halting, feeling their way, now informative, now quoting - Hofer's =
lines roam in search of a language that could grapple with our multiple =
realities, including the delusional one of the Iraq war. A great cry of: =
What can be done?
-Rosemarie Waldrop

As a title, One-like war-insists on singularity. Yet One is filled with =
many: quotations become limbs from dismembered newspaper articles, =
"Atomic Noir" film dialogue and song lyrics which slowly bleed into Jen =
Hofer's own poetic interrogations, reports and outcries. It is as though =
the viscera once confined to our separate bodies is everywhere, staining =
everything into a charnel unity which Hofer must search and identify. =
Still, One is also "won" and in that "victory" impoverished to a pun's =
faint echo, we see the remains of what was lost. Hofer's poems are =
battlefield photographs from a war waged with language. Look and listen =
carefully.=20

Subject:      New from Palm Press: Longer I Wait,
              More You Love Me by Wendy S. Walters
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Palm Press is pleased to announce the publication of Wendy S. Walters' =
first book-length collection of poems: Longer I Wait, More You Love Me

In the thirteen experiments in narrative structure that comprise LONGER =
I WAIT, MORE YOU LOVE ME, Wendy S. Walters' first full-length =
collection, special attention is given to the long-form poem. The subtle =
dynamics of relationship that can lead to loneliness, romance and even =
divine love are noted with deadpan perceptiveness. This collection =
examines how misfortune occurs when we allow those moments, people and =
locations most familiar to us to pass by without acknowledgement of =
their resonant mystery.


"Wendy S. Walters is not poetic, she is cinematic. Her toolbox contains =
all of the possibilities of widescreen behavior, and each page of this =
book knows it. Everything we learned as poets, she has unlearned. If you =
read her across the page, horizontally, she appears to be a narrative =
poet with a linear line in love with story but if you read her down the =
page, vertically, she appears to be a philosophical painter with an =
insistent line in love with layering. Verit=E9 not mere studio mise en =
scene, Walters is also a master of erasure--no easy similes or =
tie-up-the-end-the-poem metaphors. Her aspect ratio is wholeness, the =
gathering of artifice, allegory and constant, intellectual creativity. =
Longer I Wait, More You Love Me is a bit of a tease too. It hears our =
request and knows we want song." -Thomas Sayers Ellis

"Longer I Wait, More You Love Me is a dream-radio in which Wendy Walters =
tunes a wonderment of voices. It is beautifully kaleidoscopic. Mixing =
loneliness and longing, juxtaposing eroticism, humor and violence, this =
collection is fable-esque, journalistic, rapturous, and =
dead-pan-acknowledging that 'It can be hard to get a message through =
when / people are underwater'-without betraying the complex narratives =
of our lives. These poems accrete with a heart-rending attentiveness to =
the actual: stories of family, lovers, politics and race are sharpened =
and backdropped by the speaker's avowal that 'Inside me / are many =
people / I don't know // who they speak for / They talk / all the time.' =
Longer I Wait, More You Love Me swells with the cut-up songs of =
unhearing and the vicissitudes of intimacy, marking the arrival of a =
much-needed new voice in contemporary poetry and inviting 'the rotten =
joyful / to take one on the chin.'"=20
-Alex Lemon

Wendy S. Walters was raised in a suburb of Detroit, MI and is Assistant =
Professor of Poetry in the Department of Literary Studies at the Eugene =
Lang College of The New School University. Her poems and essays have =
also appeared in Callaloo, Seneca Review, HOW2, Natural Bridge, =
Sou'wester, Seattle Review and Harper's Magazine. She lives in New York, =
NY.

I am pleased to announce the publication of the first major section of my t=
ranslanations project by BlazeVOX [books] and in celebration I am having a =
book launch at 8:00 pm on Friday, November 27th at InkTank in Cincinnati. S=
o, for those whose holiday travel takes them to the area I hope to see you =
then.

InkTank, 1311 Main Street, Cincinnati, OH.

For those of you who can=92t make it, the book is available through both th=
e BlazeVOX [books] website

http://www.blazevox.org/bk-bh2.htm

and the SPD Website

http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781935402435/translanations-one.aspx


From SPD: Poetry. TRANSLANATIONS ONE is the first major installment of Will=
iam R. Howe's Emily Dickinson project, translanations. The collection is a =
homophonic, homolinguistic transformation of Dickinson's poems 500-599. How=
e radically, and fantastically, re-invents Dickinson's lyrics while approxi=
mating those poems' sound and rhythm patterns: "Rather than just `translati=
ng' these poems from English to English," Howe writes, "I have written thes=
e poems to the tune of Dickinson, and through that music I am exploring our=
 relationship with language." Listening to one of Howe's "translanations" i=
s like hearing a Dickinson poem after it's been processed by a shrooming ba=
belfish. "Dickinson said that it's poetry if you feel as though the top of =
your head were taken off. But what if it's the whole head, down to the shou=
lders?... Read this with a helmet on"--K. Silem Mohammad.

Remove A Concept vol 01 / blurb by Ivan Arg=FCelles

www.lulu.com/content/7642668

Peter Ganick's REMOVE A CONCEPT written in the mid 1980's, comprising 3350
sections and employing registers of language that range from the colloquial
of jazz refrain to the enigmatic typlogies of the "seer". Between the
convulsive high notes of Archie Shepp and the intricate silences of a
himalayan Rishi this amazing text baffles stimulates irritates and gratifie=
s
the reader who has the patience and intellectual curiosity to plumb the
depths and extents of this "ghost-ridden astrologic theater" , which can
also be read as a continuous? segmented? alleatory composition in the manne=
r
of John Cage. It is as if Jackson Pollock had chosen to use words
(syllables!) rather than pigments as his medium. Ganick says "the poem was
exciting to write" and indeed its almost naive exuberance, fracturing synta=
x
in every possible way, is a principle characteristic of this monumental
Text. This is not to deny the underlying lyricism in the content of its
intense fragmentation, as in "over full, read is anothered to morning in
sky," ... The at times oneiric segmentation cannot help but remind one of
Holderlin's "Fragments". The enormous and sometimes puzzling breadth of thi=
s
Text can best be summed up in a single phrase: "Light & Maya".

 -----------------------------------

Remove A Concept vol 02 / blurb by Sheila E. Murphy

www.lulu.com/content/7762352

A principled uncertainly proposes hypotheses, examines each with a cool
calculus infused with depth of feeling. One of the welcome ironies of this
extended text is the centrality of a pressurized short segment that stands
discernibly as a focal gem. Peter Ganick=92s disciplined attention to the
situational mystique reveals that single points of focus enrich the whole
mental field with meaning. Here, a fine, musical ear sharpened by
considerable and continual study and experience, trusts the occupation of a
locus, finds a panoply of linkages embedded within situations to yield
concise renderings of surfaces and their multiple under-layers as a

Remove A Concept vol 03 / blurb by John Crouse

www .lulu.com/content/7800085

yr remove a concept, its endless/open as yr other writings. while it tells/
says one thing, it can be other things @ other readings/looks. yr words don=
t
seem harvested by program, i would say theyre not, theres alot more going o=
n
than random splice and splat & see what sticks. the kind of reading i
experience, or what i experience while im reading yr work is a kind of
terminal freedom, a velocity that glides unbiased like gold thread can keep
stretching while retaining valence and value. terminal as endless as well a=
s
endless places to board and depart.

Remove A Concept vol 04/ blurb by Jim Leftwich

www.lulu.com/content/7841069

thinking in this text, *what if *soon becomes *as if*, and if, one by one,
concepts proposed are removed as other concepts emerge, then *as if* become=
s
*is*, concept yields to process, being yields to becoming, and one is no
longer thinking, or at least not thinking of concepts, one is in the
process, no longer reading for content, or at least not for concepts as
content, nor is one engaged in a process of reading as writing, one is
rather reading as a process of following poetry as it unfolds, as if a poem
might be about the time spent writing or reading it, as is the case with
this poem, and perhaps with all other poems, once the concepts are removed.

Remove A Concept vol 05 / blurb by Olchar Lindsann

www.lulu.com/content/7962709

A poem to be read by the morning, when routes of possibility are to be
discerned winding amongst the gaps between shifting particles of thought, o=
f
thoughts still porous, not utterly cohered: so that the removal of a concep=
t
is the opening of a trapdoor, an infra-verbal space in which one shuttles
back and forth: so that the poem forms itself around spaces, in undulating
and arrhythmic cascades of language, then waits: so that one thinks *betwee=
n
*the nascent concepts lunging in staccato or gushing languorously on either
side (...) A space for movement, to form itself around.

Remove A Concept vol 06 / blurb by Michael Peters

www.lulu.com/content/7962708

This important historical work bears its age with increasing intrigue,
simply because it would seem to suggest the inversion of time via its
manipulation of absence=97before and after you were born.  It is unlike som=
e
of the more known, smaller works comprising Peter Ganick's publishing
history=97and a must have, but good luck finding yourself within it. This
massive body of words becomes porous, wildly poetic=97a veritable sea of
holes, a space machine, or a supervaast field of labias. Ganick's RAC,
a.k.a. "Remove a Concept," stretches you way out, makes you cross vaast
spaces where you are uncertain of removals and insertions, and this
contemplation includes yourself.  Then if you realize it was undertaken in
the late 1980s, the kinks in its thinking creates wild, definitive
indefinitiveness where even the uncertainties are doubtful.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I am proud to announce my first book of poetry, an experimental long poem.
The scoop:

A long poem at the fringes of the Canadian tradition, Ex Machina is a
latticework of poetic and philosophical statements concerning the symbiosis
of humans, books, and machines. A series of three intertwining sequences,
the reader is encouraged to move back and forth from statement to statement=
,
seeking development but meeting frustration. The reader thus becomes a
larval stage in the poem=92s development, forging connections between its
disparate parts during the course of this mental processing, as the text
evolves over multiple readings.

I'd like to see this book reviewed, so if you have any interest in reviewin=
g
the book for some publication, please contact myself (
jonathan@jonathanball.com) or the publisher (jay@bookthug.ca) to request a
review copy.

The book is available from the publisher (
http://www.bookthug.ca/proddetail.php?prod=3D200915) or from SPD (
http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781897388488/ex-machina.aspx) or from

Hello,

This is a special edition of the Project AlphaAlpha. These are the
letters "A" by our dear Friend, Poet and WebArtist Millie Niss, who is
at the ICU of a hospital in Buffalo, NY, =A0fighting against the
consequences of this terrible swine flu. She made these six letters
"A" a little bit before of being so ill and even being ill, she asked

Please, visit her page and pray for Millie, it does not matter your
religion or=A0if you have not a religion, but=A0ask for her, so young and
so special Artist and human being.

A hundred feet in the sky, but "flying" is what matters.

Goverrnor
SARAH PALIN
Going Rogue
Booksigning Rules

1. This is a wristband event. It will be a shining thing flashing by, just
outside your reach. You will witness the strangled cries of many, and only
afterward realize it comes from your own throat. ONE WRISTBAND PER FAMILY,
limit TWO books per wristband. Once you have obtained your wristband, you
will be distant from the hunger of the others. It is advised that you
conceal your wrists from the sight of others.

2. We will start handing our wristbands at store opening, 9:00 AM on
Saturday November 21. Remember, you are as a handful of seed scattered over
the desert, which will remain when the sowing is done as empty as ever.

3. In order to get your wristband you must purchase at least one copy of
Going Rogue from Borders. Be prepared to show proof of purchase (Borders
receipt) to recieve a wristband. Because each book will feel but a tissue of
feathers, you will rise slowly, floating upward as all those who have gone
before you.

4. There is a limit of TWO books per wristband. Each book has equally points
to the end of the universe, each text contained between the covers is
flecked with gleaming tinsel pointing to the glittering stars.

5. Gov. Palin will sign but not personalize the books. Any careless change
to this protocol may cause Her to float away.

6. Gov. Palin will only be signing her book Going Rogue. Absolutely no
memorabilia, posters, signs, clothing, or other items allowed in the signing
line. Please leave these items in your car. Exceptions to this rule: wasp
nests, campaign exhumations, Her own family album, hemlock, speeches
concluding with obvious falsehood and wolf pelts.

7. You must NOT take photos of Gov. Palin at the signing table. You may take
photos from a distance but you will be asked to put away your camera and
cell phone as you approach the table. This rule serves to provide the
necessary comfort level for Gov. Palin since she fears that photos that
close read her will steal a soul she believes she has.

8. We will have a table set up for you to check your bags/purses and to
collect any gifts you might bring for Gov. Palin. Checks for you-know-what
should be made out to you-know-who.

9. Gov. Palin fully intends to sign books for everyone with a wristband.
However if unforseen circumstances arise we cannot guarantee she will stay
to sign everyone's book. It is best to bring the deaf, dumb, blind, as well
as all others afflicted to the head of the line for the faith healing during
Gov. Palin's Altar-Call. Remember: only those born at least twice of the
water may approach the signing table.

10. Rules are subject to change. Gov. Pailin's destiny may seize her,
flinging her in another direction. If this should happen, praise God, since
you will have witnessed Her Going Rogue!

Thank you--enjoy the event!

**Jonathan Berger
http://www.myspace.com/jonathanberger

Jonathan Berger writes words in a variety of media, running the gamut =20=

from self-deprecating poetry to self-deprecating prose. Once, he tried =20=

a self-deprecating play called Waiting for Jon to Leave (it did not =20
work out well). He leads the rock band JUANBURGUESA and an acoustic =20
"musical" project called Jon Berger, and has published a couple of =20
zines. Currently, he edits the music section for Boog City.


**Christy Davis and friends

Christy Davis is a drummer, singer/songwriter who has been playing in =20=

bands since 1989.  She currently plays with Olive Juice Music's own =20
Kansas State Flower.

She has been a part of many projects including Rebecca Moore and the =20
Prevention of Blindness, Reverend Billy and His Stop Shopping Choir, =20
and the popular kid's band Audrarox. While playing with Rebecca Moore, =20=

Christy had the honor of playing on the same bill as Lou Reed as part =20=

of a tribute show for John Zorn at Town Hall.

Christy will be accompanied by David Weintraub and Steve Scavuzzo. =20
Christy, Steve, and David were in the band Mold (1993-1999) and have =20
reunited, writing and rehearsing a new repertoire of songs, and going =20=

back into the studio.


**Renminbi
http://www.renminbinyc.com/
Three seconds into Surface=92s penultimate track, Renminbi has already =20=

pitted a Polvo guitar wobble against a sing-song Galaxie 500 melody. =20
Keyboardist SMV and guest drummer Jenny Johnson sound like they=92re =20
winding down from a 20-minute dirge, and guitarist Lisa Liu sings with =20=

Tara Jane O=92Neil=92s woozy assurance.

But this song isn=92t a half-hour epic. It doesn=92t anchor an album by =20=

Sonic Youth or Mogwai=97although Youth cohort and producer Don Fleming =20=

was at its helm. It clocks in at just over four minutes. And although =20=

it=92s called =93Set-Up,=94 it starts in medias res and ends with a =
feedback =20
whine. Like the other three songs comprising Surface, its terseness =20
belies its keening arc.

Despite the EP=92s scope, Liu insists its origins are humble. After =20
accumulating a heap of experimental rock material she couldn=92t use in =20=

her band Danger! Giant Ranger, in 2003 Liu formed Renminbi (pronounced =20=

REN-MIN-BEE) and recruited her girlfriend SMV to play keys. Working =20
with a rotating cast of drummers, the duo released a pair of fractious =20=

noise-punk EPs and in 2007 explored electronic textures on its full-=20
length The Phoenix.

On Surface, the textures remain, but the keyboard sounds more like an =20=

organ or violin and once-faint vocals come to the forefront. So why =20
the departure from 2007=92s asymmetrical, electro-heavy forms?

=93Well =85 I got a new guitar,=94 Liu admitted=97and she was drawn back =
=20
toward more traditional structures. For her and SMV, traditional =20
structures meant gutsy playing in unnameable time signatures or =20
unusual keys, =E0 la Versus (=93Portland=94), latter-day Sleater-Kinney =20=

(=93Toulouse=94), and Autoclave (=93Then We Came to the End=94).

The pair was also drawn to Fleming, whose work they=92d admired for =20
years from afar. After they sent him a long-shot email, he surprised =20
them by offering to produce the EP. In May 2009, with the help of =20
engineer Matt Azzarto, Surface was recorded live at the Hoboken, N.J. =20=

studio that Sonic Youth calls home.

=93There was something magical about it,=94 said Liu of recording the =20=

tracks live. "Anything can happen in that situation." Fleming=92s =20
without-a-net approach served the band=92s expansive sound well. "The =20=

focus was less on achieving a perfect take, and more on being present=97=20=

feeling your way through the songs instead of thinking your way =20
through," Liu explained.

Sonically, Fleming introduced "a huge palette of sounds," pushing amps =20=

into the red to give the keys and guitars a grainy ring. =93There=92s a =20=

certain energy that=92s captured through the extra overtones. It=92s =20
really open and raw,=94 Liu added.

When it set out to record with Fleming, Renminbi=92s goal was an =20
immediate, taut statement. With Surface, it=92s made one breezily. But =20=

it=92s also made an EP that sounds like some early '90s double album =20
you=92d put on after everybody=92s left the party, distilled down to =
four =20
vital songs. =97Sam Schulz

multi-instrumentalist. She often performs as Lady Blanche, her rock/=20
comedy persona. Lady Blanche sings an array of punk-twanged tongue in =20=

cheek compositions, not so ladylike confessionals, and stream of =20
consciousness rambles often placing the human condition on a pedestal =20=

and glorifying it with graceful irreverence, bucketloads of heart, and =20=

fervent immediacy. Lady Blanche has recently been a consistent support =20=

act for the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players on their national =20
tours. Tracy also plays as one-third of the female retro rock trio The =20=

Mini Pearls.


**Krista Weaver
http://www.kristaweaver.com/

Krista Weaver was born at the Naval Hospital in St. Alban's, Queens in =20=

June of 1969. She had a fairly normal suburban New York upbringing, =20
with slow-moving grandparents who lived nearby, a mother who stayed at =20=

home, and a father who worked. Her parents divorced when she was nine. =20=

She grew up, went to a public high school in Brooklyn, graduated, then =20=

left town. She travelled extensively in Europe and across the United =20
States, working as a bar-girl, a donut-slinger, and a ranch-hand. She =20=

got married, had children, got divorced.

When she took up the guitar in 2004, she baked pies, and did sub work =20=

at the local high school to make money. She never listened to the =20
radio and never watched TV. She drove a silver-gray Buick Regal with =20
lavender pinstriping that had belonged to her grandmother. She learned =20=

how to play--and recorded her first album (So Long Arlington, Two =20
Stones Music)--on a $100 guitar she borrowed from her brother. Her =20
life hasn't been the same since.

SARAH PALIN
Going Rogue
Booksigning Rules

1. This is a wristband event. It will be a shining thing flashing by, just outside your reach. You will witness the strangled cries of many, and only afterward realize it comes from your own throat. ONE WRISTBAND PER FAMILY, limit TWO books per wristband. Once you have obtained your wristband, you will be distant from the hunger of the others. It is advised that you conceal your wrists from the sight of others.

2. We will start handing our wristbands at store opening, 9:00 AM on Saturday November 21. Remember, you are as a handful of seed scattered over the desert, which will remain when the sowing is done as empty as ever.

3. In order to get your wristband you must purchase at least one copy of Going Rogue from Borders. Be prepared to show proof of purchase (Borders receipt) to recieve a wristband. Because each book will feel but a tissue of feathers, you will rise slowly, floating upward as all those who have gone before you.

4. There is a limit of TWO books per wristband. Each book has equally points to the end of the universe, each text contained between the covers is flecked with gleaming tinsel pointing to the glittering stars.

5. Gov. Palin will sign but not personalize the books. Any careless change to this protocol may cause Her to float away.

6. Gov. Palin will only be signing her book Going Rogue. Absolutely no memorabilia, posters, signs, clothing, or other items allowed in the signing line. Please leave these items in your car. Exceptions to this rule: wasp nests, campaign exhumations, Her own family album, hemlock, speeches concluding with obvious falsehood and wolf pelts.

7. You must NOT take photos of Gov. Palin at the signing table. You may take photos from a distance but you will be asked to put away your camera and cell phone as you approach the table. This rule serves to provide the necessary comfort level for Gov. Palin since she fears that photos that close read her will steal a soul she believes she has.

8. We will have a table set up for you to check your bags/purses and to collect any gifts you might bring for Gov. Palin. Checks for you-know-what should be made out to you-know-who.

9. Gov. Palin fully intends to sign books for everyone with a wristband. However if unforseen circumstances arise we cannot guarantee she will stay to sign everyone's book. It is best to bring the deaf, dumb, blind, as well as all others afflicted to the head of the line for the faith healing during Gov. Palin's Altar-Call. Remember: only those born at least twice of the water may approach the signing table.

10. Rules are subject to change. Gov. Pailin's destiny may seize her, flinging her in another direction. If this should happen, praise God, since you will have witnessed Her Going Rogue!

Thank you--enjoy the event!

I'm very proud, and excitied, to announce the winner of the 2009 Furniture =
Press Poetry Prize:=20

Emily Carr's manuscript, "directions for flying: right side lower arms rais=
e arms bend knees repeat on left / 23 fits: a young wife's almanac," will b=
e published as a perfect-bound volume (not a chapbook, as was originally in=
tended). It was chosen from a vast pool of fresh work by some great writers=
. But Emily's book stood out dramatically in its depths, its inter- and out=
ter-actions with appropriation and seemless intertextuality.=20

I'm quite happy that Emily's book will be the first in our new series of pe=
rfect-bound volumes, and each subsequent poetry prize winner will be publis=
hed in similar fashion.=20

And look out for an announcement for the 2nd annual prize, which will be ho=
sted by a new judge that exemplifies and practices an aesthetic of deep scr=
utiny and collaboration.=20

Look for this title in late winter, in your local bookstores, or order dire=
ctly through Furniture Press.=20

Cheers, Emily!=20

corrected a friend recently. Why call poetry that breaks from conventions innovative when it's actually unorthodox. & i nominate EE Cummings as the one poet who was innovative/unorthodox/ and popular as... as a singular poet, perhaps the ONE enlish speaking poet of the 20th century who managed t inovation and was also unorthodox & popular.

Dear All,

Notice of a conference on Olson, courtesy of David Herd and the
University of Kent.

Best,
Sam


Charles Olson 2010



A Centenary Conference



Centre for Modern Poetry, University of Kent



13th =96 14th November, 2010



2010 marks the centenary of the birth of the American poet Charles
Olson. As poet, critic and theorist, Olson extended the possibilities
of modern writing. From Call Me Ishmael to The Maximus Poems he probed
the relation between language, space and community, providing radical
resources for the re-imagining of place and politics. Aiming, in
Robert Creeley=92s terms, to hear all that Olson still provokes at the
beginning of the Twenty-First Century, this conference seeks to
re-assess the scope of his legacy. It will provide an opportunity to
consider Olson=92s value through and across a range of disciplines, with
particular attention to be given to his influence on British and
European writing. Topics to be addressed could include (but won=92t be
limited to):



-=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Olson in Europe

whether it's innovative depends on the nature of the breaks from convention.
or is there orthodox innovation? if there is, does it matter? innovation
necessarily involves breaks with convention or there is merely invention.

Hi all,

In December 2008, as one of our monthly writing projects, my friend,
and maybe yours, Sean Cole, co-wrote a poem a day for the month. Some
days we took turns writing single lines or stanzas. Other days we each
wrote our own poem related to a common theme. Sean recorded us reading
all the poems and created a podcast. Below's the link to get a free
subscription to the podcast via itunes.

http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=343169880

The December 1st poem is already up, and each day throughout this
December you'll get the corresponding date's poem. Happy (almost)
December. Enjoy.

as ever,
David

In the few weeks leading up to the publication of the Kenning Anthology of Poets Theater: 1945-1985, edited by Kevin Killian and David Brazil, a series of "Previews and Supplements" are being posted to the press' website, http://www.facebook.com/l/d3769;www.kenningeditions.com. The first includes otherwise unpublished documents related to Fiona Templeton's "Against Agreement," along with the editors' note on the text culled directly from the anthology. The second, just posted today, includes an alternate opening page or so from the first play in the book, Jack Spicer's "Young Goodman Brown," along with a photographic record of Killian's 2005 production of the piece. More to follow... Pre-orders are available by subscription only--click through to subscription offers on the site.
