Funny you should ask. Really.

there was one that was of considerable interest. That was the one that
>spoke of language poets and experimental poets. Is there a difference?

Drunken Boat Design  Contest - $2500 for winning designer=20
=20
Drunken Boat < www.drunkenboat.com >, an international online journal of =
the arts, celebrates its 10th anniversary! Part of our conceptual origin =
has been in exhibiting works of art that use the medium of the Web as =
constitutive of meaning; with this in mind we are soliciting proposals =
for the design of a special 10th issue dedicated to arts and literature =
online. The winning designer receives a $2500 honorarium in return for =
designing the home page of a publication that attracts nearly half a =
million unique visitors per year.

PERMISSION=20
Contestants grant Drunken Boat permission to display a designer=92s =
name, company name, client name and/or relevant design work at =
www.drunkenboat.com.=20
=20
COPYRIGHT NOTICE=20
Drunken Boat assumes all submitted artwork is the property of the =
designer or design firm submitting the work. Drunken Boat will not be =
liable for any copyright infringement on the part of the contestant. All =
rights to the work will revert to the designer upon publication.=20
=20
ETHICAL GUIDELINES=20
Drunken Boat reserves the right to revoke the award from any individual =
or company, whose artwork does not fall within the ethical guidelines =
set forth by the magazine, whether before, during or after the judging =
is complete. Fees are non-refundable once the entry has been submitted =
for any reason.=20
=20
TERMS OF DELIVERY=20
The winner will receive a $2500 honorarium, payable upon launch date of =

aspects of the home page design, including its interface with all other =
sections of the issue (particularly the 10 mini-sites). The winner must =
also be willing to work with other individuals, as needed, to enable =
completion of the issue in time for a Winter 2008/2009 launch.=20
=20
DEADLINE
December 01 2008=20
=20
RULES=20
The Drunken Boat Design Contest is open to designers from any =
discipline, from anywhere in the world, particularly individuals attuned =
to the potential dynamicity of designing work online. We at Drunken Boat =
are open to any number of aesthetic models that might encompass this =
issue=92s contents. Best of all would be an interactive / dynamic =
component that actively invites reader participation. The only =
parameters of the contest are that all of the home page designs must be =
structured to encompass a group of 10 mini-sites designed by Drunken =
Boat Web Editor / Site Designer Shawn M. McKinney. A sample of the =
visual design of the 10 mini-sites may be found here: =
www.drunkenboat.com/db10/designcontest.=20
=20
All entries will be considered potential home pages; some finalists may =
ultimately provide alternate home page designs.=20
=20
NOTES=20
We don=92t expect you to submit an entire Web site. We do expect you to =
provide us with a clear sense of the graphic =93look and feel=94 of a =
home page, as well as a proposed system of navigation, for Drunken Boat, =
Issue No. 10. In addition, all proposed design elements must be =
aesthetically compatible with the 10 mini-sites mentioned previously. =
Although your email confirmation and digital artwork will be sufficient =
for our judges to assess your entry properly, contestants may physically =
mail design samples to allow for a more in-depth evaluation process. In =
any event, no materials will be returned (unless prior arrangement has =
been reached). Please submit disposable materials wherever possible.=20
=20
We urge you to explore the archives of www.drunkenboat.com. Take a look =
at some of the creative work we have published in the past, while you =
consider the design sensibility that has shaped previous issues. Also, =
you might want to read the =93designer=92s note=94 (essay) found in the =
Oulipo section of Drunken Boat, Issue No. 8. Locate it as follows: =
www.drunkenboat.com/db8 > oulipo > shawn m. mckinney > =93Oulipo Redux: =
Extensible, Exegetic, Ex Post Facto.=94
=20
A spirit of collaboration is essential to the success of this contest =
and this special issue of Drunken Boat. The winning designer will be =
expected to work closely with a staff of designers and editors to =
complete the design of Issue No. 10. Mavericks need not apply.=20
=20
If all we have at our disposal is language to articulate the world, its =
precision and meaning, in abstract form, how do we reconcile the stance =
that dialogue is nothing more than the congress of arbitrary conceits?
=97Ravi Shankar, =93Editor=92s Statement,=94 Drunken Boat, Issue No. 9=20

All entries must be received by midnight. No late entries will be =
considered.=20

Timken Lecture Hall
Refreshments will be served

Join us!


Scott Inguito lives in San Francisco, teaches in San Jose,
and paints in his garage.  His most recent project is called
PANDAFUCK, a suite of poems inspired by the pointless,
the ill-tuned yet well-intentioned, the black and white of it all.
Dear Jack (2008), a book of poems, is out on Momotombo
Press. You can find his paintings at scottinguito.com


Sandra Doller (n=E9e Miller) has a new name. Her first book
Oriflamme was published by Ahsahta Press in 2005, and
her second collection Chora is forthcoming from Ahsahta
in 2010. Sandra Doller is the founder & editrice of a fancy
magazine & press, the curiously named 1913. She teaches
at Cal State San Marcos and lives way out west with her
man, Ben Doller (n=E9 Doyle) and their pup Ronald Johnson.


Ben Doller (n=E9 Doyle)'s first book of poems, Radio, Radio,
was selected by Susan Howe as winner of the 2000 Walt
Whitman Award. His second book, FAQ:, will be published
by Ahsahta Press in 2009, and his third book, Dead Ahead,
is forthcoming from Fence Books. He co-edits the Kuhl
House Contemporary Poets series and teaches in Antioch's
Low-Res MFA program. Wherever he lives, he lives with his
lady, Sandra Doller (n=E9e Miller) and their boxador,
Ronald Johnson.

Language Poetry was central to experimental American poetry essentially
about twenty years ago. I think innovative poetry (one may ask if innovative
is the same as experimental) has been moving in new directions only
tangentially related to tenets of Language Poetry.

One, but not the only, obvious example is visual poetry, of which the
digital movement is an aspect, where by definition there is a change in the
very concept of "Language." Another development is the re-emerging of the
lyric as a central form, not the lyric as it was conceived before, as an
instrument of personal expression; but as a materialization of thought, and
its processes and movements, in language. The third is a rethinking of the
whole idea of fake/authenticity, copying/originality where the whole persona
of the poet as a creator changes into a that of an editor, scholar,
collector or translator.

These are just three which come to my mind off the top of my head all of
which are major departures from Language school aesthetics.

Right you are, except of course that "language Poetry was central to
experimental American poetry essentially
about twenty years ago" only in the estimation of a few of those who
identify themselves as language poets.

Thanks for the response, Murat. I'm interested in your second point. Is this
where Karen Volkman would fit in with book of sonnets? But, is this new?
Hasn't the 'New Formalism' been kicking around for quite some time - even
while language poetry was forming?

the most cogent remark i recall about 'experimental poetry'--but i can't
remember who said it--is that, like experiments of other kinds, the outcome
should be uncertain. probably it was a lanaguage poet.

if the outcome is not particularly uncertain, it isn't much of an
experiment.

of course one may say all poetry is then experimental because who knows,
when they sit down to work, just what exactly one will write? yes, well,
there is some truth in that, even when one knows a great deal about what one
will write and will do it in a traditional form. but there's experimenting
as to whether the water will boil and then there are more recent
experiments. where there really is some question at stake, not only for the
writer, but for the reader also. not as in a whodunit, where the question is
traditional and is normally posed in a traditional form, but where the
issues are played out in some sort of innovative scenario or form or
combination of innovative scenario/form.

is 'experimental poetry' then a synonym of 'innovative poetry'? well, no. if
there isn't an element of innovation in an experiment, then it isn't much of
an experiment; it's a repeat of work that has already been done. but work
can be innovative without being particularly experimental. it can just be
new without there having been any particularly experimental process
involved.

but, you know, rereading the above, i'm not all that impressed. particularly
with the last paragraph. anybody know of some good, not too boring, online
writing explorative of the notion of  'experimental poetry'? not too
clinical, i mean. and which deals comfortably with the shades of grey/gray
involved in a good piece about experimental poetry. it'd have to, wouldn't
it. 'experimentalness' is relative. yet, while one would want to acknowledge
that, one would also want to cut through the exploitation of its relativity
involved in claims that stuff that's already been done is experimental. but
one would have to qualify 'already done' in a useful way.

so much writing in this vein reads like a land claim. every sentence seems
designed to reinforce the claim of an individual or a group to special
status x. poetry capitalism. rather than creating useful distinctions for
general thinking.

I am looking for the names of contemporary (or even early to mid-20thC)
Afro-Caribbean women poets. Would be grateful for the suggestions of names

I'd also love to see you elaborate on this, the second of your three points on innovative poetry. Sounds like Olson, Whalen, Duncan, early Levertov, McClure, Mackey, Blaser, Eileen Myles, Wanda Coleman and others would fit into this mode.

Thanks for the response, Murat. I'm interested in your second point. Is this

Hasn't the 'New Formalism' been kicking around for quite some time - even

Language Poetry was central to experimental American poetry essentially
about twenty years ago. I think innovative poetry (one may ask if innovative
is the same as experimental) has been moving in new directions only
tangentially related to tenets of Language Poetry.

One, but not the only, obvious example is visual poetry, of which the
digital movement is an aspect, where by definition there is a change in the
very concept of "Language." Another development is the re-emerging of the
lyric as a central form, not the lyric as it was conceived before, as an
instrument of personal expression; but as a materialization of thought, and
its processes and movements, in language. The third is a rethinking of the
whole idea of fake/authenticity, copying/originality where the whole persona
of the poet as a creator changes into a that of an editor, scholar,
collector or translator.

These are just three which come to my mind off the top of my head all of
which are major departures from Language school aesthetics.

John,

The concept of the lyric I am referring to has little, if anything at all,
to do with formalism. It has more to do with a "movement of thought, of
ideas." In a different context I call it "eda." Zukofsky refers to something
related when he refers to a third state of poetry as "gas state." When
Spicer describes a poetry, not of the logs in the river; but the clicks the
logs make [pointing to the motions of the water underneath] he is reaching I
think for the same thing.

Ciao,

Murat

I do agree with your last paragraph in terms of relevancy. Unless there is
something useful that distinguishes such as a new philosophy, new way or
means of expression, etc., then there really is no point in calling an apple
a Spartan just for the hell of it.

This shows such a misunderstanding of what experiments are all about -- at least,
scientific experiments -- that it must have been some postmodern who said it, and
probably a poet. I don't say that only a postmodern poet could get it so wrong, but it's
sure that he or she would get it wrong.

An experiment, to be worth anything in the real world, has to be the testing of a
prediction, and the prediction the result of a theory or hypothesis. Only an experiment
designed to test a prediction has any use in science. What the kind of "experiment"
you're talking about, and what experimental poetry, resembles is throwing shit on the
wall to see what sticks. That's not experimenting, that's simply trying things blindly
without plan, and without even much hope.

Of course I understand that "experimental poetry" is a special use of "experimental", a
jargon-word, a term of art, that has nothing whatever to do with experimental in the
scientific sense -- that merely misappropriates a scientific-sounding word in an effort to
cadge some of the authority of science to try to borrow some legitimacy for an entirely
unscientific endeavor. It is interesting, and amusing, too, to note that those who so
disparage science that they cannot even define what it is accurately are still so eager
to use the language of science to describe their own unscientific efforts. It's like
listening to children playing house, hearing them copying the grownup words and as
completely ignorant of their denotations as of their connotations.

This so mistakes what people who write in traditional form do that anyone hearing it
would guess that it, too, was likely said by a postmodern poet, even if he hadn't signed
it. Traditional form makes no more demand that what is to be written will be known or
unknown than any word-salad. There are, of course, rules regarding the form, but
none regarding the content.

This sounds Grummanesque in its apparent slavish devotion to "the new", as if the
only value in the world were whether something were "new". There is nothing in mere
newness that is of value, because value itself consists in an array of other
characteristics, from interest to usefulness, among many others, none of which have
"new" as a necessary (though the thing may be new, of course -- no one says it may
not be) component.

Which is exactly what your writing in this vein sounds like: your attempt to justify your
own practice, without a shred of understanding about what other practices have been,
or are.

Cervena Barva Press is pleased to announce the publication of=20
"Sarasota VII" by Lo Galluccio=20


=C2=A0=20

Reading Sarasota VII is like watching, no staging, a play that happens to b=
e written in poetry. By playing with structure, Galluccio has done somethin=
g akin to Calvino where the structure itself is a character and a part of t=
he plot, and you're right in the thick of it.=20

You need to read it.=20
Ralph-Michael Chiaia, poet, Ten Poems & Ampersands , Coatlism Press.=20



Passionate, poignant and concise, Lo Galluccio's Sarasota VII presents us w=
ith a story of loss and raw delinquent energy, woven into a great surreal w=
eb of metaphors and magic. Crafted with care and lucid honesty, this poetic=
 prose offers its readers an intense vision of real and imaginary journeys =
across universal and interior landscapes. "We write as if it matters, so it=
 does. We love as if it matters, so it does," declares the author.=20
Flavia Cosma, poet of Gothic Calligraphy and Season of Love=20


As in the heavens, there is much beauty and much destruction, where even li=
ght cannot escape black holes, and "nothing's pure and nothing's stable." G=
alluccio takes the reader on a journey from a hotel room in Florida into th=
e expansive cosmos of the soul, revealing a woman caught up between passion=
 and intellect, raging to be free while seeking to merge; loving, losing, d=
ominating and submitting in her evolution to reconnect and be whole.=20
Karen Bowles, Publisher Luciole Press=20



So this is what Anne Boleyn whispered to the men who took her head=E2=80=94=
both her husband and her executioner=E2=80=94so this is what the henchman r=
eplied; for nowhere has sinner and saint been so exquisitely linked than in=
 Lo Galluccio=E2=80=99s Sarasota VII . As the curtain parts, it is not pola=
r opposites that are revealed but a single conjoined child. Traversing Sara=
sota VII (it has less in common with reading, more so the navigation to hea=
ven or the surrender into hell) is like giving definition to the word =E2=
=80=98passion.=E2=80=99 This is how to say profoundly simple words with oft=
en incomprehensible meanings: Love. Desire. Hate. Birth. Destruction. And w=
ho hasn=E2=80=99t attempted this=E2=80=94 to grasp the single rose in the p=
it of thorns. And who hasn=E2=80=99t, on occasion, failed and been banished=
? But Lo=E2=80=99s beautiful, prophetic prose lulls us, even as we burn, an=
d she tells us to =E2=80=9CFossilize the monster=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CTend=
 our rings like vain kings.=E2=80=9D She is right. We must. For something s=

that statement ain't by "lanaguage" poet but is watered-down (which is not

Here's a few, Gabriel, for an area of poetry I'm sure is teflon coated
against the snarky comments on this list about what one should know
about poetry, or how one should go about acquiring knowledge, or
endeavor to expand one's repertoire for teaching or simply for life;
explore with impunity; let's hear it for the open humility of not
knowing:

M. NourbeSe Phillip ("innovative")
Dionne Brand
Honor Ford Smith
Lenelle Moise (performance poet; has CDs, the latest of which is
called Madivinez)
Cheryl Boyce Taylor
R.H. Douglas (see Creation Fire/Poems by Caribbean Women)
Ana-Maurine Lara
Audre Lorde
R. Erica Doyle (she's in Thomas Glave's recent anthology, Our
Caribbean, and was 1st runner up for the Cave Canem poetry prize for
this year; reading just happened last weekend in Pittsburgh.
"innovative")
Rosamond King  (in Thomas Glave's book as well, other places.
"innovative")
Cheryl Nailah Folami Imoja Gill (in Barbados, in a collective called
VOICES.  Met her there through Kamau B.  She's got some online
presence; contact her)
Shani Mootoo
Opal Palmer Adisa
Carla Richmond (she's in Ma-KA: Diasporic Juks: Contemporary Writing
by Queers of African Descent, Douglas, McFarlane, Silvera & Stewart,
eds.)
Lorna Goodison
Danielle LeGros Georges (Maroon, Curbstone Press)
Marilene Phipps
Erna Brodber ("innovative")

See also, OUR WORDS, OUR REVOLUTIONS: Di/Verse Voices of Black Women,
First nations Women, and Women of Colour in Canada, Sophie G. Harding,
ed.; LET IT BE TOLD: Black Women Writers in Britain, Lauretta Ngcobo,
ed. (I have these books; hopefully they're online; definitely out of
print); BEYOND THE FRONTIER: African American Poetry for the 21st
Century, E. Ethelbert Miller, ed. (see bios in back; several poets of
Caribbean ancestry working in particular traditions)
On that score, check the Heinemann collection of Caribbean poetry, The
Norton of Af-Am Poetry, special issues of Callaloo on the Netherlands
Antilles, Haitian literature, and general Caribbean literature, the
latest issue of Small Axe on Haitian literature, and various back
issues, back issues of the Caribbean women's journal MaComere (here's
their page, the Association of Caribbean Women Writers and Scholars,
with additional resources, http://acwws.org/links.php), and any number
of Af-Am collections, as Caribbean poets are often included in these
books.

Thanks for asking; the increased visibility of these poets' work will
make a difference to lots of somebodies somewhere.
Backchannel me if you need more.

There hasn't been a nation called the Czechoslovakia for nearly 20 years. I am assuming most do not understand that Czechoslovakia was created following the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire and that it consisted of two ethnic groups - Czechs and Slovaks (the Slovaks of which supported the Nazis). And the split was peaceful. They aren't Eastern Europeans, as they are sandwiched btw Germany and Austria, neither are they Russian - and yes, they do not belong to former Yugoslavia. You hear this mistake made often - by Brits, Yanks, most anyone who neither knows nor cares. I will say, however, a good number of the most important figures in both art, music, and literature have played in what is solely Bohemia.

Ted?! Why do we listen to him anymore. Even though a news magnot, he clearly doesn't know his GEORGRAPHY - so said my Czech wife!!!

marcus,

in experimental poetry, once tries things that one hopes (and has some
reason to believe) will provide interesting results, but one cannot be
certain of the outcome. perhaps because no one has tried it. or perhaps--as
is usually the case--the initial conditions need to be just right. so one
tries it several times with different initial conditions.

the 'prediction' is usually that the resulting piece will have various
properties, but, mostly, the prediction and the hope is that the resulting
piece will be of interest. the 'theory', whatever it is, is being 'tested'
insofar as it informed the construction of the method.

an example.

i recently made some musical recordings at
http://vispo.com/jig/JigAteroids2.htm . the raw material of the recordings
were some voice recordings i made some time ago. they weren't particularly
musical. you can hear them in the Arteroids poetry game i wrote some time
ago at http://vispo.com/arteroids . i wanted to use those sounds to create
some loops which, when sequenced and layered interactively, might be of some
musical interest. i won't go into the details, but let's just say i tried
all sorts of things. i did not know whether i would end up with anything of
interest. i think i did. such as http://vispo.com/jig/JigArteroid2.mp3 . you
might not agree, of course, and that's fine.

the 'theory' was that it was somehow possible to use those non-musical
recordings in an interestingly musical way.  not as just part of the piece
but as the entirety of the piece. no other instrumentation or anything else.

part of what's involved, it seems to me, in experimental poetry or
experimental art more generally, is a different approach to 'the material'.
more like the way visual artists think of 'the material' than the more
limited notion of 'the subject matter'. 'the material' is subject to
processes that are typically applied not to words or paint or whatever, but
to other things. the construction is not so much a matter of simply
reflecting and speaking/writing as a constructive process that may well--and
usually is--be informed by one's reflections and meditations, but the
compositional method is very different from just sitting down to write and
writing or standing up to paint and painting, yadayada. and of course
interesting results are by no means guaranteed, but one has in mind some
relation of that constructive method to meaning in the world, meaning in
writing, and one is, in a sense, testing that theory in trying out all sorts
of ways to get interesting results from the method.

so i think that the term 'experimental' is actually quite apt concerning
this type of art.

and, in a scientific experiment, certainly the outcome is in question. even
though it is testing a theory. if the outcome is not in question, the theory
has already been proven, so the value of the experiment is questionable, at
that point. so i don't think the notion that i brought up, originally,
namely that, like experiments of other kinds, the outcome of experiments in
art  should be uncertain, shows "such a misunderstanding of what experiments
are all about -- at least, scientific experiments," as you maintain, marcus.

ps: when i was a kid at university in canada, i didn't get exposed to the
language poets, but i did get exposed to some earlier usamerican
intellectual poets such as wallace stevens, pound, ashbery and emerson. and
i gotta say i find that usamerican tradition of thoughtful poetry (it's also
a tradition in france) beautiful and very important to thinking young people
and a world, more generally, in which thought and art, thought and feeling,
are brought together. the language poets are heir to that tradition of
innovative, thoughtful, conscientious art in the usa, so my hat's off to
them. and from what i've read of their challenging, often remarkable work,
they've earned their reputation. and have done things to benefit poetry and
poets more widely, not the least of which is this list and the network it is
part of. i expect they're used to criticisms of all sorts.

Maria, good question. Mostly Anglo-, tho the names of writers in
French/Dutch/Spanish would be welcome if they somehow trend out of a more

Paul,

You are on when you say that Olson, particularly in the prose of* Mayan
Letters*, has something to do with it. On the West Coast, to me the crucial
poet is Spicer. His poetics anticipates a poetry of thought (rather than
specifically of ideas). If one follows the Socratic Dialogue between the
poet and his audience which basically *The Vancouver Lectures* is, one
realizes at the end that what Spicer means by "writing against the grain" o=
r
"writing from Mars" is the creation of a poetic space where thought and its
processes occur. The lyric where materialization of thought occurs develops
a spacial/ visual dimension where its processes occur. One has not exactly
"a projection" of thought; but its weave, its dance. For a greater
elaboration of what I mean by this kind of lyric, the best place to go woul=
d
be my book, *Eda: An Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry*. In its
introduction, "The Idea of a Book," I explain in detail what *Eda* is, in
its last section focusing on a specific embodiment of it I call "poetry of
motion." Poets in the anthology whose works were published in the 1990's an=
d
onward create this new kind of poetry. Their names include: Lale M=FCld=FCr=
,
Ahmet G=FCntan (whose *Romeo and Romeo* is the pure embodiment of the poeti=
cs
of motion), Seyhan Eroz=E7elik, Sami Baydar, k. Iskender.

I hope this is helpful.

Ciao,

Murat

Hello poetics list, I am chasing some rather loose and wild conjectures
at present about Gerald Manly Hopkins and wondered if an assemblage such
at this might shake out a few ideas about this to aid my endeavors. I'll
just list some queries and then blab below each about them all a bit. As
will be obvious these different questions are not a 'unified' research
project, although I do have an intuition which might allow them to work
in concert for an academic project I have at present. Ok, then...

1. Hopkinsian-ism in Contemporary Poetry?
- can anyone point to any recent poetry, especially as deriving from
more experimental impulses that seems hopkinsian? naturally, the more
specific the references the more helpful.
- i recently read some poems from Clark Coolidge to a graduate seminar
on Hopkins, i wasn't sure whether i was hallucinating on account of
having ingested so much Hopkins lately or if there really were things in
these poems that evoked Hopkins. The Coolidge poems were both from
SOLUTION PASSAGE "Halt Hole in Blend Hill"(p.167) and "Speech to a
Mirror"(p.222). To my surprise the class, seemed largely to agree that
these poems were 'hopkinsian' though they all thought that Coolidge was
"easy to understand" as his syntax is not so clotted and knotty! the
basis of comparison with C is more sound-based, use of few connective
words, etc.
- i have also been looking into other recent sources for examples of
poets who make use of a syntax more comparable to Hopkins', which was
famously descried as "torturous," which,  if you are trying to crate a
content-based paraphrase, i suppose it is. but my own enjoyment of it is
more akin to the way i enjoy certain effects in Bruce Andrews or,
alternately, Jake Berry. so, torturous syntax in contempo po along lines
of the Hopster, shout out if you got a clue on that one

2. Abjection in Contemporary Poetry?
again I desire to lean more towards experimental work for what I am
doing, but this is a more wide-open question really (and it does all tie
back into Hopkins ultimately, in whose work I see many hints of the
abject self presented, for instance in [I wake and feel] where he writes
"I am gall, I am heartburn.")...  so, to spell it all out more
delectably, i am looking for poets or poems which concern themselves
frequently with abject matters (in both sense of that word) and thus;
corpses, the "unclean," shit, piss, mucus of whatever sorts, ejaculate
of whatever sort, saliva, blood, pus, any other bodily gunks and
gooks... especially as these things mark individuals as abjected.  in
this connection i always feel as if i will find this in Bruce Andrews
but then i get caught up and forget what i am looking for, or, i don't
quite find it, instead i get these sorts of abjecting effects from the
sorts of debased sources he uses (which IS abjectifying but not quite
what i am looking for.. but maybe what i am after is there still,
somehow?) also i think of John Bennett who, as a friend once remarked,
seems to "have this thing for gross bodily processes" but virtually
eveything i have of his is in magazines or chapbooks and thus all in
deep storage and hard for me to access right now.

anyway, i am curious about these things and interested to see what
anyone else might have to say, but whether you have any thoughts on this
or not, thanks for reading thus far...

When Jerry Rothenberg & I put together the Millennium anthologies, we =20=

tried our hand at describing what "experimental" or "avant-garde" =20
means as it was such terms that guided our selection process. Given =20
the wide range of work these adjectives can be applied to, the best we =20=

could do was to gather a catalogue indicating the areas in which such =20=

a push to "make it new" had happened (&, I think, is still happening). =20=

Here is our catalogue of experimental ships =97 &  such a catalogue has =20=

of course to be international, as one aspect of this work is exactly =20

  =97 poetry-art intersections in which conventional boundaries between =20=

arts break down,

     sometimes involving generalized art movements (Cobra, Fluxus) =20

     with a poetics at their center;

(from the continua-

     tion of Surrealist dream experiments to the psychedelic =20

     meditative experiments of the 1970s, and beyond) in which =20

     one hand toward prose as an instrument of poetry and on the other =20=

toward the

     exploration of  previously suppressed languages (including the =20
genuine languages of

     the deaf, not shown here) or of those sublanguages (dialects, =20

     etc.) that had long been at the fringes of accepted literature;

     ineluctably in process;

Often all you have to do is look at it and you understand it's off the
conventional map of poetry. But not always, of course. It seems likely that
'experimental poetry' is less about an identifiable look or style or genre
of poetry so much as a way of approaching it. Something resembling but not
identical to a 'methodology'. Looser than a methodology. Mind you, most
methodologies are applied loosely, in practice. Object oriented programming
is a methodology but one is free to apply the principles as loosely or
rigorously as one wants, in practice.

I'm no expert on the subject, but here are some of the characteristics I've
noted in some of the experimental poetry I've encountered.

Seeing poetry as amid media. Whether it's the page or the screen or audio or
video or programming or whatever. The way it means is not limited to the way
sentences or even words mean. A bunch of words can mean all sorts of things
on thier own but they're never on their own. They're in a mag out of Seattle
or New York, and they mean different things because of it. Maybe they're on
a screen; then they mean something different than if they're on paper. For
all sorts of reasons. One of which is that when they're on the screen,
they've got competition from 70 refreshes per second, menus, google ads, and
whatnot.

Media are active in shaping the meanings of the work in them. Swim or sink.

You can't deal with the problems that poses from a thought bubble.
Conventional reading as posing a thought bubble in which the range of
meanings are worked out through the text alone. Whereas the meanings are
actually worked out not only through the work itself but through the frame,
the membranes between the work and the media it's embodied in, and its
relation with the world more generally as a literary individual work in a
massive population of other such entities. Where does it live?

So then 'the material' in which the work is embodied, the media
itself--experimental poetry gets its hands on that material .

Quite a while ago, by now, Burroughs said something like 'escaping our own
internal tape loops and habits thought can't be done simply by an act of
will as writers but, instead, we have to resort to things like cut-ups to
cut those loops, those habits of thought and expression.'

I'm still not sure whether that's true. But, regardless, methods of dealing
with language that aren't subordinated to the ways we typically use language
in speech and according to the rules of grammar, etc,  can be quite valuable
in the energy and unexpected insight they sometimes introduce. the way they
diversify 'voice', for instance. to 'find one's voice' is now quite a
different thing than it once was. And the way the particular processes one
has chosen to work with affect the tone and quality of the language they
touch, inflecting the language with something of the atmospheres associated
with the processes from other contexts. Whether the processes involve
recipes or computer algorithms, the rhythms of the tides or the rhythms of
AC/DC.

a lot of the methods one can use in dealing with the material--rearranging
it, filtering it, transforming it, recombining it, and so on, typically
needs selection and composition thereafter, requires dealing with lots of
permutations, combinations, and so forth. Experimenting with large or small
'data sets' that usually get selected into smaller bodies.

That's enough for now.

dear stephen, i think this is the best point that's been made.  true true
true.  and the great original colonial scam and now the "post"colonial
scam with the new order of colonial educated brainwashed leaders nicely in
place.  g (plodding through emails)

OVERVIEW OF LESSON PLAN:
In this lesson, students consider the phenomenon of Black Friday and then=
=20
research and debate the idea that Americans are "programmed" to shop for=20
poems to read.

SUGGESTED TIME ALLOWANCE:
 1-2 class periods

OBJECTIVES:


RESOURCES / MATERIALS:


ACTIVITIES / PROCEDURES:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW:

Students respond to the following quotation from Mad Magazine: "The only re=
ason=20
a great many American families don't own a poem the size of an elephant is =
that=20
they have never been offered a poem the size of an elephant for a dollar do=
wn and=20
easy weekly payments."

Ask: What do you think the speaker is trying to say about American consumer=
s=20
of 21st century poetry? Do you agree or disagree with this statement? What =
are=20
your observations about how and why we shop as a culture? As individuals? T=
hen,=20
expand the conversation to the phenomenon of Black Friday Poetry, the bigge=
st=20
poetic day of the year. Ask: How does this statement make sense in the cont=
ext=20
of Black Friday? Why do you think would someone would get up at 5 a.m. to g=
o=20
looking for a poem to read on the day after Thanksgiving? Have you ever loo=
ked for=20
a poem to read on Black Friday? Why or why not? What are your observations =
or=20
experiences with this most poetic of days? What dominant images, metaphors,=
=20
similes, metonymies come to your mind when you think of this day?

2.  QUESTIONS:
a. What iconic images or scenes of the past century can a poet evoke in a d=
escription=20
of the Black Friday Poetry Doorbuster rush? What is the purpose?
b. What=92s is responsible for the phenomenon? Do you think it=92s a positi=
ve or negative=20
aspect of American culture? Why?
c. What special significance did this year=92s Black Friday hold for shoppe=
rs, businesses=20
and even policy makers looking to red poetry?
d. To what can a poet compare the American economy?=20
e. What has the government=92s position been on spending on iambs in recent=
 years?
f. What is the challenge facing American consumers of Vispo right now?
g. Why do you think a poem which includes a reference to the Picasso painti=
ng=20
"Guernica"? What does that suggest?

3. ACTIVITY:

Debate the following argument: "For decades, Americans have been effectivel=
y programmed=20
to read haiku, sonnets., etc. China, Japan and other foreign powers have pr=
ovided the wherewithal=20
to write their poems by allowing Americans and other Westerners to copy the=
ir styles. Institutions=20
of poetics have scattered miles and miles of explication as if they were ta=
keout menus and turned=20
our houses into shacks that Pound built. Hollywood and Madison Avenue have =
excelled at=20
persuading us that Poetry Month is a time to read closer or risk being foun=
d insufficiently=20
appreciative of our slim volumes." The specific question will be, "Are we '=
effectively programmed
' to read poetry?"=20

Divide into two groups. Assign one side the "pro" position and the other th=
e "con" position.

hey!

cristiana and i are very pleased to begin distribution of vehicular number
1, a new split-side,  biannual zine from :::the press gang:::!

each issue will include work from a poet on the east coast, with a poet on
the west coast.

this first issue includes work by j.d. mitchell-lumsden and evan kennedy!

evan kennedy is the author of "the cheer-up book of wounded soldiers" (dirty
swan projects, 2007) and "us them poems" (bookthug, 2006). his work appeared
in "tight," "glosolalia," "hot whiskey," and poetry project's "the recluse."
he lives in brooklyn.


In a Season of Switchblades
for Saint Augustine

After an awkward phase,     our bodies
became a pleasure to look at;

we got the hint that things     were starting
to fill out.
                We joined the Wreckers and

received matching coats. We bred
a subtle trouble     through the school halls.

Even a little danger loved was death won.
There were the bloody-nosed     at the video arcade

and haircuts in the bowling alley bathroom.
On one wall     a portrait of Cabeza de Vaca,

another, all the animals he brought.
There were Swishers to smoke and

showers to get the stink off. The Cineplex
was brimming with unheard-of poetries...


j.d. mitchell-lumsden co-edits cricketonlinereview. he lives in oakland,
california.


     I am doing a report on an ocean ecosystem. It appears it is provided
free of charge. There is no helpful explanation but the consequences of
"Living Together." Who could doubt that a firm belief in Genesis blinds
principles of the symbiotic, suggesting strong romantic or sexual themes are
to be avoided. Of course chairs exist as chairs independently of
designation.

    The hermit-crab and the sea absorb each other.

    Associations between organisms, if providing reciprocal benefit (let us
say aphids and asses), are highly interdependent but free of charge; if
those associations lack reciprocity (let us say aphids and the State),
commercialism and/or colonization coerce\s mutations in those associations,
and thereby distorts all other associates. Multiple mice carry mutation.
Complex mutation when bred.

    There are mutual places.

Subject:      NEW BOOK: Poems for the Millennium, Volume Three
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press is pleased to announce the publication of:

Poems for the Millennium, Volume Three: The University of California
Book of Romantic & Postromantic Poetry

Jerome Rothenberg is an internationally known poet and Professor
Emeritus of Visual Arts and Literature at the University of
California, San Diego. Jeffrey C. Robinson is Professor of English at
the University of Colorado Boulder.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Rothenberg

The previous two volumes of this acclaimed anthology set forth a
globally decentered revision of twentieth-century poetry from the
perspective of its many avant-gardes. Now editors Jerome Rothenberg
and Jeffrey C. Robinson bring a radically new interpretation to the
poetry of the preceding century, viewing the work of the romantic and
post-romantic poets as an international, collective, often utopian
enterprise that became the foundation of experimental modernism.
Global in its range, volume three gathers selections from the poetry
and manifestos of canonical poets, as well as the work of
lesser-known but equally radical poets. Defining romanticism as
experimental and visionary, Rothenberg and Robinson feature prose
poetry, verbal-visual experiments, and sound poetry, along with more
familiar forms seen here as if for the first time. The anthology also
explores romanticism outside the European orbit and includes
ethnopoetic and archaeological works outside the literary mainstream.
The range of volume three and its skewing of the traditional canon
illuminate the process by which romantics and post- romantics
challenged nineteenth-century orthodoxies and propelled poetry to the
experiments of a later modernism and avant-gardism.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is
available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Rothenberg

Odetta, Voice of American Civil Rights Movement, Dies

By Tim Weiner
International Herald Tribune
December 3, 2008

http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/03/arts/03odetta.php

Odetta, the singer whose deep voice wove together the
strongest songs of American folk music and the civil
rights movement, died Tuesday. She was 77.

The cause was heart disease, said her manager, Doug
Yeager.

He added that she had been hoping to sing at Barack
Obama's inauguration.

Odetta -- she was born Odetta Holmes -- sang at
coffeehouses and Carnegie Hall and released several
albums, becoming one of the most widely known and
influential folk-music artists of the 1950s and 60s.

Her voice was an accompaniment to the black-and-white
images of the freedom marchers who walked the roads of
Alabama and Mississippi and the boulevards of
Washington in quest of an end to racial discrimination.

Rosa Parks, the woman who started the boycott of
segregated buses in Montgomery, Alabama, was once asked
which songs meant the most to her. She replied, "All of
the songs Odetta sings."

Odetta sang at the August 1963 march on Washington, a
pivotal event in the civil rights movement. Her song
that day was "O Freedom," dating back to slavery days.

Born in Birmingham on Dec. 31, 1930, Odetta Holmes
spent her first six years in the depths of the
Depression. The music of that time and place -- in
particular prison song and work songs recorded in the
fields of the deep South -- shaped her life.

"They were liberation songs," she said in a videotaped
interview with The New York Times in 2007, for its
online feature "The Last Word." "You're walking down
life's road, society's foot is on your throat, every
which way you turn you can't get from under that foot.
And you reach a fork in the road and you can either lie
down and die, or insist upon your life."

Her father, Reuben Holmes, died when she was young; she
and her mother, Flora Sanders, who later remarried,
moved to Los Angeles in 1937. Three years later, Odetta
discovered she could sing.

"A teacher told my mother that I had a voice, that
maybe I should study," she recalled. "But I myself
didn't have anything to measure it by."

She found her own voice by listening to blues, jazz and
folk music from the African-American and Anglo-American
traditions. She earned a music degree from Los Angeles
City College. Her training in classical music and
musical theater was "a nice exercise, but it had
nothing to do with my life," she said.

"The folk songs were -- the anger," she emphasized.

In a 2005 National Public Radio interview, she said:
"School taught me how to count and taught me how to put
a sentence together. But as far as the human spirit
goes, I learned through folk music."

In 1950, Odetta began singing professionally in a West
Coast production of the musical "Finian's Rainbow," but
she found a stronger calling in the bohemian
coffeehouses of San Francisco. "We would finish our
play, we'd go to the joint, and people would sit around
playing guitars and singing songs and it felt like
home," she said in the 2007 interview with The Times.

She began singing in nightclubs, cutting a striking
figure with her guitar and her close-cropped hair. (She
noted late in life that she was one of the first black
performers in the United States to wear an "Afro"
hairstyle -- "they used to call it 'the Odetta,' " she
said.)

Her voice plunged deep and soared high, and her songs
blended the personal and the political, the theatrical
and the spiritual. Her first solo album, "Odetta Sings
Ballads and Blues," resonated with an audience hearing
old songs made new.

"The first thing that turned me on to folk singing was
Odetta," Bob Dylan said, referring to that record, in a
1978 interview with Playboy . He said he heard
"something vital and personal. I learned all the songs
on that record." It was her first, and the songs were
"Mule Skinner," "Jack of Diamonds," "Water Boy," "
'Buked and Scorned."

Her blues and spirituals led directly to her work for
the civil-rights movement. They were two rivers running
together, she said in her interview with The Times. The
words and music captured "the fury and frustration that
I had growing up." They were heard by the people who
were present at the creation of the civil rights
movement, people who "heard on the grapevine about this
lady who was singing these songs." She played countless
benefits; the money she raised underwrote the work of
keeping the movement alive.

Her fame hit a peak in 1963, when she marched with
Martin Luther King in Selma and performed for President
John F. Kennedy. But after King was assassinated in
1968, the wind went out of the sails of the civil-
rights movement and the songs of protest and resistance
that had been the movement's soundtrack. Odetta's fame
flagged for years thereafter. She recorded fewer
records, although she performed on stage as a singer
and an actor, during the 1970s and 1980s. She revived
her career in the 1990s, and thereafter appeared
regularly on "A Prairie Home Companion," the popular
public-radio show. In 1999 she recorded her first album
in 14 years, and that year President Bill Clinton
awarded her the National Endowment for the Arts Medal
of the Arts and Humanities from. In 2003 she received a
"Living Legend" tribute from the Library of Congress
and the Kennedy Center Visionary Award.

Odetta was married three times: to Don Gordon, to Gary
Shead, and, in 1977, to the blues musician Iverson
Minter, known professionally as Louisiana Red. The
first marriages ended in divorce; Minter moved to
Germany in 1983 to pursue his performing career.

She was singing and performing well into the 21st
century, and her influence stayed strong through the
decades.

In April 2007, half a century after Dylan heard her,
she was onstage at a Carnegie Hall tribute to Bruce
Springsteen. She turned one of his songs, "57
Channels," into a chanted poem, and Springsteen came
out from the wings to call it "the greatest version" of
the song he had ever heard.

Reviewing a December 2006 performance, James Reed of
the Boston Globe wrote: "Odetta's voice is still a
force of nature -- something commented upon endlessly as
folks exited the auditorium -- and her phrasing and
sensibility for a song have grown more complex and
shaded."

The critic called her "a majestic figure in American
music, a direct gateway to bygone generations that feel
so foreign today."

My friend Kaia Sand had this to say a few years ago in an online
conversation with Carol Mirakove after Mirakove asked Sand about the
creation of her panel "Women in the Avant-Garde":
*
I chose the term "avant-garde" over "experimental" because "avant-garde"
implies the social side of the work. There are a lot of ways to pitch in
with an avant-garde movement=96=96this is an inclusive frame. So many artis=
ts
have shown us that if you want to extend what's possible, you need to build
the ground to walk on=96=96and that's collective action. Such ground is
established by chapbooks, readings, meetings ... If, on the other hand, one
strives to be an author who works individually and is lauded and published
by HarperCollins, one is striving, generally speaking, to gain acceptance
from social elites who uphold established conventions. One simply succumbs.=
*

My friend Michael Hennessey recently showed me a paper he had written title=
d
"Towards a True Avant-Garde Poetics," framed with some ideas of Peter
Burger's. Let me share:
*
While conventional notions of the avant-garde suggest work which is
groundbreaking, confrontational and even impenetrable, this panel seeks to
investigate poetry and poetics which adhere to a narrower sense of the
term=97namely, Peter Burger's conception of the avant-garde as work which
"demand[s] that art becomes practical once again," or returns art to the
praxis of everyday life. Understood this way, Burger's avant-garde aestheti=
c
changes the ways in which an audience interacts with art, calling for
personal action, and provides new, democratized inroads to the creative
process.*

This shows such a misunderstanding of what experiments are all about -- at=
 least,
scientific experiments -- that it must have been some postmodern who said =
it, and
probably a poet. I don't say that only a postmodern poet could get it so w=
rong, but it's
sure that he or she would get it wrong.

An experiment, to be worth anything in the real world, has to be the testi=
ng of a
prediction, and the prediction the result of a theory or hypothesis. Only =
an experiment
designed to test a prediction has any use in science. What the kind of "ex=
periment"
you're talking about, and what experimental poetry, resembles is throwing =
shit on the
wall to see what sticks. That's not experimenting, that's simply trying th=
ings blindly
without plan, and without even much hope.

Of course I understand that "experimental poetry" is a special use of "exp=
erimental", a
jargon-word, a term of art, that has nothing whatever to do with experimen=
tal in the
scientific sense -- that merely misappropriates a scientific-sounding word=
 in an effort to
cadge some of the authority of science to try to borrow some legitimacy fo=
r an entirely
unscientific endeavor. It is interesting, and amusing, too, to note that t=
hose who so
disparage science that they cannot even define what it is accurately are s=
till so eager
to use the language of science to describe their own unscientific efforts.=
 It's like
listening to children playing house, hearing them copying the grownup word=
s and as
completely ignorant of their denotations as of their connotations.

This so mistakes what people who write in traditional form do that anyone =
hearing it
would guess that it, too, was likely said by a postmodern poet, even if he=
 hadn't signed
it. Traditional form makes no more demand that what is to be written will =
be known or
unknown than any word-salad. There are, of course, rules regarding the for=
m, but
none regarding the content.

This sounds Grummanesque in its apparent slavish devotion to "the new", as=
 if the
only value in the world were whether something were "new". There is nothin=
g in mere
newness that is of value, because value itself consists in an array of oth=
er
characteristics, from interest to usefulness, among many others, none of w=
hich have
"new" as a necessary (though the thing may be new, of course -- no one say=
s it may
not be) component.

Which is exactly what your writing in this vein sounds like: your attempt =
to justify your
own practice, without a shred of understanding about what other practices =

or are.

Dear Poetics-L:


RE: http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

The University of California Press is pleased to announce the publication of:

Poems for the Millennium, Volume Three: The University of California
Book of Romantic & Postromantic Poetry

Jerome Rothenberg is an internationally known poet and Professor
Emeritus of Visual Arts and Literature at the University of
California, San Diego. Jeffrey C. Robinson is Professor of English at
the University of Colorado Boulder.

http://go.ucpress.edu/Rothenberg

The previous two volumes of this acclaimed anthology set forth a
globally decentered revision of twentieth-century poetry from the
perspective of its many avant-gardes. Now editors Jerome Rothenberg
and Jeffrey C. Robinson bring a radically new interpretation to the
poetry of the preceding century, viewing the work of the romantic and
post-romantic poets as an international, collective, often utopian
enterprise that became the foundation of experimental modernism.
Global in its range, volume three gathers selections from the poetry
and manifestos of canonical poets, as well as the work of
lesser-known but equally radical poets. Defining romanticism as
experimental and visionary, Rothenberg and Robinson feature prose
poetry, verbal-visual experiments, and sound poetry, along with more
familiar forms seen here as if for the first time. The anthology also
explores romanticism outside the European orbit and includes
ethnopoetic and archaeological works outside the literary mainstream.
The range of volume three and its skewing of the traditional canon
illuminate the process by which romantics and post- romantics
challenged nineteenth-century orthodoxies and propelled poetry to the
experiments of a later modernism and avant-gardism.

Full information about the book, including the table of contents, is
available online: http://go.ucpress.edu/Rothenberg

The World Seen From Poem Central All about ZenitSynod Propositions 11-13


Conclusions of Poetical Assembly on Word of Words


DARK CITY, DEC. 4, 2008  www.CENTRAL.org - Here are=20
translations=20
of the synodal=20
propositions 11-15, which were=20
submitted to Bernstein XXX at the end of the world=20
Synod of LANGpo on the "Word of Words in the Life=20
and Mission of Poetics,"=20
held in today in Dark City.

CENTRAL will publish a translation of the=20
remaining propositions in subsequent=20
services...as it sees fit.

* * *

Proposition 11
Word of words and charity toward the sentences
One of the characteristic features of the word is the revelation of=20
our predilection for the poor sentences. Word=20
of word incarnate, went through this world=20
doing good sentences. The Word=20
of words, willingly received, generates abundantly in the=20
exchange charity and=20
justice towards all, above all towards the poor sentence.

Poets are called to listen to them, to learn from=20
them, to guide them in their path and to motivate them to be architects of=
=20
their own history. Academics in charge of the service of charity of words=
=20
have a particular responsibility in this ambit. CENTRAL=20
encourages them in their ministry.

Proposition 12

Inspiration and truth of the Language

CENTRAL proposes that the Congregation for the=20
Doctrine of=20
the RIGHT PATH clarify the concepts of inspiration and truth of=20
the LANGUAGE, as well as their reciprocal=20
relationship, in order to understand better the=20
teaching of "Dei Verbum"=20
In particular, it is necessary to highlight the=20
originality of the co-operative=20
Linguistic hermeneutics in this field.

Proposition 13

Word of words and natural law

CENTRAL is well aware of the great challenges present in the=20
current historical moment. One of these=20
touches the enormous development that=20
science has realized in regard to knowledge of nature.
Paradoxically, the more this knowledge increases the=20
less one sees=20
the ethical message that stems from the same. In the history of=20
thought, ancient philosophers already used=20
to call this principle "lex naturalis"=20
or natural law. As Pope Bernstein XXX has recalled, this expression=20
seems to=20
have been made incomprehensible today "because of a concept of=20
nature that is no longer=20
metaphysical, but only empirical. The fact that nature,=20
being itself is no=20
longer permeable to a moral message, creates a sense of disorientation=20
that makes decisions of daily life precarious=20
and uncertain... especially within DARK CITY.
In the light of the teaching of scarce language, as=20
recalled above all by the=20
Acolytes underline that this law is written in the depth of=20
the heart of each person=20
and each one can access it. Its basic principle is that=20
one must "do good and avoid=20
evil"; a truth that is evidently imposed on all and from which=20
other principles=20
stem that regulate ethical judgment on the rights and=20
duties of each one. It is=20
good to recall that to be nourished by the Word of words also=20
increases knowledge=20
of the natural law and allows for progress of the moral conscience.=20
Hence, the=20
synod recommends to all pastors that they have=20
special solicitude in which the=20
ministers of the Word are sensitive to the=20
rediscovery of the natural law and=20
its function in the formation of consciences.

Australia often adopts successful Kiwis as their own - Jane Campion,
Split Enz, Fred Dagg (aka John Clarke) etc etc
but it's not a usual practice with regard to poets.

Alan Loney is a New Zealander

gonna be here on New Year=B9s Day!



Friday, December 5, 10 PM
Hey, What=B9s All The Hooplah?

Forget the impending breadlines, grab your polka-dotted canvas bindle,
bundle up and bustle your way over to hear the tales of times said and gone
and the prophetic parables of a new generation of poets, storytellers and
musicians. Featuring music and performances by John Houx, Elizabeth Devlin,
Frank Hoier, & others T.B.A. Mr. Houx grew up in West coast cattle country
and "hoboed" his way to New York in 2007, where he was quickly embraced by
the East Village's Antifolk scene and traditional folk music circles. With
appearances on radio and television (broadcast and online), John is
presently planning his first full-length record and a small European tour.
Elizabeth Devlin has traveled the world to invoke influences from scratchy
American and French phonographs, combining bitter-sweet, haunting vocals
with angelic, cacophonous Autoharp melodies. Her forthcoming full-length
album will be released on December 6th, 2008. Frank Hoier is poised at the
front of a new wave of modern Americana roots music. Backed by rock'n'roll
prodigy siblings, The Weber Brothers, Frank's self released album Lovers &
Dollars is set for it's national debut on November 11, 2008. Frank Hoier
brings a fresh perspective and a rock'n'roll energy to Folk music. His
Guthrie-esque anthem "Jesus Don't Give Tax Breaks To The Rich" has been
hailed as "the most perfect protest song written yet this millennium"
(PopHeadWound).

The World Seen From Poem Central? All about CENTRAL's SYNOD Propositions 11=
-15


Conclusions of Poetical Assembly on Word of Words


DARK CITY, DEC. 4, 2008 (CENTRAL.org).- Here are translations of the synoda=
l=20
propositions 11-15, which were submitted to Bernstein XXX at the end of the=
 world=20
Synod of LANGpo on the "Word of Words in the Life and Mission of Poetics,"=
=20
held in October in Dark City.

CENTRAL will publish a translation of the remaining propositions in subsequ=
ent=20
services...as it sees fit.

* * *

Proposition 11

Word of words and charity toward the sentences
One of the characteristic features of the word is the revelation of=20
our predilection for the poor sentences. Word=20
of word incarnate, went through this world doing good sentences. The Word=
=20
of words, willingly received, generates abundantly in the exchange charity =
and=20
justice towards all, above all towards the poor sentence.

Poets are called to listen to them, to learn from=20
them, to guide them in their path and to motivate them to be architects of=
=20
their own history.Academics in charge of the service of charity of words ha=
ve a particular=20
responsibility in this ambit. CENTRAL encourages them in their ministry.

Proposition 12

Inspiration and truth of the Language

CENTRAL proposes that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the RIGHT PATH c=
larify=20
the concepts of inspiration and truth of the LANGUAGE, as well as their rec=
iprocal=20
relationship, in order to understand better the teaching of "Dei Verbum" 11=
. In=20
particular, it is necessary to highlight the originality of the co-operativ=
e=20
Linguistic hermeneutics in this field.

Proposition 13

Word of words and natural law

CENTRAL is well aware of the great challenges present in the=20
current historical moment. One of these touches the enormous development th=
at=20
science has realized in regard to knowledge of nature.
Paradoxically, the more this knowledge increases the less one sees the ethi=
cal=20
message that stems from the same. In the history of thought, ancient=20
philosophers already used to call this principle "lex naturalis" or natural=
 law. As=20
Pope Bernstein XXX has recalled, this expression seems to have been=20
made incomprehensible today "because of a concept of nature that is no long=
er=20
metaphysical, but only empirical. The fact that nature, being itself is no=
=20
longer permeable to a moral message, creates a sense of disorientation that=
=20
makes decisions of daily life precarious and uncertain... especially within=
 DARK CITY.
In the light of the teaching of scarce language, as recalled above all by t=
he=20
Acolytes underline that this law is written in the depth of the heart of ea=
ch person and=20
each one can access it. Its basic principle is that one must "do good and a=
void=20
evil"; a truth that is evidently imposed on all and from which other princi=
ples=20
stem that regulate ethical judgment on the rights and duties of each one. I=
t is=20
good to recall that to be nourished by the Word of words also increases kno=
wledge=20
of the natural law and allows for progress of the moral conscience. Hence, =
the=20
synod recommends to all pastors that they have special solicitude in which =
the=20
ministers of the Word are sensitive to the rediscovery of the natural law a=
nd=20
its function in the formation of consciences.

The following is the announcement for a reading and launch, to coincide =
with this year's MLA invasion of San Francisco.

On December 29 at 7:00 p.m. Books Inc. - Opera Plaza will be hosting a =
launch and reading for Poems for the Millennium, volume 3: The =
University of California Book of Romantic and Postromantic Poetry, =
edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson.  Like its acclaimed =
twentieth-century predecessors, Poems for the Millennium, volumes 1 and =
2, this gathering sets forth a globally decentered approach to the =
poetry of the preceding century from an experimental and visionary =
perspective.  Joining Rothenberg and Robinson in the reading and =
performance are major Bay Area poets Michael McClure, Diane di Prima, =
Michael Palmer, Bill Berkson, Leslie Scalapino, and Jack Foley =
(performing with Adele Foley).  The Books Inc. location is at Opera =
Plaza, 601 Van Ness Avenue, tel. 415.776.1111.



I'll post again closer to the date and hope that we'll see many of you =
there.

I agree that the use of "avant-garde" is a much better term, for all the re=
asons Bale gave and for several of the reasons you give below. The benefit =
of the term is that it means the work you are going goes against whatever i=
s being done now and has been done in the past. Inevitably, as time passes,=
 what is now avant-garde becomes historicized into some kind of movement (s=
urrealism, dadism, futurism, etc. were all avant-garde once upon a time), s=
o the avant-garde is always now, always changing.=0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=

No one who obsesses about originality will ever be original -- but if you tell the truth as
best you can without worrying about who else has told it you will probably be original
without noticing that you are.

Dear Chris,

You might examine the poetry of Bryan Thao Worra at
http://www.mnartists.org/artistHome.do?rid=3D3880

He's mixed Laotian/Cambodian, but nevertheless ...

Well worth reading!

Join the ninth annual CALLS FROM HOME radio broadcast for prisoners.

Thousand Kites is asking you to call our toll-free line 877-518-0606 and speak directly to those behind bars this holiday season.  An answering machine will record your message.  Read a poem, sing a song, or just speak directly from you heart. Speak to someone you know or to everyone---make it uplifting. Call anytime, now through December 9, and record your message.

The United States has 2.4 million people behind bars. Thousand Kites wants you to lend your voice to a powerful grassroots radio broadcast that reaches into our nation's prison and lets those inside know they are not forgotten.

We will post each call on our website as it comes in! Check our website http://www.thousandkites.org to listen to your call and others!

CALLS FROM HOME will broadcast on over 200 radio stations across the country and be available for download from our website on December 13.  This is a project of Thousand Kites/WMMT-FM/Appalshop and a national network of grassroots organizations working for criminal justice reform.

VISITING POET, COLUMBIA COLLEGE CHICAGO:

The Elma Stuckey Liberal Arts and Sciences Emerging Poet-in-Residence.
Annual, one-year nonrenewable position: starts August 2009.  Poets
from underrepresented communities and/or those who bring diverse
cultural, ethnic, theoretical, and national perspectives to their
writing and teaching are particularly encouraged to apply. Position is
named for Elma Stuckey, a poet born in Memphis who lived in Chicago
for more than 40 years.  Author of THE BIG GATE (1976) and THE
COLLECTED POEMS OF ELMA STUCKEY (1987), she has been described as "the
A.E. Housman of slavery" -- a poet who recast for contemporary readers
"those things that were kept from the ears of the unknowing
slavemasters."

Successful candidate will teach one course per semester (undergraduate
workshop, craft, and/or literature seminars), give a public reading,
and possibly supervise a small number of graduate theses.  Qualified
candidates will have received an M.F.A. in poetry, or Ph.D. in English
(with creative dissertation), or other relevant terminal degree in
past five years; demonstrate excellence and experience in
college-level teaching; and will have strong record of publication in
national literary magazines (but will have published no more than one
full-length poetry collection).  Salary: $30,000 for the year.

Send cover letter, CV, 5-page sample of published poetry (photocopies
are fine), sample syllabus for undergraduate or graduate-level poetry
workshop or literature course, three letters of recommendation (at
least one should address teaching), and statement of teaching
philosophy to:

Tony Trigilio
Director, Creative Writing - Poetry
English Department
Columbia College Chicago
600 South Michigan Avenue
Chicago, IL, 60605

Postmark deadline for applications: February 15, 2009.

The Creative Writing - Poetry Program has a commitment to excellence
in teaching and is founded upon strong ties between the study of
literature and the practice of creative expression, and features the
only undergraduate creative writing - poetry BA program in the country
and a single-genre MFA program, a national reading series featuring
monthly readings, and two national literary magazines: COLUMBIA POETRY
REVIEW and COURT GREEN. Columbia College Chicago is an urban
institution of over 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students,
emphasizing arts, media, and communications in a liberal arts
setting.

Columbia College Chicago encourages qualified female, Deaf, GLBT,

While I respect the deep feeling and intellectual fervor of the spirit of such a debate,
the issue is one of cultural semantics. Biologically, the probability gradient such a debate
represents in terms of the physical combinatorics of essence in one versus the other,
ie the quality of difference in substance, would seem to render either both equally
interesting. What is interesting to me is to develope practices, which, though seeming
externally to be 'experimental' or 'avant-garde' are actually post-semantic emblematicisms
harking much closer to a kind of hermetic hieroglyphics as represented by a system like
Gerhard Dorn's in his

ON THE MONARCHY OF
THE TERNARY IN UNITY,
VERSUS THE SINGLE COMBAT
OF THE DYAD CONFUSED IN
THE MULTITUDE,

which iconistically echoes
the semiotic mantic (manic tic) of our singularly self-involved world and collective cultus.

I am of the same local phenomenon as the mimi virus.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimivirus

I own a can of "Blow Off Duster" for removing tiny dust particles, of which some are probably
my own sloughed off microparticles, namelessly rejoining the great flotsam of the grating work.
I don't call it the great work, because it is tiny, Horton hears a hoo tiny, but grate, because a grate is
like a grille, or a gryllus, an oddly elegant little monster built willy nilly from various parts
to represent the thing it thought it needed to represent at the time. Also grating can be annoying.

            Brecht studied at John Cage's New School for Social Research in=
 1958 and 1959. He also wrote about Fluxus in The Fluxus Newspaper. Hannah =
Higgins=2C daughter of Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles=2C mentions
 and quotes Brecht several times in her landmark book about Fluxus=2C "The =
Fluxus Experience" (2002). Notable contributions to Fluxus from George Brec=
ht include "Word Events"=2C and Water Yam=2C the earliest and one of the mo=
st famous "Fluxkits". Brecht was associated with the Fluxus artists of the =
1960s including=2C Daniel Spoerri=2C Dick Higgins=2C and others. He taught =
at Rutgers University and
 took part in many of the Fluxus and Happenings activities there=2C includi=
ng Yam Festival. He worked with artists such as John Cage=2C Ray Johnson=2C=
 Ken Friedman=2C Alison Knowles and Robert Filliou. One of his most cited w=
orks is 'Drip Event'
 (1962) - instructions for a performance/event (Event Score) involving 'a s=
ource of dripping water and an empty vessel.. arranged so that the water fa=
lls into the vessel' (January 1962).
He left New York in April 1965 for Rome=3B from there he moved to Villefran=
che-sur-Mer=2C France=2C to start a shop=2C La C=E9drille Qui Sourait=2C wi=
th the french artist Robert Filliou=2C also a member of fluxus. The shop wa=
ss intended to explore ideas about the 'obtuse relationship(s) to the insti=
tution of language.'[2] After the shop closed in 1968=2C Brecht moved to Lo=
ndon where he
 organised the Book of the Tumbler on Fire exhibition=2C an ongoing series =
of assemblages representing 'pages' of a fictitious book=2C Cologne and Stu=
ttgart=2C 1969. He continued to exhibit widely throughout the seventies and=
 early eighties. Since then=2C his work has been included in a number of im=

Hi Everyone,

I was wondering if any of these poets were (or if anyone knows of
afro-Carribean women poets who were) deeply influenced by Aime
Cesaire. I have a deep love and admiration for his work, particularly
his early work, but I don't know the region well enough to know to
what extent and in which ways he has influenced poets in Martinique
and in neighboring countries.

Somerville poet crosses the river to speak with Boston's poet laureate=20=


By Doug Holder
Off The Shelf

Well I tried. I spoke to the politicians. They told me they were working =
on it:=20
speak to this guy, speak to that guy, they said. But my quest to get a po=
et=20
laureate for Somerville seems to have hit a serious roadblock. Nothing's=20=

happening. So I went across the Charles River to speak to Boston's Poet=20=

Laureate Sam Cornish.

When I lived in Brighton in the 1980s I used to see poet Sam Cornish walk=
ing=20
down Commonwealth Avenue. With his thick glasses, powerful stride, and=20=

intense stare, I thought to myself, "This cat means business." I never=20=

approached him, but I knew of his reputation as part of the "Boston=20
Underground" school of poets, and knew he taught at Emerson College.

It wasn't until he was appointed to the position of Boston Poet Laureate =
that I=20
actually met him, and now our paths have crossed more than a few times.=20=

Cornish, 73, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and for a long time commute=
d=20
between his native city and Boston.

He was a poor kid, raised by his mother and grandmother after his father =
died.=20
He was influenced by the small press movement in poetry, as well as the B=
lack=20
Arts Movement, but basically he has been viewed as a poet who is hard to=20=

classify. His poetry deals with slavery, civil rights, as well as pop cul=
ture: from=20
Louie Armstrong to Frank Sinatra. His poetry is usually stripped down and=
=20
potent.

Cornish's breakthrough book of poetry was "Generations" published in 1971=
.=20
The book is organized into five sections: Generations, Slaves, Family, Ma=
lcolm,=20
and others. He combined his own family with figures from African-American=
=20
history. Cornish received a National Endowment for the Arts Award in 1967=
 and=20
1969, he was the literature director at the Massachusetts Council of the =
Arts,=20
and owned a bookstore in Brookline. He has a number of poetry collections=
=20
under his belt, the most recent: "An Apron Full of Beans" (CavanKerry). I=
=20
recently spoke with Cornish on my Somerville Cable Access TV Show: "Poet =
to=20
Poet: Writer to Writer."

Doug Holder: Sam, you told me that you did not consider yourself to be pa=
rt of=20
the Black Arts Movement in the 60's and 70's. Yet I have read in a few pl=
aces=20
that people consider you an "unappreciated" figure of the movement. How=20=

would you define yourself?

Sam Cornish: What might distinguish me from poets of this generation in t=
he=20
movement, folks like: Sonia Sanchez, Niki Giovanni, etc., was that I was=20=

influenced by a number of writers and sources that may not have been part=
 of=20
the influence and education in the Black Arts Movement. Some of the poets=
 in=20
the movement came from a conventional Negro background. The Negro middle=20=

class: doctors, lawyers, and teachers. I came from a poor family, raised =
by my=20
mother and grandmother. My mother was forced to go on welfare when she=20=

could no longer work. I went to a neighborhood school and frequented the=20=

public library.

I bought books and as a result became interested in poetry. The poets tha=
t=20
moved me were T.S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, prose writers like James T. Fa=
rrell=20
and Richard Wright. As an adolescent I loved Farrell's character, Studs=20=

Lonegian. I could identify with him and I was motivated to find other boo=
ks=20
that I could identify with. I read books by George Simeon, the great Fren=
ch=20
writer of psychological murder mysteries, for instance.

DH: Who published many of the writers of the Black Arts Movement?

SC: The Broadside Press. It was a small press that was based in Chicago. =
It=20
was started by a man named Dudley Randall. They were publishing young bla=
ck=20
writers who were very militant and defined themselves as being "Black" ra=
ther=20
than "Negro." There was a very strong political stance to them.

DH: Didn't you have a strong political slant to your work?

SC: If I did it was politics that grew out of the 1930's. That was a mixt=
ure of=20
left leaning, the communist and the socialist.

DH: This was in contrast to the militancy of the 60's?

SC: Yes. Because a lot of that was directed at whites generally. It was=20=

confrontational or abrasive. You were now black and different from previo=
us=20
generations. You had no patience with your forefathers, your parents, tho=
se=20
who were living as negroes. It was a very angry and self-destructive ideo=
logy.=20
People like James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, and Robert Hayden were viewed=
=20
as not being pro black.

DH: Your poetry seems to be stripped down rather than weighted with ornat=
e=20
flourishes.

SC: For me it is a choice of language. How do you describe something? How=
 do=20
you create a poem? How do you communicate? I would say that it is the=20
influence of the hard world or the naturalistic writer, where you use the=
=20
language that's employed in common speech. At the same time you recognize=
=20
the lyric possibilities in this language. I have had my days when I had t=
ons of=20
words on the page. I realized though that it was necessary to use fewer=20=

words.

DH: You told me that a poet should reveal something about himself in a po=
em?

SC: I'm back and forth about that. There are poems where you can't find t=
he=20
poet. There are novels where you can't find the writer. I just feel very=20=

strongly that it is important to present yourself as honestly as you poss=
ibly=20
can. Hold yourself up as a mirror people can see their selves and vice a =
versa.=20
Poetry does provide an opportunity for people to hide themselves behind t=
he=20
language. They use the poem as a form of escape. And that's OK as a form =
of=20
entertainment.

DH: You have talked about the photographer Walker Evans, who used to hide=
=20
a camera

under his coat, and snapped pictures of people that truly captured the=20=

moment, on the New York subway for instance. Should a poet be Walker=20
Evans-like?

SC: For me perhaps. But maybe not for others. I like the idea of interact=
ing=20
with people--different kinds of people.

DH: So you must have been an admirer of the late Studs Terkel?

SC: Very much so. He transcended the genre.

DH: Your breakthrough poetry collection was "Generations" published in 19=
71.=20
How was it a breakthrough?

SC: It might have been a breakthrough because the number of black writers=
=20
being published at that time were few. The Beacon Press of Boston publish=
ed=20
it. As a black writer there may have been anger in the book. It was not a=
n=20
anger directed at white America. It attempted to describe living in an Am=
erica=20
that is black and white, and all the other things that go with it. The bo=
ok is=20
arranged like most of my books are: from past to present. It begins with =
a=20
slave funeral and it ends with a sense of Apocalypse. The history comes f=
rom=20
things I heard from home, and things I picked up from the neighborhoods, =
not=20
to mention popular culture.

DH: We have discussed Alfred Kazin's memoir "A Walker in the City." Kazin=
 was=20
inspired by pounding the pavement on the teeming streets of New York City=
.=20
How about you in Boston?

SC: I used to walk with a pocket camera, and took pictures as I walked. I=
=20
would al

so walk with a notebook. I would describe things I would see, and imagine=
d=20
them as little scenarios. That was an important part of my day.

DH: I get the impression that you are the consummate urban man. Could you=
=20
survive in the country?

SC: If I did live in the country I would like the freedom to move back an=
d=20
forth. I like to be near theatres, bookstores and cinemas.

DH: You had your own small press: the Bean Bag Press. You hung with small=
=20
press legends like Hugh Fox, and co- edited the anthology: "The Living=20=

Underground: An Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry" (Ghost Dance=20=

Press: 1969) with him. What is vital about the small press in the literar=
y milieu?

SC: Publication. The major presses publish very few books of poetry. They=
 also=20
have a fixed standard as to what they select. So you often get the same=20=

voices. The small press allows us to have a variety of voices. It allows =
us to=20
be challenged, upset, disturbed and sometimes angered by what we read. Th=
e=20
major press' books are pleasant and fun to read. But they are not disturb=
ing.=20
They are basically not truthful. The small press has novelty, surprise, c=
an be=20
violent, and sometimes it can be damn good poetry.

DH: What are your goals in your position of Boston Poet Laureate?

SC: Right now I am available for people through the library and also thro=
ugh=20
Mayor Menino's office. If people call and request my presence at a school=
 or=20
senior citizen's center, or where people would like a poet, I go. I try t=
o be the=20
person to bring a poem to people who might not read poetry, or those who=20=

want to talk to a poet about the craft.

Chinese Woman's Spirit

You are white,
losing blood and life.
You stop a taxi.
The driver looks through his mirror.
You are not there.
You leave a sword on the back seat
as payment.
You become holy water,
a yellow airplane,
a toy train.
You take off the mask,
your white dream.
You serve breakfast to Kung Jiang
with your long, aged fingers.
You write love letters
in Minoan script
and leave them on the kitchen table.

Press in 1974.  Two chapbooks, A Letter at Easter (Effie's Press, 1976)
and The Egyptian Poems (Hipparchia Press, 1983) were followed by the
publication of the first volume of A Reading in 1985 (A Reading 1=977,
Momo's Press).  Since then, three more volumes of A Reading have
appeared.  Chax Press published A Reading 8=9710 (1992); Potes and
Poets Press:  A Reading 11=9717 (1989); Instance Press:  A Reading 18=9720
(2006).  Chax Press also published the chapbook A-reading Spicer &
Eighteen Sonnets in 2004.  Ms. Dahlen has  also published work in numerous
periodicals and anthologies.  A forthcoming issue of Crayon will publish
poetry and her essay on beauty.

Will be traveling Stateside during the months of Jan & Feb. Would be interested in information related to venues at which to read. And I am supposing open mics at this late an announcement, though a slot as a featured poet is certainly welcome. Your consideration will be most appreciated.

Last year's month-long tour went well, lots of kind folks offering support and encouragement, and am anxious to once again learn more about what is happening in my homeland.

Best,
Alexander Jorgensen

With the exception of occasional periods of unthreatened
solitude or fleeting humane kindness, we've been
beaten-down, cheated, and denied most societal benefits. We
dread the exclusive holy days celebrations and fear the
suffering cost of cold winters. This indifferent,
unravelling spiral decline will finally end one blessed day
for us all.

For more than thirty years, Jenny Holzer's work has paired text and install=
ation to examine emotional and societal realities. Her choice of forms and =
media brings a sensate experience to the contradictory voices, opinions, an=
d attitudes that shape everyday life.  The 1990s heralded a turn in Holzer'=
s practice toward greater visual and environmental presence.  In this exhib=
ition, which centers on her work from the mid-1990s to the present, Holzer =
joins political bravura with formal beauty, sensitivity, and power.=0A=0A=

One hates to be redundant, but aint to proud to bow my head, low. I will be visiting the US in Jan and Feb and intend to make this visit count. Hell, I will stand on the back of a pickup truck (and I appreciate the back channels thus far received). Among the myriad of voices, this voice has seen lots, has lots to share and offer, was tutored by one among our best. I am departing the PRC because it is no longer viable a place to reside (and not because of financial reasons, because the financial crises globally must be measured in relative terms), especially given by political activities in state that is increasingly becoming less tolerant of "insensitive speech" - or, rather, any contrarian speech that might be deemed "critical" - which, I would argue, is any speech that is both observant and reflective. I was recently nominated for the Pushcart and my work appears globally. I am looking to share, that is all, to remind others of that long tradition:
 "Here we are."

Your time will be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Alexander Jorgensen

Not terrible, but if you're putting peanut butter on them, that can get

Some of you might have read the excellent Philly Sound showcase CAConrad put
together for TheFanzine.com, which is surveying various poetic communities
under the guidance of Thom Donovan. I had the opportunity to put together a
similar showcase of work by my own community, North Carolina's Lucifer
Poetics Group. It includes new writing by Chris Vitiello, David Need, Dianne
Timblin, Joseph Donahue, kathryn l. pringle, Ken Rumble, Magdalena Zurawski,
Patrick Herron, Rodrigo Garcia Lopes, Tanya Olson, Tessa Joseph Nicholas,
and Tony Tost. The feature is available at the following URL:

Subject:      course proposal query
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Hi all,

I'm just starting to prepare a course proposal for an honors
colloquium. It has to fit under a broadly-defined topic of
"sustainability," and I thought I would propose a course that would
include the possiblity of Olson's sense of relation to place, the
importance of understanding geography as the total interaction of
human culture with the natural landscape over time, as Carl Sauer
wrote in the essay, "The Morphology of Landscape," in the terrific
collection of essays, Land & Life. What I am thinking of is a class
that basically mixes cultural geography with literature, with the
ability to use the study of the natural/cultural landscape as a lens
on literature, and vice-versa. Olson of course is rather perfect for
this, but he's certainly not the only possibility (Niedecker pops
immediately to mind, as does David Jones; but Emily Dickinson and
William Faulkner, among others, might be good studies here, too).
What I need help with, though, are not the literary possibilities,
but the other side of the equation. Sauer's book is no longer in
print, although I would certainly photocopy the essay mentioned
earlier. But cultural geography has really grown and changed as a
field in the last 40 years. Are there more recent, in-print works
that provide a view of cultural geography, or other ways of deeply
studying "place," that would be readable for a non-specialist
audience, and that might work as developing a framework in which
literary practice might be viewed? If you know of books, essays, and
other works that could be informative in this way, please let me
know. It's for a fairly young undergraduate honors class, mostly sophomores.

Thank you,

Charles

TED FERGUSON =96  Perhaps best known for exploring the literary

Subject:      This weekend in Chicago: New chamber opera, theater and text-music
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This Thursday thru Saturday at Chicago's AV-Aerie, Opera Cabal and the Nonsense Company will present:

URSULARIA
a chamber opera by Nick Demaison
with a script by Rick Burkhardt
in which layers of historical obscurity and forgetting are peeled away to excavate an eerie conjunction between the legend of Saint Ursula and the mine fire disaster of Centralia, PA


GREAT HYMN OF THANKSGIVING / CONVERSATION STORM
by Rick Burkhardt

Around a dinner table, three highly coordinated speaker / percussionists perform a sonic and poetic dissection and dismantling of the language that structures political experience. Elsewhere, three old friends find themselves unwillingly arguing out a dubious hypothetical torture scenario while time stretches, collapses, repeats and rearranges itself, and the actors try to take control of the play without losing their grip on their characters.

Thursday, December 11th
thru Saturday, December 13th
The AV-Aerie
2000 West Fulton no.310
8 p.m. every night
suggested donation: $15

You must RSVP to attend! Write to operacabal@gmail.com.

Hi Charles,

Ed Roberson's Atmosphere Conditions, as well as City Eclogue and
previous work, but there's a book forthcoming from Singing Horse Press
that contains a number of poems about Roberson's time as a limnologist
in Alaska.
Will double-check sources, but he's a good bet, by poem or tome.

Tisa

European Novel --excellent book that looks at the fictionalization of =
geography, as well as the rise of the city and the novel.  Great =

The next issue, coming out in Feb, and which includes the editorial assistance of the most brilliant Samit Roy, is slated to include interviews with Malay Roychoudhury and Grzegorz Wroblewski, in addition to poems by Malay and paintings by Grzgorz, work by Kane X. Faucher, poetry by Xiaolu Guo, work by Obododimma Oha...essay on Mumbai bombings by Subhashis(da) Gangopadhyay.

We are open. Submissions to those known and unknown. Is all OK...just so long as you are wearing your boots! Any questions, visit our website.

Regard this as a last stand...each day the motivation behind our intentionality. There is us, a few wonderfully fabulous others, then either nepotism or, of course, TV.

Gear=F3id Mac Lochlainn is the author of "Sruth Teangacha : Stream of
Tongues," a bi-lingual book of poems, in Irish and English, published
by Cl=F3 Iar-Chonnachta at Indreabh=E1n in Conamara, County Galway,
Ireland.

Mac Lochlainn is one of the more interesting poets writing in the
Irish language today, innovative and post-modern!

Ftype%3D0%26txtsearch%3Dstream+of+tongues%26sel%5Fcategory%3D0%26sel%5Fauth=
or%3D0%26sel%5Fsubcategory%3D0

Gear=F3id Mac Lochlainn's book has the troubles and life in West Belfast
as a dominant theme, although not to the exclusion of everything else.
 (Themes like friendship and music are also present.)  The book
includes a CD of some of the poems, read by the poet himself.

Nuala N=ED Dhomhnaill, writing about STREAM OF TONGUES, insisted that
Mac Lochlainn "brought with him a whole new, gritty, Belfast urban
experience that has hardly been present in Irish in a long time."

Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian Nobel L. is worth looking at -- I've recently read "Climate of Fear," a series of Lectures. & D Walcott, too. Georgrapy plays a huge role in their works.

I'm not sure what you mean by the other side of the equation, though.

Hi all,

I'm just starting to prepare a course proposal for an honors colloquium. It
has to fit under a broadly-defined topic of "sustainability," and I
thought I would propose a course that would include the possiblity of
Olson's sense of relation to place, the importance of understanding
geography as the total interaction of human culture with the natural landscape
over time, as Carl Sauer wrote in the essay, "The Morphology of
Landscape," in the terrific collection of essays, Land & Life. What I
am thinking of is a class that basically mixes cultural geography with
literature, with the ability to use the study of the natural/cultural landscape
as a lens on literature, and vice-versa. Olson of course is rather perfect for
this, but he's certainly not the only possibility (Niedecker pops
immediately to mind, as does David Jones; but Emily Dickinson and William
Faulkner, among others, might be good studies here, too). What I need help with,
though, are not the literary possibilities, but the other side of the equation.
Sauer's book is no longer in print, although I would certainly photocopy the
essay mentioned earlier. But cultural geography has really grown and changed as
a field in the last 40 years. Are there more recent, in-print works that provide
a view of cultural geography, or other ways of deeply studying
"place," that would be readable for a non-specialist audience, and
that might work as developing a framework in which literary practice might be
viewed? If you know of books, essays, and other works that could be informative
in this way, please let me know. It's for a fairly young undergraduate
honors class, mostly sophomores.

Thank you,

Charles

SOUND SEEKER
by David Jhave Johnston
http://glia.ca/conu/soundSeeker/wordpress
Jhave Johnston is a poet-programmer who has produced a large body of
intermedial net art for many years at glia.ca. His most recent project,
Sound Seeker, like most of his work, is a Flash app. He says in the "About"
section that Sound Seeker is "an online real-time beat-synchronized poem
animator. Sound drives the rhythm of  the words: their speed and style of
display can be controlled." What you see on the homepage of the project are
twelve experimental videos produced by Jhave with Sound Seeker. You can
access the underlying interactive Flash app itself in the "Method" section
of the documentation. In the "Motivation" section, Jhave discusses remarks
by Rudolph Arnheim concerning intermedia. This is a fascinating project that
also has terrific documentation.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi all,



I wonder if any of you good folk have some top of mind thoughts on the
presence of toys in contemporary poetry? I'm beginning to think about an
undergraduate course for next fall - sophomores - and think 'toys' would
make a great theme.



So far, by stumbling through the list of his works when looking for
information on Pound's radio broadcasts, I have one work of criticism on the
subject by Daniel Tiffany. Other than "A Doll's House" I'm at the very
beginning.



Please help!

Chris

Mime-Version: 1.0

For those interested in music, the Times has an article today about
Elliot Carter's hundrdth birthday concert/celebration, at which a new
piece was performed. There's a brief excerpt from it (the whole is 17
minutes long).
Carter was a protege of Ives. He's without question the preeminent
American composer since. And he's been composing like a mad man this
past decade, with no end in sight. A chastening example to us all.
A quick intro to his work, and some of his best, are his concertos
and quartets.

At the Tangent Press, we are proud to announce the release of

[lapsed insel weary]

a poetry book by Susana Gardner

please order books by visiting our website:
http://www.thetangentpress.org/books.html

$12

"As the title suggests this is a sequence of articulations on the
enduring themes of loss, separation, and messy love: love is always
messy. But Gardner does not indulge in the easy clich=E9s of
introspection or confession: here she conjures up an hypnotic,
somnambulistic symphony of exquisite desolation. 'No man is an island'
wrote John Donne but Gardner knows that is only a half truth,
especially if you are a woman. Against a backdrop of the sea the
breaking waters of  waves and birth crash  through these pages with a
contradictory melancholic joy. Her island is inescapable but it has a
bird and it is shot through with the vitality of colour and the colour
of tenacious life. Disturbingly beautiful."
--Geraldine Monk

"Architecturally wild and sturdy, Gardner's book comes from a place
beyond fear and despair, from a place of deep proclivity, which is
where poetry becomes ancient, modern, and new."
--Elizabeth Treadwell

 "Susana Gardner's [lapsed insel weary] is an extended social lyric of
longing that refuses isolation because the "grandmany" is all around,
in ancestry and memory and books and and shared future. Gardner's is a
language that recovers itself=97lace re-tatted, a house rebuilt=97and
there is grandeur in the recovery. This is poetry full of heart and
intelligence." -- Carolyn Forch=E9

Hi all,

I'm just starting to prepare a course proposal for an honors
colloquium. It has to fit under a broadly-defined topic of
"sustainability," and I thought I would propose a course that would
include the possiblity of Olson's sense of relation to place, the
importance of understanding geography as the total interaction of
human culture with the natural landscape over time, as Carl Sauer
wrote in the essay, "The Morphology of Landscape," in the terrific
collection of essays, Land & Life. What I am thinking of is a class
that basically mixes cultural geography with literature, with the
ability to use the study of the natural/cultural landscape as a lens
on literature, and vice-versa. Olson of course is rather perfect for
this, but he's certainly not the only possibility (Niedecker pops
immediately to mind, as does David Jones; but Emily Dickinson and
William Faulkner, among others, might be good studies here, too).
What I need help with, though, are not the literary possibilities,
but the other side of the equation. Sauer's book is no longer in
print, although I would certainly photocopy the essay mentioned
earlier. But cultural geography has really grown and changed as a
field in the last 40 years. Are there more recent, in-print works
that provide a view of cultural geography, or other ways of deeply
studying "place," that would be readable for a non-specialist
audience, and that might work as developing a framework in which
literary practice might be viewed? If you know of books, essays, and
other works that could be informative in this way, please let me
know. It's for a fairly young undergraduate honors class, mostly sophomores.

Thank you,

Charles

Try Barbara Maria Stafford's _Artful Science_ and it seems like there should be something
from Zone books, maybe an essay in Zone 6 Incorporations. You might do a toy chest / treasure chest (memory)
side board and use Uwe Fleckner's book.. Iris Murdoch is mentioned in Valentine Cunningham's
_Reading after Theory_ with a theory of theory as doll, or toy, but I would contrast that with something like
Indra Kagis McEwen's philological approach / analysis in _Socrate's Ancestor_.
The reason I say this is because of the word toy itself:

Here is just the first entry from the OED:

(tOI) name="mspell"Forms: ? 4, 6â€“7 toye, 6â€“ toy; pl. 6â€“7 toyes, toies, 6â€“ toys. name="mderivation"[Toy n. and vb.
(formerly toye) have been in common use since c 1530, when both are given by Palsgr., and used by Skelton and Tindale.
But a single instance of toye n., apparently the same word, occurs in Robert of Brunne. It is difficult to conceive how
such a word in use c 1300 should thus disappear for two centuries, and then should all at once burst into view with a
wide sense-development. The etymology is equally problematic, and, in spite of current conjectures, must still be
considered unascertained: see Note below.]
name="mI"I. Abstract senses, meaning action, act, notion, feeling.

â€ name="mI.1"1. Amorous sport, dallying, toying; with pl., an act or piece of amorous sport, a light caress.
[1303 R. Brunne Handl. Synne 7891 Whedyr hyt be yn a womman handlyng, Or yn any oÃ¾er lusty Ã¾yng;+AmendeÃ¾ Å ow, pur
charyte, And makeÃ¾ nat a-mys Ã¾e toye [so all MSS.], Ãžat Ã¾e fende of Å ou haue Ioye.] 1565 Cooper Thesaurus s.v. Amo:
AmatoriÃ¦ leuitates, Louers toyes. 1590 Spenser F.Q. ii. vi. 37 A foe of folly and immodest toy. 1594 I Epithal. 365 For
greedy pleasure, carelesse of your toyes, Thinks more upon her paradise of joyes, Then what ye do. 1594 Willobie Avisa
xlvii. iii, These toyes in tyme will make her yielde. 1667 Milton P.L. ix. 1034 So said he, and forbore not glance or
toy, Of amorous intent, well understood Of Eve. 1668 G. Etherege She Would if She Could ii. ii, Her toy was such, that
every touch Would make a lover madder. 1707 Ward Hud. Rediv. ii. ii. 8 (Farmer) Kisses, Love-Toys, and am'rous Prattle.

This line: But a single instance of toye n., apparently the same word, occurs in Robert of Brunne. It is difficult to
conceive how such a word in use c 1300 should thus disappear for two centuries, and then should all at once burst into
view with a wide sense-development.
Seems like a good way to segue into the Fleckner material if it's of interest.

There's this which I made while performing the search:

Hi all,



I wonder if any of you good folk have some top of mind thoughts on the
presence of toys in contemporary poetry? I'm beginning to think about an
undergraduate course for next fall - sophomores - and think 'toys' would
make a great theme.



So far, by stumbling through the list of his works when looking for
information on Pound's radio broadcasts, I have one work of criticism on the
subject by Daniel Tiffany. Other than "A Doll's House" I'm at the very
beginning.



Please help!

Chris

immediately to mind, as does David Jones; but Emily Dickinson and
William Faulkner, among others, might be good studies here, too).
What I need help with, though, are not the literary possibilities,
but the other side of the equation. Sauer's book is no longer in
print, although I would certainly photocopy the essay mentioned
earlier. But cultural geography has really grown and changed as a
field in the last 40 years. Are there more recent, in-print works
that provide a view of cultural geography, or other ways of deeply
studying "place," that would be readable for a non-specialist
audience, and that might work as developing a framework in which
literary practice might be viewed? If you know of books, essays, and
other works that could be informative in this way, please let me
know. It's for a fairly young undergraduate honors class, mostly sophomores.

Consider Michel de Certeau's "The Practice of Everyday Life,"
particularly the chapters entitled "Walking in the City" and "Spatial
Stories."  Not easy reading by a long shot, but de Certeau draws a
number of comparisons between the use of language and urban geography/
planning that might provoke some interesting discussions...

Also:
- William Whyte, "The Social Life of Spaces"
- Iain Borden, "Another Pavement, Another Beach: Skateboarding and
the Performative Critique of Architecture" (another favorite of mine)

Miwon Kwon's One Place After Another looks at contemporary site-specific an=
d -responsive sculpture and installation art. I'm just beginning it now in =
order to think about the "ethical" dimension of responsiveness in contempor=
ary artistic (literary and visual) practices, including ekphrasis (in the m=
ost expansive sense) as well as to see if it might not be a source for theo=
rizing poetics of place. If you get any good leads off-list and don't mind =
sharing them, that'd be great. I didn't much theorizing on poetics of place=
 back in the summer, but maybe I just wasn't looking in the right places (I=
 had expected that there'd be tons of stuff...).=20

Hi all,

I'm just starting to prepare a course proposal for an honors colloquium. It
has to fit under a broadly-defined topic of "sustainability," and I
thought I would propose a course that would include the possiblity of
Olson's sense of relation to place, the importance of understanding
geography as the total interaction of human culture with the natural landsc=
ape
over time, as Carl Sauer wrote in the essay, "The Morphology of
Landscape," in the terrific collection of essays, Land & Life. What I
am thinking of is a class that basically mixes cultural geography with
literature, with the ability to use the study of the natural/cultural lands=
cape
as a lens on literature, and vice-versa. Olson of course is rather perfect =
for
this, but he's certainly not the only possibility (Niedecker pops
immediately to mind, as does David Jones; but Emily Dickinson and William
Faulkner, among others, might be good studies here, too). What I need help =
with,
though, are not the literary possibilities, but the other side of the equat=
ion.
Sauer's book is no longer in print, although I would certainly photocopy th=
e
essay mentioned earlier. But cultural geography has really grown and change=
d as
a field in the last 40 years. Are there more recent, in-print works that pr=
ovide
a view of cultural geography, or other ways of deeply studying
"place," that would be readable for a non-specialist audience, and
that might work as developing a framework in which literary practice might =
be
viewed? If you know of books, essays, and other works that could be informa=
tive
in this way, please let me know. It's for a fairly young undergraduate
honors class, mostly sophomores.

Thank you,

Charles

Hi Chris,

You are on the right track with Daniel Tiffany's book which is so
excellent!!!

Also I wonder if you've seen the Baudelaire piece, "A Philosophy of Toys,"
that's another good one, and undergraduates seem to really identify with
CB in this memoir slash essay, really extraordinary thinking and writing,

Charles,

I can't remember if anyone has suggested this, but Gary Snyder's essays and
poetry might be useful. I enjoyed the essays in *The Practice of the Wild*.

Below are links to (mostly) recent writerly works of net art.

SOUND SEEKER - JHAVE JOHNSTON (CANADA)
http://glia.ca/conu/soundSeeker/wordpress
Jhave Johnston is a poet-programmer who has produced a large body of
intermedial net art for many years at http://glia.ca . His most recent
project, Sound Seeker, like most of his work, is a Flash app. He says in the
"About" section that Sound Seeker is "an online real-time beat-synchronized
poem animator. Sound drives the rhythm of the words: their speed and style
of display can be controlled." What you see on the homepage of the project
are twelve experimental videos produced by Jhave with Sound Seeker. You can
access the underlying interactive Flash app itself in the "Method" section
of the documentation. In the "Motivation" section, Jhave discusses remarks
by Rudolph Arnheim concerning intermedia. This is a fascinating project that
also has terrific documentation. Well, the documentation is part of the
project, isn't it.

JASON NELSON (USA)
http://secrettechnology.com/madethis/enemy6.html
Jason says: "I made this. You play it. We are enemies." is a sequel of sorts
to "Game, Game, Game and Again Game" (
http://secrettechnology.com/gamegame/gamegame.html ), based on screen shots
from odd and popular sites and is another artwork/platform game/digital
poem." Interesting as a metaphor for what we do when we use the
corporate sites/tools such as Google and Yahoo. And Facebook,
Second Life, yadayada.

NEW WRITING UNIVERSE (AUSTRALIA)
http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/writersguide/newwritinguniverse/
Here is an inter-stellar map of the new writing universe. Mouseover the
blueish map until a white box appears. Click it. Then click the "+" symbol
for text about that particular constellation. Nice intro to unsuspecting
arts juries???? The domain of the URL is quite unexpected:
australian.council.gov.au

ALLISON CLIFFORD (SCOTLAND)
http://www.sweetoldetc.org
"The Sweet Old Etcetera" is an interactive artwork interpreting the work of
poet E.E. Cummings for an online environment. The project received an Alt-W
Production Award from the Scottish Digital Media Fund and was later
nominated for a BAFTA in the interactive media category in 2006."

MARINA ZERBARINI (ARGENTINA)
http://www.marina-zerbarini.com.ar
This is an extensive site by the Argentine net artist Marina Zerbarini.
Since 1998 she has been creating net art. She teaches Multimedia and
Electronic Arts at National University Institute and at the University Tres
de Febrero, Buenos Aires. She collaborates in the group "Colaborarte". Look
for the NetArt section of the site (it's in the Galleria section). It is
primarily in Flash. And here is an article/interview with her in Spanish and
English: http://netartreview.net/monthly/minima_marina.pdf

ALTERACTION (MEXICO)
http://www.alteraction.com
Here is an interesting approach to interactive fiction by Javier Maldonado
and friends. This piece is several years old, but I haven't seen it before.
A little blurb about it: "By revolving around characters, moral choices,
scandal and relationships, but keeping you in the thick of the story rather
than watching from above as in The Sims, Masq fills the soap slot on the PC.
It's a genre that's going to be unstoppably popular one day." (quote from PC
Gamer Magazine UK)

All these links are also on my links page at http://vispo.com/misc/links.htm

Happy holidays to all the fine folks on the Poetics list.

Chris,

Try "The Dy-Dee Doll" in Anne Sexton's "Death Baby" series. The whole series, in
fact: the baby, the I, death itself, as a frozen or stone baby.

Also Marge Piercy's "Barbie Doll." Also Colette Inez's "Without Toys at the
Home" and David St.John's "Dolls" (the last two found with the Poetry Tool on
the Poetry Foundation website, a great resource).

It's interesting how in poems, dolls are usually creepy. Freud had something to
say on this in his essay "The Uncanny."

Hope this helps,
Hilary Clark

i didn't realize that Carter was That old. I had his work with Benny Goodman on vinyl. I've lost lots of great records, hundreds.

For those interested in music, the Times has an article today about Elliot
Carter's hundrdth birthday concert/celebration, at which a new piece was
performed. There's a brief excerpt from it (the whole is 17 minutes long).
Carter was a protege of Ives. He's without question the preeminent American
composer since. And he's been composing like a mad man this past decade,
with no end in sight. A chastening example to us all.
A quick intro to his work, and some of his best, are his concertos and
quartets.

Mark

Chris,

Try "The Dy-Dee Doll" in Anne Sexton's "Death Baby" series. The whole =
series, in
fact: the baby, the I, death itself, as a frozen or stone baby.

Also Marge Piercy's "Barbie Doll." Also Colette Inez's "Without Toys at =
the
Home" and David St.John's "Dolls" (the last two found with the Poetry =
Tool on
the Poetry Foundation website, a great resource).

It's interesting how in poems, dolls are usually creepy. Freud had =
something to
say on this in his essay "The Uncanny."

Hope this helps,
Hilary Clark

Hi Chris,

You are on the right track with Daniel Tiffany's book which is so
excellent!!!

Also I wonder if you've seen the Baudelaire piece, "A Philosophy of =
Toys,"
that's another good one, and undergraduates seem to really identify with
CB in this memoir slash essay, really extraordinary thinking and =
writing,

David Trinidad has (in Hand Over Heart?) a poem about playing with dolls
that has the smoothest, shiniest surface of any sestina I've ever read.
Also, when she put me to bed my grandmother used to read me a sentimental
poem, perhaps by Edgar Guest, about toys who are sad because an angel came
during the night and took their little boy away. It affected me permanently.

William Fox's work may be useful for this course.

From his website: "William L. Fox is a writer, independent scholar,
and poet whose work is a sustained inquiry into how human cognition
transforms land into landscape. His numerous nonfiction books rely
upon fieldwork with artists and scientists in extreme environments to
provide the narratives through which he conducts his investigations."

Hi George,

Down here in the US, the inferior US, copies are available in the
bookstores.  If you are having trouble locating them in the bookstores of
superior Canada, well, they have all those Canadian books to sell through
first.  I think this is called the trickle up theory.

Let me see if I can get you one,

Oh, and here is a poem by Spicer on the Toys theme Chris Chapman put out
there (from 15 False Propositions against God, 1958)

Millions of meaningless toys
If the child isn’t born soon we’ll have to close the toyshop. The
	second
Joyful mystery.
They make them out of trees and rubber bands and place them
	in stockings and cradles
No one
Knows how to play with them.
Kneel
At his birth
Meaningless
As he is
They are not his toys or our toys we must play with.  They are
Our toys.

An anonymous, collective blog, Faits Divers de la Poesie Americain et
Britannique, is now available for viewing.
=20
Inspired by the early-20th century French anarchist, art critic, and
journalist Felix Feneon, who under the byline "Novels in Three Lines"
anonymously published hundreds of faits divers in Le Matin during 1906, the
blog will present, with periodic additions, epigrammatic
observations--satirical and fanciful--related to U.S. and British poetry.
=20
For example:
=20
Impassive, impenetrable, offering only name, rank, and institution, the
heroic neo-Oulipean M. B=F6k withstood three weeks of waterboarding in the
secret chambers of the Poetry Foundation. Finally, he broke.
=20
An initial offering of 85 is now up, accompanied by visuals. More will be
added, as inspiration strikes. Please visit!
=20

Happy holidays,

A Picture Of Young G. S. With His Phantom of the Opera Figure

    Here he his as a boy copying what he almost but won't
    admit he knows, a murderous ruse appears to fuse appearing at night
    to be his face half-masked, but already seen at
another's touch: the lurking special effects of revulsion harmony granted by
night
are never enough to maintain this semblance called atmosphere, this swooping
up to an unknown mark that looks back at him in ghastly horror-RIFFIC-scope
    pulling pain from a gas-light's glow--
    The play began so early and even the wattage of all THE SAINTS & THE
BLESSED BLUE
    ONE HERSELF behind him was too bright, too insistent to pull
            the undesirable soul from this Phantom of the Opera figure

We here at Tribes would like to wish you and yours happy holidaze.

Over the last year, the highlight of our programming was of course our
Charlie Parker Festival with poetry, group art show, concerts, and block
party.

From the perspective of diversity, we also featured an art show by 3
Native American artists, which included a Native drumming/singing group.

Tribes’ publishing arm, Fly By Night Press, is preparing to release 3
books of poetry: “the Geoglyph” by former intern Patrick Kosiewicz,
another book of selected poetry by the Nuyorican Cafe’s Co-director Lois
Elaine Griffith, and a third book by Tribes’ sometime-assistant Luis
Chalusian.

And finally, after some stumbling, Tribes #12 will be out sometime in
January, featuring works of such notables as Willie Birch, Chakaia
Booker, Louise Bourgeois, Hettie Jones, Sol Le Wit, Donald Lev, Thomas
Noskowski, and Jerome Rothenberg, among others. Also among the ranks are
local favorites such as Dorothy Friedman August, Bonny Finberg, Bob
Holman, Anyssa Kim, and Deborah Pintonelli. Plus a wonderful section of
contemporary Japanese poetry.

Also, our innovative, ever-mutating house band Will McEvoy & Friends has
been joined by another monthly jazz event, participatory improv featuring
Patrick Brennan and other guest artists.

Next August we’d like to keep Charlie Parker’s spirit alive by repeating
Festival events with a different set of characters – artists, musicians,
poets. We’re also planning a new series of art shows yet to be announced,
but you can bet your bottom dollar, surprise, surprise...

Unfortunately, like NPR, WBAI, and others, we too are suffering from the
economic downturn. As Charlie Parker would have it, speaking of scrapple
from the apple, we’re scraping the bottom of the barrel, even worse than
others, as we are a small nonprofit committed to supporting emerging,
multicultural artists. If you agree with us that this is a unique and
important mission – which can’t be accomplished without your help! –
please send whatever tax-deductible contribution you can make, check or
money order, to:

Tribes
POB 20693
NY, NY 10009

P.S. A little bit of something is better than a whole lot of nothing!

Three off the top of my head that stay fresh:

For an interesting look at the "common touch".  Theoretical study of =20
vulgarity. Challenges the modern aesthetic.

GB  *Divine Landscapes* =97 Ronald Blythe

as a present.

Italy  *The Villa - Form and Ideology of Country Houses*  James S. =20
Ackerman. Outlines the best def. of "Sweet Otium" I've read

Granted these titles live outside specific poetic categories, but off =20=

My best,

Petrichord Books is pleased to announce the publication of OUT ANOTHER
by Michael Carr. In OUT ANOTHER a mentholated wind blows the reader
from
deja to jamais vu and back, in a poemscape that lies distinctively in
between. These poems, like continental noir, present a facade that may
or may not be real.

OUT ANOTHER may be purchased for $6 online via paypal at

or by sending concealed cash or a check (made payable to AARON TIEGER) to 6=

With her warm subtle fleshy FIRST BABY POEMS Waldman creates an infant powe=
r
that did not exist before in her words. These poems are complex joyful
bioalchemy.=20

Whenever my friends give birth, I always send them the words of William
Blake's "Infant Joy" ("What shall I call thee?"/'I happy am,/Joy is my
name.'/Sweet joy befall thee!") and a xeroxed copy of Anne Waldman's FIRST
BABY POEMS - long unavailable and now happily reprinted - for their
delectation: twenty-nine joyful, lucent poems in all manner of styles and
song. It is no matter of a "hard sell" to suggest that FIRST BABY POEMS is =
a
"perfect gift" for those who are birthing and those who are busy being born=
.
Sweet joy befall them.

Anne Waldman glows even in the throes of morning sickness at the Buddhist
chateau. The mind empties as the belly expands, but the mind doesn't clear
without a detailed expression of what it is letting go of, and the body
doesn't fill without a rich chronicle of sensation. She takes us all the wa=
y
to term and then, the baby gets the pantoums. What a retreat she takes us
on. What a euphonic spell of sleep-deprived wonder she casts.

Hi Charles,

Geoff Park, Theatre Country: Essays on landscape & whenua, Victoria
University Press 2006,
is a terrific collection & I think would be apt. A Maori term, whenua means
both land/ground and
placenta - his introduction is subtitled 'A more indigenous life' and there
are essays such as
'The Ecology of the Visit' whose feel reminds me of both W G Sebald in, say=
,
The Rings of Saturn,
and of Lisa Robertson in her Occasional Works and Seven Walks from the
Office for Soft Architecture
(Clear Cut Press) - which, come to think of it, also would be apt for your
course. It has always smart
and sometimes ravishing approaches to urban ecology and the constructedness
of other cultural forms
in 'natural' spaces (I'm thinking of the hut piece - sorry that I cannot be
more specific as the book's over at school).

Happy teaching - I love looking over the menus of possibility before the
courses begin,
Lisa

Again, great thanks to all - Gerald, Steve, Kevin, Murat, Cara, J.A., Mary,
George -who've added to the toy discussion. I can construct a doll-eany in a
beat of the heart now.

"Wood removes, from all the forms which it supports, the wounding quality of
angles which are too sharp, the chemical coldness of metal. When the child
handles it and knocks it, it neither vibrates nor grates, it has a sound at
once muffled and sharp. It is a familiar and poetic substance, which does
does not sever the child from close contact with the tree, the table, the
floor." (Barthes, _Mythologies_ 61)

A Picture Of Young G. S. With His Phantom of the Opera Figure

    Here he his as a boy copying what he almost but won't
    admit he knows, a murderous ruse appears to fuse appearing at night
    to be his face half-masked, but already seen at
another's touch: the lurking special effects of revulsion harmony granted by

night
are never enough to maintain this semblance called atmosphere, this swooping
up to an unknown mark that looks back at him in ghastly horror-RIFFIC-scope
    pulling pain from a gas-light's glow--
    The play began so early and even the wattage of all THE SAINTS & THE

    ONE HERSELF behind him was too bright, too insistent to pull
            the undesirable soul from this Phantom of the Opera figure

Sir, =96 Sean O=92Brien=92s excellent review of Volume Three of The Compl=

Works of W. H. Auden, Prose, 1949=961955 (September 12), requires a bit o=

the =93very funny story=94 in Edward Mendelson=92s Notes. O=92Brien says =

Auden =93could be assiduous in his role as gatekeeper=94 for the Yale You=

Poets Series; and =93as a result no collections appeared in 1954, nor in=20=

1955=94. Auden, he says, knew =93that Ashbery had intended to submit a=20=

her,=20
that =93Chester Kallman had helped overcome Auden=92s own doubts about th=
e=20
work=94 (which was selected and published as Some Trees). The matter is m=
ore=20
complicated than that, and Mendelson may be excused for knowing nothing=20=

about what happened.=20

What happened was this: I had submitted for the 1956 competition a=20
collection (Whatever Love Declares). I had been informed that the work wa=
s=20
on the shortlist of twelve poets. In about late March of that year my wif=
e=20
and I were invited to dinner by Naomi and Arnold Weinstein, whom I had me=
t=20
when we joined the English Department of New York University a year=20
earlier. The guest of honour was Auden, and it was to be an evening for=20=

the five of us. At the last moment, while we were having aperitifs, John=20=

Ashbery showed up, new to New York from Buffalo, as I recall, and recentl=
y=20
acquainted with Arnold. The evening commenced oddly, after Auden had aske=
d=20
about my wife=92s cheekbones: =93Are you Hungarian, by chance?=94. To whi=
ch she=20
replied, =93Yes, Hungarian by affiliation, I suppose, since my parents we=

were, after 400 years in north-eastern Hungary, gathered up, all but one=20=

who survived Auschwitz in 1944, and sent into the sky in smoke and ash=94=
.=20
That didn=92t cause Auden to miss a beat; he went right on to say he=92d=20=

surmised as much =96 from her fine eyes, lidded with that epicanthic fold=
 of=20
the Jews, as he put it, at least, like the Hungarians out of the Asian=20=

Auden and prizes=20
Letter in response to Jascha Kessler's letter of November 28=20
December 3, 2008=20

Sir, -- Jascha Kessler's letter (November 28) about W. H. Auden and the=20=

Yale Younger Poets Series is seriously delusional. Kessler describes a=20=

mid-1950s New York dinner party that I do not recall, where supposedly=20=

Auden and I first met, and where he was so entranced by my effeminate,=20=

Waspy charms that he invited me to send him a manuscript for the Yale=20
competition, of which he was the judge, thereby robbing Kessler or anothe=
r=20
of the twelve finalists of the prize.=20

Kessler has a careless way with facts. He says I was new to New York from=
=20
Buffalo, where I ve never lived, and recently acquainted with [the host]=20=

Arnold \[Weinstein\], whom I had known since 1949 when I moved to New Yor=
k=20
City. Also, I had first met Auden as an undergraduate around 1947 after a=
=20
reading he gave at Harvard, and often seen him in New York as a result of=
=20
knowing his lover Chester Kallman. If he was going to be swept away by my=
=20
"mewling", "mincing", "goy gay persona" he had already had almost a decad=
e=20
to be so (and wasn't). To suggest that the notably ethical Auden would=20=

propose circumventing the Yale contest rules to someone he had just met i=
s=20
ridiculous. In any case he would have had no need to give me his address,=
=20
as Kessler says he did, since I had been to his apartment on a number of=20=

occasions (including for one of his famous birthday parties).=20

The "history"to which Mr Kessler refers at the end of his letter is=20
hardly supported by the easily verified record. George Bradley has writte=
n=20
the history of the Yale series in the introduction to his Yale Younger=20=

Poets Anthology (1998). This is from the part about me (p lxviii):=20

As usual, Auden was on Ischia that spring [1955], where he had been sent=20=

twelve manuscripts. After he went through them, he sent [Eugene] Davidson=
=20
[at Yale University Press] an unhappy letter. Not only had he not found=20=

anything he liked, he had not found what he was looking for:=20

  "I am very worried because, for the second year in succession, I do not=
=20
  find among the mss. submitted to me one that I feel merits publication.=
=20
  It so happens that there is another poet staying here, and I have asked=
=20
  him to read them also as a check on my own judgment.=20

=20=20
  "What bothers me particularly is that a young poet (John Ashbery) whom =
I=20
  know personally told me he was submitting a manuscript this year. I hav=
e=20
  reservations about such of his poems as I have seen, but they are=20
  certainly better than any of the manuscripts which have reached me. I=20=

  don't know how or by whom the preliminary sieving is done at the press,=
=20
  but I cannot help wondering whether I am receiving the best."=20

The other poet reading manuscripts with Auden was Anthony Hecht, who had=20=

been travelling in Italy and had met Auden by chance. As for John Ashbery=
,=20
his manuscript had indeed been weeded out, along with that of another New=
=20
York poet, Frank O'Hara. Auden contacted them both and asked that they=20=

re-submit their work directly to him. He received the manuscripts in=20
little more than a week and made up his mind within days. The winner was=20=

Ashbery, salvaged from the slush pile to become in time one of the=20
best-known poets the Yale series has ever published.=20

Dear List:

Wondering if anyone might have a spare Issue of Noon #4. If so, then please back channel. I have two poems published in this wonderful, wonderful journal. Regrettably, however, I have managed to distribute every last one to friends. Your time and consideration will be most sincerely appreciated.

This is an updated version of my Masters Thesis, done through Independent Study at Lesley University in Cambridge. More info at http://www.OrganicPoetry.org

The phrase comes from the early 60's correspondence of Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov, and the book traces the method through several North American poets, from Whitman to WCW, Olson, Duncan, Levertov, McClure, George Bowering and Robin Blaser, among others. Cultural implications are touched on, especially the notion that this process is an antidote to the mechanistic cosmology so rampant in our Western world today. (Competition and domination give way to the notion of interconnection and process.)

I am grateful to all the people who made this book possible, including occasional SUNY-Buffalo listserv wiseguy George Bowering.

On December 29 at 7:00 p.m. Books Inc. - Opera Plaza will be hosting a =
launch and reading for Poems for the Millennium, volume 3: The =
University of California Book of Romantic and Postromantic Poetry, =
edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson. Like its two =
twentieth-century predecessors, Poems for the Millennium, volumes 1 and =
2, this gathering sets forth a globally decentered approach to the =
poetry of the preceding century from a radically experimental and =
visionary perspective. Joining Rothenberg and Robinson in the reading =
and performance are major Bay Area poets Michael McClure, Diane di =
Prima, Michael Palmer, Bill Berkson, Leslie Scalapino, and Jack Foley =
(performing with Adelle Foley). Introducing the reading will be =
Katherine Hastings, founder of the WordTemple Poetry Series and host of =
WordTemple on KRCB 91.1 FM, Santa Rosa's NPR affiliate. The Books Inc. =
location is at Opera Plaza, 601 Van Ness Avenue, tel. 415.776.1111.=20

The following is from the University of California Press announcement:=20

The previous two volumes of this acclaimed anthology set forth a =
globally decentered revision of twentieth-century poetry from the =
perspective of its many avant-gardes. Now editors Jerome Rothenberg and =
Jeffrey C. Robinson bring a radically new interpretation to the poetry =
of the preceding century, viewing the work of the romantic and =
post-romantic poets as an international, collective, often utopian =
enterprise that became the foundation of experimental modernism. Global =
in its range, volume three gathers selections from the poetry and =
manifestos of canonical poets, as well as the work of lesser-known but =
equally radical poets. Defining romanticism as experimental and =
visionary, Rothenberg and Robinson feature prose poetry, verbal-visual =
experiments, and sound poetry, along with more familiar forms seen here =
as if for the first time. The anthology also explores romanticism =
outside the European orbit and includes ethnopoetic and archaeological =
works outside the literary mainstream. The range of volume three and its =
skewing of the traditional canon illuminate the process by which =
romantics and post- romantics challenged nineteenth-century orthodoxies =
and propelled poetry to the experiments of a later modernism and =
avant-gardism.

Mime-Version: 1.0

The New York Times ran an article today about Clinton's donors. It's
headline--"Moguls and Arab States Are Big Donors to Clinton
Charity"--must have sent a momentary frisson down the collective
spine of India. The moguls, or mughals, were emperors of India before
the British Raj. So, the headline seems to say that the potentates of
the decadent east are palsy walsy with Clinton, though by "moguls" is
meant the likes of Bill Gates. What the headline really says is that
the Times can't find writers who know any history.

Gave me a chuckle, tho.

  Greetings-

Just wanted to make you aware that pre-orders are now available for The
Matthew Shipp Trio's latest recording, "Harmonic Disorder". The release
date for this CD is January 27th, 2009.

"Shipp views the date as ''a continuation of the great piano trio
tradition-artists such as Bud Powell, Bill Evans and Ahmad Jamal- but
played
with our own language and in our own unique way.''
 THAT ABOUT SUMS IT UP.

i have a copy of this book. it's very good. writings by some i know and many
i don't yet.

the writers include joerg piringer, jaap blonk, pamila z, katharine norman,
larry wendt, paul lansky, and laurie anderson.

the book's production is very good. and it's 200+ pages.

i'm currently reading an essay by john wynne about his project with speakers
of gitxsanimaax, which is spoken by some natives around the upper skeena
river in my home province of british columbia.

and enjoyed katharine norman's discursive piece called 'local materials'
about what catches her ear and what she makes of it.

i would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the art of sound.

Dear Elizabeth I'm writing to you today to consider saying No to
reading at Barak Obama's inauguration in light of his invitation to
Rick Warren to officiate the blessing.  Mr. Obama's invitation to Rick
Warren is clearly a message to the Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Transgender
community that he is not interested in our rights, not interested in
our struggle, not interested in our suffering.

Rick Warren's money, time and effort towards Proposition 8 in
California is a very clear message.  Any man who would put THAT MUCH
time, money and effort into a campaign is sending a message which is
nothing but clear.

This is not an easy thing to ask you to do Elizabeth.  As a poet I
know full well how long and hard we work with little or no recognition
and respect.  Being asked to read at Mr. Obama's presidential
inauguration is without a doubt one of the highlights of your life as
a poet, I'm sure.  The papers say you say you're "completely
thrilled."  I believe that.  I understand that, but, I'm asking you as
a poet, and a queer man to consider the implications of reading in
January.

When George W. Bush was reelected I was one of millions in DC to
protest the inauguration, but that was different, that was very
different because he was transparent.  The transparent man is always
easiest to protest.  Mr. Obama is not transparent, and while he talks
about building and maintaining bridges with opposing forces, that
should not in my opinion spill over into the celebration of his
inauguration.

Asking Rick Warren's blessing is Obama's message.  Rick Warren has
been publicly open about his homophobia, but Mr. Obama has not been,
not until now that is.  In asking Rick Warren to bless the
inauguration the LGBT community is being told straight up we will not
count, we will be ignored, we will continue to suffer.

Protesting Mr. Obama's inauguration is much more important than
protesting George W. Bush's inauguration ever was because Mr. Obama
promised us he was a man with ethics and courage.  By asking Rick
Warren to give the blessing the weakness of Obama is immediately
clear.  Courage is something someone has when they are standing
against oppressive forces, not when they stand with them.

It wasn't my intention of turning this letter to you into a lecture,
but while I'm at it, let me say that I PROTEST this choice Mr. Obama
made to invite Rick Warren on behalf of the many LGBT people I have
known, most especially the African American LGBT friends I have made
over the years.  I have learned from these friends just how entrenched
homophobia is within the African American community, and this decision
of Mr. Obama's serves to galvanize that bigotry.

If we are going to send Mr. Obama a message, better to do it on his
first day.  Send it now, tell him No Thank You, please do that
Elizabeth Alexander.  Mr. Obama isn't George W. Bush, meaning HE WILL
LISTEN, but, if we don't tell him how we feel then how will he know?
You have the power in your hands to tell him how you feel.  You have
the opportunity and power more than any other poet in America right
now Elizabeth Alexander.  And if you read then you are telling him
that it is more important to you to read for him than it is to tell
him you are disappointed with his decision to invite Rick Warren.

But then again maybe you aren't disappointed that he chose to invite
Rick Warren?  What do I know about you after all?  Maybe all of this
is just fine with you?

Here's to hoping you tell Mr. Obama No Thank You on behalf the
millions who suffer under the pressures of Rick Warren and all those
who stand beside Rick Warren and his very bad, bigoted decisions.  It
was easy for Sharon Olds to say No to George W. Bush, but for you it's
a more difficult decision, I understand that.  But the only right
decision in my opinion is to say No, and I hope you realize that.

Most sincerely,
CAConrad

The New York Times ran an article today about Clinton's donors. It's
headline--"Moguls and Arab States Are Big Donors to Clinton
Charity"--must have sent a momentary frisson down the collective spine of
India. The moguls, or mughals, were emperors of India before the British Raj.
So, the headline seems to say that the potentates of the decadent east are palsy
walsy with Clinton, though by "moguls" is meant the likes of Bill
Gates. What the headline really says is that the Times can't find writers
who know any history.

Gave me a chuckle, tho.

New York poetry brothel tempts with verse

Published: Friday December 19, 2008

http://rawstory.com/news/afp/New_York_poetry_brothel_tempts_with_12192008.html

The prostitute whispers, wets her lips and prepares to bare... her
heart with a poem.

Welcome to New York's Poetry Brothel, where punters delve between the
lines, not the sheets.

At a weekend session in a Manhattan night club called the Zipper
Factory the look was bona fide bordello.

Literary ladies of the night flitted between intimate, candle-lit
nooks, red lights and paintings of nudes.

Some of the poetesses for sale sported retro-style garter belts and
frilly knickers. One swanned about in a top hat and feather boa.

But transactions at the Poetry Brothel are of the mind, not the body,
and a moment with the catalogue, replete with pictures and whimsical
descriptions, reveals what's on offer.

Page four boasts The Professor, swearing to have heard "the wail of
your striving heart drifting over the spires of skyscrapers."

Harriett Van Os on page 10 promises to "tell you secrets she doesn't
know she knows." Cecille Ballroom tempts punters on page 13 claiming
she can "coax your drum."

Gigolo poets are available, not least Poetry Brothel co-founder
Nicholas Adamski, who goes by the name Tennessee Pink and tops
tempestuous, dark looks with an eye patch.

"Poetry is what I love more than anything," cooed The Madame, the
sultry spirit behind the whole idea.

The Madame -- real name Stephanie Berger -- came dressed for the part
in low-cut dress, elbow-length black gloves and a peacock headdress.

"I'd rather be in the bedroom hearing poetry than listening to some
old man sitting on a chair on a stage," she explained by the light of
a guttering candle.

One-on-one encounters, for which "clients" pay three to five dollars
in addition to a 15 dollar entry fee and one free reading, took place
upstairs.

The "whores" read from their own material, much of which is free
verse, making for intense, sometimes baffling performances.

But for those needing a break, the Poetry Brothel laid on flamenco
guitarists, a fortune-teller, a blackjack table and a bar specializing
in port and whisky

The young hedonists, most of them students, appear to have struck a
surprisingly successful formula.

"There just aren't that many poetry readings where poets show a lot of
cleavage," said The Professor, otherwise known as Jennifer Michael
Hecht, aged 43 and a real life professor at Manhattan's New School.

She teaches writing to many of the Brothel's regulars and is proud of
the result.

"It's kind of like the Weimar Republic without the Nazis. At two in
the morning you have 20- or 30-year-olds lying all over the place
reading poetry," she said.

"The custom is to read poetry alone, but we know that from Homer
onward, people read it aloud and in groups."

By midnight the Zipper Factory was packed and getting fuller -- and
rowdier.

The fortune teller, bedecked in red scarf and blue plumes, mumbled to
someone about "choppy waters." The flamenco duo strummed. The Madame,
yet another glass of port in hand, introduced poet "whores" in a voice
suggesting she appreciated more than their literary charms.

When Patricia Smith, a well-established poet, took the mike to declaim
a long and rhythmical poem about love and making love, there were rock
concert cheers from the crowd.

"I always shudder when I pray," Smith intoned in a mesmerizing voice,
"so your name must be a prayer."

Even for these bohemians there's no escaping the economic crisis
sweeping the country.

One of the poets, 22-year-old Nina Cheng, was about to start a job at
Bear Stearns this year when the bank collapsed. Now she is writing a
play about the experience and applying for a playwright's course at
Yale.

"I'd thought I'd do banking and get into the arts when I retired --
not this early," said Cheng, known at the Brothel as The Opium Eater.

Another poetry prostitute, 27-year-old Rachel Herman-Gross, aka
Simone, worried that crashing stock markets will pull the rug from
under the arts scene. "It's going to be a lot harder. A lot of artists
are sustained by grants from people with money."

But one enthusiastic "client" said the ingenuity of the Poetry Brothel
proves there are ways to survive.

"Money's always been scarce for artists and they're very resourceful
people," said Edmund Voyer, 54, a hefty man described as an
"evangelist" on his business card and who came to the Zipper Factory
wearing a kilt.

His drinking companion, Jennifer Hoa, 27, agreed money and art would
always find ways to meet.

"I've been a sell-out for years as a corporate lawyer, but I come
here," she said. "I can't suppress my artistic side."

The Madame promised that the Poetry Brothel welcomed all.

"Many are young men with perhaps a secret interest in poems," she
murmured. "Just look at the menu. Get a recommendation. Or say you
don't care. Say: 'I need poetry. I'm hungry.'"

why is it not possible for Elizabeth Alexander to tell Barack Obama what she
thinks about her company and his choices and still read??
in fact she *could read something that addresses her concerns? write
something specifically for the occasion?

cooptation of poetry by capitalist objectification of women. not funny. to
use a brothel as a metaphor is disgusting. I remember when Denise Levertov
criticized a poet for using napalm as a metaphor for personal pain, saying
you don't know what it feels like & it's much worse than the way you are
characterizing it.

I've been trying to tell people for years that the Democrats are no friends to gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgenders, etc., that they were only using civil right issues in general to fool people into voting for them while they in fact undermine the groups they claim to support to keep them dependent upon them. Please, people, wake up and smell the cynicism.

Subject: OPEN LETTER to Elizabeth Alexander

Dear Elizabeth I'm writing to you today to consider saying No to
reading at Barak Obama's inauguration in light of his invitation to
Rick Warren to officiate the blessing.  Mr. Obama's invitation to Rick
Warren is clearly a message to the Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Transgender
community that he is not interested in our rights, not interested in
our struggle, not interested in our suffering.

Rick Warren's money, time and effort towards Proposition 8 in
California is a very clear message.  Any man who would put THAT MUCH
time, money and effort into a campaign is sending a message which is
nothing but clear.

This is not an easy thing to ask you to do Elizabeth.  As a poet I
know full well how long and hard we work with little or no recognition
and respect.  Being asked to read at Mr. Obama's presidential
inauguration is without a doubt one of the highlights of your life as
a poet, I'm sure.  The papers say you say you're "completely
thrilled."  I believe that.  I understand that, but, I'm asking you as
a poet, and a queer man to consider the implications of reading in
January.

When George W. Bush was reelected I was one of millions in DC to
protest the inauguration, but that was different, that was very
different because he was transparent.  The transparent man is always
easiest to protest.  Mr. Obama is not transparent, and while he talks
about building and maintaining bridges with opposing forces, that
should not in my opinion spill over into the celebration of his
inauguration.

Asking Rick Warren's blessing is Obama's message.  Rick Warren has
been publicly open about his homophobia, but Mr. Obama has not been,
not until now that is.  In asking Rick Warren to bless the
inauguration the LGBT community is being told straight up we will not
count, we will be ignored, we will continue to suffer.

Protesting Mr. Obama's inauguration is much more important than
protesting George W. Bush's inauguration ever was because Mr. Obama
promised us he was a man with ethics and courage.  By asking Rick
Warren to give the blessing the weakness of Obama is immediately
clear.  Courage is something someone has when they are standing
against oppressive forces, not when they stand with them.

It wasn't my intention of turning this letter to you into a lecture,
but while I'm at it, let me say that I PROTEST this choice Mr. Obama
made to invite Rick Warren on behalf of the many LGBT people I have
known, most especially the African American LGBT friends I have made
over the years.  I have learned from these friends just how entrenched
homophobia is within the African American community, and this decision
of Mr. Obama's serves to galvanize that bigotry.

If we are going to send Mr. Obama a message, better to do it on his
first day.  Send it now, tell him No Thank You, please do that
Elizabeth Alexander.  Mr. Obama isn't George W. Bush, meaning HE WILL
LISTEN, but, if we don't tell him how we feel then how will he know?
You have the power in your hands to tell him how you feel.  You have
the opportunity and power more than any other poet in America right
now Elizabeth Alexander.  And if you read then you are telling him
that it is more important to you to read for him than it is to tell
him you are disappointed with his decision to invite Rick Warren.

But then again maybe you aren't disappointed that he chose to invite
Rick Warren?  What do I know about you after all?  Maybe all of this
is just fine with you?

Here's to hoping you tell Mr. Obama No Thank You on behalf the
millions who suffer under the pressures of Rick Warren and all those
who stand beside Rick Warren and his very bad, bigoted decisions.  It
was easy for Sharon Olds to say No to George W. Bush, but for you it's
a more difficult decision, I understand that.  But the only right
decision in my opinion is to say No, and I hope you realize that.

Most sincerely,
CAConrad

I agree, this is truly a time to get Up In It, not
a time to be Not there at all. Audre Lord opted
out of her time to have a bigger place to say
what she needed to say here in NY State.
A sad loss that was!

To CA Conrad:  Thank you for writing this letter.  The choice of Rick Warren
by Obama is a terrible mistake, for anyone who believes in Civil Rights for
all citizens. And what is the point of Civil Rights for only some of us?
Elizabeth Alexander would be doing the right thing, if she chosses to take
your advice, and withdraw in protest from the inauguration ceremony.  What a
disappointment from Obama.
Laura

Pastor Rick Warren said:

"Three years ago I took enormous heat for inviting Barack Obama to my
church because some of his views don't agree (with mine)," he said.
"Now he's invited me."

So, it's ok for Obama to speak to Pastor Warren's parishioners, but not ok for Warren to speak at the Inauguration? Another example of how Obama's pragmatism (consciousness) goes way beyond left vs. right, way beyond the failing duality of US versus THEM, the exact same duality we're trying to overcome with Gay/Straight.

I love how Obama continues to defy the conventional wisdom of the Left AND the right. Keep guessing folks, or broaden your perspective during the next eight years. Dialog has begun. Much more interesting than the last eight.

Someday Rick Warren and others will understand that Gay people have a very important role in this society, as has been recognized by many indigenous and ancient cultures. The term used in some Native American cultures, Two Spirit, begins to communicate this.

Subject: OPEN LETTER to Elizabeth Alexander

Dear Elizabeth I'm writing to you today to consider saying No to
reading at Barak Obama's inauguration in light of his invitation to
Rick Warren to officiate the blessing.  Mr. Obama's invitation to Rick
Warren is clearly a message to the Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Transgender
community that he is not interested in our rights, not interested in
our struggle, not interested in our suffering.

Rick Warren's money, time and effort towards Proposition 8 in
California is a very clear message.  Any man who would put THAT MUCH
time, money and effort into a campaign is sending a message which is
nothing but clear.

This is not an easy thing to ask you to do Elizabeth.  As a poet I
know full well how long and hard we work with little or no recognition
and respect.  Being asked to read at Mr. Obama's presidential
inauguration is without a doubt one of the highlights of your life as
a poet, I'm sure.  The papers say you say you're "completely
thrilled."  I believe that.  I understand that, but, I'm asking you as
a poet, and a queer man to consider the implications of reading in
January.

When George W. Bush was reelected I was one of millions in DC to
protest the inauguration, but that was different, that was very
different because he was transparent.  The transparent man is always
easiest to protest.  Mr. Obama is not transparent, and while he talks
about building and maintaining bridges with opposing forces, that
should not in my opinion spill over into the celebration of his
inauguration.

Asking Rick Warren's blessing is Obama's message.  Rick Warren has
been publicly open about his homophobia, but Mr. Obama has not been,
not until now that is.  In asking Rick Warren to bless the
inauguration the LGBT community is being told straight up we will not
count, we will be ignored, we will continue to suffer.

Protesting Mr. Obama's inauguration is much more important than
protesting George W. Bush's inauguration ever was because Mr. Obama
promised us he was a man with ethics and courage.  By asking Rick
Warren to give the blessing the weakness of Obama is immediately
clear.  Courage is something someone has when they are standing
against oppressive forces, not when they stand with them.

It wasn't my intention of turning this letter to you into a lecture,
but while I'm at it, let me say that I PROTEST this choice Mr. Obama
made to invite Rick Warren on behalf of the many LGBT people I have
known, most especially the African American LGBT friends I have made
over the years.  I have learned from these friends just how entrenched
homophobia is within the African American community, and this decision
of Mr. Obama's serves to galvanize that bigotry.

If we are going to send Mr. Obama a message, better to do it on his
first day.  Send it now, tell him No Thank You, please do that
Elizabeth Alexander.  Mr. Obama isn't George W. Bush, meaning HE WILL
LISTEN, but, if we don't tell him how we feel then how will he know?
You have the power in your hands to tell him how you feel.  You have
the opportunity and power more than any other poet in America right
now Elizabeth Alexander.  And if you read then you are telling him
that it is more important to you to read for him than it is to tell
him you are disappointed with his decision to invite Rick Warren.

But then again maybe you aren't disappointed that he chose to invite
Rick Warren?  What do I know about you after all?  Maybe all of this
is just fine with you?

Here's to hoping you tell Mr. Obama No Thank You on behalf the
millions who suffer under the pressures of Rick Warren and all those
who stand beside Rick Warren and his very bad, bigoted decisions.  It
was easy for Sharon Olds to say No to George W. Bush, but for you it's
a more difficult decision, I understand that.  But the only right
decision in my opinion is to say No, and I hope you realize that.

Most sincerely,
CAConrad

It seems to me that the best way to say "No, thank you" is to write and read
a poem about LGBT rights, sufferings, anxieties, etc, for the inauguration.
That, again, would make history. The best form of protest is staged "on
stage", not offstage.

This is quite persuasive, Paul. Dialogism works in and for opposites, not in
sameness, not for compatibles. Thanks to William Blake for saying, in The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell, "Without Contraries is no progression.
Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to
Human existence."

cooptation of poetry by capitalist objectification of women. not funny. to
use a brothel as a metaphor is disgusting. I remember when Denise Levertov
criticized a poet for using napalm as a metaphor for personal pain, saying
you don't know what it feels like & it's much worse than the way
you are
characterizing it.

it seemed, at the time, an empty gesture when Sharon Olds refused to read f=
or 43, Bush.
so i thought at the time.

but Conrad seems on to something.

poets, what more do=A0 we have=A0 other=A0 than a handful of gesures?

To CA Conrad:  Thank you for writing this letter.  The choice of Rick Warre=

by Obama is a terrible mistake, for anyone who believes in Civil Rights for

Elizabeth Alexander would be doing the right thing, if she chosses to take

At a party last night I had an odd conversation with a friend I
hadn't spoken to since before the election. My friend is in his
sixties. He had spent two months as a fulltime volunteer for the
Obama campaign. I commented, I thought rather modestly, and none to
originally, that a lot of what Obama has said he hopes to do would be
constrained by the economic crisis, what with bailout plans and
falling revenues. My friend said he had faith in Obama's intelligence
to figure out how to do it all. Then he got scary--his eyes had the
faraway look of the convert to a new religion. "He has a lot of the
characteristics traditionally associated with sainthood," my friend told me.

I don't know if saints are supposed to keep us guessing, but I don't
think elected officials are. Certainly we had to guess enough in the
last eight years to last a lifetime.

Yes Paul, actually that's exactly right. You see, speaking at the
Inauguration is an *honor*. When you honor someone who has bigoted views,
you legitimize those views by saying that despite them that person belongs
not just in the crowd with the rest of us citizens but *on the platform*. It
says that homophobia--and sexism (Warren's "church" doesn't allow women to
hold leadership positions) is not a bigotry as unacceptable as those that
would disqualify a person from such public honors.

Objecting to this bigot speaking isn't about gay vs. straight. A lot of
straight people are pissed off about this. I can't even imagine the
doublethink required to say that honoring a man who creates a strong divide
between gay and straight with his cruel biased rhetoric constitutes
overcoming divisions.

Pragmatism is cool but what is the end goal of this pragmatism? Term two?

Aha. Those of us who dare to object to any action taken by Obama simply have
insufficiently broad perspectives. Dialog has begun? Giving an invocation
=/= dialog.

Behaving as if sexism and homophobia are acceptable is hardly
unconventional, incidentally.

I sure hope you're right. I sure hope that one day this bigot realizes the
homosexuals are not committing acts comparable to incest and pedophilia. I
sure hope he realizes that women can lead, too, though I see you didn't
mention that in your email. The trouble is that as long as he is rewarded
socially he will see no reason to change his bigoted beliefs, nor will the
guys watching at home.

Indeed. There has been something in the knee jerk condemnation of the
Rick Warren selection that has been bugging me, and I think this puts
the finger on it. I don't like Rick Warren and I disagree with his
politics. But that's hardly a new thing for me when it comes to
questions of preachers on the national stage. If I had my druthers,
there'd be no prayers at all and the ceremony would be entirely
secular. But then, I voted for Obama knowing that he was a religious
third way centrist and not expecting him to be the great progressive
hope that clearly many of my friends and allies on the left thought
he would be. I do know that I'm tired of us vs them and I'm tired of
the culture war. it's not my fight and I don't want to keep fighting
it and i find moves like this one that are attempts to step beyond it
are more compelling to me than the sort of nonsense that 60s style
protest leftism calls for. That movement beyond is the thing that I
have always found compelling about Obama and I remain encouraged to
see where he will go with it.

My biggest fear is that everyone will relax like they did after Bill
Clinton was elected.

OR WORSE not pay attention like they did after Bill Clinton was elected.

Bill Clinton was much worse for queer people in many ways than Bush
ever was, which is why I agree with Troy here.

But I also agree it would be good if Elizabeth chose to read a poem in
protest of Warren's invitation, my whole point to the letter was TO
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN ANYTHING AT ALL!

BUT SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN!

The truth is I fear nothing will happen.  I fear she will read a poem
that says great things about Obama, or, a poem about the state of the
world, but nothing in protest about the very clear homophobia at hand.
 And Rick Warren will do his thing.  And everyone will go home.

With the distractions of a landsliding economy and war on more than
one front, IT'S PERFECT TIMING to stick it to the queer community ONCE
AGAIN.  People LOVE TO HAVE a place to STICK their frustrations and
irrational fears.

Proposition 8 was a great BONDING experience for bigots everywhere to
HAVE THE POWER to tell the queers to fuck off, once again.

A BIG FAT public announcement from Elizabeth Alexander saying NO THANK
YOU BARAK OBAMA is kind of great though.  Though I seriously doubt it
will happen that way, or any way I hope it to happen.

Oh, and for those who think this is Obama's way of creating "dialogue"
um, how is that?  THAT is dialouge?  Well why not invite the Ku Klux
Klan while you're at it?  Bigots UNITE!  I simply don't understand how
this is in any possible way a form of "dialogue" frankly.

I'm NOT AFRAID of bigots, I just want my president that have MORE
FUCKING SENSE to NOT have them in my face for the celebration of his
new job.

But then again, that seems to be exactly what he wants, to have Warren
in our faces, to have Warren be his passive-aggressive mouth of
bigotry.

There is SO MUCH SUFFERING as it is in the queer community, queer
teens still having the highest rate of suicide.  And I think of all
the African American queers I have known over the years and how hard
it's been for them.

People voting FOR Obama also at the same time voted AGAINST civil
rights for queers.  That much we know to be true.

Paul this was such a weird thing to read.

I'm just this "left" guy who is gonna BE SHOWN?

You "love" how Obama told me that I'm a big fat zero and that I'm
worthless and that I'm not allowed to be on the same grounds as he and
his wife?

I need to "broaden" my "perspective" do I?

Yeah, guess I just need to understand that being 2nd class is OK.
Thanks for the tip.

Suffering is NOT entertaining to me, but it's fine with me that you "love" it.

You got that right, Paul.

I dont have high hopes for Obama, he being a US president-elect,
but I am impressed by his openness,
as in this instance.

As you USAmericans say: what wd Jesus have done?

this seems pretty light hearted.
I'm sorry to hear about the wicked (objects, et cetera) capitalist.
i suspect that the most die hard feminist could enjoy her/himself.

New York poetry brothel tempts with verse

Published: Friday December 19, 2008

http://rawstory.com/news/afp/New_York_poetry_brothel_tempts_with_12192008.html

The prostitute whispers, wets her lips and prepares to bare... her heart with a
poem.

Welcome to New York's Poetry Brothel, where punters delve between the
lines, not the sheets.

At a weekend session in a Manhattan night club called the Zipper Factory the
look was bona fide bordello.

Literary ladies of the night flitted between intimate, candle-lit nooks, red
lights and paintings of nudes.

Some of the poetesses for sale sported retro-style garter belts and frilly
knickers. One swanned about in a top hat and feather boa.

But transactions at the Poetry Brothel are of the mind, not the body, and a
moment with the catalogue, replete with pictures and whimsical descriptions,
reveals what's on offer.

Page four boasts The Professor, swearing to have heard "the wail of your
striving heart drifting over the spires of skyscrapers."

Harriett Van Os on page 10 promises to "tell you secrets she doesn't
know she knows." Cecille Ballroom tempts punters on page 13 claiming she
can "coax your drum."

Gigolo poets are available, not least Poetry Brothel co-founder Nicholas
Adamski, who goes by the name Tennessee Pink and tops tempestuous, dark looks
with an eye patch.

"Poetry is what I love more than anything," cooed The Madame, the
sultry spirit behind the whole idea.

The Madame -- real name Stephanie Berger -- came dressed for the part in
low-cut dress, elbow-length black gloves and a peacock headdress.

"I'd rather be in the bedroom hearing poetry than listening to some
old man sitting on a chair on a stage," she explained by the light of a
guttering candle.

One-on-one encounters, for which "clients" pay three to five dollars
in addition to a 15 dollar entry fee and one free reading, took place upstairs.

The "whores" read from their own material, much of which is free
verse, making for intense, sometimes baffling performances.

But for those needing a break, the Poetry Brothel laid on flamenco guitarists,
a fortune-teller, a blackjack table and a bar specializing in port and whisky

The young hedonists, most of them students, appear to have struck a
surprisingly successful formula.

"There just aren't that many poetry readings where poets show a lot of
cleavage," said The Professor, otherwise known as Jennifer Michael Hecht,
aged 43 and a real life professor at Manhattan's New School.

She teaches writing to many of the Brothel's regulars and is proud of the
result.

"It's kind of like the Weimar Republic without the Nazis. At two in
the morning you have 20- or 30-year-olds lying all over the place reading
poetry," she said.

"The custom is to read poetry alone, but we know that from Homer onward,
people read it aloud and in groups."

By midnight the Zipper Factory was packed and getting fuller -- and rowdier.

The fortune teller, bedecked in red scarf and blue plumes, mumbled to someone
about "choppy waters." The flamenco duo strummed. The Madame, yet
another glass of port in hand, introduced poet "whores" in a voice
suggesting she appreciated more than their literary charms.

When Patricia Smith, a well-established poet, took the mike to declaim a long
and rhythmical poem about love and making love, there were rock concert cheers
from the crowd.

"I always shudder when I pray," Smith intoned in a mesmerizing voice,
"so your name must be a prayer."

Even for these bohemians there's no escaping the economic crisis sweeping
the country.

One of the poets, 22-year-old Nina Cheng, was about to start a job at Bear
Stearns this year when the bank collapsed. Now she is writing a play about the
experience and applying for a playwright's course at Yale.

"I'd thought I'd do banking and get into the arts when I retired
-- not this early," said Cheng, known at the Brothel as The Opium Eater.

Another poetry prostitute, 27-year-old Rachel Herman-Gross, aka Simone, worried
that crashing stock markets will pull the rug from under the arts scene.
"It's going to be a lot harder. A lot of artists are sustained by
grants from people with money."

But one enthusiastic "client" said the ingenuity of the Poetry
Brothel proves there are ways to survive.

"Money's always been scarce for artists and they're very
resourceful people," said Edmund Voyer, 54, a hefty man described as an
"evangelist" on his business card and who came to the Zipper Factory
wearing a kilt.

His drinking companion, Jennifer Hoa, 27, agreed money and art would always
find ways to meet.

"I've been a sell-out for years as a corporate lawyer, but I come
here," she said. "I can't suppress my artistic side."

The Madame promised that the Poetry Brothel welcomed all.

"Many are young men with perhaps a secret interest in poems," she
murmured. "Just look at the menu. Get a recommendation. Or say you
don't care. Say: 'I need poetry. I'm hungry.'"

As somebody suggested somewhere, the intense heat and exposure of Obama's p=
rovocative (to put it mildly) Warren invitation, may have the consequence o=
f giving Obama a 'quid por quo' opportunity to eliminate the Military's Gay=
 policy quagmire=A0 of=A0 'don't ask, don't tell'.=20

That also might be a 'prayer' but let's hope (or pressure) to be surprised.

This is quite persuasive, Paul. Dialogism works in and for opposites, not i=
n
sameness, not for compatibles. Thanks to William Blake for saying, in The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell, "Without Contraries is no progression.
Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary t=

Conversation: regarding bigotry, big ideas & the inaugural
Subject: regarding bigotry, big ideas & the inaugural

Much as one sympathizes with President-elect Obama=B9s rationale for inviting
Rick Warren to participate in the inaugural ceremony, this is one calculate=
d
risk that should not be taken and plainly has not been sufficiently thought
through.

That the President-elect promises to be a shining example of
post-ideological politics is one thing, that he may defeat this great
promise with yet another sort of ideology, the Big Idea of bringing togethe=
r
diverse, and often contradictory, elements of the national culture is
another: like most big ideas, this one fails the moment one element, or
segment =8B or more to the point, one person -- of the culture is left out or
devalued.=20

However modified Warren=B9s bigotry may be by his other, kinder views, that
bigotry is a national disgrace.
To invite him to drag it along to the grandstand on Inauguration Day is an
insult to the Constitution the incoming President will swear perforce to
protect.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to announce Samantha Giles
as the organization's new Executive Director.

Samantha Giles was born in Oakland and raised in Santa
Monica, California. She returned to the Bay Area in 1996,
to complete her Bachelors of Social Work at San Francisco
State University. From 1999 to 2004, she was the Community
Arts Program Director for Central City Hospitality House,
providing artistic access for homeless people in San Francisco's
Tenderloin district. Her extensive administrative, programmatic
and curatorial work during her tenure there helped stabilize
and grow a program of disparate, often unheard voices.
In 2008, she received her MFA from Mills College, where
she also served as Managing Editor for 580 Split.  Her work
appears in numerous journals and web-zines.

Samantha will serve as the Director beginning January 1, 2009.

We look forward to working with Samantha
and to seeing you all in the year ahead!

Hi Conrad,

That's a terrific letter to Elizabeth Alexander.

The Rick Warren appointment to invoke, or evoke, or whatever preachers
do up in your hemisphere at inaugurations is perhaps the first
disappointment. (hope there aren't too many more yet)

Have to remember - Obama IS a politician.


Have a great silly season - Ruth, Conrad, Poeticists

Churches in D.C. have been courting the Obamas, who haven't attended church since April when they left Trinity UCC in Chicago -- after 20 years according to one report -- due to controversy over Rev. Wright's sermons.? UCC is pro-gay rights and in recent years, pro-gay marriage.? I checked this: Trinity in particular is specifically in favor of gay rights, including marriage.? A UCC church was burned over the synod vote for gay marriage a few years ago.? Tell me the Obamas attended Trinity regularly that long while harboring anti-gay sentiment; it doesn't make sense.? They would have left long before they did if they didn't like the emphasis on gay rights theologically or socially.? It also doesn't make sense to me that a long-term UCC family would be attracted to non-denominational evangelical fundamentalist Christianity.? Is telling Elizabeth Alexander what to protest a protest of both poet and pastor?? In any case, protest over Rick Warren seems necessary.? AMB

Yes, exactly! The moment this occurs, us vs. them is being reified, even if
it is done in the name of bringing 'us' together.

Me too. I am getting more and more discouraged by the calls for
censorship from the "left."
I speak as a non USAmerican who sees Obama as right of most tolerable
governments in the western world.
I had never heard of this preacher till I saw a piece on him in your
Time Magazine a while back.
But it doesn't bother me that he is going to show up at the
inauguration. I mean most civilized people
don't get it that in places like the US and Iran there has to be
religious approval for inaugurations and on the money.

Inflammatory language such as this is kind of playing into the hands
of the right,
isn't it? Wouldn't it be better to prove more intelligent than the
jerks?
Inflammatory language should be left to the lockstep fundamentalists in
the Middle-East and the US South, for example.
Or anywhere.

Did Obama say those things you have him saying, CA?
I like you, and I am with you,
but I hate to see you playing into their hands.

Ruth,

I see the piece as both funny and not funny, i.e., ironic. When
Salieri (?) objected to Mozart that his music had too many notes,
Wolfie replied "Which ones would you eliminate?" Which kinds
of hyperbole would you eliminate? Would you also decree such
usages as "If a person wants to succeed, s/he must do his/her
work him/herself"? Would you keep the asterisks in HOWL's
first edition: "Who with mother finally ******"? It seems to me
that poets "don' need no steenking badches."

 I agree with Elizabeth S. -- and thanks to CA Conrad, for his persistance
with this issue.

Elizabeth's articulate defense here explains just why it is right to say No
to the Inaugural invite  --unless, perhaps, Obama, under political pressure,
changes his "preacher"  to someone who has done the right things in "her"
career toward everyone (changing the implicit male pronoun); someone who has
not called any group of citizens, including Gays, bigoted names -- and there
are many, many to chose from in American religious networks.

Obama made a serious mistake.  He needs to admit it and make a correction.
Now THAT would be leadership we haven't seen in awhile.

I understand the idea that you have to be inside the system to make a
difference, or that you have to have a public platform to verbally
articulate a point.  However, I do hope that Elizabeth Alexander is reading
us, and that however she choses to make the point, she will do so in her own
way, and strongly.  Stepping off the stage makes its own strong statement.
And I do NOT agree that the only way to make a difference is to work from
within (on the "stage of")  a compromised system.  Change does not just
occur from inside.  It changes in all kinds of ways and through various acts
that all of us in any moment may know about and record, or may not know
about and record.  It means that each act of protest joins other acts.
Solidarity among those of us who believe in COMPLETE Civil Rights for every
person and citizen has its own pragmaticism -- and, I would add, its own
"broader perspective."

I write this as a white heterosexual.  I think I have a "broader
perspective."  And I DEMAND that Obama DEMAND -- starting with his great
public theater in January, called the Inauguration -- that every one of us
have equal rights.  And that Obama's stance on this be symbolically
registered, starting Day 1 of his presidency.

I totally agree with CA Conrad's remarks on Gay scapegoating (see below*).
This particular bigotry of Warren's can be seen as another scapegoating
tactic that undermines every member of a society of "free debate."
Laura

* CA Conrad's words: "With the distractions of a landsliding economy and war
on more than
one front, IT'S PERFECT TIMING to stick it to the queer community ONCE
AGAIN"

A few people wrote personal notes to me saying that they're tired of
the culture wars.

Um, this isn't some Queer Theory Class to me, THIS IS MY LIFE, and I'm
not the type of fag who gets pushed around, I PUSH BACK, which is why
I take stands.  Which is why I'm appealing to Elizabeth Alexander's
higher self.  It must be VERY DIFFICULT to be invited to do such a
reading, such a historical reading.  Well, it would be difficult for
me.

One person wrote me asking me to take "the higher road like Gandhi."
Um, my protest suggestions were ALL nonviolent, I mean, I didn't ask
Elizabeth to STAB someone at the microphone.  Geeze, it's so
ridiculous reading such e-mails.

AND I I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT:
If Obama were white, and chose a pastor who was openly racist NO ONE
would question my anger.  Well, unless you were also racist, but you
know exactly what I'm saying here.  Queer rights may keep taking a
back seat as long as I'm alive, but that just means I'll go to the
grave YELLING!

as with any President- 'select'

he's got about 20% wiggle-room
(witness JFK, RFK, MLK)
which is about as much

a great storm of words, ones

Conversation: regarding bigotry, big ideas & the inaugural
Subject: regarding bigotry, big ideas & the inaugural

Much as one sympathizes with President-elect Obama¹s rationale for inviting
Rick Warren to participate in the inaugural ceremony, this is one calculated
risk that should not be taken and plainly has not been sufficiently thought
through.

That the President-elect promises to be a shining example of
post-ideological politics is one thing, that he may defeat this great
promise with yet another sort of ideology, the Big Idea of bringing together
diverse, and often contradictory, elements of the national culture is
another: like most big ideas, this one fails the moment one element, or
segment < or more to the point, one person -- of the culture is left out or
devalued.

However modified Warren¹s bigotry may be by his other, kinder views, that
bigotry is a national disgrace.
To invite him to drag it along to the grandstand on Inauguration Day is an
insult to the Constitution the incoming President will swear perforce to
protect.

Jason,

What a relief, many thanks for your message condemning the us v.themism
Of these GLBT (my adaptation) bigots who leave you thinking that their
bigotry is perhaps more strident and more inflexible than that of Warren
himself!  I too am tired of the culture war which can only be exacerbated
and perpetuated by such invective.  Long live the middle way!
And Obamas openness for dialogue, which encourages me also. I look forward
to an end of this tiresome conversation.

CA,

Have you sent your letter to Elizabeth?  I just looked at her site
(http://www.elizabethalexander.net/home.html) and there's a contact
phone number and email address there.

love, as always, Sharon M.

BYSTANDER: An Irreality by mIEKAL aND

A 'pataphysical post-apocalytpic novella in 3 movements

=B7 Paperback: 130 pages
=B7 Publisher: BlazeVOX [books]
=B7 ISBN: 1-934289-63-9

http://www.blazevox.org/bk-ma.htm

What would happen if words, disguised as characters Balboa Pettibone =20
and She-singer, could hallucinate and time travel? mIEKAL aND, one of =20=

our most intrepid verbal explorers, takes us into the world of genre =20
fiction and sets it spinning into an =93irreality=94 as iridescent as =
myth =20
clothed in neon language.   The sideways feints and flourishes of =20
aND's words lead us through a minefield of future decay, artfully =20
finding glimmers of beauty and eros even in the most blasted lang-=20
scapes and bone-scrapes. In a world where =93a blackened sky corrupt[s] =20=

the horizon,=94 =93snakes of anger=94 war with =93snakes of confusion,=94 =
and =20
=93there are no curtains between darkness and its opposite,=94 the =
beauty =20
of the words themselves offer joy in apocalyptic circumstance. And =20
courtly love wins the day.

Maria Damon

There is a secret travelogue through the irreal estate of the 20th =20
century, a picaresque that passes down the arcades of the Invisible =20
Cities, across the plains of Flatland, through the Gardens of Priapus =20=

to the foothills of Mount Analogue. Between the lines of Bystander: An =20=

Irreality, mIEKAL aND has thoughtfully printed you a map for the next =20=

leg of the journey. Pack your sieve and your bicycle; it's a long trip.

Darren Wershler

_Bystander: An irreality_ is indeed an irreality or sobreality so vivd =20=

it brings senses to a full function and merges the one into the =20
implications of the text. What I experiencet wasnt prose or poetry in =20=

its common definition. Its written just and laconic. Exactly the =20
amount and texture of information needed to hook the right senses and =20=

teleport one inside. Psy-fi and a metaphor for the webbed chronology =20
of thought and remembered events, reconstructed map of communication. =20=

After digestion i found a brain map that emerged, map of how thoughts =20=

are layed and georgraphical x-ray of how they settle and drift with/ =20
within time.   The process of reading or rather drinking pleasantly =20
hurts the neurons, like adrenaline that spreads from the head to =20
appendages. I want to repeat the journey on my own after watching =20

For anyone remotely to the left of what used to be liberal who buys Obama's
insulting-to-my-intelligence rationale for affording a prominent position to
the homophobic, anti-Choice Christian evangelist (yeah really, if we have to
be overdosed with religion contra to the spirit of the Establishment Clause,
why not include leaders of all of the religions, plus an atheist like Noam
Chomsky? -- joke), I refer you to
http://makethemaccountable.com/index.php/category/media-news/.  You and
others here might also want to take a look at Obama's record and statements
in regard to Native American rights. Frankly, he doesn't give a damn.
http://www.nativeamericansrightsassociation.com/Obama_FIles.html.  And
frankly, we have to be watchdogs.  This is the politician who voted for the
FISA Amendment.  As someone here pointed out, he's basically a centrist,
hardly a progressive, though of course, anyone would be an improvement over
Bush, one would HOPE.

In regard to CA Conrad's excellent letter to Elizabeth Alexander, how can we
sign onto it?  Do you (CA) suggest that we simply forward it to Graywolf
Press?

Thanks,

Carol

At a party last night I had an odd conversation with a friend I
hadn't spoken to since before the election. My friend is in his
sixties. He had spent two months as a fulltime volunteer for the
Obama campaign. I commented, I thought rather modestly, and none to
originally, that a lot of what Obama has said he hopes to do would be
constrained by the economic crisis, what with bailout plans and
falling revenues. My friend said he had faith in Obama's intelligence
to figure out how to do it all. Then he got scary--his eyes had the
faraway look of the convert to a new religion. "He has a lot of the
characteristics traditionally associated with sainthood," my friend told
me.

I don't know if saints are supposed to keep us guessing, but I don't
think elected officials are. Certainly we had to guess enough in the
last eight years to last a lifetime.

Well, I guarantee all of your backchannel correspondents that if Alexander
leads anybody in a march down to the Potomac, whatever she finds floating
there will not be salt. It's cleaner than it used to be, but still, do not
attempt salt-harvesting from the Potomac.

Seriously, if we could start the '90s with Maya Angelou having the word (and
no more than that, but still, the word) "gay" in her inaugural poem for
Clinton, surely Alexander could slip some inclusiveness into hers as well?
Or, you know, do one of the other nonviolent things you suggested? Unlike
that notorious suicide bomber, Gandhi?

Instead of protesting the preacher we should work toward discrediting the
notion that we need preachers.

It'll go away if no one listens.

Why is the capitalist exploitation of women at a brothel worse than, say,
the capitalist exploitation of women at a Zipper Factory?  It's just a
different kind of labor, no?  Given that some artists are seemingly
comfortable with capitalism, why should they not acknowledge it in the name
of their ventures?

I understand, of course, that brothels have a particular history with a
particular kind of violence attached to it, but so do factories.  Do you
direct the same righteous anger at Andy Warhol?

Roy,

I know you're trying to argue for what you call "the middle way," and
while I'm all for conversation across issues, bringing together
people of varying views, etc., in this case I just don't see a middle
way -- I mean, it's not ok to oppress people "halfway." I don't see
how one can support some civil rights, but not others, or rights for
some groups of people, but not others. I concede George's point that
the US is generally to the right of most nations, or at least most
western nations, in our politics. I would rather not have a minister
at all at the inauguration. But if one, not this one. And if it is
this one, there should be some yelling. I'm not GLBT, so technically
you can't, I think, label me a "GLBT bigot." I'm just trying to sort
through these issues, with others, in a way that makes sense, and
honors human dignity.

George, are you now becoming a defender of prescriptive grammar?
Would you have us all speak in gentle tones, possibly not dare to eat
a peach, and certainly not spell SPACE large because it comes large
here, large and without mercy.

(ah but I think I've exceeded my posts today, and this one will die
in that SPACE across which we meet)

"I'm a Christian. And so, although I try not to have my religious beliefs
dominate or determine my political views on this issue, I do believe that
tradition, and my religious beliefs say that marriage is something
sanctified between a man and a woman."

Obama's words. And note: Not "I will not let my religious beliefs dominate
or determine..." but "I try not to let my religious beliefs dominate or
determine..." (How humble!) And not just "I try not to let my religious
beliefs dominate or determine..." but "although I try not to... I do believe
in that tradition, and my religious beliefs say..." The man IS clever with
words.

So why shouldn't his inauguration feature people who shares his views on the
matter? Or to be more blunt, why should anyone who has been paying attention
be surprised, or "disappointed," that he should want to share the stage with
someone like Rick Warren? Those with residual stars in their eyes, read Paul
Street, please.

An Open Letter to Elizabeth Alexander?=20

How about an Open Letter to Every American--

"tear the doors loose from the jambs!!!"

as a great poet wrote--

"Respondez Respondez!!!"

Didn't the people just turn ou tin the greatest numbers ever to=20
Democratically" elect=2C for a cool Billion Bucks=2C the Candidate of their=
 Choice--

isn't the message really one directed at all the people=2C only no one take=
s it seriously until it affects them?

an open Letter that each person needs to write to themself also--?

saying Wake Up!!!!




A friend gave me a stack of old Ebony and Jet magazines recently=2C and in =
an Ebony from 2004 there was a one page spread among the top notch ads on a=
 slick page some fotos of Congressman Obama=2C handsome and smiling walking=
 on a very mice street in his shirtsleeves=2C just beginning his campaign t=
o be Illinois' next Senator and=2C if vctorious=2C the one Black Senator at=
 the time in DC.

Two years after that photo the President-Elect launched the two year 1 Bill=
ion $ journey to the the Inaugeration.=20

Late last Spring Senator Obama cut cold his friend and Pastor of 20 years=
=2C the man who had married the Obamas and baptised their children. Apparen=
tly Reverend Wright=2C shown in a noin stop loop of one clip=2C had offende=
d deeply the pundits at Fox and --well--"America"--with his "radical views =
and America hating sermons."

Senator Obama said hardly a word about the friend he had called a Mentor--a=
 man once a huge part of his life vanished down the oubliette as fast as th=
ose persons who one day would be in a foto walking and smiling next to Stal=
in=2C Mao=2C Hitler--and the next day--no longer there at all in the now ON=
LY  "real" foto in which Stalin smiles and walks along=2C humming no doubt=
=2C accompanied only by a tree in the background=2C and the vast expanse of=
 a Stalinist Sky=2C which=2C no doubt about it=2C "is not cloudy all day."

In June=2C Senator Obama gave what has been called the most obsequois speec=
h to AIPAC ever given byan American candidate seeking election.  Even oppon=
ents of Senator Obama were embarassed by the fawning display of "fealty" (t=
he term used)=2C in which a Black man running for the highest office in the=
 land in a "historic" campaig of "change" pledged total allegeinace to an A=
partheid State as the number one pririoity of US  policy.

Since the election=2C the President -Elect has surrounded himself with the =
likes of  Coporate America's best friend=2C Rahm Emmanueal (who has curious=
ly almost vanished since it became known there are tapes of him having some=
 dubious chats with the Governor of Illinois=2C as well as being the subjec=
t of an FBI inevstigation as a suspected Mossad agent)=2C and a long list o=
f hard core War  Hawks=2C Wall Street fixers (to "fix the economy" which th=
ey destroyed)=2C and such old War Criminals as Madeliene "The Mad Bomber"  =
"500=2C 000 dead Iraqi children is not a high cost compared to the good of =
the sanctions" Albright and a host of other apparatcheks=2C lifetime Washin=
gton Ghouls dripping with the bloody secrets of decades of Advising leaders=
 and cruising the Friendly Global Skies on Company time and pay-- they're b=
aaaaa---ccckkkk !!! again--the samo samo State Craft  Persons=2C the samo s=
amo War Criminal War Crazed=2C the samo samo collection of revolving door l=
obbyists-office holders helping create a seamless Corporate State Fascism a=
 la Mussolni=2C and the long line of lizards lured out from under the rocks=
 where they are altering documents as they crank out their Memoirs of "Stat=
e Craft=2C" "Decision Maiking=2C" and "Geo Political Fantasies."

"To change everything so that nothing is changed=2C "as the great Sicilian =
writer Tomasso Lampedusa succinctly observed.

Having disappeared his friend and Mentor=2C having sworn allegiance to prot=
ect eternally Apartheid=2C having  flung wide the  door to the samo samo cr=
owd of  trigger happy fixers=2C crooks=2C looters=2C FBI invstigation subje=
cts=2C the samo samo "wise persons" who have led the country from one disas=
ter to the next while pocketing fortunes and endlessly banging the drums to=
 "let loose the Dogs of War"--and dstroy as many millions as possible to st=
eal the most resources posible--

Having done al this before even taking office=2C why should one be shocked =
or surprised that the Gigantic  Genial Bigot will mount the stage and launc=
h some sort of rhetorical juggernaut antithetical to Christ's own teachings=
 in the name of "Christian" double talk?  Isn't double talk all that is lef=
t anyway?

Heck=2C even John McCain realized that the  "Straight Talk Express " won't =
get you anywhere--

No=2C  to be a real Politico you have to hew the line close to the Poetics =
of ambiguity=2C opacity=2C high flights of Formalist rhetorical flourishes-=
-

After all=2C isn't the New President a "Poet"--???

Apparently reaching across the aisles and "going beyond" left and right ide=
ologically doesn't mean all people are  included=2C only some. Apartheid=2C=
 bigotry=2C the complete "white washing" of American Indians=2C the total i=
nsult to the LGBT communities that worked so hard for ths "new kind of Lead=
er"--


It is just like Orwell's Animal Farm=2C in which the Aniamls revolt and sta=
rt to install a fdarm where "Alla Animals Are Equal=2C" only to find that s=
omehow they are electing leaders who have decided that "All Animals Are Equ=
al=2C But Some Are More Equal than Others."=20
=20

I just don't think that Obama is mirroring "openness for dialogue" by
selecting a "pastor" to represent his "religious views" -- in the huge
public forum that is the American presidential inauguration -- who has
condemned the basic humanity of a certain group of people, based on their
sexuality.  This to me is FAKE OPENNESS.  Because it symbolically leaves a
huge segment of the people of this society OUTSIDE the debate.

Some eyes seem glazed by the Obama honeymoon.  I love the guy, too.  But I
see what I see -- no fairy dust.  He made a mistake.

OK, he is being a Politician:  the Warren choice is a cynical appeal to the
Sarah Palin crowd on inauguration day.  That happens not to be OK with me.
Call it "culture wars" and dismiss my views.  (I hear that all in time, as a
feminist academic not to mention as a poet.  This kind of labeling is just
another way of categorizing my view, and others' who share it:  that
everyone, actually, should be allowed inside the debates.)

Now I'm not against Obama inviting Warren to the White House for a chat.
Hey, he can even have the Warrens -- assuming this guy, Rick Warren, who I'd
never heard of before last week, plays the role of Victorian patriarch with
his probable brood and Wife -- for a lovely dinner.  Get the china out,
Michelle.  (She'll have to play Wife, too, of course.)   I think Nancy
Reagan left some nice china  in the White House cupboards (if the Clintons
didn't chip it too badly, or W didn't kick it with his boots).

But -- and I would say this to President-elect Obama: don't make this
particular "pastor" stand for the "American pastor" (I heard this on the
News Hour), giving the signal that Gay bashing is back in.  CA Conrad's
point is so true:  Obama would have never selected a racist bigot to stand
on that stage with him.  Never.

Happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas and thanks for the stimulating dialogue.

To Mr. Obama

Inviting Rick Warren to your inauguration was a horrible idea. His
anti-gay-rights and anti-women, anti-choice ideas are an embarassment
to a country that pretends to stand for liberty and equality, and by
giving him this platform you are recognizing him above all other
clergy in the country, many of whom are much more genuinely dedicated
to the ideals of love and acceptance that your religion supposedly
advocates. I am an atheist myself and I am put off by any sort of
religious benediction at important state events, but I understand the
symbolic significance of this for many people.

There are (roughly) two ways your decision could be interpreted:
either you mostly agree with Warren and you feel he is worthy of this
distinction, or else you disagree with him but feel that the
inauguration should represent the different prominent ideologies of
the populace, and this is your way of fostering "dialogue." I
certainly hope, and have some reason to think, that the former isn't
true, so I am assuming it's the latter. I like the idea of dialogue,
openness, and inclusion, but I think your invitation to Warren does
not serve this ideal. It actually prevents dialogue by exclusively
privileging someone who is not open and not inclusive.

I hope you will take steps to fix this mistake. Univiting Rick Warren
would be great, but I recognize that you are in politics and for
political reasons you may not see this as an option. Therefore I
strongly urge you to invite other clergy to take part who do not
share Warren's close-minded, bigoted stances. If dialogue is what you
want, then allow differing views. If you were to invite Gene
Robinson, for example, the first openly gay bishop, then I could
believe that your invitation to a homophobic right-wing evangelist
was more than just a cheap bid for political support. Ask them to
share the stage, and then we'll see who is really committed to dialogue.

 "Did she do it when he went to the shelf behind the cash register to
fetch the baby oil for the mother who'd just wheeled her toddler's
stroller into the store? Did she snatch it from the Revlon sample
display? Did she run? Or did she walk out the door casually to make it
look as if she had nothing to hide? Once out in the street, did she hurry
to the corner? Did the sun blind her? Did she run then... past the
firehouse, the Methodist Church on the corner, the lumberyard? God, how
did she keep herself from running back to the drugstore and falling on her
knees and begging the old man to forgive her?"

Nanao was one of the participants in the Japanese Poetry Festival we (The
Committee for International Poetry) organized in New York City in the early
eighties.

Do you remember his poem about taking a crap?

Political correctness be dammed, I like the idea of "Poetry Brothel".
Firstly, isn't feminine or feminist poetry (whichever you prefer) spoken
from the body. Secondly, here is a legally sanctioned place of 'intercourse'
(the poetic kind, a.k.a. communication) where the practitioner are
protected. For those of you who are speaking out against the body being used
in commerce, why are you not speaking out against football or hockey where
male bodies are being used in commerce? When you consider the damage that is
done to the male body during that contact sport and the lingering effects of
it in terms of permanent injury and disability such as arthritis and other
diseases, isn't this just as bad? Or is it that one affects women whereas
the other affects men? If we're going to get on a train, lets get on the
right one - the one that carries both male and female on equal terms.

Why is the capitalist exploitation of women at a brothel worse than, say,
the capitalist exploitation of women at a Zipper Factory?  It's just a
different kind of labor, no?  Given that some artists are seemingly
comfortable with capitalism, why should they not acknowledge it in the name
of their ventures?

I understand, of course, that brothels have a particular history with a
particular kind of violence attached to it, but so do factories.  Do you
direct the same righteous anger at Andy Warhol?

Ruth,

I think your examples move from irony to absurdity.

How would one conduct a poetry holocaust--have poets
read, then kill them? Walter Benjamin saw poetry after
the holocaust as too insensitive (in The Pripet Marshes,
Irving Feldman gave us reason to disagree, as did
Yevtushenko in Babi Yar). Does Swift writing about
eating babies seem insensitive?

The analogy about a 'poetry plantation' interests me
more. In the hands of Eddie Murphy (or Amiri Baraka,
Tracie Morris, Nate Mackey?) that might provide some
very pointed satire about oppressive authority (e.g., of
the poetry establishment and the aristocracy of workshops).

Some folks would wince at Ed Sanders' The VFW Crawling
Contest, or lots of Ezra Pound, or Bukowski. Fahrenheit 451
'em? Kilmer's Trees gets me queasy. Piss Christ? Rudy, Rudy.

The Poetry Brothel seems clearly satirical. I think it makes
sense to see it in that context. Sacred cows often provide
the choicest milk.

Nobel-winning playwright
Harold Pinter dies at 78

By PAISLEY DODDS=2C Associated Press Writer Paisley Dodds=2C Associated Pre=
ss Writer Thu Dec 25=2C
9:44 am ET=20

LONDON =96 Harold Pinter=2C praised as the most influential British
playwright of his generation and a longtime voice of political protest=2C h=
as
died after a long battle with cancer. He was 78.


Pinter=2C whose distinctive contribution to the stage was recognized with t=
he Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005=2C died on Wednesday=2C
according to his second wife=2C Lady Antonia Fraser.


"Pinter restored theater to its basic elements: an enclosed space and
unpredictable dialogue=2C where people are at the mercy of each other and
pretense crumbles=2C" the Nobel
 Academy said when it announced
Pinter's award. "With a minimum of plot=2C drama emerges from the power
struggle and hide-and-seek of interlocution."


The Nobel Prize gave Pinter a global platform which he seized
enthusiastically to denounce U.S. President George W. Bush and then-British
Prime Minister Tony Blair.


"The invasion of Iraq
was a bandit act=2C an act of blatant state terrorism=2C
demonstrating absolute contempt for the concept of international law=2C"
Pinter said in his Nobel lecture=2C which he recorded rather than traveling=
 to Stockholm.


"How many people do you have to kill before you qualify to be described
as a mass murderer and a war criminal? One hundred thousand?" he asked=2C i=
n
a hoarse voice.


Weakened by cancer and bandaged from a fall on a slippery pavement=2C Pinte=
r
seemed a vulnerable old man when he emerged from his London home to
speak about the Nobel Award.


Though he had been looking forward to giving a Nobel lecture =97 "the
longest speech I will ever have made" =97 he first canceled plans to attend
the awards=2C then announced he would skip the lecture as well on his docto=
r's
advice.


Pinter wrote 32 plays=3B one novel=2C "The Dwarfs=2C" in 1990=3B and put
his hand to 22 screenplays including "The Quiller
Memorandum" (1965) and "The French
Lieutenant's Woman" (1980). He admitted=2C and said he deeply
regretted=2C voting for Margaret Thatcher in 1979
and Tony Blair in 1997.


Pinter fulminated against what he saw as the overweening arrogance of
American power=2C and belittled Blair as seeming like a "deluded idiot"
in support of Bush's war in Iraq.


In his Nobel lecture=2C Pinter accused the United States of supporting
"every right-wing military dictatorship in the world" after World War II.


"The crimes of the United
  States have been systematic=2C constant=2C
vicious=2C remorseless=2C but very few people have actually talked about
them=2C" he said.


The United States=2C he
added=2C "also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead=
=2C
the pathetic and supine Great
  Britain."


Most prolific between 1957 and 1965=2C Pinter relished the juxtaposition of=
 brutality
and the banal and turned the conversational pause into an emotional minefie=
ld.


His characters' internal fears and longings=2C their guilt and difficult
sexual drives are set against the neat lives they have constructed in order=
 to
try to survive.


Usually enclosed in one room=2C they organize their lives as a sort of grim
game and their actions often contradict their words. Gradually=2C the layer=
s are
peeled back to reveal the characters' nakedness.


The protection promised by the room usually disappears and the language
begins to disintegrate.


Pinter once said of language=2C "The speech we hear is an indication of
that which we don't hear. It is a necessary avoidance=2C a violent=2C sly=
=2C and
anguished or mocking smoke screen which keeps the other in its true place. =
When
true silence falls we are left with echo but are nearer nakedness. One way =
of
looking at speech is to say that it is a constant stratagem to cover
nakedness."=20


Pinter's influence was felt in the United States in the plays of Sam Shepar=
d and David Mamet
and throughout British literature.=20


"With his earliest work=2C he stood alone in British theater up against
the bewilderment and incomprehension of critics=2C the audience and writers
too=2C" British playwright Tom Stoppard said
when the Nobel Prize was announced.=20


"Not only has Harold Pinter written some
of the outstanding plays of his time=2C he has also blown fresh air into th=
e
musty attic of conventional English literature=2C
by insisting that everything he does has a public and political
dimension=2C" added British playwright David Hare=2C
who also writes politically charged dramas.=20


The working-class milieu of plays like "The Birthday Party" and
"The Homecoming" reflected Pinter's
early life as the son of a Jewish tailor from London's
East End. He began his career in the provinces
as an actor.=20


In his first major play=2C "The Birthday Party" (1958)=2C intruders
enter the retreat of Stanley=2C a young man who is hiding from childhood gu=
ilt.
He becomes violent=2C telling them=2C "You stink of sin=2C you contaminate
womankind."=20


And in "The Caretaker=2C" a
manipulative old man threatens the fragile relationship of two brothers whi=
le
"The Homecoming" explores the hidden rage and confused sexuality of
an all-male household by inserting a woman.=20


In "Silence and Landscape=2C" Pinter moved from exploring the dark
underbelly of human life to showing the simultaneous levels of fantasy and
reality that equally occupy the individual.=20


In the 1980s=2C Pinter's only stage plays were one-acts: "A Kind of Alaska"=
 (1982)=2C
"One for the Road" (1984) and the
20-minute "Mountain Language" (1988).=20


During the late 1980s=2C his work became more overtly political=3B he said =
he
had a responsibility to pursue his role as "a citizen of the world in
which I live=2C (and) insist upon taking responsibility."=20


In March 2005 Pinter announced his retirement as a playwright to concentrat=
e
on politics. But he created a radio play=2C "Voices=2C" that was
broadcast on BBC radio to mark his 75th birthday.=20


"I have written 29 plays and I think that's really enough=2C" Pinter
said . "I think the world has had enough of my plays."=20


Pinter had a son=2C Daniel=2C from his marriage to actress
Vivien Merchant=2C which ended in divorce in 1980. That year he married
the writer Fraser.=20


"It was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years. He will never
be forgotten=2C" Fraser said.

AP moved this story about 2-1/2 hours ago, saying that NOBEL winning playwright Harold Pinter died last night. Few playwrights, as you know, won Nobel Literature prizes. Even fewer -- Pinter -- were married to another great writer, as the obit makes clear: Antonia Fraser.

An Open Letter to Elizabeth Alexander?=20

How about an Open Letter to Every American--

"tear the doors loose from the jambs!!!"

as a great poet wrote--

"Respondez Respondez!!!"

Didn't the people just turn ou tin the greatest numbers ever to=20
Democratically" elect, for a cool Billion Bucks, the Candidate of their
Choice--

isn't the message really one directed at all the people, only no one takes
it seriously until it affects them?

an open Letter that each person needs to write to themself also--?

saying Wake Up!!!!




A friend gave me a stack of old Ebony and Jet magazines recently, and in an
Ebony from 2004 there was a one page spread among the top notch ads on a sl=
ick
page some fotos of Congressman Obama, handsome and smiling walking on a ver=
y
mice street in his shirtsleeves, just beginning his campaign to be Illinois=
'
next Senator and, if vctorious, the one Black Senator at the time in DC.

Two years after that photo the President-Elect launched the two year 1 Bill=
ion
$ journey to the the Inaugeration.=20

Late last Spring Senator Obama cut cold his friend and Pastor of 20 years, =
the
man who had married the Obamas and baptised their children. Apparently Reve=
rend
Wright, shown in a noin stop loop of one clip, had offended deeply the pund=
its
at Fox and --well--"America"--with his "radical views and America
hating sermons."

Senator Obama said hardly a word about the friend he had called a Mentor--a=
 man
once a huge part of his life vanished down the oubliette as fast as those
persons who one day would be in a foto walking and smiling next to Stalin, =
Mao,
Hitler--and the next day--no longer there at all in the now ONLY=20
"real" foto in which Stalin smiles and walks along, humming no doubt,
accompanied only by a tree in the background, and the vast expanse of a
Stalinist Sky, which, no doubt about it, "is not cloudy all day."

In June, Senator Obama gave what has been called the most obsequois speech =
to
AIPAC ever given byan American candidate seeking election.  Even opponents =
of
Senator Obama were embarassed by the fawning display of "fealty" (the
term used), in which a Black man running for the highest office in the land=
 in a
"historic" campaig of "change" pledged total allegeinace to
an Apartheid State as the number one pririoity of US  policy.

Since the election, the President -Elect has surrounded himself with the li=
kes
of  Coporate America's best friend, Rahm Emmanueal (who has curiously almos=
t
vanished since it became known there are tapes of him having some dubious c=
hats
with the Governor of Illinois, as well as being the subject of an FBI
inevstigation as a suspected Mossad agent), and a long list of hard core Wa=
r=20
Hawks, Wall Street fixers (to "fix the economy" which they destroyed),
and such old War Criminals as Madeliene "The Mad Bomber"  "500,
000 dead Iraqi children is not a high cost compared to the good of the
sanctions" Albright and a host of other apparatcheks, lifetime Washington
Ghouls dripping with the bloody secrets of decades of Advising leaders and
cruising the Friendly Global Skies on Company time and pay-- they're
baaaaa---ccckkkk !!! again--the samo samo State Craft  Persons, the samo sa=
mo
War Criminal War Crazed, the samo samo collection of revolving door
lobbyists-office holders helping create a seamless Corporate State Fascism =
a la
Mussolni, and the long line of lizards lured out from under the rocks where=
 they
are altering documents as they crank out their Memoirs of "State
Craft," "Decision Maiking," and "Geo Political
Fantasies."

"To change everything so that nothing is changed, "as the great
Sicilian writer Tomasso Lampedusa succinctly observed.

Having disappeared his friend and Mentor, having sworn allegiance to protec=
t
eternally Apartheid, having  flung wide the  door to the samo samo crowd of=
=20
trigger happy fixers, crooks, looters, FBI invstigation subjects, the samo =
samo
"wise persons" who have led the country from one disaster to the next
while pocketing fortunes and endlessly banging the drums to "let loose the
Dogs of War"--and dstroy as many millions as possible to steal the most
resources posible--

Having done al this before even taking office, why should one be shocked or
surprised that the Gigantic  Genial Bigot will mount the stage and launch s=
ome
sort of rhetorical juggernaut antithetical to Christ's own teachings in the
name of "Christian" double talk?  Isn't double talk all that is
left anyway?

Heck, even John McCain realized that the  "Straight Talk Express "
won't get you anywhere--

No,  to be a real Politico you have to hew the line close to the Poetics of
ambiguity, opacity, high flights of Formalist rhetorical flourishes--

After all, isn't the New President a "Poet"--???

Apparently reaching across the aisles and "going beyond" left and
right ideologically doesn't mean all people are  included, only some.
Apartheid, bigotry, the complete "white washing" of American Indians,
the total insult to the LGBT communities that worked so hard for ths "new
kind of Leader"--


It is just like Orwell's Animal Farm, in which the Aniamls revolt and start
to install a fdarm where "Alla Animals Are Equal," only to find that
somehow they are electing leaders who have decided that "All Animals Are
Equal, But Some Are More Equal than Others."=20

Poet Hugh Fox: Way, Way Off The Road


In 2006 the Ibbetson Street Press published a controversial memoir of the=
=20
small press: =93Way, Way Off the Road=94 by the legendary poet, critic an=
d=20
translator Hugh Fox. The memoir was indeed controversial, and we got more=
=20
than a few angry calls from small press figures of the 60=92s and 70=92s =
who felt=20
Fox=92s portrayal of them was less than accurate. The book covered Fox=92=
s=20
involvement with COSMEP, (the seminal small press organization,) his=20
encounters with Charles Bukowski, Lyn Lifshin, Harry Smith, Len Fulton, A=
D=20
Winans, and many of the other players in the small press movement. In a=20=

recent editorial in The Small Press Review Len Fulton wrote of Hugh Fox:

=93For Hugh Fox the reach must be always for the grasp to be ever. He tak=
es=20
memory, mixes it with imagination, imagery, and an almost Teutonic lexica=
l=20
arsenal, and flings into the cosmos for the delectation of anyone who car=
es to=20
listen.

There is enough Fox to go around, and little on this planet he has missed=
 in his=20
fifty-odd years of publishing. Richard Kostelanetz calls him =93 the most=
=20
distinguished man of =93 alternative letters of our time=85.=94

I do have limited editions of the memoir for sale=85 a collector=92s item=
. The book=20
retails at 15 dollars with four dollars for shipping and handling. (lbbet=
son=20
Street Press 25 School St. Somerville, Mass. 02143) The book was designed=
=20
and edited by Steve Glines.

Agreed. My disagreement is with the tactics, not the sentiment behind
them.

Actually, i'd be willing to bet that Warren is in fact a racist
bigot. I think he's just too good a politician to air those
particular views in public.

Just thought I'd add that Rick Warren has said openly that he thinks
Jews are going to hell: http://www.americablog.com/2008/12/rick-warren-told-jewish-woman-she-was.html
. Not that this is particularly surprising, and I imagine it would
have been difficult to find an evangelical preacher who did not think
this, but it did make me wonder, had I been chosen as the inaugural
poet, how I would feel and what I would say about having to share the
stage with him.

this is what drives me nuts about this whole conversation. other
clergy, prominent respected clergy, with diametrically opposed views,
have been invited and were invited at the same time that Warren was.
Rev. Joseph Lowery is going to be delivering the benediction. It's
not as if Obama has just put Warren on a pedestal and gesticulating
grandly in his direction intoned in solemn aspect "this i believe."

this inauguration, ideologically, theologically, and politically is
much more nuanced symbolically than people are giving it credit for
being.

Omigod, you're so right. I hurt in my anterior cruciate ligaments for all of
those men FORCED or DECEIVED into collegiate and professional sports every
year; BEATEN if they try to leave; often denied any other employment options
in the case of being transgendered; not allowed to keep a PENNY of their
earnings... oh wait.

I hope Elizabeth Alexander makes a statement for gay rights at the inaugeration;

but has anybody noticed that, aside from announcement of deaths, magazines, and books, the content on this list has at long last reached 100% focus on debate of political/symbolic/moral issues--the brothel thread, the inaugeration, what can/shd we expect of Obama,

never aesthetics--

I'm not sure exactly what to make of this. Just saying.

New York, NY-- Poets & Writers has received the largest donation in its
38-year history. The Liana Foundation (established by the John and Susan
Jackson Family) will donate $2 million to endow The Jackson Poetry Prize.
The annual $50,000 prize, which was initiated in 2007, honors an American
poet of exceptional talent who has published at least one book of recognized
literary merit but has not yet received major national acclaim. The award is
designed to provide what all poets need -- time and the encouragement to
write.

"Receiving this generous gift during such a challenging time reminds us of
the importance of literature," said Elliot Figman, Executive Director of
Poets & Writers.

Since its founding in 1970, the mission of Poets & Writers has been to
foster the professional development of creative writers, to promote
communication throughout the U.S. literary community, and to help create an
environment in which literature can be appreciated by the widest possible
public. Poets & Writers accomplishes this by publishing /Poets & Writers
Magazine/, producing Poets & Writers Online, offering publishing information
and an online Directory of Writers, introducing emerging writers outside of
New York to the New York City literary community, and supporting writers
participating in public literary events through the Readings/Workshops
program.

Which is to say that Obama is trying to be all things to all people?

Jason, I didn't know that Joseph Lowery was also going to be speaking, so=
 my
note to the president-elect wasn't as well-researched as it could have be=
en,
but I stand by my characterization of the Warren invitation as a
distinction. I don't know how many clergy were invited, but only one of t=
hem
is giving the "invocation" =97 Rick Warren. You make it sound like he is =
just
one of many voices from across the spectrum, which isn't the case. He's b=
een
chosen for a very high profile role, and it's an honor he doesn't deserve=
.
In the past there have been as many as five clergy involved in a single
inauguration, and not just Christians either. Not that inviting a few mor=
e
religious folk, of whatever point of view, would make me happy, really=97=
my
point was more that I'd like to see a gay man of the cloth (or lesbian of=

the cloth) standing alongside Warren, in the hope of making him seem more=

ridiculous than scary.=20

if that's how you want to read it, then that's your option.

my take on this particular lazy machine is that it is part of the
move towards inclusiveness that Obama has been talking about since he

in the end, it's a dumb preacher saying a prayer at a public event
though. if anything all of this debate about it is just overcharging
a minor occurrence with excess meaning.

rick warren is ridiculous and anybody who finds him scary needs a =20
reality check. there are scary hatemongers out there. people who =20
advocate physical violence, people who think stoning gays and =20
lesbians in the public square is what oughta be done. by virtue of =20
his own desire to be a famous public religious leader, Rick Warren is =20=

entirely nonscary and to my knowledge is a more moderate anti-gay =20
than that. he's not a monster, he's just an idiot, as are the people =20
who look to him for spiritual counsel.

and yes, he is just one voice of many across a spectrum. and more =20
importantly he represents the beliefs of a significant swath of the =20
american people. the way people are talking about this it's almost =20
like the obama folks picked warren BECAUSE he was a misogynistic =20
homophobe. which is ridiculous. Clearly they picked him because he is =20=

a prominent conservative christian leader. I will give anybody who =20
can find me five prominent conservative christian pastors who support =20=

gay marriage, the rights of gays  to adopt, are prochoice, and =20
support easy access to birth control 5 US dollars. I know i'm not =20
gonna have to give that money to anybody because by definition no =20
conservative christian pastors believe any of those things because =20
they are CONSERVATIVE shristian pastors.

The reason I am really kind of annoyed at all of this is precisely =20
that. Rick Warren does not represent a fringe position, he is a =20
mainline conservative. Ever since Obama appeared on the national =20
stage he has been talking about breaking down the lines between =20
liberal and conservative, and talking about listening to the other =20
side and being pragmatic about focussing on those areas where =20
interests over lap as a way to build dialog that can then help us =20
movve towards resoltion on morecontentious issues. he has alwasy =20
indicated that he was going to have a seat at the table for =20
conservatives just as there would be one for liberals. well, guess =20
what, conservatives are bigots and homophobes and are anti-choice =20
misogynists. It's what makes them conservatives. if conservatives are =20=

going to be involved in the process, part of the dialog, or whatever =20
you want to call it, that means there are going to be figures on the =20
national stage who are taking part in trying to form policy who will =20
believe things that are reprehensibile. it's the ugly underneath of =20
Thrid Way politics and anybody who didn't think this sort of thing =20
was coming in an Obama administration was just naive. but i'd get =20
used to it, because this is not going to be the last time Obama gives =20=

an important job to someone whose opinions you don't like. this is =20
what strategic progressivism and tactical pragmatism look like in =20
concert. Which is to say, I think folks should condemn rick warren =20
all they feel hthey need to, and I'm certainly never going to defend =20
the guy, but I find it a little bit absurd that people are =20
criticising obama for including peope like him when all he's talked =20
about for the last two years on the campaign trail was his pragmatic =20
politics of inclusiveness. What did you all who are feeling so angry =20
and betrayed by warren delivering the invocation at the inauguration =20
think he meant by that?

I personally don't give a damn about any of this since it's clearly =20
all political tactics and as such within a pragmatic philosophy the =20
only meaning that can be read into it is that meaning that we choose =20
to give it. So i choose to disempower it. It's a gesture to religious =20=

nutbags and right wing goons in order show them that if they can =20
behave themselves with a little etiquette then they don't have to sit =20=

at the kids table for the next four years. I don't see anything more =20
than that going on with Rick Warren. Now, given that Rick Warren is =20
from California, his anti gay sentiments are a ot higher profile than =20=

would be some other megachurch baptist from arkasas or kentucky or =20
something like that. But again, you give conservatives a seat at the =20
table, and you will getpeople who believe the things that rick warren =20=

believes

I Called Richard Yates On The Phone: Musings From A Minor Poet

By Doug Holder

An editor of a new literary magazine invited me to write an essay on the =
role=20
of the =93Post Modern=94 Poet. Well, I am not sure what =93Post Modern=94=
 means, but=20
I am a poet, however minor, and hell, for what it=92s worth I should know=
 what=20
my own small role is and even the role of the much bigger fish in the poe=
try=20
sea. But I think I want to expand that question. What is the role of the =
writer?

Now I am not known for the intellectual heft of my writing, be it communi=
ty=20
journalism or in my straightforward poetry. But I always have prided myse=
lf on=20
tapping into my instincts, bringing my rather provincial personal experie=
nce to=20
the universal. So as it happens I was thinking of the late novelist Richa=
rd=20
Yates. I was reading Yates long before he became tremendously famous from=
=20
the movie with Kate Winslet, etc=85 =93Revolutionary Road.=94 (based on t=
he novel=20
of the same title.) That book for me, was electric, as thrilling as Kerou=
ac=92s =93On=20
the Road=94, but in a very different way. Both Yates and Kerouac made me =
go=20
out and hungrily acquire and read everything they ever penned. They made =
me=20
think outside my self-made box, made me realize the power of language and=
=20
literature, and they spurred me on to read even more. From Yates, I found=
=20
other chroniclers of the broad lawns and narrow minds of the suburbs in p=
ost=20
World War ll America, like John Cheever and John Updike. And later I move=
d=20
through the whole canon of contemporary American authors like Philip Roth=
,=20
Saul Bellow, James Baldwin, Henry Roth, to name a few.

Some people say a great poem can make you cut yourself while shaving, or=20=

make you miss your subway stop. Well, I say it makes you want to call the=
=20
author on the phone.

You see, years ago I lived in a rooming house in the Back Bay of Boston, =
right=20
near where Yates lived. I used to see him shamble down Mass. Ave. He look=
ed=20
like a homeless guy; stooped over, disheveled=97a man in serious disrepai=
r. I=20
heard he drank at the =93Crossroads=92, a bar a few blocks from the hole-=
in-the-
wall I lived in. I went in a few times but I missed him. I probably would=
n=92t have=20
had enough gumption to speak to him anyway. So I tried to call him on the=
=20
phone several times, but I got no answer. But the point is that his writi=
ng=20
affected me so much I wanted to call him; I wanted to connect, in a tangi=
ble=20
way.

He was a man of my father=92s generation. And since I am a Baby Boomer, a=
nd=20
lived in the suburbs of New York City (as did the characters in Revolutio=
nary=20
Road), I knew the milieu he wrote about. My old man was a regular =93Dash=
ing=20
Dan,=94 a guy who hopped the Long Island Railroad everyday to the adverti=
sing=20
canyons of Madison Ave. So in this novel =93Revolutionary Road=94 I had a=
 window=20
into the mind of a guy trapped in this =93Rat Race.=94 I had lived on=20
a =93Revolutionary Road=94 in Rockville Center, NY with my parents=92 req=
uisite=20
barbecues and the tipsy cocktail parties that my brother and I witnessed =
at=20
the top of the living room stairs.

Here was a writer who was doing an exegesis of this milieu, the one I gre=
w up=20
in and did not question (at least when I was in the thick of it). This=20=

regimented existence, from birth, death and infinity, was tightly=20
choreographed, and I thought that it was the only game in town.

And since, during this specific time, when I was living in the Back Bay, =
I=20
happened to be a denizen of a down-at-the--heels rooming house=97a=20
bathroom down the hall affair, with other gone- to- seed residents, and=20=

playing at being an artist---well, I thought Yates really spoke to me.

I often read his books, and at times they left me reeling, even crying. E=
ven=20
though I never actually spoke to Yates, Yates spoke loudly to me. So what=
 do=20
I think is the role of the =93Post Modern=94 Poet? I think I told you, pa=
l.

Hi,
CA u might send your a copy of your letter to the Presidential Inaugural
Committee thru http://www.pic2009.org/content/home/

remind them of their task:

PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL COMMITTEE

*The Presidential Inaugural Committee, at the direction of President-elect
Obama and Vice President-elect Biden, will organize an inclusive and
accessible inauguration that reflects the new Administration's commitment to
leadership that sets aside partisanship and unites the nation around our
shared values and ideals.*



remind them also of what Barack Obama said on LGBT rights in the Civil
Rights section of his transition info on http://change.gov (it's in the
"Your Seat at the Table" section on the right of the splash page) and point
out the discrepancy;-)


Support for the LGBT Community

"While we have come a long way since the Stonewall riots in 1969, we still
have a lot of work to do. Too often, the issue of LGBT rights is exploited
by those seeking to divide us. But at its core, this issue is about who we
are as Americans. It's about whether this nation is going to live up to its
founding promise of equality by treating all its citizens with dignity and
respect."

-- Barack Obama, June 1, 2007

even a spelling dilemma;-)
IS A DILEMNA for Alexander, as you have deftly posed CA (should she read . .
. of course she will . . . what could she read / write /read . . .  there's
the rub) much as what might Aretha sing (maybe she'll do "r-e-s-p-e-c-t")

also a dilemma for Warren who is under heavy fire from his own
constituencies and beyond for accepting an invitation

because by agreeing to perform at the inauguration he endorses the agenda of
the President-elect ticket. Look at the rhetoric about same-sex marriage on
the transition site for example. He has to "understand" that as well as
sections on h8 speech and LGBT rights. Whatever he says now he has been
co-opted into endorsing, validating, forwarding those policy statements??


not arguing for anything just exploring the complexities

so his discomfort *might be of interest?? as might the discomfort of all who
appear in fact of all who are talking now about that discomfort of all who
even watch, bear witness etcetera?

i understand the variant and diverse discomforts and i am way happier that
discomfort is at the heart of politics and Politics than any sense of
comfort or for that matter safety


radical inclusivity is not a comfortable state (not that Obama is anywhere
near the radical inclusivity . . .  tolerance . . . along the lines that
Roger Williams proposed)

See Frank Rich's column in the New York Times on line, Dec. 27.  He
articulates the problems with Obama's selection of Warren -- to act as
symbolic "pope" during the inauguration -- we've discussed here.   Rich
quotes Barney Frank on Obama's selection of Warren:  "I think he
overestimates his ability to get people to put aside fundamental
differences."

Warren gave equal stage to both Obama and McCain during the campaign, being
polite to both of them and letting them speak answering his questions,
knowing full well that Obama believed in choice in relation to abortion and
civil union in relation to gays. He avoided inflammatory rhetorical devices=
.
Obama is returning the gesture. In my world this is called civil discourse,
the reverse of the sickening demonizing which has been carried on by the
Bush administration, both domestically and internationally, the last eight
years.

I sat down to write a little piece about this Russian poet, and came
up with a strange take on the long poem--an idea that the seriality of
it is somehow related to consumer capitalism--

http://tsky-reviews.blogspot.com/

not the pleasantest thought--

and so I was wondering if anyone has any good counter arguments, or
different takes on why so many are so obsessed with this form right
now. & will we fall out of love with it during the recession?

thank you, gwyn! (but prostitution affects many more females than males.
still, yes, it does affect both & is odious everywhere.)
besides, even if prostitutes were not forced or sold or beaten or young or
broke or threatened every day or exposed to every kind of degradation
instead of being admired as football players are, imagine selling your body
for long-term effects on human being.

Everything a new president does is invested with=20
the weight of symbolism, especially when the=20
president is so little known. Obama's election=20
strategy was to run as a symbol, the word=20
"change" plastered on every lectern, but he let=20
us know only in the vaguest terms what he=20
actually believed or meant to do. So those with a=20
mind to projected on to him whatever they hoped=20
he'd be. There's a degree of smoke and mirrors to=20
this. Obama's attempts to differentiate himself=20
from Clinton, for instance, have resulted in his=20
appointment of a Clinton cabinet and Hillary=20
herself, whose judgement in international affairs=20
he ridiculed, as Secretary of State. As it begins=20
to be apparent that there's a man behind the=20
symbol who almost certainly will represent change=20
in the limited sense of not being like Bush but=20
perhaps not much beyond that, it's reasonable to=20
be trepidatious. All we have to look at now is=20
the latest gestures, of which the Warren=20
selection is one. The memory of Clinton's=20
imposition of "don't ask don't tell" as an=20
attempted sop to both sides is pretty fresh.

Lest we forget, it's not just gays who lose out=20
in Warren's theology; Warren, along with most of=20
his kind, thinks that Jews, Muslims, Hindus,=20
etc., are destined for hell. In the face of that,=20
trying to appeal to rank and file fundamentalists=20
by courting their preachers seems=20
counterproductive. Better to go over the heads of=20
the clergy to their parishoners. In any case, the=20
Republican leadership has made it pretty clear=20
that they're not interested in reconciliation.

We'll know more soon. In the interim, it's our=20

I am mixed up about this. I thought that he had said that he would
close the torture cells at Gitmo. I
didn't think that he was going to give Cuba back the area stolen from
them during the US maneuvers
in the late 19th Century.

Does anyone know more?

Can anyone recommend essays or books that specifically discuss poetry as
song? I'm down with the deep song and the duende and Eliot, too. But I'm
also interested in Shamanic song and Native American chants. One more thing:
Where can I get a copy of Ann Carson's London lecture on Sappho and IF NOT
WINTER? Thanks in advance, Cynie Cory

what I mean is that being angry at bigots doesn't necessarily make you a
bigot. it means you are criticizing abuse.

I suppose one could say you have a case. However, do blacks from the ghetto
really have a choice? Are athletes fully aware? I just saw a show on The
Fifth Estate examining brain injury in pro-football athletes. Do
pro-athletes really want to play hurt - including playing with concussions -
or is it the owners of the teams that insist on it or else the athlete loses
his position.

thank you, gwyn! (but prostitution affects many more females than males.
still, yes, it does affect both & is odious everywhere.)
besides, even if prostitutes were not forced or sold or beaten or young or
broke or threatened every day or exposed to every kind of degradation
instead of being admired as football players are, imagine selling your body
for long-term effects on human being.

How very kind of you to acknowledge there "might be a case."  However, how common too to respond to the notion that prostitution is harmful to *women* on so many levels and to avoid the notion that this harm is namely done by men by equating some thin comparison with the "harm" done to men.

In other words, the only real commonality with your comparison between football and prostitution is that men also get hurt, mostly physically, and this fact is what you use to deflect any attention that should be turned on just how pervasive and strictly gendered the harm done by prostitution is.  Kind of like when women say prostitution is harmful, we're told, 'Well women choose to be prostitutes!' as though that answer also renders invisible exactly who is controlling the strings to make prostitution happen -- because they want that 'service' -- and to avoid the myriad ways men get to abuse the system they create, uphold and support.

You better believe if women were the ones paying massive amounts of money and demanding more gore on the football field, even committing violence against the players when the impulse struck, there would be a national outcry of the rape of these players...

The comparison is something of another strawman meant to detract from actually examining just who really is committing the violence against women and how that violence is monetarily fueled by money men earn and spend and how that violence is not regulated and rarely punished.

By the way, I've only almost been to the Poetry Brothel and see no harm in the name as it's clearly a play on brothels that men and women participate in / simulate in weird ways, is even something of a debunking of the purpose of brothel.  Never been invited to read and would likely find behaving as the poet-prostitute awkward at best as I'm no good at such simulations.  Poor acting skills on my part, I guess.

Be well,

Amy

i'm definitely opposed to "screaming all the time." now and then,

So prescriptive grammar = smart objection? Or, there can be no smart
objections unless they follow a specific set of grammatical rules?

Dear Eireene--



Thank you so much for this excellent piece and the question you pose.



Seriality in writing as a deliberate form is directly an effect of
Captialsim--in that serials such as the Feuilletons of Eugene Sue and the
serial manner of publishing Dickens' novels=2C became one of the few ways t=
hat an
author could make money directly from writing--and also it was used as a wa=
y to
get people to keep buying the newspaper or journal in which the serial
appeared.



Seriality of this kind is constructed round the desire to "want to know
what happens next" and is accompanied by the acceptance by the reader that
one "will pay any price  to find out how the cliff hanger was
resolved--and what happens next until the next cliff hanger is reached=97=
=93



An author often could make more money from selling a serial than having a b=
ook
appear "all at once=2C" due to the lack of copyright for American
writers who were pirated outrageously by British publishes=2C and the lack =
of
copy right in many other countries also.



A writer like Dostoyevsky who had gambling debts would crank out serials to=
 pay
off creditors=2C a vast improvement actually on the strategies open to=20
Balzac=2C  who often wrote six books at a time=2C for several different
publishers=2C not having yet the serial at his disposal. =20

=20

(Hence the often strange effect in many of Balzac=92s works=2C
that a book begun at one point in time=2C interrupted to complete two other=
s more
pressing=2C then returned to=97the writer would suddenly decide that a diff=
erent
character should step into the spotlight from its previous position vaguely=
 in
the background at the edge of the wings and faded old curtains--=2C and in
stepping forward=2C suddenly alter almost entirely the direction of the nar=
rative
and the meaning of the moral Balzac was presenting as another in his
=93philosophies des moeux=94 in the structure of the Comedie Humaine

=20

A structure whose descriptions and analyses Karl Marx found
to be the greatest and most perceptive study ever made of Capitalism in all=
 its
function and effects---



Seriality was continued in the early "Motion Pictures" with the
famous feuilletons of Louis Feuillade so beloved of the
Surrealist--"Judex" "Les Vampyrs" and etc--and in the US
the endless series of "Adventures of Pauline' and her constellations of
spin offs--tied to the rail road tracks as the train approaches--and escapi=
ng
miraculously--only to have another misadventure seize hold of her before th=
e
reel runs out--and the lettering on the black screen says--"Wait Until
Next Week to Find Out What---"



Serial production functions not unlike a model of addiction--once hooked=2C=
 one
HAS to keep coming back for MORE MORE MORE--which is at once the
"same" and slightly different=2C just enough so=2C that the sense of
being both satisfied that "the stuff is good" and at the same time
give an extra "plug" in that one enjoys it for only so long and then
has to be in the throes craving until the next fix can be obtained.



Soap operas came about for the same reason--to keep the customer coming bac=
k in
order to have the familiar fix and also to experience the titillation of th=
e
seductive "wait for next time and I'll be there--just waiting for
YOU--"



"Soap" opera referring to be sure to the selling of laundry soaps
that paid for the serial production of these "Opere"--so that both
the "serial" and the product become inseparably associated and one
finds oneself suddenly craving--soap!!=20



Actually Language Poetry's assertions about grammar being an expression of=
=2C
structured by=2C Captialsim=2C is a fallacy=2C in terms of linguistics=2C a=
nd is instead
a kind of "soap" that sponsors the reader's having a new "mode
of production" i.e. "a new line"--to develop an addiction
to--'what will be the next book from language writers?--what will be the ne=
xt
exciting daring thing they do in their hair raising battle with
capitalism"--in other words=2C  a fallacious
"anti-capitalist" production is marketed as just that--hey!! Buy us!!
We are anti-capitalism=92s structuring of grammar!! We are liberating you!!=
--From
what? =96

=20

 From buying one form
of poetry one is freed to buy another.  Nothing has changed but the
"exterior appearance" of the product.  Inside it is the same old
thing--production=2C product=2C authors=2C canons=2C sub divisions of categ=
ories of
styles=2C rhetorical devices and =93morphemic transgressions=94 replete wit=
h
torque  and the tensile strengths of the
requisite number of  =93allowances for the
reader=92s constructions of their own meanings=94-- and  all of these cramm=
ed within the new models so
that one might choose still somehow between a convertible or a coupe=2C or =
perhaps
simply a two door or a four door---



And what colors would you like these to come in?--With or with out ash tray=
s=2C
CD player--radio?--No smoking?=97OK=97we=92ll make a note of that=97no ligh=
ter=97either--



Oh!! Did someone mention Hybrids--??!!  How marvelous!!--What a pun=2C mon
vieux=97do you mean automobiles or genres--?=97or perhaps some fantastical =
life
form=97out of Lewis Carroll or Borges=97

=20

A used car dealer=2C a used poem dealer . . . .or perhaps in
these days of tightened belts=97the two combined and displaying their wares=
 on
the same much contracted =93lot=94

 whose fading banners
may well not be seen by the dawn=92s early light=97other than as limp remna=
nts of
plastic  curling and scuttering across
the tarmacs in the gusts of an ill wind blowing no good=97

=20

Yes=97from the assembly line to the poetic line=97

Is a very fine line indeed=97

And so one can replace the unemployed=92s  former jobs on the assembly line

With jobs on the poetic line=97

Hard at work creating serial production again--



The serial is created to "provoke and sustain interest through
time--"



And indeed one might think of this interest as a paying of interest in that
instead of one product in full paid for al at once=2C one is paying for the
product stretched out through time=2C and so pays more for each
"section" in the serial=2C bringing the total cost of the completed
series to quite a bi more than if one had simply been able to purchase the
whole thing inside one cover.  But then--one would have been deprived of
the thrill and the touch of each new issue each new episode arriving in the
stores or in the mails or on line or video--awaiting with that craving so
deliciously satisfied by the insertion into the human system of the capital=
ist
addiction system--and then=2C as the pleasure is moving through out one in =
a
sensuous erotic glow--suddenly one is cut off-and told to wait until next
time--



And there one is=2C "Waiting for the Man=2C 26 dollars in your hand/he's ne=
ver
early=2C always late/the first thing you learn/is you just got to wait."



And so there were and may still be--long lines queuing up on the days that =
the
"Man" is coming --shivering and shaking in the junk sick streets
until at the last moment of unendurable waiting=2C when al are cursing the
"Man" who is subjection them to this suffering--at this last moment
when al are ready to forever consign this Monster to the dustbins of their
crashed hopes and illusions--here he or she is!! And like salivating dogs t=
hey
al rush to lick her (or his)  feet and
rub against his (or her) legs and practically shit themselves in delight--w=
ith
outpourings of love finally getting their greedy paws on the serial's new
installment=2C and putting down al their hard saved coins and bills for thi=
s
immediate satisfying of the unbearable cravings building up--



How many times does one not find someone writing of having to satisfy their
poetry fix with a quick rush to a book store and their tear off their coats=
=2C
yank up their sleeves=2C wrap the nearest belt or cord around their scrawny=
 arm
and inject three or four chapbooks--and with great and sudden euphoria--plu=
nk
down whatever price they are told these precious "rocks" are jacked
up to this week--



Who hasn=92t seen lurking near the bookstores and poetry dens the sinister =
figure
of the Reviewer loaded with the latest galleys and review copies of release=
s=2C
wiling to sell them cheaper than the store--or forego the cash as long as t=
he
figure is paid for in some kind of trade--for sex perhaps=2C or say season =
ticket
to the opera or bal game or perhaps simply the inside scoop on some trading=
 tip
on good old Wall Street--or a tip on the races--



A different method of composition was advocated by Edgar Allan Poe=2C who=
=2C in his
"Principles of Poetry" and "Philospsophy of Composition"
formulated one of the msot influential approaches to this day for the produ=
ction
of poems and =2C to be sure--short stories.  This is to create works whcih=
=2C
given the speeding up oflife and magazine prodcution=2C can be read in one
sitting=2C because=2C argues Poe=2C only in having the entire poem or story=
 all at
once=2C is one experiencing the full power of the Effect.  For Poe=2C --and
this is also an argument against the "Inspiration=94 of Romanticism--a poem
is constructed deliberately=2C almost mathematically as well as musically--=
by
choosing first the effect to be experienced by the reader=2C and working
"backwards=2C" determining the elements and their arrangements with in
the structure which is determined by the length of time as measured in numb=
ers
of words. =20



Where the serial exploits the drawing out of time=2C as a never quite consu=
mmated
series of piquing of desire--the work as advocated by Poe--delivers an Effe=
ct
so great that is far more satisfying than the long drawn-out
"sickness" of serial addiction=2C with its attendant ever demanding
layouts of cash--



The short story=2C the short poem--for Poe these offer a much more interest=
ing
field for the investigations of questions of composition--because they prov=
ide
CONSTRAINTS--which provoke rather  than limit discoveries--because
"Necessity the Motherfucker of Invention" is a goad to the
imagination completely at odds with its dispersal as in a serial--in which =
the
poet or writer has far more TIME to dream up what happens next--



Poe's theories of Composition=2C traced via Baudelaire and his invention of=
 the
short prose poem--and the theory of Correspondances--is at the basis of Fre=
nch
Symbolism as it culminates in Mallarme--a good friend of his Tuesdays atten=
dee
Felix Feneon=2C who=2C combining his anarchist ideas with those of the
"creation of the effect"--much as Mallarme noted that Feneon's words
were "detonators" as much as the bombs he advocated and may have
thrown himself--comes up with the turning of his hack job writing "Faits
Divers" for the mass circulation Le Matin into the writing simultaneously
of news (Nouvelles) and  "short stories" (nouvelles)=2C which
become known when published posthumously as his "Nouvelles en trois
lignes"--News Stories/Short Stories in three lines.  Like Poe=2C who
published his works in newspapers and large circulation journals=2C Feneon =
is
melding "news of the day=94 in its documentary "detective story"
aspect with its fictional "Balloon Hoax" (published in a newspaper to
emulate one that had been taken as truth) and "Purloined Letter=2C"
"Ms in a Bottle" aspects.=20



Since the short story and short poem=2C the "Faits Divers" hack filler
turned into a short story/documented event do not create the dependence the
"fort-da" psychology of Captilist Need and Desire=2C these short=2C
effect driven works subvert in a strange way the more "profitable"
serials in that they offer the "most bang for the buck'--as it were=2C
rather than endlessly teasing out the most bucks for an ever differed bang =
as
does the serial.



This "bang" effect is literally "realized=2C if one is willing to
think of this way--in the naming of the NFL Baltimore Ravens for Poe's poem=
.
The Ravens=2C a hard hitting team led by a Super bowl MVP Ray Lewis who has=
 been
charged in the past with connection to a homicide--play with indeed the mos=
t
bang delivered for the buck--producing some "shocking" effects and
like Poe producing a "mystery story to be investigated by
detectives."



One of the reasons for Poe's development of his theories was not surprising=
ly=2C
economic.  In Poe=92s time American writers had no copyright protection=2C =
so
the one surest way to "get the most out" of a piece of writing was to
have it produce its effect al at once=2C before it was pirated.  "The
Raven=2C" for example=2C was pirated thousands of times--it was a
"Platinum Selling Hit" for its times--yet Poe was paid only once=2C and
that=2C for him=2C a not too miserly fee of a few dollars. was al he ever r=
eceived.

=20

In the 1890=92s=2C Henry James was faced with the example of
Poe=2C a writer who in the past he had been dismissive of.  After the fabul=
ous failures of his dramatic pieces
on the stage=2C James found himself in need of money to keep himself and hi=
s
beloved Lamb House afloat. (His neighbors there were to become Stephen Cran=
e=2C
Joseph Conrad and H. G. Wells.)

=20

James decided at first one the old famialar standby=97the
writing of a serial=97which proved to be =93The Turn of the Screw.=94 As he=
 worked to
find a way to keep on creating an Effect on which each episode would end so=
 as
to keep the suspense hanging and make the reader desire intensely to purcha=
se
the nest episodes as they appeared=97James began reconsidering Poe=92s theo=
ry of
the Effect.  From the creation of a ghost
story serial=2C James began to turn to the creation of short stories which=
=2C like Poe=92s
are created with the final effect in mind.=20


(While dictating aloud to his red haired Scottish typist
=93The Turn of the Screw=2C=94 James discovered himself building in each ep=
isode to
the proper cliff hanging effect=97only to see not =93an effect=94 produced =
on the
typist=2C but rather his poker faced question as he paused with fingers in =
mid
air to type the next words=97=93And then?=94 This may have contributed a bi=
t towards
James=92 deciding he would prefer to produce the Effect in toto in a short
story=97just to see what if any Effect it had on the seemingly unimpression=
able
red haired typist.)

=20

Another interesting example is Roberto Bolano=2C who turned
from writing poetry to producing short stories after his marriage and with =
a child
on the way.  Bolano=2C like many other
writers who have used this material of the short story competition for shor=
t
stories in themselves=2C discovered that in Spain a great many towns and sm=
all
cities offered prizes for best short story on such and such a theme=2C plac=
e or
person of the immediate region.=20
Competing for prizes helped Bolano develop his skills at producing
Effects that would =93outshine=94 those of his opponents.

=20

From the short stories he moved to the novella form=2C and he
became aware his life was rapidly getting shorter and shorter=2C and that t=
he
best way to leave a profitable legacy for his family was to compose novels=
=97and
ever bigger ones!=97Bolano devoted himself literally feverishly to the prod=
uction
of as man words as possible=2C in order to earn the most money posthumously=
 for
his widow and small son.

=20

The connection between Captialsim and writing is NOT
grammar=2C but WORD COUNT=97page length=97and=2C hopefully for the writer a=
nd publisher
both=2C NAME RECONITION=97by which a much slighter prodcution can be market=
ed if
the author=92s name=2C rather than the bulk=2C merits the raising of the pr=
ice no
matter how short a work may be.

=20

In one of his essays the Italian Futurist (an ex-Symbolist
whose Futurism is littered with many of the most hackneyed of Symbolist ima=
ges
and techniques)=2C considered that literature and poetry could be assigned =
values
based on a system of weights and measures=2C including that of measuring an=
d

ition=94 as a
=93guarantee=94 of at least a certain level of quality being available to t=

reader.

=20

This is another of the paradoxes of the hack work of
Feneon=92s Faits Divers=97that in an anonymous poorly paid and very low-reg=
arded
form=2C he would decide to go about producing work of the highest quality=
=2C while
getting absolutely no credit for it =93in name=94 nor being rewarded for hi=
s extra
efforts by any increase in the minimal pay.

=20

And so it is only a century later that Feneon=92s Faits Divers
aka Nouvelles en trois lignes appear in English=2C in a translation of most=
 of
the pieces.  (The translation unfortunately
uses the word =93novels=92 for nouvelles=97which disappears the punning of =
=93short
news items=2C news briefs=94 and short stories. Instead there is a making m=
uch by
reveiewers of the pieces being =93novels=94 which contradicts the entire me=
aning of
the pun. It also makes impossible the contemporary punning of =93news flash=

with today=92s =93flash fictions.=94)

=20

Flaubert=2C after all=2C had already accomplished the turning=20

I think we've become obsessed with it precisely because it's fallen out of favor. Somebody, or a few people, wondered where it went, and began writing about it. It seems to me that the long poem became impossible with the abandonment of narrative by poets. How long can one keep up a feeling or a mood or an "experiment"? Frederick Fierstein writes quite long poems, but his poems also have narratives holding them together. Frederick Turner has written two epic poems. It seems that the gradual abandonment of narrative in poetry by the Modernists, especially the late Modernists, and the postmodern poets, far more than economic conditions, have contributed to the abandonment of long poetry as a form.

Subject: capitalism and the long poem

I sat down to write a little piece about this Russian poet, and came
up with a strange take on the long poem--an idea that the seriality of
it is somehow related to consumer capitalism--

http://tsky-reviews.blogspot.com/

not the pleasantest thought--

and so I was wondering if anyone has any good counter arguments, or
different takes on why so many are so obsessed with this form right
now. & will we fall out of love with it during the recession?

Thank you, Mark. It's interesting to me how responses to symbolic gestures
can differ so greatly in kind and degree from responses to other sorts of
gestures: for example, the Warren invitation is both infuriating and almost
purely symbolic, while Obama's drafting of Ron Kirk and Arne Duncan, which
will very likely have serious, concrete policy consequences, seem to have
barely made a stir. Is this where poetics plays a role in the discussion?
I've always felt that part of my job, as someone trying to work deeply and
fastidiously with language, is to address both the efficacy of signs and
symbols and the dangers they present.
(As for civility, I'm in favor of it, but it seems that for the Democratic
Party it has often meant "taking the high road" by giving the Republicans
what they want, while for Republicans it usually means that the Democrats
should be civil enough to take the high road and give them what they want.)

Everything a new president does is invested with
the weight of symbolism, especially when the
president is so little known. Obama's election
strategy was to run as a symbol, the word
"change" plastered on every lectern, but he let
us know only in the vaguest terms what he
actually believed or meant to do. So those with a
mind to projected on to him whatever they hoped
he'd be. There's a degree of smoke and mirrors to
this. Obama's attempts to differentiate himself
from Clinton, for instance, have resulted in his
appointment of a Clinton cabinet and Hillary
herself, whose judgement in international affairs
he ridiculed, as Secretary of State. As it begins
to be apparent that there's a man behind the
symbol who almost certainly will represent change
in the limited sense of not being like Bush but
perhaps not much beyond that, it's reasonable to
be trepidatious. All we have to look at now is
the latest gestures, of which the Warren
selection is one. The memory of Clinton's
imposition of "don't ask don't tell" as an
attempted sop to both sides is pretty fresh.

Lest we forget, it's not just gays who lose out
in Warren's theology; Warren, along with most of
his kind, thinks that Jews, Muslims, Hindus,
etc., are destined for hell. In the face of that,
trying to appeal to rank and file fundamentalists
by courting their preachers seems
counterproductive. Better to go over the heads of
the clergy to their parishoners. In any case, the
Republican leadership has made it pretty clear
that they're not interested in reconciliation.

We'll know more soon. In the interim, it's our
job to question the slender information we've
got. It's what voters do, and it's more important
than civility.  Without it leaders don't learn
what's good for them, and voters don't find out
if their leaders are capable of learning.

Can anyone recommend essays or books that specifically discuss poetry as song? I'm down with the deep song and the duende and Eliot, too. But I'm also interested in Shamanic song and Native American chants. One more thing: Where can I get a copy of Ann Carson's London lecture on Sappho and IF NOT WINTER?

Announcing A New Book

by MICHAEL CROSS

IN FELT TREELING: A Libretto

Poetry paperback
ISBN 0978925904751
64 pages
$16


In in felt treeling, Michael Cross has created a pastoral theatre in =20
which elaborate patterns of resemblance are poetically measured by =20
counter-voiced assertions of autonomy and difference. The world is =20
invited to =93err=94 and to =93air=94 its intentions freely, treely, =20
freewheelingly, treelingly. These poems are =93felt=94 doubly, as both =20=

noun and verb, with their layered emotional registers and their =20
playfully theatrical costume dressing. As this carefully scored work =20
is animated by the vocal fabric of its setting in the woods, the =20
reader becomes transfixed, like Daphne, within the lush, felt =20
landscape of the poems. =97 Elizabeth Willis

Michael Cross=92 post-objectivist poems lace archaic vocabularies into =20=

airy filagrees =97 spun wisps of whispered fragments and obliquely =20
glimpsed scenes barely suspended in the draft. These poems suggest =20
=93tracery=94 in both senses of the word: a delicate interweaving of =
open-=20
work lines, but also phrases traced from other pages, records of =20
reading rendered as writing. And yet, despite that filigrane and the =20
impression of found language, in felt treeling also has an =20
astonishing sonic density that proves Cross=92 language infelt =20
[=93inwardly felt or experienced=94] and leaves the reader reeling, as =20=

syllabic hints and fragile internal rhymes transform words in a tour-=20
de-force series of seriously playful midsummer metamorphoses. The =20
slightest sleight or faintest feint moves this language from =20
=93squints=94 to =93sequins,=94 from =93herr=94 to =93err,=94 from =
=93slips=94 to =93lips=94 =20
to =93lisp=94 to =93ellipse.=94 Scored for Mezzo and Chorus with =
Narrator, =20
this Virgilian libretto is also scored by virgules which cross the =20
page in a signature poetic device that puts c=E6sura and linebreak into =20=

new lyric tension. A genuinely original formal invention, these =20
distinctive marks both open and anchor the text, echoing the book=92s =20=

dialogues of intimacy and distance. Airy and solid, felt and seen, =20
separating and soldering, those solidi or separatrices are =97 like the =20=

poems they punctuate =97 little strokes of genius. =97 Craig Dworkin

New on vispo.com:

ENDEMIC BATTLE COLLAGE AND
OTHER 1987 APPLE BASIC POEMS
by Geof Huth
http://vispo.com/huth

Endemic Battle Collage and other 1987 Apple Basic Poems is a suite of
programmed, animated poems by Geof Huth. This work is discussed in Chris
Funkhouser's landmark book Prehistoric Digital Poetry. Because this early
Huth work is digital and from 1987, it's been unavailable for many years.
You can view the work as video at http://vispo.com/huth or download an
emulator and view the poems through the emulator. Also included on vispo.com
are writings by Geof Huth about these works and about digital poetry more
generally. And an introduction by me to the project.

This is some of the earliest programmed+kinetic visual poetry created. This
Huth work and bpNichol's related First Screening at http://vispo.com/bp
exude the sense of excitement Nichol and Huth felt at this incunabular point
in the intersection of visual and digital poetry with the cinematic.

Happy new year to all on the Poetics list!

I'm assuming he has a large following. It's not really my milieu. And I f=
ind
that conservative Christian leaders tend to rise and fall in prominence
according to fashion/scandal etc.=20

All I'm saying is that he will not be simply one voice among a spectrum o=
f
voices at the inauguration; in symbolic terms, his theology is being
elevated as a representation of the "shared values and ideals" of the nat=
ion.

Besides, it wouldn't matter if everyone in the US agreed with him except =
CA
Conrad, because he would still be wrong (i.e. unjust). Civil discourse me=
ans
listening to differing views, of course, but that doesn't mean one has to=

validate a certain view just because a lot of people hold it.

Corey
Isn't an immoderate early riser either.

Where did you get the notion that prescriptive grammar was a subject?

CALL FOR REMISSIONS: VERZION TWO:

Remember Issue 1 - that PDF on the For Godot blog site that had computer-ge=
nerated poems attributed to about 4,000 poets who had nothing to do with th=
em?=20

Well, some of the people to whom those names are legally attached got prett=
y upset about it, and others smiled. In any case, it seemed to me like ther=
e's a lot of raw material there that's going unused and unrecycled. Hence, =
VERZION TWO.

If you are one of the names that appeared in that scurrilous publication, a=

impulses to annihilate the status quo AND impulses to maintain the
status quo.

Yes, I think that this is the part that I was worrying about:

As DBChirot says:
Serial production functions not unlike a model of addiction--once hooked, one
HAS to keep coming back for MORE MORE MORE--which is at once the
"same" and slightly different, just enough so, that the sense of
being both satisfied that "the stuff is good" and at the same time
give an extra "plug" in that one enjoys it for only so long and then
has to be in the throes craving until the next fix can be obtained.

So there's a sort of repetition thing going on (I don't really follow
this Freud stuff very well, but someone explained the
Lacan/consumerism problem as similar, as Troy alludes to, one in
postmodernism's problems of self: both stemming from an inherent
emptiness--there is no self there at the center--so we keep trying to
fill the lack or hole with one commodity or otherwise sexy thing after
another.

It' not always the same thing, but there's a repetitive structure to
the act of filling the hole--(okay this may not look like the long
poems at all)--and maybe Lacan, being a structuralist (?), would say
that that the motion of filling forms some sort of updatable subject?

well, now I am lost again.

I want to get to this part where Catherine Daly is where there's a
possibility of woven funcitons but I'm not sure how to get from one to
the other.

What's the source of all of that talk about the usable past? and
available nerve endings and tissues, by the way. I feel like I must
have somehow missed some whole big discussion here.

It seems to me that the long poem became impossible with the abandonment of narrative by poets. How long can one keep up a feeling or a mood or an "experiment"? Frederick Fierstein writes quite long poems, but his poems also have narratives holding them together. Frederick Turner has written two epic poems.

Here's an interesting article, for those who are interested, about a more
useful approach to bettering the terrible conditions of brothels: forming a
prostitutes' union.
http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-prostitutes-union

I think as long as every mention of prostitution brings up just so much
puritan moralizing, pimps and their bosses will continue to operate with
impunity, out of the sight of polite society.  Meanwhile police continue to
fine and jail the women, in order to keep them out of sight of the neighbors
whose real estate values they would otherwise
lower.tp://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html

Human error.  I hit a wrong button when dealing with some spam just now.  There should be about four spam emails that got through, so please avoid clicking suspicious links.  If it looks like spam, it likely is - but the site is not hacked.

Thanks,

Okay, I only found three and removed them from the archive.  If someone spots the other, please let me know.

One spam email is a call for a "Secret Shopper", one is just gibberish in symbols, and the final one has a header "Lyrical Verse" from the "Star Journal" -- the latter is the one to ignore.

Thanks,

Who will revise (re:vice), scramble, recycle, cannibalize ... on behalf of
Shakespeare, e.e. cummings, etc, that appeared in that anthology? Or do we
assume that dead poets are satisfied because dead poets don't bite?

There's a lot of interesting stuff here, but one does wonder how one fits p=
re-capitalist societies into this. The epic poem all but dies off with the =
advent of the Modern Era and capitalism. How does one fit the idea of line =
production in fact being LOST with the advent of capitalist society? Homer,=
 Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides, Virgil, et al were well-known authors, al=
l pre-capitalist. Certainly your points about serialization and novel produ=
ction with Balzac are quite interesting and true, but your thesis almost tr=
eats literary production as having arisen with capitalism. How does one fit=
 the rest of world literary history into your model?=0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=

sick of men saying it's puritan moralizing to criticize prostitution.
whether it shd be legal or not is a complicated question. but I make no
judgment about prostitutes. if anything, I wish the world could hold them in
its arms in a loving way to counteract all they suffer.

Now, repetition is very ancient, and is traceable to rituals of all sorts. It thus has a deep connection to religion. I'm of the opinion that repetitious arts and rituals helped our ancestors to see the patterns in nature better, making them better at noticing the subtle changes in the rhythms of nature, making them better hunters and gatherers, and be better at not being prey to predators. Repetition also has the effect of altering brain states too, though, so the result is religious experiences, mass hypnosis, etc. When decoupled from its religious and artistic origins, we repetitious buying, etc. that forms the core of many people's critique of capitalism. It seems to me, though, that the same people who make this critique then assume that all repetition is bad (many in the Marxist camp also are anti-religion, so wish to do away with that form of repetition as well), and the baby is thrown out with the bath water -- making people in fact even more
 prone to consumerist influences. There's pretty good evidence that people need repetition. With the anti-repetition mentality in some in the arts and humanities, these problems are only exacerbated. Removal of repetition from life and art dehumanizes both.

Yes, I think that this is the part that I was worrying about:

As DBChirot says:
Serial production functions not unlike a model of addiction--once hooked, one
HAS to keep coming back for MORE MORE MORE--which is at once the
"same" and slightly different, just enough so, that the sense of
being both satisfied that "the stuff is good" and at the same time
give an extra "plug" in that one enjoys it for only so long and then
has to be in the throes craving until the next fix can be obtained.

So there's a sort of repetition thing going on (I don't really follow
this Freud stuff very well, but someone explained the
Lacan/consumerism problem as similar, as Troy alludes to, one in
postmodernism's problems of self: both stemming from an inherent
emptiness--there is no self there at the center--so we keep trying to
fill the lack or hole with one commodity or otherwise sexy thing after
another.

It' not always the same thing, but there's a repetitive structure to
the act of filling the hole--(okay this may not look like the long
poems at all)--and maybe Lacan, being a structuralist (?), would say
that that the motion of filling forms some sort of updatable subject?

well, now I am lost again.

I want to get to this part where Catherine Daly is where there's a
possibility of woven funcitons but I'm not sure how to get from one to
the other.

What's the source of all of that talk about the usable past? and
available nerve endings and tissues, by the way. I feel like I must
have somehow missed some whole big discussion here.

It seems to me that the long poem became impossible with the abandonment of narrative by poets. How long can one keep up a feeling or a mood or an "experiment"? Frederick Fierstein writes quite long poems, but his poems also have narratives holding them together. Frederick Turner has written two epic poems.

Sonnet for the New Year

Pleistocene campfires flickering in the distance, deeply
rooted slogans chat it up with money barons. Medical
malpractice suits us just fine, thank you very much.
For instance, well-delivered apologies salve all wounds.

Partial reconciliations break step when crossing a bridge,
miraculous transformations no longer expected or offered.
Higher disease rates unrelated to education or health costs
speak volumes to our well-tuned ears.  Biology urges us

to seek out music in the company of other people. Yahweh
and other loud cellphone talkers gather to break bread to-
gether, airwaves atremble with salutations, with greetings.
On everyone=92s lips, prospects for reelection, for theatrical

productions that do not close in a month or less. And soon,
all spats aside, someone texts us a toast, and all follow suit.

What a 'flight' here, David. Thank you.=20
Just so that the shade of Capitalism does not critically destroy the genuin=
e possibilites of writing and reading, I thought I will mention two recent =
events that gave me great listening/lit pleasure:=20
The MLA just finished dropping its presence into San Francisco. I am sure -=
 aside from all the criticisms of x, y and z about such affairs - that coll=
eagues in academia no doubt enjoyed parts of it, socializing et al. So more=
 power to comradeship. But more than that, were two corrolary events made p=
ossible by the MLA:=20

Pleasure for me as a local were two events:
The Books Inc. reading celebration of the new Poems for the Millennium, vol=
ume 3: The University of California Book of Romantic and Postromantic Poetr=
y, edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson.=A0 Along with two h=
appy editors, and several local poets (Berkson, McClure, Palmer, Scalapino)=
,=A0 we were treated to a great evening of Rousseau, Coleridge, Wordsworth(=
s), Keats, Thoreau, Anonymous and on.=A0 Delicious stuff. Leslie Scalapino'=
s reading of Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" was absolutely astonishing, an opiate=
 in itself. As Jerry pointed out at one point, in joy, "After 70 years I am=
 reminded of what got me writing poetry in the first place."=A0 Indeed it w=
as great to see/hear all those retired Romantic apples lifted back off the =
ground and given back=A0 in 're-edible' form!=20

Last night, there was the Small Press Traffic sponsored marathon reading at=
 the Hotel Utah with a focus on local poets - 30 of us at 2 mintues each wi=
th an audience of MLA poet visitors and locals. There in the non-corporate =
funk of an old building - its small stage much more known for local roots, =
punk, & world music - it was one of those wonderful ocassions where all lev=
els of tribe - the young up to the elders 'slung it' into the air, indeed a=
iring out the angsts and pleasures (formal and anti-formal, sexual and plat=
onic, political), indeed an airing out of the 'geist' before plunging into =
the new era (aira) of Obama and Company. All followed by more drink, and mu=
ch social, meeting new people from in town and out of town, the pleasures o=
f exhanges with strangers.

Whoever 'we' are, we have the MLA to thank for providing catylist to such e=
vents - these colorful carnivals outside the Church/Castle walls -=A0 we wh=
o create to speak and write for=A0 'the present'=A0 which, also, ultimately=
 provide provisions (poems et al) to inform the study of the past.=A0=20

Yes, it's a lousy economic model, but 'toot, toot', there are still such ev=
ents as these.=20

Dear Eireene=97

I will write re the thing you name physically by which one
may encounter

Series very simple

Is the sudden arrival of vast flows of series of images
memories sound sayings persons that one has not thought of in so long

=20

yet they are triggered not by a  Madeleine outside
oneself=2C but by the very movement of the muscles bones sinews and nerves =
as one
bends say just a tiny bit to pick up some thing a child or oneself had
dropped--

and as one is bending --out of nowhere come lowing these
memories=2C dreams--imaginings in aeries and tumults and amoks--

=20

rather than worrying about al these structuralisms=2C what one
does is work with what is there in the immediate site sight cite --the
materials which aw within the reach of ones body or a short walk or going a=
lone
walking--are the things one sees close buy--that cal to one and one respond=
s or
not=97a

=20

To be a debroullard in the debris yard--

=20

To begin with next to nothing is the best form of learning
al manner of incredible and unexpected things which begin to link for a per=
son
in their own ways=2C associations and series --

and not from those pre-arranged marriages of structures
imposed on one--

=20

Necessity is the Motherfucker of Invention--

=20

What more kinds of "restraints" and
"constraints" does one need to impose on oneself on top of those already
existing in things as they are

or are not!

=20

given how little one may have immediately there--the mind
though gets going=2C quick!--at finding ways to o something interesting and=
 maybe
even fun--with just these few things--

Universe opens--

to begin with next to nothing --then there is so much room
in which one sees how infinite are something all around one

and yet how little one may need than just a certain broken
car emblem with the interesting letterings

or a leaf fragments sealed in an embrace with a rock=2C
clinging so tightly as to=94 wrap its being around" rock worn smooth by
rains--

=20

Isn=92t it interesting that one says one doesn=92t have a self
or it is such and such a critiqued version of it that one has

=20

isn=92t one taking the word of somebody else about this?? And aren=92t'

t they manifesting themselves very much as selves in doing
so with such authority--

telling one in no uncertain terms that the self is pass=E9=2C
gone he way of the old made at home by oneself gingham dress--or the hand p=
ump
or water--

=20

you see  they are prescribing for you because of some
doctorate in self ology--which gives their own self an incredible importanc=
e in
telling others how they have none or at best a very teetering and Tower of
Pisa  leaning and decentered one wobbling about like a spinning top abt to
keel over--

=20

Before one takes these wags to seriously one has to ask
oneself--how do they know so much about it--what are their examples and
reasons--and how many of them are just hot air--or current trends--which in=
 a
few days or minutes or years will be hopelessly out of date and one wouldn'=
t be
caught dead leaving he house attired in them!

=20

It is far more interesting to listen to and watch people in
all their glories going through the actual situations in life--because here=
 one
fids the warp and woof of words and life wound around one another
continually-and in this twisting and turn as it were--of the nerve around t=
he
sinews and muscle cables of that are operating the bones--

=20

Cells in revolt or clam--the skin bearing signs of
weathering and wear--

al of this is going on around one continually--and if one
listens and looks and finds associations and links and repetitions by comep=
ltely
different persons of the same old story--million variation son a gesture or=
 way
of smelling a flower

=20

What is right there before one is plenty enough to get goin
with--

=20

And without the need for a plan or an authoritative Michelin
guide to the Soul or Self or Non self or Non I and al the rest of the
things which they try to evade confessing that they actually do have very
much a sense of self

And that self knows more about the non self than you do--

because they are not empty at all but very full of themselves!

=20

No-there is something in one's being that is not empty--

if one just looks around one how much there is going on outside
one that one finds oneself "getting lost in"--simply listening or
looking and letting wander-following its own trains of associations--

=20

i have been clinically dead four times--in a short period of
years--and long before that near death experience--

One has periods in which one doesn=92t know if one may not be
leading actually a ghost humous existence-

that is i may be ghost writing my own posthumous works--

And have had moments when suddenly feeling that i was actually
dead and just dreaming of things that had not been finished in life--not gr=
eat important
things like bike ride or going to meet my daughter and then one finds
those are the things which are the great ones--

The heavy weight of emptiness which one is burdened with--

well who the hell is telling one this?

=20

Perhaps they have spent far too much time regarding only those
selves without looking around one listening to al that is here--

is a self empty--yes that is what one is told when one has
repetitive patterns of stuffing oneself in some say--compulsively repeating
actions whcih are not good for oneself yet somehow thinking that they will
miraculously today be good for oneself-

And only to find that one has just done another greet injury
to the being one lives with as oneself or someone--

In charge at least of keeping care of the body one is
finding oneself walking about in--

Emptiness comes fro wanting to stuff things--to stuff time s
to stuff materially a space or materially oneself--

Because one is afraid to look around and find that one may
be al alone-

Not loved by anyone or cared about--

=20

and what then?-

Then to simply begin backwards and think--loneliness! Now that
is something i could take an interest in and find out how to live with it--=
set
up a kind of housekeeping with it as it were

or a kind of give and take friendship in which one discover
that both of you are laughing t he fact that you ahve between you only one
shadow--

=20

(This is from a story which will be in the next issue of
sous rature=97

=20

El colonel smiles. Checking his watch=2C he turns and
approaches a chair on one side of the table set in the center of the large
light filled room. This chair and the one on the table=92s other side are h=
igh
backed=2C with strong arms of a wood hard as iron and painted in a still sh=
iny
black lacquer. The upholstered seats and backs are not uncomfortable and of=
 a
worn red fading into rose. With studied and precise=2C angular movements=2C=
 El
Colonel begins to arrange himself in the correct position in which to be fo=
und
by his =93immanent and eminent visitor.=94=20



El Colonel permits himself a barely audible and very brief laugh as =93he t=
akes
possession of himself the better to assiduously arrange the head=2C the tor=
so=2C
the limbs=2C the folded hands=2C as though he were in the process of prepar=
ing a
stuffed and mounted specimen of a representative example of a Colonel=2C wh=
ose
taxidermist he himself was.=94

=20

You see that is one way of handling the emptiness=97

(He also-well you will see very soon!!)=97

=20

There is a great story of Charlie Parker=97who at one point
had just vanished=97no on knew where he was=2C if he was alive if he had an=
y means
of getting along=97

And so one day someone from the club world sees the great Charlie
Parker

Just humming long going through a trash bin loooking for
something-

The man approaches Charlie very condescendingly yet
concerned al the same-- and says how can he live like this such a genius an=
d ho
w sick the society=92s that is depriving him from making a living

--

Charlie turned and looked at this man and aid=97what to you
mean how I live like this=97

And gesturing gall about him=97al the dumpsters filled with
food scraps=2C places to curl up from a pounding rain

And he said to the man

=20

How can one not be living when there=92s so much stuff!!

=20

You see=97the Motherfucker of necessity and its Inventions!=97

=20

(Charlie Parker =96like Billie Holiday with hers----lost his
license to play evening Birdland the club named for him=2C because he was a
narcotic addict and alcoholic)

=20

=20

To tell the truth=2C  while writing this previous letter
that you cite--and then pausing for a bit after=97I was thinking =96oh no!!=
 Have I
been on the level with thinking on series=97no=97not serial production=2C b=
ut
series-so I was thinking why they are different?

=20

And the first thing that came to mind was the letter-writing
rookie =93busher=94=20

of Ring Lardner=92s You Know Me=2C Al=97

Who writes the World Series as the World Serious

Which of course it is for him in terms of glory and money--

So right away one realizes that Seriality may be left to
serial killers=20

while workers in Series enjoy being semi-literates whose
mis-writings carry within them the shift of a sound=2C of a few letters and
Voila!=97an open entry back and forth between two realms suddenly joined by=
 a
swinging door-- =20

a not-quite pun=2C yet close enough to function as a hinge=97

=20

In my case I know a series has no plan to it=97out of the blue
a phrase

a form

suddenly triggers a vast flowing =93series=94 of associations=97

So I just begin from there=97

With the form or phrase that triggered this=97

=20

I thought back to al the different factories and the tulip
bulb warehouse in Holland
where I have worked=97and the oncoming rush of those bits and pieces or hug=
e
boxes of things that one had to adjust to and perform with them dances of
Fordian Motion=97to the Tune of Taylor Time=97

Or else!!

(Except in Holland
some of us were =93schwarzarbeiter=94 black workers=97illegal alien
workers=97seasonal-- and so were tolerated to some extent---the good part w=
as
that when one ran amok the bosses and owners couldn=92t do anything about i=
t=20

because THEY were illegally employing us! -- Alien
workers!--

=20

 i have done quite a few "series" both in
writing and in visual and sound works--



actually that is a way of working i enjoy a lot and i don=92t necessarily d=
o a
series

like Pretty Maids=20

"all in a row"=20

OR--

"these pieces of the last two months are a series expressing the artist=92s
confrontation with the abyss=2C an event of which=2C he says=2C that though=
 he looked
at it=97

Completely unlike what Nietzsche said

IT DID NOT LOOK BACK AT HIM--

=20



i might take up a series months or years or minutes after having abandoned =
it
when something truly stunning Found=2C Found me and I Found it--



when i work in a series=2C the series doesn=92t come out of a preplanned st=
ructure
in which the elements are all to function in a serial manner --=20

(if you've worked in factories you know what that is like!)=97

=20

No=2C a series is quite another =93series of events=94 found long
the way=2C associative=2C uncanny=2C fraught with sudden about faces and ex=
plosive
interruptions=97

So=2C being unknown until one arrives or encounters each thing
=93ahead of one=94 that calls out to one=97

 And it sure doesn=92t have any

of the aggressive quality of those objects coming right at
one on the relentless merciless brutal assembly line!

=20

Perhaps thinking in terms of series rather serials may be
quite helpful=97

=20

William Burroughs wrote some thing very true which is
ignored by people who glamorize it=97of being a junky=2C Burroughs says=97

=93It=92s not about kicks.  It=92s a way of life.=94

=20

And=2C again voicing the experience of untold numbers of
recovering junkies the world over=97the Matt Dillon character who tells his=
 wife=2C

Because=2C the tells her=97=93for the addict every day is the
same=2C one knows already how much needs to be measured out to keep the sic=
kness
away that day=97

And al the frantic desperate adventures along the way to
keeping a stash going=97

=20

Every day the same old story=97

But now that he is straight=2C Matt Dillon says=2C he is finding
out that he wakes up every day and knows untold numbers of things he hasn=
=92t
thought of or known ahead of time=2C are going to happen to him this day--

=20

Isn=92t a Serial Killer basically like a dope fiend in that
they are repeating endlessly the same old MO=92s=97with here and there a sl=
ight
variation=97

=20

With some of the =93intriguing=94 Killers there is a lot of
planning to do so that all ritualistically goes =93according to plan=94=97

=20

At the risk of groans I=92ll quote again Picasso though it=92s
basically the same with many others myself included=97

=20

=93I do not seek=2C I find.=94

Yet think of how many different Isms there have been in the
last fifty years which are really interested in a =93programmed chance (or =
not)
Seriality=94 in which the variations are to be surprises=2C if random=2C or=
 if not=2C
the revealing through time of a structure that builds=2C rather than the ex=
act
following of one copy after another in endless rows as with the factory=92s

Seriality=97

=20

There are some very interesting works done with many such
different investigations of Seriality in music=97especially=97

=20

You see=2C it is important to not make an either/or of
Seriality /Series=2C when one comes down to it=2C it is the both/and of the
different ways which elicits a greater invitation than if one sticks to jus=
t
one side of the questions=97

=20

One may take such things and find with in them paradoxes=2C
puns=2C the hinges which unhinge----that =93take the doors themselves off t=
heir
jambs!!=94 as Walt Whitman says=97

And so turn inside out the rigid formulations which all too
often become the =93Rules for Freedom=94 in composition and life--

=20

With a series. one has the ability to work in a freedom=2C an
uncanniness=2C un expectedness=2C of the Found=2C  that one doesn=92t have =

profiting off  that money you turn over to them in every way they can
figure out--

To take back from you as much as possible=2C if not MORE than
is humanly possible!

=20

I would say that rather than choosing one aspect over another
before one just for fun thinks and works with them in a casual or a discipl=
ined
manner --just kicking the old can around=97and yet getting more and more
disciplined and good at it!--

=20

That=97why not=97follow Yogi Berra=92s advice and =93when you come
to a fork in the road=97take it!=94

Many of the isms today and poetics and so forth tend to be
proud of manuals exhorting Risk=97transgression=97risks and transgressions =
to be
sure on the page or canvas or screen=97

Yet these very things turn into formulas soon enough=97because
of the built in safety nets-

And then=97why not turn to Boredom as the Next Big Thing! ---

And what after that?

=20

You see this form of production's dependent on the Next Big
Thing to keep the production lines rolling and the jobs created by the carv=
ing
out of new genres and hybrids

And manuals and technological marvels=97

And what do aloof them have in common other than one is
being told continually to unquestioningly listen to the Authorities=97so th=
at one
doesn=92t get lost

=20

Yet finding oneself lost=97one finds out what is there=97via
Necessity the Motherfucker of Invention=97=20

Not a junk necessity of just staying not-sick and just going
on doing the same =96the same--the same boring junkie life so similar at ti=
mes to
factory life--

=20

=20

And finding this on one=92s own=2C one awakes to the
DIY=97breaking free of needing someone to tell you what and how and when wh=
ere
and why to do and behave and think

According to plan--

Because now the only person who can figure it out is
oneself--

And the Other and Others existing right beside and inside
and al around one=97

Happy New Year to Everyone!!

Dear Eireene=97

I will write re the thing you name physically by which one
may encounter

Series very simple

Is the sudden arrival of vast flows of series of images
memories sound sayings persons that one has not thought of in so long

=20

yet they are triggered not by a  Madeleine outside
oneself=2C but by the very movement of the muscles bones sinews and nerves =
as one
bends say just a tiny bit to pick up some thing a child or oneself had
dropped--

and as one is bending --out of nowhere come lowing these
memories=2C dreams--imaginings in aeries and tumults and amoks--

=20

rather than worrying about al these structuralisms=2C what one
does is work with what is there in the immediate site sight cite --the
materials which aw within the reach of ones body or a short walk or going a=
lone
walking--are the things one sees close buy--that cal to one and one respond=
s or
not=97a

=20

To be a debroullard in the debris yard--

=20

To begin with next to nothing is the best form of learning
al manner of incredible and unexpected things which begin to link for a per=
son
in their own ways=2C associations and series --

and not from those pre-arranged marriages of structures
imposed on one--

=20

Necessity is the Motherfucker of Invention--

=20

What more kinds of "restraints" and
"constraints" does one need to impose on oneself on top of those already
existing in things as they are

or are not!

=20

given how little one may have immediately there--the mind
though gets going=2C quick!--at finding ways to o something interesting and=
 maybe
even fun--with just these few things--

Universe opens--

to begin with next to nothing --then there is so much room
in which one sees how infinite are something all around one

and yet how little one may need than just a certain broken
car emblem with the interesting letterings

or a leaf fragments sealed in an embrace with a rock=2C
clinging so tightly as to=94 wrap its being around" rock worn smooth by
rains--

=20

Isn=92t it interesting that one says one doesn=92t have a self
or it is such and such a critiqued version of it that one has

=20

isn=92t one taking the word of somebody else about this?? And aren=92t'

t they manifesting themselves very much as selves in doing
so with such authority--

telling one in no uncertain terms that the self is pass=E9=2C
gone he way of the old made at home by oneself gingham dress--or the hand p=
ump
or water--

=20

you see  they are prescribing for you because of some
doctorate in self ology--which gives their own self an incredible importanc=
e in
telling others how they have none or at best a very teetering and Tower of
Pisa  leaning and decentered one wobbling about like a spinning top abt to
keel over--

=20

Before one takes these wags to seriously one has to ask
oneself--how do they know so much about it--what are their examples and
reasons--and how many of them are just hot air--or current trends--which in=
 a
few days or minutes or years will be hopelessly out of date and one wouldn'=
t be
caught dead leaving he house attired in them!

=20

It is far more interesting to listen to and watch people in
all their glories going through the actual situations in life--because here=
 one
fids the warp and woof of words and life wound around one another
continually-and in this twisting and turn as it were--of the nerve around t=
he
sinews and muscle cables of that are operating the bones--

=20

Cells in revolt or clam--the skin bearing signs of
weathering and wear--

al of this is going on around one continually--and if one
listens and looks and finds associations and links and repetitions by comep=
ltely
different persons of the same old story--million variation son a gesture or=
 way
of smelling a flower

=20

What is right there before one is plenty enough to get goin
with--

=20

And without the need for a plan or an authoritative Michelin
guide to the Soul or Self or Non self or Non I and al the rest of the
things which they try to evade confessing that they actually do have very
much a sense of self

And that self knows more about the non self than you do--

because they are not empty at all but very full of themselves!

=20

No-there is something in one's being that is not empty--

if one just looks around one how much there is going on outside
one that one finds oneself "getting lost in"--simply listening or
looking and letting wander-following its own trains of associations--

=20

i have been clinically dead four times--in a short period of
years--and long before that near death experience--

One has periods in which one doesn=92t know if one may not be
leading actually a ghost humous existence-

that is i may be ghost writing my own posthumous works--

And have had moments when suddenly feeling that i was actually
dead and just dreaming of things that had not been finished in life--not gr=
eat important
things like bike ride or going to meet my daughter and then one finds
those are the things which are the great ones--

The heavy weight of emptiness which one is burdened with--

well who the hell is telling one this?

=20

Perhaps they have spent far too much time regarding only those
selves without looking around one listening to al that is here--

is a self empty--yes that is what one is told when one has
repetitive patterns of stuffing oneself in some say--compulsively repeating
actions whcih are not good for oneself yet somehow thinking that they will
miraculously today be good for oneself-

And only to find that one has just done another greet injury
to the being one lives with as oneself or someone--

In charge at least of keeping care of the body one is
finding oneself walking about in--

Emptiness comes fro wanting to stuff things--to stuff time s
to stuff materially a space or materially oneself--

Because one is afraid to look around and find that one may
be al alone-

Not loved by anyone or cared about--

=20

and what then?-

Then to simply begin backwards and think--loneliness! Now that
is something i could take an interest in and find out how to live with it--=
set
up a kind of housekeeping with it as it were

or a kind of give and take friendship in which one discover
that both of you are laughing t he fact that you ahve between you only one
shadow--

=20

(This is from a story which will be in the next issue of
sous rature=97

=20

El colonel smiles. Checking his watch=2C he turns and
approaches a chair on one side of the table set in the center of the large
light filled room. This chair and the one on the table=92s other side are h=
igh
backed=2C with strong arms of a wood hard as iron and painted in a still sh=
iny
black lacquer. The upholstered seats and backs are not uncomfortable and of=
 a
worn red fading into rose. With studied and precise=2C angular movements=2C=
 El
Colonel begins to arrange himself in the correct position in which to be fo=
und
by his =93immanent and eminent visitor.=94=20



El Colonel permits himself a barely audible and very brief laugh as =93he t=
akes
possession of himself the better to assiduously arrange the head=2C the tor=
so=2C
the limbs=2C the folded hands=2C as though he were in the process of prepar=
ing a
stuffed and mounted specimen of a representative example of a Colonel=2C wh=
ose
taxidermist he himself was.=94

=20

You see that is one way of handling the emptiness=97

(He also-well you will see very soon!!)=97

=20

There is a great story of Charlie Parker=97who at one point
had just vanished=97no on knew where he was=2C if he was alive if he had an=
y means
of getting along=97

And so one day someone from the club world sees the great Charlie
Parker

Just humming long going through a trash bin loooking for
something-

The man approaches Charlie very condescendingly yet
concerned al the same-- and says how can he live like this such a genius an=
d ho
w sick the society=92s that is depriving him from making a living

--

Charlie turned and looked at this man and aid=97what to you
mean how I live like this=97

And gesturing gall about him=97al the dumpsters filled with
food scraps=2C places to curl up from a pounding rain

And he said to the man

=20

How can one not be living when there=92s so much stuff!!

=20

You see=97the Motherfucker of necessity and its Inventions!=97

=20

(Charlie Parker =96like Billie Holiday with hers----lost his
license to play evening Birdland the club named for him=2C because he was a
narcotic addict and alcoholic)

=20

=20

To tell the truth=2C  while writing this previous letter
that you cite--and then pausing for a bit after=97I was thinking =96oh no!!=
 Have I
been on the level with thinking on series=97no=97not serial production=2C b=
ut
series-so I was thinking why they are different?

=20

And the first thing that came to mind was the letter-writing
rookie =93busher=94=20

of Ring Lardner=92s You Know Me=2C Al=97

Who writes the World Series as the World Serious

Which of course it is for him in terms of glory and money--

So right away one realizes that Seriality may be left to
serial killers=20

while workers in Series enjoy being semi-literates whose
mis-writings carry within them the shift of a sound=2C of a few letters and
Voila!=97an open entry back and forth between two realms suddenly joined by=
 a
swinging door-- =20

a not-quite pun=2C yet close enough to function as a hinge=97

=20

In my case I know a series has no plan to it=97out of the blue
a phrase

a form

suddenly triggers a vast flowing =93series=94 of associations=97

So I just begin from there=97

With the form or phrase that triggered this=97

=20

I thought back to al the different factories and the tulip
bulb warehouse in Holland
where I have worked=97and the oncoming rush of those bits and pieces or hug=
e
boxes of things that one had to adjust to and perform with them dances of
Fordian Motion=97to the Tune of Taylor Time=97

Or else!!

(Except in Holland
some of us were =93schwarzarbeiter=94 black workers=97illegal alien
workers=97seasonal-- and so were tolerated to some extent---the good part w=
as
that when one ran amok the bosses and owners couldn=92t do anything about i=
t=20

because THEY were illegally employing us! -- Alien
workers!--

=20

 i have done quite a few "series" both in
writing and in visual and sound works--



actually that is a way of working i enjoy a lot and i don=92t necessarily d=
o a
series

like Pretty Maids=20

"all in a row"=20

OR--

"these pieces of the last two months are a series expressing the artist=92s
confrontation with the abyss=2C an event of which=2C he says=2C that though=
 he looked
at it=97

Completely unlike what Nietzsche said

IT DID NOT LOOK BACK AT HIM--

=20



i might take up a series months or years or minutes after having abandoned =
it
when something truly stunning Found=2C Found me and I Found it--



when i work in a series=2C the series doesn=92t come out of a preplanned st=
ructure
in which the elements are all to function in a serial manner --=20

(if you've worked in factories you know what that is like!)=97

=20

No=2C a series is quite another =93series of events=94 found long
the way=2C associative=2C uncanny=2C fraught with sudden about faces and ex=
plosive
interruptions=97

So=2C being unknown until one arrives or encounters each thing
=93ahead of one=94 that calls out to one=97

 And it sure doesn=92t have any

of the aggressive quality of those objects coming right at
one on the relentless merciless brutal assembly line!

=20

Perhaps thinking in terms of series rather serials may be
quite helpful=97

=20

William Burroughs wrote some thing very true which is
ignored by people who glamorize it=97of being a junky=2C Burroughs says=97

=93It=92s not about kicks.  It=92s a way of life.=94

=20

And=2C again voicing the experience of untold numbers of
recovering junkies the world over=97the Matt Dillon character who tells his=
 wife=2C
Kelly Lynch=2C that she can have all the dope he didn=92t give to Bill Burr=
oughs=2C
old Junkie Priest down the hall=97

Because=2C the tells her=97=93for the addict every day is the
same=2C one knows already how much needs to be measured out to keep the sic=
kness
away that day=97

And al the frantic desperate adventures along the way to
keeping a stash going=97

=20

Every day the same old story=97

But now that he is straight=2C Matt Dillon says=2C he is finding
out that he wakes up every day and knows untold numbers of things he hasn=
=92t
thought of or known ahead of time=2C are going to happen to him this day--

=20

Isn=92t a Serial Killer basically like a dope fiend in that
they are repeating endlessly the same old MO=92s=97with here and there a sl=
ight
variation=97

=20

With some of the =93intriguing=94 Killers there is a lot of
planning to do so that all ritualistically goes =93according to plan=94=97

=20

At the risk of groans I=92ll quote again Picasso though it=92s
basically the same with many others myself included=97

=20

=93I do not seek=2C I find.=94

Yet think of how many different Isms there have been in the
last fifty years which are really interested in a =93programmed chance (or =
not)
Seriality=94 in which the variations are to be surprises=2C if random=2C or=
 if not=2C
the revealing through time of a structure that builds=2C rather than the ex=
act
following of one copy after another in endless rows as with the factory=92s

Seriality=97

=20

There are some very interesting works done with many such
different investigations of Seriality in music=97especially=97

=20

You see=2C it is important to not make an either/or of
Seriality /Series=2C when one comes down to it=2C it is the both/and of the
different ways which elicits a greater invitation than if one sticks to jus=
t
one side of the questions=97

=20

One may take such things and find with in them paradoxes=2C
puns=2C the hinges which unhinge----that =93take the doors themselves off t=
heir
jambs!!=94 as Walt Whitman says=97

And so turn inside out the rigid formulations which all too
often become the =93Rules for Freedom=94 in composition and life--

=20

With a series. one has the ability to work in a freedom=2C an
uncanniness=2C un expectedness=2C of the Found=2C  that one doesn=92t have =
in the
most conceptions of the Serial=97which is a working for some one else=97and=
 their
profiting off  that money you turn over to them in every way they can
figure out--

To take back from you as much as possible=2C if not MORE than
is humanly possible!

=20

I would say that rather than choosing one aspect over another
before one just for fun thinks and works with them in a casual or a discipl=
ined
manner --just kicking the old can around=97and yet getting more and more
disciplined and good at it!--

=20

That=97why not=97follow Yogi Berra=92s advice and =93when you come
to a fork in the road=97take it!=94

Many of the isms today and poetics and so forth tend to be
proud of manuals exhorting Risk=97transgression=97risks and transgressions =
to be
sure on the page or canvas or screen=97

Yet these very things turn into formulas soon enough=97because
of the built in safety nets-

And then=97why not turn to Boredom as the Next Big Thing! ---

And what after that?

=20

You see this form of production's dependent on the Next Big
Thing to keep the production lines rolling and the jobs created by the carv=
ing
out of new genres and hybrids

And manuals and technological marvels=97

And what do aloof them have in common other than one is
being told continually to unquestioningly listen to the Authorities=97so th=
at one
doesn=92t get lost

=20

Yet finding oneself lost=97one finds out what is there=97via
Necessity the Motherfucker of Invention=97=20

Not a junk necessity of just staying not-sick and just going
on doing the same =96the same--the same boring junkie life so similar at ti=
mes to
factory life--

=20

=20

And finding this on one=92s own=2C one awakes to the
DIY=97breaking free of needing someone to tell you what and how and when wh=
ere
and why to do and behave and think

According to plan--

Because now the only person who can figure it out is
oneself--

And the Other and Others existing right beside and inside
and al around one=97

=20

Happy New Year to Everyone!!

Dear Eireene=97I wil write re the thing you name physcialy by which one may=

yet they are triggered not bea  madeleine outside oneself=2C but by the ver=

how they have none or at best a very teetering and Tower of Pisa  leaning a=

Before one takes these wags to seriously onehas to askoneself--how do they =
know so much about it--what are their examples and reasons--and how many of=
 them are just hotair--or current trends--which in a few days or minutes or=
 years will be hopelessly out of date and one wouldn't be cuaght dead leavi=

and what then?-then to simply beign bacwards and think--loneliness! now tha=
tis somthing i could take an interst in and findout how to lvie with it--se=
t up a kind of housekeeping with it as it wereor a kindof give and take fri=
endhsip in whch one discover that both of you are laughing t he fact that y=
ouahve between you only oneshadow--




To tell the truth=2C  while writing this previous letter you cite--and then=
 pausing for
a bit after=97I was thinking =96oh no!! Have I been on the level with think=
ing on
series=97no=97not serial production=2C
but series-so I was thinking why they are different?

=20

And the first thing that came to mind was the letter-writing
rookie =93busher=94=20

of Ring Lardner=92s You Know Me=2C Al=97

Who writes the World Series as the World Serious





Which of course it is for him in terms of glory and money--So right away on=
e realizes that Seriality may be left to
serial killers=20

while workers in Series enjoy being semi-literates whose
mis-writings carry within them the shift of a sound=2C of a few letters and=
 Voila!=97an
open entry back and forth between two realms suddenly joined by a swinging
door-- =20

a not-quite pun=2C yet close enough to function as a hinge=97

=20

In my case I know a series has no plan to it=97out of the blue
a phrasea form
suddenly triggers a vast flowing =93series=94 of
associations=97

So I just begin from there=97

With the form or phrase that triggered this=97

=20

I thought back to al the different factories and the tulip
bulb warehouse in Holland
where I have worked=97and the oncoming rush of those bits and pieces or hug=
e
boxes of things that one had to adjust to and perform with them dances of
Fordian Motion=97to the Tune of Taylor Time=97

Or else!!

(Except in Holland
some of us were =93schwarzarbeiter=94 black workers=97illegal alien workers=
=97seasonal--
and so were tolerated to some extent---the good part was that when one ran =
amok
the bosses and owners couldn=92t do anything about it=20

because THEY were illegally employing us! -- Alien workers!--

=20

 i have done quite a
few "series" both in writing and in visual and sound works--



actually that is a way of working i enjoy a lot and i don=92t necessarily d=
o a
series

like Pretty Maids=20

"all in a row"=20

OR--

"these pieces of the last two months are a series expressing the artist=92s=
 confrontation
with the abyss=2C an event of  which=2C he
says=2C  that though he looked at it=97

Completely unlike what Nietzsche said

IT DID NOT LOOK BACK AT HIM--

=20



i might take up a series months or years or minutes after having abandoned =
it when
something truly stunning Found=2C Found me and I Found it--



when i work in a series=2C the series doesn=92t come out of a preplanned st=
ructure
in which the elements are all to function in a serial manner --

(if you've worked in factories you know what that is like!)=97

=20

No=2C a series is quite another =93series of events=94 found long
the way=2C associative=2C uncanny=2C fraught with sudden about faces and ex=
plosive
interruptions=97

So=2C being unknown until one arrives or encounters each thing
=93ahead of one=94 that calls out to one=97

 And it sure doesn=92t
have any

of the aggressive quality of those objects coming right at
one on the relentless merciless brutal assembly line!

=20

Perhaps thinking in terms of series rather serials may be
quite helpful=97

=20

William Burroughs wrote some thing very true which is
ignored by people who glamorize it=97of being a junky=2C Burroughs says=97

=93It=92s not about kicks.=20
It=92s a way of life.=94

=20

And=2C again voicing the experience of untold numbers of
recovering junkies the world over=97the Matt Dillon charcter who tells his =
wife=2C
Kelly Lynch=2C that she can have all the dope he didn=92t give to Bill Burr=
oughs=2C
old Junkie Priest down the hall=97

Because=2C the tells her=97=93for the addict every day is the
same=2C one knows already how much needs to be measured out to keep the sic=
kness
away that day=97

And al the frantic desperate adventures along the way to
keeping a stash going=97

=20

Every day the same old story=97

But now that he is straight=2C Matt Dillon says=2C he is finding
out that he wakes up every day and knows untold numbers of things he hasn=
=92t
thought of or known ahead of time=2C are going to happen to him this day--

=20

Isn=92t a Serial Killer basically like a dope fiend in that
they are repeating endlessly the same old MO=92s=97with here and there a sl=
ight
variation=97

=20

With some of the =93intriguing=94 Killers there is a lot of
planning to do so that all ritualistically goes =93according to plan=94=97

=20

At the risk of groans I=92ll quote again Picasso though it=92s
basically the same with many others myself included=97

=20

=93I do not seek=2C I find.=94

Yet think of how many different Isms there have been in the last
fifty years which are really interested in a =93programmed chance (or not)
Seriality=94 in which the variations are to be surprises=2C if random=2C or=
 if not=2C
the revealing through time of a structure that builds=2C rather than the ex=
act following
of one copy after another in endless rows as with the factory=92s

Seriality=97

=20

There are some very interesting works done with many such
different investigations of Seriality in music=97especially=97

=20

You see=2C it is important to not make an either/or of
Seriality /Series=2C when one comes down to it=2C it is the both/and of the
different ways which elicits a greater invitation than if one sticks to jus=
t
one side of the questions=97

=20

One may take such things and find with in them paradoxes=2C
puns=2C the hinges which unhinge----that =93take the doors themselves off t=
heir jambs!!=94
as Walt Whitman says=97

And so turn inside out the rigid formulations which all too
often become the =93Rules for Freedom=94 in composition and life--

=20

With a series. one has the ability to work in a freedom=2C an uncanniness=
=2C
un expectedness=2C of the Found=2C  that one
doesn=92t have in the most conceptions of the Serial=97which is a working f=
or some
one else=97and their profiting off  that
money you turn over to them in every way they can figure out--

To take back from you as much as possible=2C if not MORE than
is humanly possible!

=20

I would say that rather than choosing one aspect over
another before one just for fun thinks and works with them in a casual or a
disciplined manner --just kicking the old can around=97and yet getting more=
 and
more disciplined and good at it!--

=20

That=97why not=97follow Yogi Berra=92s advice and =93when you come
to a fork in the road=97take it!=94

Many of the isms today and poetics and so forth tend to be
proud of manuals exhorting Risk=97transgression=97risks and transgressions =
to be
sure on the page or canvas or screen=97

Yet these very things turn into formulas soon enough=97because
of the built in safety nets-

And then=97why not turn to Boredom as the Next Big Thing! ---

And what after that?

=20

You see this form of production's dependent on the Next Big
Thing to keep the production lines rolling and the jobs created by the carv=
ing out
of new genres and hybrids

And manuals and technological marvels=97

And what do aloof them have in common other than one is
being told continually to unquestioningly listen to the Authorities=97so th=
at one
doesn=92t get lost

=20

Yet finding oneself lost=97one finds out what is there=97via Necessity
the Motherfucker of Invention=97=20

Not a junk necessity of just staying not-sick and just going
on doing the same =96the same--the same boring junkie life so similar at ti=
mes to
factory life--

=20

=20

And finding this on one=92s own=2C one awakes to the DIY=97breaking
free of needing someone to tell you what and how and when where and why to =
do
and behave and think

According to plan--

Because now the only person who can figure it out is oneself--

And the Other and Others existing right beside and inside
and al around one=97

=20

Happy New Year to Everyone!!
