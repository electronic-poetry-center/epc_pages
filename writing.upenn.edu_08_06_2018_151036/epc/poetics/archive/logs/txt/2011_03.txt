"Phonomomtage," whether it exists as a word or not, is the bread and butter
of film editing. Perhaps Godard is the primary practitioner of the art where
sound/noise acts as an independent character, often placed in the foreground
of linear action. For instance, in Godard's last film *Socialisme* there is
a sequence on a cruise ship where waiters, etc,. working in the dining
roomare in the foreground, rather than the passengers ostensibly for whom
the ship is built; and more than the waiters, the noises, clatters, the
plates, the tools, etc. they carry make.

This kind of effect which disorients conventional expectations is only
possible through a sound montage.

Ciao,

      ?Multiformalism? is a term that the poet, critic, and editor
Annie Finch employs to discuss a range of formal poetic traditions,
including experimental poems.  This capacious word may begin to resolve
the limitations of ?formalism? as a discrete genre. In her essay, ?The
Trouble with a Word like Formalism,? Anne Stevenson writes, ?In a good
poem, as everyone knows, form is inseparable from sense and tone. No
poem worthy of the name can be formless?The sounds, rhythms, pitch and
intensity of the lines ARE the form. Every poem is its form.  A bad or
failed poem is one whose form has either been imposed too much upon it,
or neglected through ignorance or lack of an ear??   Nevertheless,
?form? continues to be a problematic term in contemporary poetics,
particularly in its relationship to history.  For female writers and
people of color, formal verse is a vexed, yet potentially critical
zone.  In Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination,
Toni Morrison writes, ?Those of us who come from traditions of
oppression find ourselves estranged from canonical texts, and must
fight?against them and our arguments with them?to own them.?


Questions to consider include, but are not limited to, the following:

	What are the political valences of formal or multiformal poems in
relationship to practice and theory?

How might multiformalism be relevant and even vital in contemporary poetics?
How might formal poems, even such traditional poetic forms as blank
verse, offer versatile and sonically adventurous opportunities for
disruption and variation?
How might a revolutionary potentiality inhere in formal poetry, as has
been the case in Tahrir Square, where protesters have sung
couplet-slogans to galvanize a political movement? How might formal
poetry be decolonizing? How might form denaturalize oppressive
structures?
How might formal poetry involve expressive modulation and the
possibility of discovery, both of self and other?
In what ways do traditional and experimental forms provide an
efflorescent zone for marginalized communities?

Please send any creative or critical work that delves into
?multiformalism,? employing or discussing traditional or experimental
forms to barzakh@gmail.com by April 15. Please write ?Poetics and Form?
in the subject line.

if theres no 'phonomontage' i think its more because no ones run with it as=
 a term=2C rather than no ones done it ..

i think its prob common in contemp sound poetry - going on my limited knowl=
edge - but conceptually in print also

cris - im curious that u said cage was a better poet than olson due to his =
ideas rather than his poetry ..

"Dirty" concrete as I recall is a term like "Dada" with an uncertain
origin.  It was a familiar usage in the early seventies in my own
discussions with bp Nichol about
the incipient hierarchization within the international concrete
movement.  We both noted that anthologies were regurgitating the same
material which was straight edged, typographically lucid (Garnier's
work for instance and Eugen Gomringer's as well as Ian Hamilton
Finlay's in Scotland and that of the de Campos brothers in Brazil
Wet both considered that what seemed to offer itself as a vanguard
movement dedicated to poetic change was rapidly ossifying.
Nichol certainly used the term in his letters to and from Stephen
Scobie (living in the same town as bp we met and chatted rather than
wrote to each other hence my take is purely anecdotal).  But George's
take is accurate and it applies to much of bissett's practice, my
own, less so bp, and definitely to Bob Cobbing in England and the
younger writers (Chris Cheek, Lawrence Upton and PC Fencott) who came
out of Bob's revolutionary poetry workshops.

The practice of dirty concrete seems to be continuing in Canada via
writers such as Derek Beaulieu and jw curry (among others).


my best to everyone
Steve McCaffery

Hmm.  This is quite the examination of class Adam.  Has anyone else
taken a look at this?
http://fieledsfairgame.blogspot.com/2011/02/class-and-risk-nirvanas-in-bloom.html

So Nirvana, to be "educated in class" was to not appear to be rubes?
Are all working class people rural?  "Rube" is a term for "country
bumpkin."  And what does it mean to be "educated in class" in the
first place?  What you are saying is that Nirvana is a late 20th
century Pymalion experiment then?

And Nirvana was, in attempting to not appear to be rubes, wanting
everyone to think that their message was NOT Grunge?  Isn't Nirvana
the biggest proponent of the Grunge music genre?  This is all very
confusing because I don't think of Grunge as embodying or embracing
the dominant culture but resisting it.

And coming from working class people I can safely say that none of us
hold poverty dear to our hearts.  Poverty isn't dear.  Poverty is
frightening.  Poverty is something that keeps us up at night made sick
with worry.

I'm more confused than anything by these astonishing ideas you put forth,
CAConrad

All, just to say thank you for your interesting and helpful responses to the
issue of "dirty concrete" - I still have not yet figured out definitively
who came up with the term but generally people seem to think it was either
bpNichol or bill bissett. I might have a phone interview lined up with Mike
Weaver in a week or two and so I'm hoping he might be able to clear up some
of these questions.

"A common sign monkey strategy in some major cities in West Africa is to
stage a public drama, in the form of a mock fight, auction sales, card
games, and so on. Naturally, you would like to stop and watch, or maybe go
beyond that to separate the fighters and broker peace. Good. Sign monkey
fighters are looking for peace loving fools to separate them."

Subject: An invitation to participate in the 2012 MLA convention in Seattle

Dear Colleague,

I write to invite you to join me at the 2012 MLA Annual Convention, which
will take place in Seattle, 5=968 January. I also invite you to consider
participating, by presenting a paper, joining a roundtable discussion, or
organizing a session. The MLA Program Committee especially welcomes session
proposals in formats that highlight teaching experience, creative work, and
civic engagement and encourages you to view an invitation from the committe=
e
at www.mla.org/proposal_invite.

To be included in the convention program, search (www.mla.org/cfp_search) o=
r
browse (www.mla.org/cfp_browse) the calls for papers already posted on the
MLA Web site. Through 1 March 2011, you may also submit your own call for
papers at www.mla.org/cfp_main. As the session organizer, you are
responsible for acknowledging all submissions and inquiries regarding your
call for papers. We recommend posting a submission deadline of not later
than 15 March.

Please keep in mind that a call for papers is not a session proposal but a
way to solicit paper submissions for creating a session proposal. Proposal
forms for the 2012 convention will be available at www.mla.org/ssp_main in
early March.
Completed proposal forms must be submitted by 1 April 2011. The MLA Program
Committee will determine which session proposals are accepted.

All participants in convention sessions must be MLA members by 7 April 2011=
,
and members should review other guidelines for the MLA convention (
www.mla.org/conv_procedures) before responding to or submitting calls for
papers.

The MLA Annual Convention is an exciting intellectual and professional
event. I hope you will consider participating, and I look forward to seeing
you in Seattle.


Cordially,

Belladonna* and Kundiman Celebrate Theresa Hak Kyung Cha

On the weekend of what would have been Cha's 60th birthday (a full life cycle
event in the Chinese/Korean lunar calendar), Belladonna* and Kundiman gather
nine poets to perform a staged reading from Dictee. Cha's best known written
work, Dictee focuses on the life of several women framed with the art of the
Greek muses, yet in the cosmos of Shamanism and Daoism. Their struggle to speak
and overcome suffering is enacted through amixture of media which destabilizes
the notion of a progressive and seamless history.


Participants to include: Tamiko Beyer, Sarah Gambito, Laura Hinton, Cathy Park
Hong, Myung Mi Kim, Soomi Kim, Alison Roh Park, Sina Queyras, Jen Shyu, Anne
Waldman, Genevieve White, Zhang Er

Join us for an afternoon of projected images, voices, pictorial characters,
scholarly contextualization, a birthday cake, and surprises.


Screening of Cha's video works courtesy of University of California, Berkeley

Jen Hyde, Small Anchor Press;=A0Pei-Ling Lue, One Story;=A0Jacqueline
Waters, The Physiocrats. Moderated by=A0Kimiko Hahn, MFA Program, Queens
College, CUNY
Is the chapbook merely a charming medium for poetry? How is this
perceived limitation changing and why? What can the chapbook do for
fiction, nonfiction, and drama? Are the publications only for
experimental texts? What about digital technologies? How are chapbooks
expanding the definition of each genre as well as cross-genre
expectations? Is the chapbook just a momentary stay against the brutal
commercialization of the industry? Is it even charming? Who cares?
Panelists will address these questions and speak about individual
projects and visions.

A Roundtable on Lost & Found: The CUNY Poetics Document Initiative
The Skylight Room (9100), The Graduate Center, CUNY, 365 Fifth Ave at
34th street
Even in the digital age, the book occupies enormous cultural space and
remains a central metaphor of many civilizations. How have poets in
the 20th and 21st centuries honored and expanded this tradition? How
are histories newly created from archival materials and what are the
differences between personal and institutional archives? What are the
roles of preservation and design in the transmission of culture? In
this extraordinary gathering, hear the perspectives of poets,
scholars, archivists, and book designers as they discuss these and
other questions. Participants include=A0Ammiel Alcalay, poet, scholar,
and founder of Lost & Found;=A0Steve Clay, archivist, scholar, and
publisher, founder of Granary Books;=A0Megan Mangum, book designer and
founder of Words that Work;=A0Anne Waldman, poet and co-founder, with
Allen Ginsberg, of the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at
Naropa University.

Following the roundtable discussion, join us for a presentation and
celebration with the editors of=A0Lost & Found, Series 2, with readings,
video, and audio presentations of works by Diane di Prima, Robert
Duncan, David Henderson, Margaret Randall, and Muriel Rukeyser.
Special guest=A0Ken Irby, author of=A0The Intent On=A0(winner of the 2010
Shelley Award), will launch the series with the reading of a new poem
that will be available as a broadside. Poet David Henderson will read.

The practice, not the term, probably dates to the visual and aural montages of witchboards and newspapers that indicated the word was spreading. Partly heard overlapping conversations were featured among the first time in Citizen Kane. The first aural montage in the Eisensteinian sense that I'm aware of was in the opening sequence of Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire.

is this fundamentally a question of the nature of the engagement with
technology? or is it, more superficially, a matter of  'look'?

I find the term immediately attractive and interesting, even as I try to
locate its center -- how it would be distinct from or a sub-set of sound
poetry, text sound, phonetic poetry, poesie sonore .  Does orality, live
performance, or mechanical mediation enter into it?  There are formal
distinctions that could be made between say Dada sound (voiced) poetry and
the multi-track, magnetic tape experiments of artists especially from the
1960s onward.

Like the Cage / Olson contrast mentioned yesterday, what has often puzzled
me is the marginalization or categorization of other sound arts with
language as outside the spectrum of poetry or literature.  I remember
listening to Kenneth Gaburo years ago and wondering why Lingua II Maldeto
(also happily now at ubuweb http://www.ubu.com/sound/gaburo.html)  was
experimental music but Kurt Schwitters belonged to poetry.  Still don't know
the answer, except that Gaburo was paid by a music department.

Dick Higgins is still very much worth reading on these issues:

The Chicago Poetry Project presents

a staged reading of the play

The Dust of Suns

by Raymond Roussel

Trans. Harry Mathews

French poet, novelist and playwright Raymond Roussel (1877-1933) faced
almost universal incomprehension and derision during his lifetime, for work=
s
that neglected traditional character and plot development in favor of the
construction of elaborate descriptions and anecdotes based on hidden
wordplay. While the premieres of his self-financed plays caused near-riots,
admirers included Surrealists Andre Breton and Robert Desnos, who called Th=
e
Dust of Suns (1926) =93another incursion into the unknown which you alone a=
re
exploring.=94 Roussel never enjoyed the posthumous fame of his hero Jules
Verne, but he has exercised a powerful fascination upon later writers and
artists including the French Oulipo group, Marcel Duchamp, John Ashbery,
Michel Foucault, and Michael Palmer. New editions of his novels and poetry
are forthcoming this year from Princeton and Dalkey Archive.

Like much of Roussel=92s writing, The Dust of Suns has a colonial setting.
Against the backdrop of fin-de-siecle French Guiana, a convoluted treasure
hunt unfolds. Along the way, Roussel fully indulges his penchant for bizarr=
e
invention and juxtaposition. The Frenchman Blache seeks his uncle=92s
inheritance: a cache of gems whose location lies at the end of a chain of
clues that includes a sonnet engraved on a skull and the recollections of a=
n
albino shepherdess. Meanwhile, his daughter Solange is in love with
Jacques=97but all Jacques knows of his parentage is a mysterious tattoo on =
his
shoulder...

This script-in-hand performance of Roussel=92s play, directed by John Beer,
with design by Caroline Picard, features an array of Chicago writers and
artists. Performers include: James Tadd Alcox, Joshua Corey, Joel Craig,
Monica Fambrough, Sara Gothard, Judith Goldman, Samantha Irby, Lisa Janssen=
,
Jennifer Karmin, Jamie Kazay, John Keene, Jacob Knabb, Francesco Levato,
Brian Nemtusak, Travis Nichols, Jacob Saenz, Larry Sawyer, Suzanne Scanlon,
Jennifer Steele and Nicole Wilson.

Where: The Charnel House, 3421 W. Fullerton St., 773.871.9046

When: March 4-6; Fri, Sat 8pm; Sun 3pm. ALL PERFORMANCES ARE FREE.

the problem it seems to me - apart from stevensons tone which might make an=
yone prefer to write bad poems -

is who is reading it?

in terms of this question:

How might formal poems=2C even such traditional poetic forms as blank=20

> disruption and variation?

it sounds like a version of experimentalism for formalists - but only forma=
lists will think so - will even read the poems -

experimentalism seems to get left behind in the first sentence of the abstr=
act

toni morrisons book is brilliant

i think that indigenous takes on formal verse are on one level bitterly iro=
nic - ie look at the poor form youve left me to compose in

So Nirvana=2C to be "educated in class" was to not appear to be rubes?
Are all working class people rural?  "Rube" is a term for "country

the biggest proponent of the Grunge music genre?  This is all very
confusing because I don't think of Grunge as embodying or embracing
the dominant culture but resisting it.

And coming from working class people I can safely say that none of us

frightening.  Poverty is something that keeps us up at night made sick

Hi folks;
I just received this call for submissions from DANDELION magazine, and
thought that it might be of interest.
*****
dandelion is BUILDING | performance/MACHINE
Editor Kathleen Brown / Assistant Editor Sandy Pool
performance/MACHINE is inspired by contemporary avant garde poetic
practices, pataphysics, physics physics, devised theatre, and the work of
artists who are engaged in collaborative performance practices with
computers and machines. Dandelion seeks submissions of work from artists wh=
o
are experimenting with our relationship to technology and computers in
ACTIVE ways =AD through kinetic, digital, interdisciplinary, interactive,
poetic practices.
The MACHINE invites you to consider how writing, and the genres of writing
are translated and re-mediated by the internet and new technologies in the
post-print movement. Artists are producing a wealth of online texts, and
bodies of work where writing is performed without paper or print. How can
science and writing collaborate to redefine genre? What writings are our
machines producing and how can we read, and collaborate with them? What doe=
s
multimedia look like when you combine the materiality of text with the
materials of hardware and code? What new codes are we writing to perform
collaborations with our machines?
Curious about the genus of work we=B9re seeking? =8CRead=B9 a small sampling of
our artistic sources of inspiration here:
Antonin Artaud / Alva Noto / Aya Natalia Karpinska / Blast Theory / Kurtis
Lesick / J.R. Carpenter / Mark Z. Danielewski / Brion Gysin / Thierry
Gauthier
Dandelion <http://www.dandelionmag.ca/index.php> encourages your hybrid
experiments and welcomes visual and video work as well as text-based
submissions. This issue will feature a web-based section for
digital/interactive media presentations.
Submissions should be 3000 words maximum for fiction/poetry, 10 minutes
maximum for video and/or sound work, up to 6 images for visual art, visual
poetry, diagrams, charts, etc.
Deadline: March 25, 2011

Subject:      jack spicer's beowulf
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hello

Just wanted to highlight a project that's recently been
brought out by the wonderful Lost & Found: The CUNY Poetics Document
Initiative series: Jack Spicer's Beowulf, edited by me (David Hadbawnik) and
Sean
Reynolds, including selections from a never-before-seen Beowulf
translation that was discovered in Spicer's archive at UC Berkeley.
With a huge assist from Kevin Killian, I was able to get this document
copied, and Sean and I transcribed parts of it, and wrote an
introduction and afterword for the publication.

It's a very exciting find, only exists in Spicer's handwriting, and as
our essays explain, helps provide an important context for Spicer as
translator and medievalist. Link to the series is here:

http://www.centerforthehumanitiesgc.org/publications

And if you happen to be in New York, my colleague Sean will be
speaking about the project at the CUNY chapbook festival tomorrow
evening:

http://www.centerforthehumanitiesgc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=19

best,

David

This issue of the Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies seeks to explore the pol=
itical, social, and cultural significations of =93evil=94 (and its corollar=
y: the =93good=94) via a critical analysis of the fluid, mutable figure of =
the =93villain,=94 aiming to examine its construction and its existence in =
the world.

A few possible perspectives for the study of the villain are:

  *   The villain as the =93natural=94 being
  *   The villain as the sacrificial other
  *   The villain as a figure that defies representation
  *   The villain as hero
  *   The villain as non-existent
  *   The villain as a personification of evil
  *   The villain as Doppelganger

Diverse approaches to this topic are welcomed and actively encouraged. Poss=
ible lenses through which to view the =93villain=94 include, but are not li=
mited to, cultural, film and literary studies, political theory, law and le=
gal theory, studies of colonialism and nationalism, post-humanism, religiou=
s studies, economics, visual arts, communication and media studies, and pop=
ular culture. We invite submissions from critical and ethnographic scholars=
 across all disciplines.

Please submit two (2) printed copies and one by email by May 6, 2011 to the

Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies,
English Department,
308 English-Philosophy Building,

University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242


Contact ijcs@uiowa.edu<mailto:ijcs@uiowa.edu> with any questions or to send=
 submissions.

We prefer essays no longer than 9,000 words, MLA format. Please keep discur=
sive endnotes to a minimum.

The Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies is a peer-reviewed publication edited =
by graduate
students that mixes traditional approaches and contemporary interventions i=
n the

interdisciplinary humanities and interpretive social sciences.

Anybody who thinks rock reclaimed the cultural center stage in the 90s
wasn't listening. Hip-hop was easily as strong by then -hugely popular,
generating millions of dollars, adding words to the language, changing the
way people dressed, capturing the attention of young people around the world
in a way that grunge did not. But you'd never guess it from Adam Fieled's
piece.

Certainly true: hip hop was huge in the 90s, whereas grunge, while also
popular, largely lost a lot of bite after Nirvana. One got the sense that
grunge had been tamed by the industry it purported to reject. Hip hop, on
the other hand, in embracing commercialism (at least later) has been able to
subvert the fame it claims to want to be a part of. One example of this is
when we look at lyrics and the "tameness" of the music. Hip hop has grown
more complex, more varied and much more genre-expanding than it was in the
90s. This isn't to say that many of the artists now weren't at work 10-20
years ago (Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Jay Z, all were); perhaps hip hop has been
allowed to mature in ways grunge never could.

Arpine is one of the few living American writers to whose works the term
"profound" may be meaningfully affixed. She has as capacious a consciousnes=
s
as any I have ever encountered: Science weds Philosophy and yields the
Poetic and the Fictive (in Wallace Stevens' sense). Her mind is fertile lik=
e
the garden and pond of Giverny. To fully appreciate her writings one must
strive to emulate her genius for synthesizing the currents of a personal an=
d
intellectual history. We should not be surprised if we do not accomplish
this overnight =97 although Dream is indeed another state of Being and
Becoming: A Rainbow at Midnight, and A Dawn Eclipse.  =97 *Gerald Locklin*,
California State University, Long Beach

In Armenian, we learn, the word for money is the mirror image =97 the antig=
ram
=97 of the word for human. In her focus on the word as the smallest unit of
composition, Arpine Konyalian Grenier=92s essays and memoirs light the dark=
est
corridors of history and disaster. That's her method. In practice, she
provides a deft gloss on Fanon's notion of occult instability, locating it
in language, more precisely in poetry, and always in music. Her wisdom come=
s
not from the bookshelf, though she is the most learned essayist I know, but
from life itself, or from cultural memory and its subtractions. Through her
observations a longing absence ferociously prowls, growling like a
lion. =97 *Kevin
Killian*, Novelist, Poet, Playwright

Konyalian Grenier's *The Concession Stand* makes language take new turns.
Her essays are poems, really. Her quest is to understand what it means to b=
e

Severance Songs:
a book release party for
Joshua Corey

Saturday, March 12th
7pm

With readings by Chicago writers:
Robert Archambeau
John Beer
Ray Bianchi
Joel Craig
Chris Green
Jennifer Karmin
Simone Muench
Kristy Odelius

at The Book Cellar
4736-38 N. Lincoln Ave
Chicago, Illinois

*Free*

Joshua Corey brings his third collection of poetry, Severance Songs to the Book Cellar for its Chicago launch party.  Severance Songs, winner of the 2008 Dorset Prize from Tupelo press, is a sequence of unrhymed sonnets, written in the wake of 9/11. The poems live in the contraditions that exist within sardonic lyricism and dark humor.

A celebration of the sonnet, the reading of the new book of poetry by Corey will be interwoven by readings of new and classic sonnets by a cavalcade of Chicago poets.

*
*
*Release show at The powerHouse in DUMBO on Monday, March 21*
*
*
*
*
*New Amsterdam Records* welcomes singer-songwriters* Shara Worden* (of My
Brightest Diamond) and* Clare Muldaur Manchon* (of Clare and the Reasons),
along with indie-classical multi-instrumentalist/composer* Rob Moose*,
collaborators in the enchanted and melancholy* Letters to Distant Cities*, =
a
multi-media project curated and produced by photographer and
videographer*Murat Eyuboglu
*, exploring urban solitude through the poetry of Turkish-American
poet,*Mustafa Ziyalan
*.

The album will be re-created in a* multi-media release event* at* The
powerHouse Arena* on* Monday, March 21 (7 pm)* featuring* live
performances*by Worden, Moose, Manchon, as well as readings of the
poetry in the original
Turkish by Ziyalan with English readings of the translations by Worden, and
a video for each of the albums songs (*The Sea and Invisible*), produced by
Eyuboglu (available online only). To round out the evening, Worden and
Manchon will perform a few extra tunes of their own, not included on the
album. Tickets are $10 at the door. www.powerhousearena.com

*Letters to Distant Cities*, released* Tuesday, March 29*, is a spoken-word
album bookended by two original songs: My Brightest Diamond's* The Sea* and
Clare and the Reasons'* Invisible*.* The Sea* opens the album and cracks th=
e
door to a mythical realm, into which Shara Worden enters and embodies the
female persona of Ziyalan's poetry, speaking the texts of 24 poetic
snapshots, connected by Rob Moose's incidental reflections and intervention=
s
for violin. After the poetry,* Invisible* closes the album, drifting
wistfully to its bittersweet conclusion.

Says fellow poet Murat Nemet-Nejat: "In Ziyalan's work one can see the
impulse of the Turkish language in the 20th Century to represent a social
reality beyond national borders. It points to the prophetic nature of
Turkish poetry becoming a medium for a global sensibility - the psychic
dislocations globalism creates in consciousness."

An excerpt from* Letters to Distant Cities*:

She'd save
tarred puppies,
write letters to distant cities,
run ahead, keep her eyes peeled for them,
whisper to every tree, every shadow
along the sidewalks, along the streets,
try to collect the scattered stars
every time her head bumped into the Milky Way.

In addition to the CD, the album package includes a set of 24 pristine
keepsake cards, comprising a photographic illustration for each of Zilayan'=
s
poems collected on the recording. The images were captured by project
visionary Murat Eyuboglu with model Jamie Ansley. Designer Adam Frint bring=
s
musical, poetic, and photographic elements together, creating a physical
connection to the album's sense of memorabilia.

*M O R E   A B O U T   T H E   A R T I S T S*

Singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist* SHARA WORDEN* spearheads the
indie-folk band My Brightest Diamond. With a background in classical music,
Worden studied opera at the University of North Texas and Manhattan School
of Music, and studied composition with composer/performer Padma Newsome
(Clogs, The National). My Brightest Diamond involves elements of rock and
classical music, with the combined sound of instrumentalists Rob Moose, Ear=
l
Harvin, Chris Bruce, and Zac Rae. Their first record,* Bring Me the
Workhorse*, was released on Asthmatic Kitty Records in 2006. Their sophomor=
e
album,* A Thousand Shark's Teeth*, was released in 2008.

Recent years have found Worden collaborating as much as songwriting. Last
October, New Amsterdam's own Sarah Kirkland-Snider released the song
cycle,*Penelope
*, featuring Worden on vocals. On the rock side, Worden sang the role of Th=
e
Queen for The Decemberists' rock opera,* The Hazards of Love*. She was hear=
d
on Sufjan Stevens' albums* Illinois* and* The Age of Adz*, dueted with Davi=
d
Byrne for his album* Here Lies Love*, and she sang in Padma Newsome's
chamber ensemble, Clogs, for* The Creatures in the Garden of Lady Walton*.
Worden also performed with Bryce and Aaron Dessner in* The Long
Count*theater production at BAM.

Clare and the Reasons, fronted by collaborators* CLARE MULDAUR MANCHON* and
Olivier Manchon, is a Brooklyn-based indie-pop outfit started in 2005. Live=
,
they have a steady list of contributors, with a host of acoustic instrument=
s
-- cellos, violas, things to hit, kazoos, baby kotos, saws, recorders, and =
a
bass drum that says "Kaboom" on it. Clare and the Reasons deliver an
assortment of meticulously constructed and arranged songs. Walking the line
between musical maturity and sophistication and primal, childlike musical
instincts, Clare and the Reaons floats between both worlds, comfortably.

After two years touring their first album, "The Movie," which included
contributions from Van Dyke Parks and Sufjan Stevens, they announced the
arrival of their sophomore album this past fall. "Arrow" (Frog Stand
Records) features a special guest appearance from Shara Worden of My
Brightest Diamond, and has gathered a swarm of acclaim since its release.

A graduate of the Manhattan School of Music in violin performance,* ROB
MOOSE* has established an exciting and eclectic presence as performer,
arranger and conductor in the rapidly changing atmosphere of contemporary
music. Since joining Antony and the Johnsons in 2005, Moose has also toured
with Sufjan Stevens, Beth Orton and Duncan Sheik, and recorded with Vampire
Weekend, Grizzly Bear, Arcade Fire, The National, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Rufus
Wainwright and Marianne Faithfull.

In 2009, he co-arranged and music directed* The Long Count*, a multimedia
song cycle commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave
Festival.  Elsewhere, his arrangements have been performed and recorded by
Antony, Loudon Wainwright, Punch Brothers, Elizabeth and the Catapult and
Bon Iver.  Moose recently performed for President Obama on national
television, playing guitar and violin in support of Renee Fleming's album,
"Dark Hope."

*MUSTAFA ZIYALAN*'s poetry, short fiction, essays and poetry translations
have appeared in many literary periodicals, anthologies (most recently
in*New European Poets
*) and also in book form.* Istanbul Noir*, an anthology of short fiction he
co-edited with Amy Spangler, was published by Akashic Books in 2008. His
most recent volume of poetry,* Land of Smiles/G=C3=BCl=C3=BCmsemeler =C3=9C=
lkesi*, a
bilingual collection of poetry with original woodcuts by Vladimir Ginzburg,
was published in 2009.* Su Kedileri* (Water Cats), a collection of short
fiction, came out in 2005,* Yak=C5=BElacak Kentlerden* (From Cities Slated =
to
Burn), a collection of travel writing with original photography by Murat
Ey=C3=BCbog=CB=9Clu, in 2007,* Manhattan'da S=C2=B8iir Konus=C2=B8malar=C5=
=BE* (Poetry Talks in
Manhattan), a collection of writings on poets and poetry, in 2009.

He was born at the Black Sea coast of Turkey and worked as a general
practitioner and coroner in a rural Anatolian village. He now lives and
practices psychiatry in New York. He has worked with torture victims,
inmates, children abusing volatile substances, pathological gamblers, and
persons with HIV.

*MURAT EYUBOGLU* started photography as an apprentice to Josephine Powell i=
n
Istanbul. After attending the Academy of Fine Arts, School of Photography
(Istanbul), he transferred to Bennington College, Vermont, where he studied
music, literature and philosophy. He lived in Paris and returned to New Yor=
k
to pursue studies in music history. His dissertation was on the utopian
aspects of Gustav Mahler's works. Since 2000 he has focused mainly on
portraiture and has been working on various collaborative projects. In 2007=
,
he also started working in video. He participated in the documentary Claude
L=C3=A9vi-Strauss: Aupr=C3=A8s de l'Amazonie as assistant director. His pho=
tographs
have been published by the French edition of National Geographic and his
music videos have been released by Asthmatic Kitty Records and New Amsterda=
m
Records. He lives in New York City.

typography, an appreciation for illustration, and a passion for fine art
black and white photography. A senior designer at AGI, a global leader in

Featuring Denise Shubin, Pam Dollak, Karina Croskrey, Michael Onori, Marc
Forget and Colin Wolfe



This play takes place in the home of Gilbert and Mitzi Keegan Fay, in the
Virginia/D.C. area.  Gilbert is retired military.  Mitzi is ex-beauty
queen/Southern Belle.  The time is mid-1980s, late October.  Diana Fay
Fletcher returns home after fifteen years of estrangement with her family,
with a Ph.D. in Buddhism and a Boston Brahmin husband.  Cindy, her younger
sister, has just returned home, too -- from two years at The Virginia
Correctional Center for Women -- with a drug habit and a dangerous boyfrien=
d
we never see.  Mitzi has just undergone a mastectomy and chemotherapy, but
has not been told of her very negative prognosis.  Her husband has decided
to keep that a secret from her.  This is not a loving family.  No one's
motives are pure.

Magdalene chooses exotic dancing as a way to rescue her sexuality from a
fundamental Christian past. Paul, her first love deceased for two years,
materializes in the no man=92s land of her dressing room. As they reenact
their adolescent courtship boundaries between consent and violation
dissolve. For Magdalene being watched becomes an act of courage, and Paul i=
s
a reminder that what she leaves behind will never die.

*An Invitation to Attend E-Poetry 2011**!*

If you are interested in the emerging edge of language-informed arts
practice, whether as a poet, writer, artist, media innovator, scholar,
teacher, performer, or in any other disciplines, E-Poetry offers a
context for practice and analysis that can't be found anywhere else in
the world. For its tenth anniversary, E-Poetry has been brought back to
Buffalo, a central and accessible location for its activities. It will
provide a mix of practices, with the emphasis on emerging practices in
multiple disciplines that find themselves embedded or even just on the
edge of the digital. It will convene a celebratory (in the triumphant
spirit of preceding historic poetry festivals) and thought-filled
gathering of 150 artists, writers, and scholars from 40 countries -- a
diversity and culturally rich offering that won't be found elsewhere.
Please attend:


*E-POETRY 2011
International Digital Language | Arts Festival
/TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY FESTIVAL/**
*May 18-21, 2011
University at Buffalo
http://epc.buffalo.edu/e-poetry/2011/
Web registration now available! Specially-priced advance registration
offered during March 2011 only!
http://epc.buffalo.edu/e-poetry/2011/register.html

E-Poetry is the definitive innovative digital language arts festival in
the world. With its emphasis on poetics, performance, engaged arts,
experimentation, and scholarly and artistic conversation, and with
previous events in West Virginia, London, Paris, and Barcelona, it has
defined international digital literature poetics today.

/The tenth anniversary festival of E-Poetry 2011 is set to launch a new
epoch in digital literature. E-Poetry, at its inception, was the first
to map this field. E-Poetry has been here since the beginning and
continues even stronger today. It has set out to organize the 2011
festival as a culmination of the first ten years as well as a model for
future years -- advancing the conversation of the digital into the
engaged scene of creative and scholarly activity that the field promises./

With its sponsoring organization, the Electronic Poetry Center
(http://epc.buffalo.edu), often recognized as the world's first and
preeminent Web-based poetry resource, E-Poetry will define the arts as
emerging practice in an interdisciplinary, aesthetically complex, and
materially delightful manner never before seen. We invite you to be there.

The Festival will take place from Weds. May, 18th to Saturday May 21st,
2011, with special conference events on Tues, May 17 and its Wednesday
"Scientific Committee" panels. Please come for as long as you can. The
cost of visiting Buffalo is quite reasonable. We will be glad to help
with suggestions for your travel and accommodation. E-Poetry offers the
chance for a prolonged immersion into considerations of the workings and
practices of digital poets, scholars, and artists. Buffalo is a
location, fervent with the great powers of the Niagara rushing through
the tranquil, flat, maple forested countryside of Western New York,
where we can come together, apart from the hustle of a devouring city,
to meet as artists and thinkers. It is a location that offers
celebration and contemplation. It is a quiet place but a location within
New York State's largest university, its programs direct descendants of
Black Mountain College, Language Poetry, various iterations of the
Poetics Program, Media Study at Buffalo, and the Electronic Poetry
Center. Buffalo is a prime leader in the U.S. in the innovative digital,
visual, sound, and language arts.

Xerolage 49 - scriptions by Tim Gaze

http://xexoxial.org/is/xerolage49/by/tim_gaze

    The thing I like about Tim's new book is that it shows the full
range of styles that he is capable of creating. It has some of his
line drawing asemics, and his nebulous decalcomania.  This is a great
general survey of the instincts of an asemic master at work and honing
the tip of his pen. "Zen calligrapher" is what I think of this grand
author's expressions, as they soar overhead and land in a field of ink
and honey. This is the real thing! Get a hold of it and learn.
    =97Michael Jacobson

    Writing OR drawing=97either category sets up a filter through which
we interpret what we are seeing. But if these pages of marks on paper
are allowed to exist in the un-coded, uncultivated, lawless area
BETWEEN writing and drawing, we have nothing to rely on but our own
perceptions. These visual gestures=97non-coercive, un-systematized,
a-centric=97I myself have been looking at them with great interest as
visual indications of sound.
    =97Rosaire Appel

    Yes, the traces and signs and glyphs by Tim Gaze presented here,
come from the wide realm of the "Asemic." This term is common in the
area of verbovisual poetry. It deals with graphic works resembling
alphabetic writing, but being "other," unknown, illegible too.

    We can focus on this:

    Any writer, anyone, can really be the one with no (political,
social, economic) power. One can really realize and actually grasp,
today, what's the meaning of the term "loss" (loss of influence, for
example): the alphabetical dominion over men is still strong, but on
the other hand the writers have definitely lost their power, and they
often get rid of any kind of power, not to mention that they can
intentionally deprive their speech of politically oriented
superstructures, and of the instinct of prevailing over others'
speeches. This means that Baudelaire's and Deleuze's heritage has
become the water we can definitely choose to swim in.

    But there's a further step consisting in the neverending
production of series of signs with faint resemblance rather than
reference to any already known alphabetical series of signs. In Tim
Gaze's work this kind of resemblance shows brilliant evidences of how
the folded parts of our minds work, in making themselves unknown, and
still meaningful.

    It's like making shadows without starting from "things + sun," or
resisting to the action of the light over the objects.

    =97Marco Giovenale

From the Introduction

What are the pieces that writing is made of?

I hope these shapes & signs can speak to people around the world, no
matter what kind of writing they were taught as children.

Our ancient, pre-literate ancestors saw such complex patterns as their
own fingerprints, markings on plants & animals, geological formations,
ripples on flowing water, clouds, & conglomerations of flotsam &
jetsam deposited by wind & water. I would suggest that these are much
more powerful roots of writing than Sumerian cuneiform, which
mainstream Western history says is the beginning of true writing.

About Tim Gaze

I live in the Adelaide Hills of South Australia, between outer
suburbia & the beginnings of the countryside. Walking is important to
me. A lot of the time, I make, research, publish & share illegible
writing. The polar ice caps are melting. It's time to go beyond old
patterns of thought.


The primary investigation of Xerolage is how collage technique of 20th
century art, typography, computer graphics, visual & concrete poetry
movements & the art of the copier have been combined. Each issue is
devoted to the work of one artist.

Dear Reader,

You may have gotten a complimentary copy of the first set of Lost &
Found chapbooks, you may have bought one at City Lights or St Marks
Bookstore, purchased one at a Lost & Found event in New York, or read
about it in the Poetry Project Newsletter or the London Review blog.
The first series is already out of print: we hope to bring out a
second edition as demand increases but we need your support, and the
best way to support us is to subscribe to the second series.

Lost & Found: The CUNY Poetics Document Initiative is happy to
announce that our second series is now available at a pre-publication
discount. For $25, you will get the following set of beautifully
printed chapbooks:

Selections from El Corno Emplumado / The Plumed Horn1962-1964
(Margaret Randall, visiting editor)

Diane di Prima: The Mysteries of Vision: Some Notes on H.D. (Ana
Bozicevic, editor)

Diane di Prima: R.D.=92S H.D. (Ammiel Alcalay, editor)

Sean Reynolds, guest editors)

Muriel Rukeyser: Barcelona, 1936: Selections from the Spanish Civil
War Archive (Rowena Kennedy-Epstein, editor)

Those who have come to our events, like the tribute to Muriel Rukeyser
or the electrifying reading by Diane di Prima, know very well what
kind of energy Lost & Found has generated. Those getting to know the
scholarship of our graduate students realize that a new generation of
cultural critics and literary historians is in the making.

In order to continue our work, we need your support: please subscribe
to make sure you get the second series before it, too, goes out of
print. And consider making a donation so that we can move on to the
third series, which includes works by Lorine Niedecker, John Wieners,
Ed Dorn, Essex Hemphill, Langston Hughes and others. You can order the
books online at http://lostandfoundbooks.org/ or mail in an order form

"_Beowulf_ is a hoax": Jack Spicer's Medievalism and _Beowulf_ Translation

the innovations that poets and critics now attribute to Spicer=97his stunni=

The Carlton County Historical Society will present "Irish Voices on
the Minnesota Prairie" by S=E9amas Cain.  The presentation will begin at
1:00 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day, Thursday, March 17th, 2011 at the CCHS
Museum, 406 Cloquet Avenue, Cloquet, Minnesota, 55720.

This presentation was first given at the IMRAM Festival in Dublin,
Ireland last September.  Describing the script for "Irish Voices on
the Minnesota Prairie," Liam Carson, director of the IMRAM Festival,
said "poetic, beautiful, moving, simple, evocative.  The presentation
was a wonderful experience!"  And the Irish writer Gabriel Rosenstock
described the script as "very moving."

IRISH VOICES, PRAIRIE VOICES

"I remember herds of buffalo on the prairie, beautiful Indian ponies
... the coyotes howling at dusk."  So speaks one voice in S=E9amas
Cain=92s dramatic evocation of what he calls "Irish Voices, Prairie
Voices."

Drawing on his own conversations with grandparents and other
relatives, S=E9amas Cain=92s narrative probes deep into family, land and
language.  Through their plain but poetic voices, history is relived.
Here Irish settlers learn from Indians "where strawberries grew and
which birds were most delicious to hunt."  Here is Thomas Burke,
kinsman of Edmund, fleeing to the Irish Colonies of Minnesota in 1878.
 We are brought from the time of the wagon trains to the day
electricity arrived in the village of Murdock in 1922.  Along the way
we hear stories of the Molly Maguires, the communitarian Connemaras
and their vision of creating a Gaelic utopia on the prairies of
western Minnesota; of fiddlers and harmonica players at dances; of
droughts, crop failures, snowstorms, and swarms of locusts.

"Irish Voices, Prairie Voices" is an extraordinary journey into a
haunting past.  Actors will re-create in English the words and stories
of S=E9amas Cain=92s grandparents and their cousins and friends, whilst
Cain himself will narrate.  A unique insight into an almost forgotten
history, "Irish Voices on the Minnesota Prairie" is a deeply personal
odyssey.

John Roche's new book _Road Ghosts_ is NOW AVAILABLE from theenk Books:

"An unexpected treasure, ROAD GHOSTS is an on-the-ground poetic document of=
 radicalized students coming of age in the late 60s & early 70s. Its clarit=
y of external & internal detail is often startling. Its detached camera eye=
 lucidly documents the process of portent, pretense & Utopian fervor associ=
ated with that brief opening in U.S. dissident cultures & the generational =
clashes inspired by idealism, psychedelics, & quest fever. It's a profound =
personal essay on being & becoming"-David Meltzer.

My =93sonnet shakedown=94 workshop will run from March 15 to April 12 at
the Toronto New School of Writing.

Join us as we explore the kaleidoscopic history of the sonnet, from
Petrarchan to Oulipian, from blazon to flarf and beyond. We'll also
write our own sonnets - using, throwing out, and writing our own rules
of engagement with the "little song." The sonnet is dead. Long live
the sonnet!

Seating is limited, but there are still openings in the class - sign
up at the TNSOW website:

http://tnsow.com/sonnet-workshop/

Here's the description:

Sonnet Workshop (Mar 15 =96 Apr 12, 2011)
Instructor: Camille Martin

Duration: 5 weeks (Tuesdays), 15 March =96 12 April 2011, 6:30 =96 8:30pm

Capacity: 12 students

Combining a historical overview of the sonnet form (or as Anselm Hollo
once called it, the sonnet state of mind) with creative writing
assignments, this course offers students the opportunity to experience
the sonnet as a traditional and experimental network of possibilities.

Through a series of Reading/Writing sessions focused around various
=93sonnet-inspired models,=94 participants will deepen their appreciation
of the evolution of the sonnet across history as well as generate
their own sonnets, investigating relationships between the rubrics of
tradition and form and content and meaning, while continuing the
momentum of the =93little song=92s=94 enduring popularity.

Cheers!
Camille Martin

Some Wall Street types (and others) make over a billion dollars a year ? each
year. How much is a billion dollars? How can you visualize an amount of money
so high? Here is one way to think about it: The median household income in the
US is around $29,000, meaning half of us make less and half make more. If you
make $29,000 a year, and don?t spend a single penny of it, it will take you
34,482 years to save a billion dollars....

Some things you could buy if really wealthy:

1) the Maybach car the Landaulet model, costs $1 million. (Rush Limbaugh, who
has 5 homes in Palm Beach, drives a cheaper Maybach 57 S -- but makes up for it
by owning 6 of them.). Your $1 billion will buy you a thousand Maybach
Landaulets

2) Some hotels charge $20-30,000 per night. A billion dollars will buy you a
$20,000 room every night for 137 years

3) Some people spend as much as $200 million or more on a single yacht. You can
buy ten $100 million yachts with a billion dollars

4) There are approximately 15,000 private jets registered in the US according
to NBAA. You can pick one up for around $40 million, maybe $60 million for
top-of-the-line. Your billion will buy you 25 of these.

[etc]

So you say to yourself, "I want me some of that. I?d like to place the
following order, please.":

One Maybach Landaulet for $1 million to drive around in.
One $100 million yacht for when I want to get seasick.
One Gulfstream G550 private jet for $40 million.
One private island for $24.5 million (castle included) for when I want to
escape the masses.
One $8 million estate for when I have to go ashore and mingle with the masses
(but not too close.)
One $5 million watch so I can have one.
Total: $178.5 million.

My change after paying with a billion-dollar bill is a meager $821.5 million. I
can still stay in a $20,000 hotel room every night for 112 and 1/2 years.

As you see, $1 billion is more than enough to really live it up. Some people
today are amassing multiples of billions

And the concentration of income and wealth is increasing. The top 1% took in
23.5% of all of the country?s income in 2007. In 1979 they only took in 8.9%.

Between 1979 and 2008, the top 5% of American families saw their real incomes
increase 73%, according to Census data. Over the same period, the lowest-income
fifth (20% of us) saw a decrease in real income of 4.1%. The rest were just
stagnant or saw very little increase.
http://extremeinequality.org/?page_id=8

Wealth can be inherited and accumulates over the years.... The top 1% owns more
than 90% of us combined. In 2007, the latest year for which figures are
available from the Federal Reserve Board, the richest 1% of U.S. households
owned 33.8% of the nation?s private wealth. That?s more than the combined
wealth of the bottom 90 percent.

The combined net worth of the Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans in 2007 was $1.5
trillion. The combined net worth of the poorest 50% of American households
(about 150 million people) was $1.6 trillion

The top 1% also own 50.9% of all stocks, bonds, and mutual fund assets. The top
10% own 90.3%.

Income inequality is actually greater in the United States than it is in Egypt
- and this does affect politics.  It makes legislation which favours the
wealthy and increases inequality, but it also protects the wealthy form the
consequences of their profit.

The Koch brothers are said to have a net worth of $21.5 billion each. They
financed the Tea Party movement and, along with big corporations and other
billionaires, they financed the massive assault of TV ads in the midterm
elections that helped change the makeup of the Congress. And now Congress is
paying them back:

Nine of the 12 new Republicans on the panel signed a pledge distributed by a
Koch-founded advocacy group ? Americans for Prosperity ? to oppose the Obama
administration's proposal to regulate greenhouse gases. Of the six GOP freshman
lawmakers on the panel, five benefited from the group's separate advertising
and grassroots activity during the 2010 campaign.

Republicans on the committee have launched an agenda of the sort long backed by
the Koch brothers. A top early goal: restricting the reach of the Environmental
Protection Agency, which oversees the Kochs' core energy businesses.

That Pomegranate Shine

by   Lori Desrosiers

=20

Two brides arise from the river, shivering and shining like pomegranate =
seeds.

=96 Words from an Armenian Song

=20

I was the wrong kind of bride,

more sweat than glisten,

more peach than pomegranate.

At twenty-three, in love with marriage,

not the man,

I plunged into rough water,

bringing grandmother=92s candlesticks,

mother=92s books and two silver trays.

Ten years later, I emerged shivering,

dragging my ragged volumes,

one candlestick and two babies.

On the bank, I shook off the water

and breathed.

Standing with my children,

looking out over the river,

the new brides asked me where

I got that pomegranate shine.=

Sketch for interactive piece. Suggestions for improvement?

NATIONALISM

On the screen you see three flags. USA, Canada, Iraq.

Text over them:

"It is a serious offence
to clear thinking
to confuse patriotism
and flag waving."

When you click, the flags are cut into little squares and the pieces strewn
over the stage.

Text over them: "Please reassemble the flags of the USA, Canada, and Iraq."

When they click, the text disappears.

The viewer can drag and drop the squares to reassemble the squares into
flags. However, the sides of the squares are magnetic. They are attracted to
squares that are not of their own flag. And they are repulsed by squares of
the same flag.

What do the Golden Ratio, Tassajara=92s kitchen, and Noguchi=92s fascinatio=
n
with form have to do with natural cycles and the written word?  In Arrieta=
=92s
*triskelion, tiger moth, tangram, thyme*, language flows between forms and
fascinations sharing the elusive nature of sand, bear, and canyon and the
infinite enigmas posed by modern physics, the green dragon, and the infinit=
e
reversals of Chinese puzzles. Arrieta=92s poems are overlapping spheres,
vanishing points, circles that reflect her fascination with modern
cosmology, aesthetics, and the spirituality of language. =97 *Andrea Moorhe=
ad*



I have long followed Marcia Arrieta=92s poems, impressed by her minimalist
approach to language itself, her quiet southwest surrealism=97reminiscent a=
t
times of the visionary artistry of Georgia O'Keeffe.  Her poems are
compelling, marked by deft and abrupt turnings, a total mastery of
paratactic construction, and a dazzling sense of the landscape of the heart
played against that insistent inner voice.  Here, at last, they are gathere=
d
together, a gift well worth having, a quiet visionary voice which surprises
and invites the reader to be attentive.  =97 *David Cope*



Geometry defines symptoms of reality. Its elements hold in common a range o=
f
distances from other presences. In the perpetual imaginary search for
probable freshness, what angle offers the most valid view? Marcia Arrieta=
=92s
book enacts philosophical inquiry into tangible experience, by way of a
series of inductive expeditions. At the intersection of multiple wavelength=
s
are poetic choices of mosaic segments that the poet sculpts into a metonymi=
c
actuality that far transcends harmonics of the selves. =97 *Sheila E. Murph=
y*



Marcia Arrieta=92s long overdue first volume of poems charts the cycles of
language within consciousness by plotting the recurrence of concepts and
ideas and of certain words which, planet-like, wander among them. She has,
through a process of extreme selectivity, crafted these poems-in-motion,
poems on the outer reaches of philosophical thought. These poems are not fo=
r
the mentally inert, but one willing to =93staple the head to the sea=94 wil=
l
receive much delight and intellectual stimulation from them. =97 *Celestine
Frost*



The poems in this book are complex, "intellectually emotional" tangles of
observations. Rather than through commas, these short =97 frequently only o=
ne
noun long =97 observations are related to each other through periods, line
breaks, empty spaces. They die out instant to instant. But they're also
connected by Marcia Arrieta's acute attention, the
fingerpointingtothemoon-like unpredictability of her imagery. She is a
wonderful observer, for whom the naming process and the names, the things
and the silhouettes of their distances, "the literary symbol."* */period/
and "sea. clay. tree." belong to the same landscape, where "between the
absolute." /period/ "the door is partially open." =97 *M=E1rton Kopp=E1ny*

Dear Friends and Colleagues;

Discussion on what a place is extends in the West at least as far back =
as Aristotle, and continues to be a central concern of philosophy, =
archaeology, poetry, photography and myriad other fields.

After having lived in, or passed through, more places than I can readily =
recall, I decided it was time to look into the matter.
"Of Place Itself," the piece of Digital Literary Art I've been working =
on for the past ten months, is the result:=20

on Sommer Browning's EITHER WAY I'M CELEBRATING=20
(http://tinyurl.com/4ary56f)
=20
Sometimes I think Sommer Browning is a James Wright for the basic cable gen=
eration=2C at others the gorgeously deformed lovechild of H.D. and Groucho =
Marx. What I mean is I cannot categorize these poems=2C and that=92s the hi=
ghest compliment I can give any poetry.=20
=97Mathias Svalina=20

"All objections to progress=2C" writes Hans Blumenberg=2C "could come down =
to the fact that it hasn't yet taken us far enough." That's philosophy--and=
 it's funny--but no one would ever level the same complaint at pain or laug=
hter=2C this fine book's subjects and two phenomena that can take human bei=
ngs great distances almost immediately. Absolutely modern--but never resolu=
tely maudlin--Sommer Browning doesn't settle for making it new=3B rather=2C=
 she lets it bleed and gets us there on time.=20
=97Graham Foust=20

Well / I don't know / Sommer / Browning's new book / EITHER WAY I=92M CELEB=
RATING / so different from mine / made me laugh /so it's no sin / it made m=
e see this place anew / it moved me in my air-shield / Sommer / your heart =
was open as this cup.

on Noah Eli Gordon's The Source
(http://www.futurepoem.com/bookpages/thesource.html)
=20
"When the Source is formed and expressed in words=2C writing=2C it is true=
=2C has shaped it=2C but the spirit of the Source--the creative urge it rep=
resents=2C the feeling it expresses and evokes=2C and even in large part it=
s subject matter=2C comes from only two words: 'is' and 'are.' "
=20
We read these words on page 26 of The Source=2C Noah Eli Gordon's strange a=
nd haunting cento--a book assembled from thousands of instances of page 26=
=2C as found in the volumes of the Denver Public Library=2C their deploymen=
t of our alphabet with its twenty-six letters yielding an astonishing varie=
ty of source material that constitutes Noah Eli Gordon's adventure in numer=
ology.  Language is literally charged with meaning in exciting new ways.
=97Marjorie Perloff

Reduced choice is still choice=2C and we find what we look for. As Tzara sa=
id=2C describing a more strictly aleatory process of composition: "the poem=
 will resemble you." So Noah Eli Gordon has stitched hundreds of fragments =
into an intriguing=2C often funny synopticon of our culture and its/his nos=
talgia for transcendence. And though the book warns=2C "the Source is to be=
 taken in very small doses=2C" the total effect is exhilarating.
=97Rosmarie Waldrop

Noah Eli Gordon's The Source=2C stretches a permeable skin around ruptured =
repositories of human thought-structures while sustaining itself=2C and us=
=2C on a nutritive broth of glorious language plunder=2C bibliomancy=2C Kab=
balist numerology=2C and exquisitely attuned appropriations. Just as The So=
urce "understands a pattern and works against it" it also is a finely hewn =
compendium of appropriations culled systematically from page 26 of thousand=
s of the books in the open stacks of the Denver Public Library. What is con=
tained is what is content: socio-cultural shards of language=2C "like a Rom=
an shirt=2C stitched from the scraps of various sources=2C keeping us warm.=
" The Source embodies a text that is at once time binding--a product of its=
 own placement in current conceptual poetics=2C as well as an archive of it=
s own body through constrained ingestion of borrowed material. According to=
 the Source's own page 26 "...the spirit of the Source--the creative urge i=
t represents=85even in large part its subject matter=2C comes from only two=
 words 'is' and 'are.'" In other words=2C Noah Eli Gordon's The Source gift=
s us with a methodically repurposed text that keeps on giving.
=97Kim Rosenfield
=20
By applying a hypertextual model to paper-bound books in a library=2C Noah =
Eli Gordon turns the electronic equation on its ear=2C making us realize th=
at our engagement with every kind of media--analog and digital--has forever=
 been altered. By literally surfing though a library=2C Gordon has convinci=
ngly shown us that writing still has the potential to be personal=2C meanin=
gful and spiritual without our ever having written a word of it.

MODES OF LOVE & REASON: A BERNADETTE MAYER SYMPOSIUM
April 1st, 2011
University at Buffalo


Please join us in Buffalo this April 1st to celebrate the life and work
of the one and only Bernadette Mayer. Although arguably the most wildly
influential USAmerican poet of the past forty years, Bernadette Mayer's
work has seldom taken center stage in scholarship and literary histories
of the period. This long-overdue celebration of Mayer's life and work
will begin to redress this situation, and will consist in equal measures
of devoted fandom and rigorous study – of "love" and of "reason."
Approaching Mayer as a poet, teacher, Conceptual artist, and small-press
impresario, the symposium program brings together a diverse ensemble of
contemporary poets, scholars, archivists, and editors to investigate and
honor the many dimensions of Mayer's relentless and virtuosic practice.
The symposium will crescendo in the evening with a performance by Mayer
herself.

Critical panels will feature scholars Lee Ann Brown (St. John's
University), Stephen Cope (Bard College), Caitlin Newcomer (Florida
State University), Deborah Poe (Pace University), Sam Truitt (Station
Hill Press), and Joey Yearous-Algozin (UB).

A roundtable of contemporary poets discussing their own 'elective
affinities' with Mayer will feature CAConrad, Dorothea Lasky, and Brenda
Coultas.

Full details and symposium schedule:
http://english.buffalo.edu/mayersymposium

Day program: 9 a.m. - 4 p.m., the UB Poetry Collection (420 Capen Hall)
Evening reading: 8 p.m., the Karpeles Manuscript Museum (453 Porter Ave)

*the ulterior eden* presents us with a contemporary Song of Songs in which
allegory is subverted by eros into a more explicit  and boldly
unconventional passion.  Large with life and ecstatic with the =93names and
innumerable sensations=94 of adoration, this communion joins beloved and
beloved in the erotic chaos of a =93newest pronoun.=94 j/j hastain makes th=
is
pact of bounty both politically and spiritually charged, shaping poetry=92s
intimacies as a means through which we can =93mature all historical/grief/
into luminosity. =97*Elizabeth Robinson*





j/j hastain=92s poems thrust through language's own limits, opening it,
re-making it to carry ideas it could not otherwise accommodate, =93like a
neoteric intimacy all pluck-penitent=94, =93the dispositions we intone rath=
er
than recant.=94  Short-circuiting erasure, j/j=92s verbo-visual texts creat=
e a
space for embodied being which transcends binaries, oppositions, proffers
instead the gap into which we must leap.  hastain reimagines the possibles
in an ecstasy of sound/sounding and meditation, =93a thing overflowing with
curvature truths and tugs=85 an inter-ethereal design that renders its
subjects submerged=94 in a new real.  These erotic, potent, spiritual poems
cast us *in* *between*, *inside*, loose but never aloof, as we enter into a=
n
evolutionary *dialogos*.  A *discourse through* wilderness into a new *wild=
*
.  A birth, a dream, a text of being, hastain=92s poems and image-poems

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"

Just to announce a new book of poetry: Saccade Patterns by Deborah Meadows =
from Geoffrey Gatza=92s BlazeVOX [books] =20

Publisher Web site:  http://www.blazevox.org/index.php/Shop/Poetry/saccade-=
patterns-by-deborah-meadows-226/

Saccade Patterns explores vision, the erotic gaze, and social discernment. =
The book opens with a shuffled text that dismantles melodrama by inscribing=
 primate capacity for abstract thought.  There=92s even a list of possible =
names for a pet cricket that follows a mathematic iteration. The poems seem=
 to ask how an ekphrastic poem based on the story of Tristan und Isolde ill=
umines the oldest gaze of love and eros. =93Highways out to desert proving =
grounds=94 lead to technologically-enhanced vision, failures in our =93dyna=
stic speed-up.=94=20

   On Saccade Patterns

Some crazy inter-speciation all relative going on here.  Keep up the reflex=
es.  But
without rules, no axiomatic set =97 or:  something takes over the rules.  W=
ords thinking, re-rule, feel.  Need de-bunking?  Gladiatorial spoof, dirty =
rimshots =97 =93how squeeze structures=94.  =93Will/we fall out/of our shad=
ows?=94  The subject self-perfumes, not too allegorized.  Engines lighten t=
ouch on proximate jitters strapped to the galaxy.  Your bestiary or mine.  =
Pleasure gives outlandish learning:  resist containment.  We=92re leaning i=
n toward its surface, likely haptic, =93shot sub-surface=94 multiplication =
just gets us going.  =93how/underneath=94 =97 let=92s facilitate: =93try to=
 dance=94.

=97 Bruce Andrews

Some things which come to mind are, and of course not all in a derivative w=
ay but rather in the way of communion (the way a string from one's sweater =
will end up in a wren's nest), are Leslie Scalapino's Way and Christopher S=
mart's cataloging poems.  What is so very strong in Meadows' work is its pr=
ecision in thought and its power of accrual.  I see these texts as sincere =
evidence of a parsing intelligence; taking cross-sections of the world at v=
arying widths and preparing them (by whatever means required) for explorati=
on.  This is infinitesimal vision; vision which casts the bonds of the worl=
d in bright relief. =20

   =97Lance Phillips

This book by Deborah Meadows is surprising in its audacity.  Few texts can =
assemble and recompose themselves like these, through a process:  the gaze =
(Cubist) takes in the fragment, the splinter, and then their whole.  Thus e=
ach detail is foreseen, chosen in advance for an aesthetic solution, like a=
 puzzle setting in the substance of its lines:  porous, material, bright, l=
iquid.  You feel the vision, her way of seeing, and you learn to see that w=
hich is different through her angle of subjectivity.  A window opening to a=
 landscape of the mind, of time.  An original space gained, trimmed out in =
shapes of paper, light.   A strange geography that motivates me to revisit =
its point of view, located not in the subject but in the thing it refracts =
toward the other =96 a viewer proposing that this refracted thing may be an=
 instant won out of loss, out of the ordinary.  Meadows paints and sculpts =
with words, provoking the eye to turn toward memories, and toward impossibi=
lity.

I just added to my site the 8 recent axial drawings called "dakini
drawings": these are related to the principle that governs the
composition in axial poetics, e.g., "preverbs" as in my recent book
"Verbal Paradise" from Zasterle Press.

One should scroll down to the 8 thumbnails to enlarge each--this group
unaccountably created its own subtype:

**No Press
http://derekbeaulieu.wordpress.com/

No Press was founded by Derek Beaulieu in 2005. After the cessation of =20=

publishing his housepress imprint (1997-2004) Beaulieu returned to =20
publishing as "no press" as means of publishing and circulating =20
experimental, conceptual and concrete poetries. Dedicated to small =20
press forms - leaflets, broadsides, chapbooks, pamphlets and other =20
ephemeral forms - no press has released almost 200 publications in 6 =20
years (averaging 1 every 2 weeks) in editions of between 5 and 100. =20
Items are often out of print the same as publication, and represent a =20=

truly ephemeral means of distributing these marginalized forms.


**Kevin McPherson Eckhoff
http://kevinmcphersoneckhoff.wordpress.com/

Kevin McPherson Eckhoff likes visual poetry and even wrote =20
Rhapsodomancy (Coach House). In theory, he is not afraid of snakes. =20
His writing has vacationed in Open Letter, Fact*Simile, West Wind =20
Review, and Issue One. Don=92t try to feed him steak! He sleeps in =20
Armstrong, B.C., with his dog-rescuing partner, Laurel, and =93teaches=94 =
=20
at Okanagan College with his very bff, Jake Kennedy (The Lateral, =20
Snare Books). Together, Jake and Kevin are compiling a community-=20
written novel called Death Valley.


**Robert Fitterman
http://cwp.fas.nyu.edu/object/cwp.faculty.robertfitterman

Robert Fitterman is the author of 12 books of poetry. He grew up in a =20=

small suburb of St. Louis called Creve Coeur. His street is still =20
flanked by a Shell gas station on one side and a Mobile station on the =20=

other. His writing is kinda conceptual and sorta involves identity =20
issues that are complicated by the web. And the Mall. Recent titles =20
include: Now We Are Friends (Truck Books), Rob the Plagiarist (Roof =20
Books), and Notes On Conceptualisms, co-authored with Vanessa Place =20
(Ugly Duckling Presse). He teaches writing and poetry at New York =20
University and at the Bard College, Milton Avery School of Graduate =20
Studies.


**Charles Gute

INTERVIEW

   _The Art of Fiction No. 209
   _Ann Beattie
   "The interplay between character and external world is something that
   realist writers always dealt with conscientiously, and it started to dr=
op
   out with minimalism. Hemingway dropped it out, too, but even in his sto=
ries
   there tends to be a volley going on between the environment and the cha=
r-
   acter. Carver won=E2=80=99t say what the volley is. None of us will."

INTERVIEW

   _The Art of Nonfiction No. 4
   _Janet Malcolm
   "I think that one never completely moves beyond the pull of the persona=
l in
   any human encounter. But I think that when journalists remember that th=
e
   interview is a special sort of encounter, and withhold some of their na=
tural
   friendliness, they don=E2=80=99t lose anything by it. The subject doesn=
=E2=80=99t notice. He
   wants to tell his story. And when the journalist retells the story in a=
 way
   the subject cannot anticipate, he doesn=E2=80=99t feel like such a rat.=

Subject:      Disembodied I at Clark Coolidge's St. Marks Reading Before the
              Earthquake and Tsunami
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Disembodied I traveled with his son Yoichi all the way from Japan to
shake George Quasha's hand, eat Yugoslavian food (excellent) with
George and artist helper (nice lady!)and then foot it over to St.
Mark's to meet Clark Coolidge (nice guy!) and see him read.
Disembodied I drew CC's picture while he read, he was so impressed by
CC's stature & reading skill & of course words.

Disembodied I saw someone else read too (named slips him), and found the
reading 1)energetic and 2) vastly appreciated by the poet's friends.

Disembodied then met Bruce Andrews and had lots of cud to chew.

The tribal energy at St. Marks impressed Disembodied I and reminded him
of Mad Max movies--all that scrambling, sitting on
floors--posing--climbing--it was a SCENE.  It also reminded Disembodied
of the Monday night readings at the Baltimore Theater Project way back
in the 1970's, when Lucille Clifton would arrive late with friends and
everyone would stop & say say: "Hi Lucille!" and Lucille would say:
"Hi Everybody!" and even give out some hugs to special friends who
stood up from sitting on cushions on the floor.

Disembodied I had a great time seeing everyone mostly young and sharing
energy and co-existing, and believing that poetry really really matters,
and that being in love matters (the first reader had a great Chinese
(-American?) friend and we could tell from across the room that they
were most probably IN LOVE and avant-garde too.  (That's a heady combo!
 Disembodied I experienced that same dizzying mixture years ago!)

It was all so great.  Disembodied knew that there were folks who would
have recognized his name if he had said it, but he didn't say it
because he was jet-lagged, modest,  and ready to pass out.  He greatly
appreciated the company of George Quasha and his friend.

Shortly thereafter Disembodied saw the horror of the tsunami on CNN and
needed to hurry back to Japan asap with his son in tow.

All's well, though.

Love to all;

Disembodied I, recollecting the past and trying to capture a slice of it
for Eternity.

Subject:      the Alphabet: A Symposium on Ron Silliman's Long Poem,
              25-26 March 2011
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

Ron Silliman's reputation, as critic, theorist, exponent of poetry's
production as a socially relevant and collective act, arguably has
preceded and to a degree guided how his poetry is to be received. But if a
reader responds to the poetry, then how and what does she or he see and
hear? "I'm writing to you," the text says in the section called "Lit."
What is reading The Alphabet "like," for you?

Subject:      "For Japan"--A Suggestion from Disembodied I--St. Marks and
              Beyond Baroque?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This is an idea that I've only shared with one friend, but I'd like to
put it out on the List for your consideration:

I would like to suggest setting up readings to help fund recovery efforts
in Sendai and points north.  The earthquake, the tsunami, the radiation
problem--the really terrible thing is that those that are most
devastated are the most exposed--

The money could be donated to the Red Cross of Japan.

Two venues that immediately suggest themselves: St. Marks and Beyond
Baroque, but others.

Also the idea of an anthology--a book that could be sold and the proceeds
donated--

I'm in no position to publish anything--though I wish I could--but
certainly feel that the effort would be a worthy one.  CNN has moved on
to cover yet another tragedy while Japan's continues to grow.

Sendai, and Hanamaki, and points north is poetry territory--lots of
poets, fine poets, are from there.  I don't know how many have died.

Just an idea from Disembodied I

Back Channel or front channel responses welcome.

Barbara Hammer is a visual artist working primarily in film and video and
has made over 80 works in a career that spans 30 years. She is considered a
pioneer of queer cinema. Her documentaries tell the stories of marginalized
peoples who have been hidden from history and are often essay films that are
multi-leveled and engage audiences viscerally and intellectually with the
goal of activating them to make social change. Her memoir, HAMMER! Making
Movies out of Sex and Life was recently published by the Feminist Press at
CUNY and coincided with a retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art in New
York City, the Reina Sophia in Madrid, and the Tate Modern in London. She
teaches each summer at The European Graduate School in Saas-Fee,
Switzerland. She lives and works in New York City.







Maggie Nelson is a poet, memoirist, critic, and scholar. She is the author
of four books of nonfiction, The Art of Cruelty: A Reckoning (Norton, 2011),
Bluets (Wave Books, 2009), Women, the New York School, and Other True
Abstractions (University of Iowa Press, 2007), and The Red Parts: A Memoir
(Free Press, 2007; named a Notable Book of the Year by the State of
Michigan), and four books of poetry, Something Bright, Then Holes (Soft
Skull Press, 2007), Jane: A Murder (Soft Skull, 2005; finalist, the PEN/
Martha Albrand Award for the Art of the Memoir), The Latest Winter (Hanging
Loose Press, 2003) and Shiner (2001). She is the recipient of a 2008 Arts
Writers grant from Creative Capital, a 2010 Guggenheim Fellowship in
Nonfiction, and a 2011 NEA grant in poetry. Since 2005, she has taught on
the faculty of the School of Critical Studies at CalArts. She lives in Los
Angeles.







Janlori Goldman is a poet, civil rights activist, and teacher at Columbia
University's School of Public Health. She also works with Columbia's Program
in Narrative Medicine. After nearly 20 years in Washington D.C. pressing for
laws to protect peoples' privacy, she moved to New Work City to teach and
study poetry at Sarah Lawrence College. Her poems have been published in a
number of journals, including Mudlark, Connotation Press, The Cortland
Review, The Mom Egg, and, forthcoming, in Calyx. Other essays and articles
have appeared in health journals, U.S. Congressional testimony, and books.

Subject: Bernadette Mayer Symposium in Buffalo

MODES OF LOVE & REASON: A BERNADETTE MAYER SYMPOSIUM
April 1st, 2011
University at Buffalo


Please join us in Buffalo this April 1st to celebrate the life and work
of the one and only Bernadette Mayer. Although arguably the most wildly
influential USAmerican poet of the past forty years, Bernadette Mayer's
work has seldom taken center stage in scholarship and literary histories
of the period. This long-overdue celebration of Mayer's life and work
will begin to redress this situation, and will consist in equal measures
of devoted fandom and rigorous study =96 of "love" and of "reason."
Approaching Mayer as a poet, teacher, Conceptual artist, and small-press
impresario, the symposium program brings together a diverse ensemble of
contemporary poets, scholars, archivists, and editors to investigate and
honor the many dimensions of Mayer's relentless and virtuosic practice.
The symposium will crescendo in the evening with a performance by Mayer
herself.

Critical panels will feature scholars Lee Ann Brown (St. John's
University), Stephen Cope (Bard College), Caitlin Newcomer (Florida
State University), Deborah Poe (Pace University), Sam Truitt (Station
Hill Press), and Joey Yearous-Algozin (UB).

A roundtable of contemporary poets discussing their own 'elective
affinities' with Mayer will feature CAConrad, Dorothea Lasky, and Brenda
Coultas.

Full details and symposium schedule:
http://english.buffalo.edu/mayersymposium

Day program: 9 a.m. - 4 p.m., the UB Poetry Collection (420 Capen Hall)
Evening reading: 8 p.m., the Karpeles Manuscript Museum (453 Porter Ave)

Fred Moten is the latest to appear on JUPITER 88:
http://JUPITER88poetry.blogspot.com



This one is a favorite of mine BECAUSE the sound and video would not
(no matter what I did) synch, so I in particular look like a
poorly-dubbed foreign film.  Fred is looking down to read so you don't
always see his lips.  The time delay adds to the disconnected reality
of floating on Jupiter.

Subject:      Modernist Studies panel proposal
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Friends --

I'm looking for a third panelist for a panel to propose for the Modernist
Studies Association, convening in Buffalo Oct. 6-9.

The general idea of the panel is to present critical reflections on figures
(preferably less studied figures) who reflected upon the state of things
contemporaneously -- who wrote about the emergent Modernism in poetry as it
was emerging.  We have one paper on William S. Braithwaite and *The Poetic
Year 1916*, and a second paper on Alfred Kreymborg's representations, in *
Others* and others, of the then newer poetries.

I'm looking for a third paper along those same lines.

I'll also need someone to chair the panel.

Back channel with ideas, please.

Thanks!

A Charm For Survivors


May Love precede us in the wondering town
With a long stick, may it knock at every door,
& coax the pigeons & the people down.

From their sealed towers, may they step
Once again upon the blasted earth
& dance where the lizard & the serpent slept.

If you had problems accessing the link for the Mayer symposium before,
it should work now. I fixed one line of stray code that was causing trouble.

http://english.buffalo.edu/mayersymposium/

Also, my original e-mail failed to emphasize that Liz Kotz (UC
Riverside) will be delivering the keynote at the symposium. Kotz is the
author of WORDS TO BE LOOKED AT (MIT Press, 2007) and co-edited THE NEW
FUCK YOU with Eileen Myles (Semiotext(e), 1994).

All around, this should be a tremendous event!

No class June 1

June 8 Final potluck and Student Intertexts on Influency 9 authors and book=
s
(important! please attend!)

Classes are facilitated by Margaret Christakos.

For readers and writers alike. A powerful way to reconnect with poetry, to
build bridges into the contemporary poetry scene, and to deepen critical
engagement with poetry. Many writers and literature buffs attend this
course; the class is equally welcoming to people with a beginner=92s level =
of
experience with reading poetry. Adults from 18-1000 years welcome.
Approximately half the registrants in any given session have taken previous
sessions of the class; and each session we welcome newcomers. The course ma=
y
count towards a certificate in creative writing, or be taken for pleasure.
Registrants compose readerly critical responses to books weekly, and write =
a
final =93Intertext=94 reflecting on two or more of the books studied, for
presentation. Registrants also take turns in small groups introducing guest=
s
and bringing along snacks and non-alcoholic beverages to produce a congenia=
l
social environment for each evening.

Influency: A Toronto Poetry Salon has run twice annually from Fall 2006. In
each session, 8 accomplished poets working in distinctive styles will appea=
r
as both guest readers and peer critics in this unique lecture-reading serie=
s
hosted by Margaret Christakos. Each poet=92s critique of a colleague=92s wo=
rk
will be followed with a reading by the poet under discussion. A group
discussion led by Christakos will follow. Students will accumulate critical
vocabulary to discuss more fluently the divergences of approach, motive,
process and product typical of Toronto=92s multitraditional literary cultur=
e.
The 8-book package under discussion will be available in class for $130.
Register a week prior to course beginning if possible to facilitate smooth
running of a complex course! Note this spring=92s session is 9 in-class
meetings, with an extended evening on May 25 at an off-campus location.

The course has also spawned a fledgling online magazine
calledwww.influencysalon.ca;
please visit to see some of the essays and responses presented at some of
our earlier classes.

Course $249 plus $130 book fee (8 poetry books). Fee is paid at first class
by personal cheque or cash.

If you had problems accessing the link for the Mayer symposium before,
it should work now. I fixed one line of stray code that was causing trouble=
.

http://english.buffalo.edu/mayersymposium/

Also, my original e-mail failed to emphasize that Liz Kotz (UC
Riverside) will be delivering the keynote at the symposium. Kotz is the
author of WORDS TO BE LOOKED AT (MIT Press, 2007) and co-edited THE NEW
FUCK YOU with Eileen Myles (Semiotext(e), 1994).

All around, this should be a tremendous event!

Poets have a long history of being persecuted, if not imprisoned and =
executed, for what they wrote.=20
There are presently poets in prisons around the world because they wrote =

Reading this, it seems to me that American poets have a problem valuing =

Hmm I teach at a school of art + design and many of the students in my
current Contemporary Poetry class are Apparel majors.  I'm encouraging a fe=
w
students to do a paper on this.  If they do, I'm sure they will think about
it better than I can, but poetry's long exclusion of women;
poetry + public space / fashion + public space; 20th century women poets'
self-presentation in men's apparel / names; the late 20th articulation of
the gurlesque; and dismissive attitudes to the pairing of fashion + poetry
are some of my first thoughts.  Not to mention Kate Durbin.  Hey who was it
compared meter and form to a pair of pants tight enough for everyone to wan=
t
to sleep with you?  But poetry and sex don't mix, right!  Whatever about
poetry and fashion.  And women poets in public places modeling?  What's
happening?  Poetry is a lot more serious than that.  And what would women
know about persecution?  Floozies.

What does what one wears have to do with how good a poet they are?
 Does a student of yours write better poems on a day she or he is =
fashionably dressed?
What does a woman (or man) poet modeling clothes have to do with the =
quality of their writing, or their writing at all?
Perhaps young people who want to be poets should get jobs in the Garment =
District to learn their craft?
If you don't take poetry seriously (I'm assuming you're being sarcastic =
here) why bother?
As for women being persecuted. Yes, of course they are, in many =
countries, including this one, in states in which Republicans are in =
power.
Do we fight this with our clothes, or with our words?

Dear Joel,
It's difficult to know where to start.
Of course I don't take poetry seriously!  I have more respect for it than
that.  Look how accommodating it is!  Even on a dedicated poetics list, we
have such different understandings. Some, like you perhaps, consider poetry
matter of writing.  Others, like me perhaps, consider poetry informed but
not defined by medium or technology.  It's huger than that.  So I have no
problem seeing poetry in fashion or soccer, in a gesture or a breath.  And
of course I absolutely understand apparel designers as artists.
Furthermore, apparel design in itself is an art form but also poetry,
promiscuous as it is, may crowd in as a companion art.  One of the best
students I ever had was a consummate designer, musician, and sound poet.
Your poetry sounds exacting.  The kind where seriousness is proven by priso=
n
sentences.  My poetry is the biggest joke in the world, even bigger than
that.
And of course I expect poets to be dandies.  And even when they're not, I
expect them to be manic about grey or lint.  I expect poets to care deeply
about pencils, brands of notebooks, I expect them to cherish fetishes.  Of
course *I* do.
I would be happy to spend the entire day contemplating a color.  I hope tha=
t
means I'm not serious.  I hardly ever am luxurious like that.
I get a kick out of Frank and his tight pants.  And if Oscar goes to jail I
bet he misses his duds.  I know words are blazingly potent and can land a
poet in a heap of trouble.  That doesn't mean you can't enjoy a red dress!
Clothes can be armor.  Clothes can be talismen (if that's a word).  The
prohibition of women's voices in poetry or the agora or on stage has been s=
o
pervasive in all cultures for so long that the pairing *woman poet* heaves
with uneasiness.  Now here they are in the market-place identifying as poet=
s
and modeling clothes too.
Is* dressing up* just too much?  The woman poet should wear a man's suit?
Let's have the men poets in dresses!  That would be fun + not at all seriou=
s
(just like women poets in dresses I guess).  Or is the problem that they're
in the market-place, but not for sale?  What are the specific uneasinesses
here?  I don't doubt there are uneasinesses.
*What does what one wears have to do with how good a poet they are?*
A lot!  What does the apartment one rents have to do with writing *The
Bridge*?  Or the green carnation one wears to do with publication?  Or the
dark cloak and tricorn hat to do with
"Poetry."
*Does a student of yours write better poems on a day she or he is
fashionably dressed?*
Possibly.  Thought the best poems are written in bed.
*What does a woman (or man) poet modeling clothes have to do with the
quality of their writing, or their writing at all?*
What does anything have to do with anything?  That's the business of
metaphor.
*Perhaps young people who want to be poets should get jobs in the Garment
District to learn their craft?*
I will consult Maria Damon + Jen Bervin on this.
*If you don't take poetry seriously (I'm assuming you're being sarcastic
here) why bother?*
I am never sarcastic + seldom argumentative.  Hence the hard time I'm havin=
g
here.  How could I (a pea) take poetry (a banquet) seriously?  It doesn't
make sense.
*As for women being persecuted. Yes, of course they are, in many countries,
including this one, in states in which Republicans are in power.*
That's quite a reduction.
*Do we fight this with our clothes, or with our words?*
If we are to fight, I think body armor is the way to go.
Or we (women) could do the old trick of terrifying warriors by stripping
off.  Hold on there are websites for that ....
I hope someone else weighs in on Joel's and David Orr's critiques of the *
Oprah* poets.  I know delicious critiques are forming on *Delirious Hem* an=
d
elsewhere, i.e., Kate Durbin and Becca Klaver's call  for *Seam Ripper:
Women on Textual and Sartorial Style*, and Sandra Simonds' activist *
Sweatshop* project.

Ed Roberson was born and raised in Pittsburgh, where he studied painting =
in
his youth and was educated at the University of Pittsburgh. His =
extensive
travels inform his work,which is also influenced by spirituals and the
blues, and by visual art, such as the mixed-media collages of Romare
Beardon. Poet and critic Michael Palmer
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=3D5205>  has =
called
Roberson "one of the most deeply innovative and critically acute voices =
of
our time."

=20

Roberson is the author of numerous books of poetry, including City =
Eclogue
(2006), Atmosphere Conditions (1999), which was chosen by Nathaniel =
Mackey
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=3D82229>  for the
National Poetry Series and was a finalist for the Academy of American =
Poets'
Lenore Marshall Award, and Voices Cast Out to Talk Us In (1995), which =
won
the Iowa Poetry Prize. Words and phrases in Roberson's experimental =
poetry
actively resist parsing, using instead what Mackey has called
"double-jointed syntax" to explore and bend themes of race, history, and
culture. "I'm not creating a new language. I'm just trying to =
un-White-Out
the one we've got," said Roberson in a 2006 interview with Chicago
Postmodern Poetry.=20



Roberson's honors include the Lila Wallace Writers' Award and the Poetry
Society of America's Shelley Award. His work has been included in Best
American Poetry.=20



Roberson lives in Chicago, where he has taught at the University of =
Chicago,
Columbia College and Northwestern University.

Hi,

Is anybody running a reading series in the D.C. area? or have any contacts
with folks who are?

In May I'll be reading in Boston with Bill Corbett and then at the Poetry
Project in nyc and will be continuing down to D.C. to check out the Philip
Guston exhibit ROMA up at the Phillips Collection.

Guston is a central part of my first book recently published by Post Apollo:
http://www.postapollopress.com/GUSTONBOOK.html

I'd love to do a reading in the D.C. area while I'm there but haven't been
able to make contact with anybody down there. Any assistance is appreciated.
Please backchannel.

Cheers!

Patrick

TENDENCIES: Poetics & Practice


 4/4/11:

Jack Halberstam, Rob Halpern, and Brenda Iijima


 This series of talks, titled in honor of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, invites
artists from a variety of disciplines to explore the relationship between
writing & artmaking practice, the manifesto, queer theory, and pedagogy.



The next event features talks by:



Jack Halberstam

Rob Halpern

Brenda Iijima



...followed by a discussion/Q&A session.



on Monday, April 4

JUDITH "JACK" HALBERSTAM is Professor of English and Gender Studies at USC.
Halberstam works in the areas of popular, visual and queer culture with an
emphasis on subcultures. Halberstam's first book was Skin Shows: Gothic
Horror and the Technology of Monsters (1995), a study of popular gothic
cultures of the 19th and 20th centuries. Her 1998 book, Female Masculinity
(1998), made a ground breaking argument about non-male masculinity and
tracked the impact of female masculinity upon hegemonic genders.
Halberstam's last book, In a Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies,
Subcultural Lives (2005), described and theorized queer reconfigurations of
time and space in relation to subcultural scenes and the emergence of
transgender visibility. Halberstam has a new book due out from Duke UP in
the fall titled THE QUEER ART OF FAILURE.



ROB HALPERN has written several books of poetry, including Rumored Place
(Krupskaya 2004), and Disaster Suites (Palm Press 2009). Music for Porn is
forthcoming (Nightboat Books, 2011). With Taylor Brady, he also co-authored
Snow Sensitive Skin (Atticus/Finch 2007), which will soon be reissued by
Displaced Press in an expanded edition. Currently, he's co-editing the poems
of the late Frances Jaffer, together with Kathleen Fraser, and translating
the early essays of Georges Perec, the second of which, "Commitment or the
Crisis of Language," recently appeared in the Review of Contemporary Fiction
with an essay of his own on Perec. An active participant in the Nonsite
Collective, Rob lives in San Francisco and Ypsilanti, Michigan.



BRENDA IIJIMA is the author of Around Sea (O Books), Animate, Inanimate Aims
(Litmus Press), revv. you'll-ution (Displaced Press) and If Not Metamorphic
(Ahsahta Press) as well as numerous chapbooks and artist's books. She is

 "We will turn to the idea of the messianic in Chapter Ten of this book, =
but for the moment it suffices to stress that both Benjamin and Agamben =
employ the term in singular fashion. For them, a messianic idea of =
history is not one in which we wait for the Messiah to come, end =
history, and redeem humanity, but instead is a paradigm for historical =
time in which we act as though the Messiah is already here, or even has =
already come and gone. What is so difficult about Agamben's use of the =
term messianic is how radically it is to be distinguished from the =
apocalyptic. Agamben says that to understand "messianic time" as it is =
presented in Paul's letters "one must first distinguish messianic time =
from apocalyptic time, the time of the now from a time directed towards =
the future" (LAM, 51). To this he adds, "If l had to try to reduce the =
distinction to a formula, I would say that the messianic is not, as it =
is always understood, the end of time, but the time of the end" (LAM, =
51). The model of time corresponding to this idea is one that no longer =
looks for its decisive moment in a more or less remote future, but =
instead finds it in every minute of every day, in this world and in this =
life; and it is through such expressions as "dialectics at a standstill" =
and "means without end" that the two thinkers aim to return our gaze =
from the distant future to the pressing present."

Set in the context of this split between "the end of time" and "the time =
of the end" is Michael Rothenberg's recent invitation for the global =
writing public to participate in "a demonstration/celebration of poetry =
to promote serious social and political change" titled 100 THOUSAND =
POETS FOR CHANGE on 24 September, 2011. As protests for political =
reforms sweep across North Africa, the Middle East, in some parts of =
Europe, in the United States, with the recent disasters in The Gulf of =
Mexico and in Japan, one cannot help thinking about the "Rothenberg =
Project" as a highly significant creative response to change as =
something more than an adjustment to the way social relations are =
constructed.=20

Obododimma Oha and Anny Ballardini, in collaboration with Michael =
Rothenberg's event, will edit and feature outstanding poetic =
compositions for the 100 THOUSAND POETS FOR CHANGE on Fieralingue's  =
Poets' Corner.  Visual artwork, poems, poetic fiction, poetic =
nonfiction, and photographs to be submitted for consideration should go =
beyond the simple and gratuitous statement that 'a change is needed.' =
Our present, our Messianic time requires a STILLSTELLUNG (Benjamin's =
word) translated by Dennis Redmond in On the Concept of History (1940) =
with "an objective interruption of a mechanical process" into which we =
have been engulfed. Dennis Redmond continues in his explanation of =
STILLSTELLUNG: "rather like the dramatic pause at the end of an =
action-adventure movie, when the audience is waiting to find out if the =
time-bomb/missile/terrorist device was defused or not." We feel that we =
are living in a similar situation, and we are in need of a Stillstellung =
followed by ideas to offer our politicians, to make students/friends/our =
communities more aware of how we can change, revise history, start over =
again. =20

Visual works and photographs for submission are to be saved in JPEG =
format, while texts, which should not have rigid formatting, are to be =
in Word. All submissions should be emailed to the editors =
anny.ballardini@gmail.com and obodooha@gmail.com by September 1, 2011 =
with "100 THOUSAND POETS FOR CHANGE" in the Subject line.
