How does one get a copy of your paper "Provisional Institutions:  Alternative
Presses and Poetic Innovation" mentioned in an   August note of yours to the
UB Poetics list?
Haven't forgotten your suggestion to throw a net entry onto the list, as
things settle down here will try to do so thoughtfully.

Subject:      Anthologies priesthoods and bookstores (still!)

     I've been off-line for the last six
weeks or more, so I'm probably flogging a
dead horse. But I've always been a bit
surprised that ANY bookstore would sell to
such a specialised taste (passion?) as
poetry, especially given the brouhaha with
which our institutions (of whatever
persuasion, and to one of which I belong)
surround it. As Charles Watts told everyone,
the only decent (poetry) bookstore in this
part of the world, Proprioception Books, has
closed its doors (but is still there on-line.
The university bookstores in this town are
pitiable if not offensive in their
determination to _sell_ books (which means
that for them the whole point of running a
book shop is to move the inventory, at a
profit, not keep a book _store_, book
resource, for readers to browse in; the
textbook and the T-shirt is all they care
about); and the trade bookshops know that
poetry is not their bread and butter, so as a
rule their offerings (except for more or less
conventional Standards [Shakespeare, the Todd
Emily Dickinson, Rod McKuen], and the
occasional local book stocked on
compassionate grounds) are dull, more or less
Hallmark Cards.
     But (unlike Don Byrd) about 60% of what
I spend on books goes on poetry, about 10% on
journals and magazines -- this is because the
University of British Columbia Library tends
to buy the work of dead rather than living
poets (which makes life very hard for
students; it also makes anthologies,
including those so much abused on this e-mail
the last month or three, very useful and
indeed valuable resources indeed; ANY kind of
water is welcome in a desert). I spend less
than 10% (more like 3%) on criticism and
literary theory (I have a hard time indeed
reading either, but the library buys lots
[mainstream]). Some of the poetry I buy is
from local used-book stores (very good ones),
or when I travel; most is mail order. My
favourite of these is Am Here Books, P.O.Box
574, Philo, California 95466, which only
sells poetry -- the last catalogue as I
recall was about 2500 titles by poets last-
name-initial-E; three pages of Theodore
Enslin, about the same of Larry Eigner.
They're weak on little press stuff that's
still in print (go to SBD) but really good on
hard to find stuff. Unlike most bookshops,
they seem to care more for the living than
for the dead. With the American dollar
costing about $1.40 Canadian, they are
expensive to anyone north of the 49th; in
yankee dollar terms their prices are very
good, occasionally astonishingly cheap. They
also run catalogues of Little Magazines, one
letter of the alphabet at a time. The best
British (exclusively poetry) booksellers are
Alan Halsey, 22 Broad Street, Hay-on-Wye,
Hay-on-Wye, Nr. Hereford; and Peter Riley, 27
Sturton Street, Cambridge CB1 2QG.
     As for the whole question of
priesthoods, anthologies, bookshops, and
markets, I'd only add that I have been told
(and I believe it to be true) that Rupert
Murdoch, Australian much loved by Margaret
Thatcher, owner of and despot over those
extremes of the British Press, the (now more-
or-less downmarket) _London Times_ and the
_Sun_, has (as proprietor of Paladin Books, a
branch of Harper-Collins) ordered that all
poetry books published by Paladin be
destroyed by which he means burned
(and therefore NOT sold off or
remaindered) immediately -- these books
include _The New British Poetry_ edited by
Gillian Allnut, Fred D'Aguiar, Ken Edwards,
and Eric Mottram; and the three volumes so
far published of the _Paladin Re/Active
Anthologies_ (edited by Iain Sinclair):
Volume 1 is _Future Exiles: 3 London Poets_
(Allen Fisher, Bill Griffiths, Brian
Catling); Volume 3 is _The Tempers of Hazard_
(Thomas A. Clark, Barry MacSweeney, Chris
Torrance) -- I don't know what the second
volume is. Really generous selections: 150
pages of Fisher, for instance; 130 of Clark.
There's no doubt in my mind that these books
could have been enormously influential in
shaping possible British poetries, with a
real chance of breaking through the
moribundity of the _Times Literary
Supplement_ and the Schools Examination
Boards, Antony Thwaite and James Fenton and
their dreadful ilk, but it is clear that the
market for girlie pictures in the newspapers
is more lucrative, along with gay bashing,
paki bashing, and similar cherished English
customs.
     It's all very depressing (whether what I
hear about Murdoch is true or not --can
anyone out there confirm or refute?); I draw
comfort of a sort from the reflection that
the letters of William Cowper in the closing
years of the eighteenth century (which I've
just been reading) reflect a poetry scene in
most particulars scarcely distinguishable
from that within which we live, though
on a somewhat smaller scale. The sheer
enthusiasm of my students for the work of the
living, no matter where found, especially for
the turbulent and disrespectful (no matter
what specie and species), suggests that (like
love) it don't matter too much [if at all]
who you read, but how. Mischief and passion
never made money, but they do find and found
their own life.
     End of sermon.

I thought the latest from the Toronto Globe and Mail might be of
interest out there:

        "Last year, poets were officially declared 'miserable' by
        Kentucky University psychiatrist Arnold Ludwig, who studied
        1,000 eminent people, including poets W.H. Auden, Rupert
        Brooke and Sylvia Plath. Poets are five times more likely to
        be depressed than scientists, he found, and 15 times more
        prone to the condition than soldiers."

(Could it be from watching what the scientists and soldiers are up to?)

And then, to cheer you up:

        "Seiko, the Japanese watch company, has repaired England's
        most famous church clock, on The Old Vicarage of Grantchester.
        In 1912, Rupert Brooke immortalized the motionless dial with:
        'Stands the church clock at ten to three? / And is there honey
        still for tea?' Two years after the First World War, the clock
        started working again, reports The Observer, but it failed
        again in 1992. (Old timers recall that, in 1910, Brooks' clock
        had actually stalled at a quarter to eight -- but there are
        fewer rhymes for 'eight.'"

Smile, everybody.

In reply Peter's message about bookstores, a discussion which I have not
been following nad hence might repeat what someone else has said:

Why do we need bookstores or for that matter printers, binders, shippers,
distributors, jobbers or any of that other market infrastructure for
delivery of the text to readers.

Not that we need to do away with them entirely. They serve a purpose for
books which fulfill the volume sales requirements of the market in terms
of margin and visibility. They can deliver, because of the mature
technology, a vast array of difficult and lengthy materials. What they
cannot do is fulfill the purposes of writers whose books only sell a few
copies.

As an alternative, books can be delivered direct to the user using this
carrier as a base. We will have "bugs" to work out and ergonomic issues
to improve, but at least we will move toward liberating ourselves as
writers and readers from a market place which as Peter points out is
restricting our access.

I don't really think the issue of whether Murdoch actually pulled the
plug on some of "our" work is that critical. The restrictions, the
censorship is based in the market structure and the market-place model.

Besides, with desktop publishing and hyper text software we can extend
our range on the screen in a way we couldn not easily control on the
page.

I hope to put together a program in the near future with the help of
Patrick Phillips and others at Segue to look at the possibilities of not
chasing the chimera of acceptance by a market oriented to mass sales and
censorship of alternative discourses. Grist is a good step. This list is
a good step. Now let's go the next step and look carefully at the
issue of the necessity of moveable type.

Ah, the sermon, a form of the poem I rather like. Thank you, Peter. I
know about Am Here, but would love to hear from others about mail order
sources for books which are very good. Isn't Asphodel in Ohio primarily a
mail order shop?

One other note, of an entirely different order. I've been an advocate
here and elsewhere for the book as a carrier of meaning, i.e. the book in
its form, shape, design, materials, etc., as a partner with its text.
There aren't many working in this area, and now there is one less. Steven
Kranz, in Tucson, Arizona, who began as an intern with Chax Press about
six years ago and ended up helping with many books, newsletters, etc.,
and whose own Ring Multiples put out several marvelous books to view and,
more importantly, think about, recently took his own life. He left a
unique body of writing, drawings, and book arts works which,
unfortunately, not many have seen. He shall be missed. And just yesterday
I also heard that another book artist, Kent Kazuboski, in Philadelphia,
who made and illustrated several quite wonderful books by various
printers, also took his own life.

I know that most on this list will not know these two, which is also
unfortunate. But I still thought their passing needed to be noted. The
last book, very small in size, sent to me by Steven Kranz, had a
vellum-like pink and white wrapper and was printed on a laser printer
(Steve was fond of making books in very inexpensive and quick ways) yet
was, in a unique way, both quirky and elegant. Its title is PRESSURIZED
LINES, and it presented the following text, two sections per recto page,
with versos blank --

Hey, Sandra,
wow, Africa, eh? I read today about a new elephant safari outfit in
Zimbwabe. You shoot the elephants but what you shoot ythem with is
capsuls of food covering that go splat and leave orange splats on the
elephants. I wonder whether they get used to it and just walk calmly
by with people splatting them. It'll get too easy. These are people
who want to be Hemingway and Cousteau ayt the same time. Maybe we
could outfit the US Army with orange splat guns and they can hold
their annual invasions of small countries with orange splat guns!
Hmmm, as we say up here.

Michael, yr clippings about poets did cheer me up because today I
have been reading poems about Maud Gonne. Needed a pick me up. But I
will be going to hear Blaser in a bar tonight. I will probably have a
hangover while teaching tomorrow. I'll consider that the fault of
serial verse.

New York artists Nora Ligorano & Marshall Reese will present a
retrospective of their videotapes 7:30 PM, Wednesday, October 5,
1994 at the Pacific Film Archive, University Art Museum, Berkeley,
CA.

Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese have been far-ranging in their
assaults on the right-wing culture war, the tyrannical nature of
media, and the pall of consumerism.  Videotapes, installation,
sculpture, and expanded books have proved to be formidable tools
for their many collaborative projects.  Straight from their residency
at the Djerassi Foundation, Ligorano/Reese will present videoworks
and documentation covering recent installations, including their 45-
foot photo/video mural at the Donnell Library in Manhattan.

Examining the role of the artist in contemporary society, Acid
Migration of Culture (1994) transformed the library's facade into an
enormous dictionary of artistic terms.

An earlier work, The Bible Belt (1992) featured a specially prepared
videotape encased in a doctored Bible.  In this tape a televangelist
hawks consumerist virtues and a belt emblazoned with bold letters
spelling "JESUS."

Black Holes/Heavenly Bodies -- HELL (1982, 15 min.) is a high-tech
nightmare in which violence and mediocrity are the potent
background noise.  Several other works will be exhibited, along with
their newest 30 Aphorisms (1994, 3 min.) an image processed look at
language and the abstraction of images.

The artists will be present and will also show examples of their
limited edition artists books and slides from their work in progress
The Corona Palimpsest.

book to emerge from myh feminist art generation," by The Financial
Times of London as "a clever, unorthodox, enthralling book which
combines criticism and fiction in elegant symbiosis."
