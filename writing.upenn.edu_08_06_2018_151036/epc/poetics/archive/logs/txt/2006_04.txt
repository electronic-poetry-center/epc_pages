Granted, "The Rooster" may not qualify as a long poem in the same
sense as some of the long poems discussed, but it's Gil Orlovitz's
longest as far as I know.

Spurred into action from all this talk about long poems, I wrote a  bit
about Orlovitz on PhillySound, and reprinted in full "The Rooster,"
so if you're interested, go to:

Gennady Aygi is widely regarded as one of the world=E2=80=99s foremost conte=
mporary
poets. His work has been translated into some twenty languages, and he has
been nominated several times for the Nobel Prize. In the late 1950s, Boris
Pasternak and Nazim Hikmet urged Aygi to switch from writing in his mother
tongue, Chuvash, to Russian. It was not until the 1960s that he was first
published in Eastern Europe, and not until the late 1980s that his poems
were allowed to be openly published in the Soviet Union and Chuvashia, an
autonomous republic in the middle Volga valley where he was born in 1934.
Books of his available in the U.S. include Selected Poems: 1954-1994 (Angel
Books/Nortwestern University Press), Salute=E2=80=94To Singing (Zephyr Press=
), and
just published in April 2003, Child-and-Rose (New Directions Publishing).

March 31, 2006
Jazz Saxophonist Jackie McLean Dies at 73
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Filed at 11:11 p.m. ET

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Jazz saxophonist Jackie McLean, a performer
and teacher who played with legendary musicians including Miles
Davis and Sonny Rollins, died Friday. He was 73.

McLean, a contemporary of some of the 20th century's most famed jazz
musicians, died at his Hartford home after a long illness, family
members told The Hartford Courant.

McLean was founder and artistic director of the Jackie McLean
Institute of Jazz at the University of Hartford's Hartt School.

He and his wife, actress Dollie McLean, also founded the Artists
Collective, a community center and fine arts school primarily for
troubled youth in inner city Hartford.

University President Walter Harrison said that despite his many
musical accomplishments, McLean was a modest man whose connections
with his students lasted for decades after they left his classroom.

''He fully understood the way that jazz as an art should be passed
down to students,'' Harrison said. ''He saw his role as bringing
jazz from the 1950s and '60s and handing it down to artists of
today.''

McLean, a native of Harlem in New York City, grew up in a musical
family, his father playing guitar in Tiny Bradshaw's band. McLean
took up the soprano saxophone as a teen and quickly switched to the
alto saxophone, inspired by his godfather's performances in a church
choir, he told WBGO-FM in Newark, N.J., in an interview in 2004.

McLean went on to play with his friend Rollins under the tutelage of
pianist Bud Powell, and was 19 when he first recorded with Miles
Davis.

He drew wide attention with his 1959 debut on Blue Note
Records, ''Jackie's Bag,'' one of dozens of albums he recorded in
the hard-bop and free jazz styles.

He also played with Charles Mingus and Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers,
experiences that he credited with helping him find his own style as
he tried to emulate the famed Charlie ''Bird'' Parker.

''I never really sounded like Bird, but that was my mission,''
McLean said in the radio interview. ''I didn't care if people said
that I copied him; I loved Bird's playing so much. But Mingus was
the one that really pushed me away from the idea and forced me into
thinking about having an individual sound and concept.''

After Blue Note terminated his recording contract in 1968, McLean
began teaching at the University of Hartford. McLean taught jazz,
African-American music, and African-American history and culture. He
received an American Jazz Masters fellowship from the National
Endowment for the Arts in 2001, and toured the world as an educator
and performer.

McLean, a heroin addict during his early career, also lectured on
drug addiction research.

You felt obliged, then(?), to throw in *five* 'America/American's in your
short email because you were being critical, despite your deep awareness of
Latin America? Even you who lived in Latin America for 7 years? It's quite
an amazingly effective word, rhetorically, certainly. It's like the word
'new': it improves every product it accompanies. Think of American Gigolo,
American Psycho (great movie), American Woman (nasty Canadian song), the
band America (their horse didn't need a name), the writer Mark Amerika, AOL,
American Standard, etc. My jaw stiffens and my resolve deepens simply by
saying the word five or more times.

Subject:      *Munich* in Arabia - (but no *Paradise Now*)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

*Munich* just opened here in Muscat. I went to a Friday afternoon (like
Sunday in the West) matinee. The theatre was pretty full.

I sat mid-theatre and only once noticed people leaving: a group of women
three-fourths of the way through, after the action when the story became
more domestic again. People could have left behind me.

The crowd felt, to me, uncomfortable watching the film: murmuring and
fidgeting especially when Israeli/Jewish positions were being
explicated.

I talked to an American student at my college who, seeing it the day
before me, had the same impression of the crowd.

It's hard to be aware of others, though, during scenes with gunfire or
explosions.

"Don't fuck with the Jews," got some chuckles.

I heard a lot of "tsk-tsk" when the Dutch assassin was being killed.

What I took to be an oral sex scene was cut short by the censors, but
the sex/death scenes at the end appeared intact.

We'll see how long it lasts here. *Jarhead* lasted a week but *The
Passion of the Christ* lasted a month here in Muscat.

*Paradise Now* skipped the theaters here completely but we can rent it
on DVD.

Though all films must have Arabic subtitles, the cinemas appear to
attract a better educated, multi-lingual crowd. Arabic-language films
that delve into social issues (*Paradise Now*) could attract what the
government would consider a mono-lingual, under-educated crowd, less (or
not at all) invested in the collaborationist, internationalist policies
of the better-to-do Omani and expatriate communities and the government.
Additionally, private debate is kept private and not encouraged to
become public. Attendance at anything but fluff may lead to agitation.
Thus, films like *Paradise Now* do not receive censor permits and are
not shown in theaters.=20

(There are cinemas that cater to the Indian community, though these
Tamil & Hindi films are frequented mostly by the manual labor force. The
South Asian professional class will see English language films, or the
occasional Hindi film shown in a cinema that specializes in
English-language films.)

The only films in Arabic that play here in Oman's cinemas are
trash-actions and slapstick comedies from Egypt.

Apart from films, it's been a rare find among my students when one says
s/he enjoys reading and reads for pleasure in Arabic. In fact, I can
only think of female students that do, off hand. But I wonder if that's
how it feels to teach in the US as well?

In every one of the countries I've been to, I was called a variation of
"American" by the people there.

Besides, "Death to America" fits better on banners than "Death to the
United States."

And no one mistakes it for Paraguay anyway.

Subject: Re: China (and the US) and Poetry

I think we can all agree that both Chinese and US government have problems,
both large and small. We should also agree that both governments have done
and are even today doing good things. I hope we can all agree that we have a
duty, as well as the possibility, to work for more good and less bad.



I write this to say that I don't see any necessary competition between China
and the US in terms of which is worse. But things do get interesting when we
start asking these questions, or when we start asking how which government
is worse rather than simply which is worse.



I'm clear that from the perspective of those within these countries, the
Chinese government is more oppressive. The chance that your government will
kill you or imprison you is greater if your government is Chinese than if
it's the US. I'd rather be a poet or a dissident in the US than in China.



But I'm also sure that from the perspective of those outside these
countries, the US is a greater threat. The chances that the US will kill or
imprison you is greater than that China will kill you if you are in Iraq,
Nigeria, France, or Canada. It's probably the same everywhere in the world,
with the exception perhaps of Nepal and Taiwan. But then, from the Chinese
government's point of view, Taiwan is part of China anyway. If I were a poet
or dissident or labor leader anywhere in the world aside from the US and
China, I'd be more afraid of the US than China (I might even take help from
China if it meant I could fight the US).



Are these hard points to accept? Is China worse to its own people than the
US is to everyone else? Does discussing China's oppression keep us from
focusing on how to improve the US, or does focusing on the US's problems
keep us blind to the oppression that happens in China? I think these
questions are both more interesting and more pressing than simply whether
China or the US is the bigger monster.



And finally, as someone who has lived in the US and China, and will always
be spending time in both those countries, I should point out that I love
many things about these places that both have nothing to do with the
government and have a lot to do with the government. It's this love that
inspires me to work, in both countries, to overcome what I find oppressive
in both places.

Bernstein: Don't take L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E errors 'literally'
U.S. poet visits England amid anti-experimental protests

Saturday, April 1, 2006; Posted: 9:23 a.m. EST (14:23 GMT)


BLACKBURN, England (CNN) -- One day after Charles Bernstein said the
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets made possibly "thousands" of tactical mistakes
in the war against moderism, the poet says he was speaking
"figuratively, not literally."

About 300 protesters -- most of them upset about the experiments --
and two dozen supporters greeted Bernstein outside the town hall in
Blackburn, the home of his counterpart, Ted Hughes.

The two faced reporters at midday after attending a multi-vocal
service at Blackburn Cathedral and meeting with the city's poetry
leaders. About 20 percent of Blackburn's population are poets.

In a speech Friday at an event organized by the Chatham House think
tank, Bernstein said, "I am quite certain there are going to be
dissertations written about the mistakes of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
administration."

"I know we've made tactical errors, thousands of them, I'm sure," he
said. "But when you look back in history what will be judged on is"
whether the "right strategic decision" was made.

On Saturday, a reporter asked Bernstein to give examples of the
mistakes.

"First of all, I meant it figuratively, not literally. Let me let me
be very clear about that. I wasn't sitting around counting," he
replied. "The point I was making to the questioner ... is that, of
course, if you've ever made decisions, you've undoubtedly made mistakes.

"The important thing is to get the big strategic decisions right, and
that I am confident that the decision to overthrow moderism and give
the literate people an opportunity for incoherence and aphasia is the
right decision."

"The other point I was making to the questioner is that I'm enough of
a poet to know that things that looked brilliant at the moment turn
out in historical perspective to be mistakes, and the things that
look like mistakes turn out to have been right decisions."

Bernstein, who has been dogged by protesters over the past two days,
denied that they have drowned out his messages, and repeated that the
right to protest is fundamental in a democracy.

"Indeed, I've been very warmly welcomed. I've also noticed the people
waving along the streets, I've noticed the considerable gathering of
people from Blackburn, just on the other side of the demonstrations.
I'm hearing their voices equally clearly and equally well," he said.

Hughes also downplayed the demonstrations, including one in Liverpool
Friday night that drew about 1,500 outside the city's Philharmonic
Concert Hall.

A singer at the concert dedicated a song to the demonstrators, sang
Yoko Ono's "'Oh, O'Oh, Walking on Thin Ice" and gave an impromptu
rendition of his "God Save L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poetry ."

"I'm not embarrassed in the least," Hughes said of the demonstrations.

He drew laughter from the reporters when he added, "as for the size
of the crowds, I've been on plenty of demonstrations in my life --
well maybe a few years ago -- but I've not forgotten what is a big
crowd and what is a small crowd -- and that was not a big crowd" in
Liverpool.

Bernstein was expected to return to NYC later Saturday.

Jim, I take your point: "America" might technically mean North
America and South America (the way "Eurasia" would mean Europe and
Asia). In Latin American countries it's more common to use the word
that way. But it's a much stronger convention in English to use
"American" to mean a citizen of the United States of America, as a
"Mexican" is a citizen of the United Mexican States. You can argue
that technically "America" should be more generic, but I can't help
feeling that argument is ridiculous, because I (as a non-US-citizen
living in the US) would never ever say "I'm from America. More
specifically, I'm from Canada."

Wow, I heard there are about seventy five gathered at Newark Airport already, pens, blank notebooks, and roughly-drawn photographs of themselves in hand.  But they don't realize that today is April 1st, and Bernstein always arrives at JFK on April 1st.

  While we wait for more breaking news, enjoy Charles Bernstein's new poem, "The Twelve Tribes of Dr. Lacan" at MiPOesias (http://www.mipoesias.com/Poetry/bernstein_charles.html) - Fresh Today!

It's no secret that I am a huge Ian Hamilton Finlay fan. Finlay died of
cancer last Monday at the age of 80.

I was lucky enough to meet Finlay's son, Eck, at a poetry reading I did in
New York on St. Patrick's day. I forget exactly what year this was, it must
have been 1996, when the holiday fell on a Sunday, or 1995, when it fell on
a Friday (the most recent one on a Saturday was 1990, when I was still in
college). I was subbing for Melanie Nielson, and because of the holiday the
Ear Inn didn't want to host the reading. In any case, I read to a not very
packed house at a tea shop near by with Norma Cole - the only other notable
event was that I accidentally brushed dandruff into Jackson Mac Low's soup,
and I met Erica Hunt that day but didn't know it was her because she sat
alone, with her child, at the back (actually, very front) of the room, and I
assume she was some woman who stopped by on a whim.

I saw Eck give a talk about his father's work later that week at Teacher's
and Writers. Because his father was an agoraphobe, Eck used to give talks
about his work around the world, which afforded him a great chance to meet
poets outside of the UK.

I didn't see Eck much after that, but in 1998 I went to London to spend time
with Miles Champion, and while there met Thomas Evans, a good friend of both
Miles' and Eck's, who invited me to a party at Eck's apartment in Edinburgh.
I remember being keen on seeing a reading in London at the same time at
Subvoicive, the sort of equivalent of the Ear series over there, but it was
an Ann Waldman reading, so I felt it was probably something I could miss
being as I'd seen Ann read numerous times already. (I'll never forget the
phone call I had with Tim Atkins about this dilemma - he said "a reading by
Ann Waldman or a weekend on the Scottish shore. let me make your decision
for you.")

So I took the train up to Edinburgh. It was packed with football revelers
who were rather dismayed that their team, Newcastle, had just lost to
Arsenal in some sort of final or other. (Miles and I had been chased by
Arsenal fans the night before, so I don't think winning or losing changes
much in terms of how much is imbibed.) It was early afternoon, but everyone
on the train was drunk, drunk, drunk, and loud as hell. I knew I would hear
it when I got up to go the bathroom, but it wasn't so bad in the end.

But Edinburgh was a relief. The Scottish cabby who managed to find Eck's
place for me was a dear, or at least compared to London cabbies. The
architecture really amazed me, and for the first time on that trip I felt
like I was in another country. Not a "Blockbuster" sign in sight. The party
was great - I won't go into details, but there were Gaelic songs, an
intoxicated elder Scot with an eye for a much younger lady, the reading of
much poetry, and the poet Gael Turnbull, who in a reversal had visited
W.C.W. in Rutherford many (many) years before.

(I've just learned from Wikipedia that Turnbull, who died in 2004, also
created "kinetic poems," which were "texts for installation in which the
movement of the reader and/or of the text became part of the reading
experience." Maybe I should stop believing in coincidence.)

The next day was, indeed, spent driving around the Scottish shore and
through the hills of Fife, accompanied by Eck, two friends of his, the
daughter of one of the friends named Sinead (who sang several of the Gaelic
songs the night previous), and Thomas. I saw cows on hillsides that looked
right out of the cover of Atom Heart Mother
<http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?p=atom+heart+mother&sm=Yahoo%2
1+Search&fr=FP-tab-img-t&toggle=1&cop=&ei=UTF-8> . We visited an artist who
lived in a converted movie theater at the peak of a cliff that overlooked
the shore, and I sat with Thomas on that shore as he regaled me with
memorized lines from the letters of Jack Kerouac. Only an English poet would
bother to memorize such things written in a haze of alcohol as if they were
Samuel Johnson, but I certainly never faulted him for it! (Now that I think
of it, it might have been Clark Coolidge he was quoting to me.)

We also visited Eck's childhood vacation home, which was overrun by spiders,
and spent a good hour with Eck's mother, Sue, who helped build Little
Sparta. She and Ian, who had known each other since childhood growing up on
those hills, were estranged, but both still lived in Fife. I also saw gorse,
which is good because now I can use the word "gorse" in poems and sound like
I know what I mean, but the opportunity hasn't yet arisen.

I'm making a short story long, but this really was one of my finest
weekends. I have several beautiful photographs to show you if you ever want
to visit me.

We did finally get to the garden, the road to which is (if I remember
correctly) only marked by the most crude of signs. Eck told me that Ian
wasn't so keen on having visitors because he felt the poems "weren't there
yet" - the foliage had not yet accrued to the degree that was ideal for
their presentation. But because I was with Eck - who I didn't think liked me
the night before when I was an uninvited guest but who turned out to be very
friendly - we got in. (One memory also from that trip - I sang one of the
few songs of my own that I memorized a cappella in the car as we were
driving, a feat that will never be reproduced in my lifetime, or in yours.)

We approached the garden, I with great anticipation. It was almost
anti-climactic to come upon Ian sitting on a stone bench in his long rubber
boots looking at one of his poems right there at the entrance to the place.
I would have much rather we had to muck around in his living room looking at
stuff while he was upstairs getting decent. Nonetheless, the poem he was
looking at was beautiful, and though we barely said anything to each other,
I could tell immediately that he was a very gentle and kind man, not quite
what I expected for a guy who lost a commission in France because he wanted
the piece to be include a long row of working guillotines.

I'd tell you about walking around the garden and all the amazing things I
saw, but you can look at the photographs (links below) and get your own
sense of what it was like. Specific memories: going into the Temple of
Apollo, which had once been a sort of small museum of IHF works but was now
closed to the public because Ian had not been able to have it declared a
religious site (rather than a cultural site, which is taxed much more). It
was now a storage room - I saw several boxes of works that had just been
shipped to Finlay from his collaborators (I photographed the mailing label
on one of them).

The other memory was of Eck and his lady friend whose name I can't remember
rowing around in the "Sea Eck" in the pond there. She was doing all the
rowing, Eck was doing all the talking. Somehow this seemed hilarious to me
because she was rather skinny and didn't look exactly like she was enjoying
the imbalance of physical exertion. But that might just have been my
satirist's eye acting up.

The hills are as bare as they appear in the photographs, and the parts
covered in the foliage in the garden are as green and rich. The stones you
see above, so difficult to photograph, are littered (if that's quite the
word) on the outer edge of the garden, and they read: "The present order is
the disorder of the future." I am not always able to quote this line
properly - I even had to look it up just now - because I somehow believe the
opposite to be true, but neither version cancels the other out. I'm not sure
which is more optimistic than the other; it really all depends on where you
sit on the Foucauldian fence (oh god, did I just use the word
"Foucauldian"?).

We didn't see Ian again until we left. There is a photograph in my shoebox
of Ian and I with the sun setting behind us - a pretty awful photograph, as
the sun really should have been upon us. You can't see either of our faces
very well, but his arms are crossed and I am wearing my famous red gingham
shirt. I was too nervous (and physically exhausted, given the previous
evening's drunkenness - my entire London trip's drunkenness, you won't be
surprised to hear) to say anything significant. But then again, I hardly
expected to hit it off right away with Finlay, we are from quite different
worlds. I've only ever rented, for example. I could have told him that my
doctor was William Carlos Williams' son, but that's an ice breaker that
works on too few occasions. I could have also told him that Robert Smithson
was also from Rutherford - their work seems to have something to do with
each other - but I didn't know it at the time.

I wrote an article about Finlay for the St. Mark's Poetry Project Newsletter
which Lisa Jarnot was kind enough to publish. John Tranter republished it in
Jacket, and I think it convinced him to have an entire section devoted to
Finlay's work, including a really excellent (much superior to mine) article
by Drew Milne. I encourage anyone who reads this blog to take a peek at
these articles and also at the links to photographs below.

I don't have anything terribly profound to say about his work right now,
except perhaps that he really enriched my thinking on what it means to be a
"postmodern" artist - he was not "postmodern" in any convenient sense of the
term, there is/was nothing obvious about Ian Hamilton Finlay, his politics,
his aesthetics or his philosophy. He is the first concrete poet I knew whose
work actually pointed to a larger world view that was not entirely a
meditation on text and its paradoxes, or some easy comment on modern culture
- his "vision of sweet philosophy" permeated everything he did, and he
created an easy transport between his wee garden in Scotland and the greater
(and most frightening) themes of Western Civ.

Ok, that's a bunch of abstraction for you, but I did use the word
"Foucauldian" earlier. He used many of the same techniques that artists like
Bruce Nauman (script in neon lights) and several other conceptual and
performance artists (words on the side of buildings, on gallery walls,
appropriation, not to mention the "crates" event) but it all pointed to some
vision that was, on the one hand, sublime, historical and full of sense of
order and the ideal, but on the other anchored in the particular, the
ephemeral. The garden may very well sink into ruin, but that seems to have
been part of the plan (again, an echo of Smithson here, whose Spiral Jetty
was meant to degrade beautifully, then disappear). Most of us are hoping for
something a little better than that, at least for the immediate future.

Thanks to mIEKAL aND for sending some of these links along to the ubuweb
listserv. I append the New York Times obituary since it will eventually
become a pay-only piece of reading; I hope they (and Jeffrey Julich) don't
mind.

Ian Hamilton Finlay, 80, Poet and Conceptual Artist, Dies

By KEN JOHNSON for The New York Times
Published: March 31, 2006

Ian Hamilton Finlay, a Scottish poet and conceptual artist known for his
neo-Classical-style sculptures inscribed with poetic texts as well as for
his home and garden, an imaginative echo of ancient Rome in the Pentland
Hills of Lanarkshire, died on Monday at a hospital in Edinburgh. He was 80.

The cause was cancer, said Katherine Chan, director of the Nolan/Eckman
Gallery, which represents Mr. Finlay in New York.

The famously contentious Mr. Finlay began calling his home Little Sparta in
1980, partly to symbolize his refusal to compromise with the local
authorities over whether a building dedicated to Apollo should be taxed as a
religious or a commercial structure.

Now maintained by a foundation, Little Sparta resembles the home of an
ancient Roman philosopher-poet. Rustic and Classical-style stone carvings
bearing literary quotations have been carefully placed throughout the
property. One stone block, seemingly antique and tilted in the ground as if
it were a ruin, presents the neatly chiseled words of the French
revolutionary Louis de Saint-Just: "The world has been empty since the
Romans."

But the grounds are not completely given over to nostalgic traditionalism.
Images of 20th-century warfare are also distributed about. The two posts of
a stone-and-brick gateway, for example, are each topped by an oversize stone
carving of a hand grenade.

Mr. Finlay conceived and designed his sculptures, but hired craftsmen to
produce them. He also created works for exhibitions in Europe and the United
States and for public commissions. Although he had agoraphobia, which
restricted his traveling, he had an internationally recognized career, and
many visitors made the pilgrimage to Little Sparta.

Mr. Finlay was on the short list for Britain's Turner Prize for contemporary
art in 1985 and received the honorary appointment of a Commander of the
British Empire in 2002. His work was selected to be part of the 2006 Tate
Triennial, a survey of British contemporary art now on view at Tate Britain
in London.

Ian Hamilton Finlay was born on Oct. 28, 1925, in Nassau, the Bahamas, where
his father was a bootlegger who smuggled rum into the United States during
Prohibition. At 6 Mr. Finlay was sent to boarding school in Scotland. War
cut short his education at 13, when he was evacuated to Orkney, an
archipelago at the northern tip of Scotland. As a teenager he briefly
attended the Glasgow School of Art before being called up in 1942 for duty
with the Royal Army Service Corps.

After the war, Mr. Finlay worked as a shepherd while producing paintings;
short plays, which were broadcast by the BBC; and stories, which were
published in The Herald of Glasgow.

In 1961 Mr. Finlay founded the Wild Hawthorn Press, which initially
published contemporary poets like Louis Zukofsky and Lorine Niedecker but
later focused mainly on Mr. Finlay's poetry. In the early 60's he became
interested in concrete poetry, in which the visual appearance of words was
meant to count as much as the literary meaning. He also began producing
short poems sandblasted on glass. One read simply, "Wave Rock."

In 1966 Mr. Finlay and his second wife, Sue, moved to the cottage and
grounds that would become Little Sparta, a patch of highlands then called
Stonypath, 30 miles southwest of Edinburgh. It was to be his home for the
rest of his life. Mr. Finlay's marriage to his first wife, Marion, ended in
divorce. He is survived by his wife and their children, Alec Finlay and
Ailie Simpson.

Today visitors to Little Sparta are greeted by a bronze plaque mounted on a
brick wall that nicely sums up Mr. Finlay's independent, high-minded and
mercurial spirit: above the imposing, precisely modeled image of a machine
gun, sentiments from the poet Virgil read, "Flute, begin with me Arcadian
notes."

U.S. poet visits England amid anti-experimental protests

Saturday, April 1, 2006; Posted: 9:23 a.m. EST (14:23 GMT)


BLACKBURN, England (CNN) -- One day after Charles Bernstein said the
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets made possibly "thousands" of tactical mistakes in the
war against moderism, the poet says he was speaking "figuratively, not
literally."

About 300 protesters -- most of them upset about the experiments -- and two
dozen supporters greeted Bernstein outside the town hall in Blackburn, the
home of his counterpart, Ted Hughes.

The two faced reporters at midday after attending a multi-vocal service at
Blackburn Cathedral and meeting with the city's poetry leaders. About 20
percent of Blackburn's population are poets.

In a speech Friday at an event organized by the Chatham House think tank,
Bernstein said, "I am quite certain there are going to be dissertations
written about the mistakes of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E administration."

"I know we've made tactical errors, thousands of them, I'm sure," he said.
"But when you look back in history what will be judged on is"
whether the "right strategic decision" was made.

On Saturday, a reporter asked Bernstein to give examples of the mistakes.

"First of all, I meant it figuratively, not literally. Let me let me be very
clear about that. I wasn't sitting around counting," he replied. "The point
I was making to the questioner ... is that, of course, if you've ever made
decisions, you've undoubtedly made mistakes.

"The important thing is to get the big strategic decisions right, and that I
am confident that the decision to overthrow moderism and give the literate
people an opportunity for incoherence and aphasia is the right decision."

"The other point I was making to the questioner is that I'm enough of a poet
to know that things that looked brilliant at the moment turn out in
historical perspective to be mistakes, and the things that look like
mistakes turn out to have been right decisions."

Bernstein, who has been dogged by protesters over the past two days, denied
that they have drowned out his messages, and repeated that the right to
protest is fundamental in a democracy.

"Indeed, I've been very warmly welcomed. I've also noticed the people waving
along the streets, I've noticed the considerable gathering of people from
Blackburn, just on the other side of the demonstrations.
I'm hearing their voices equally clearly and equally well," he said.

Hughes also downplayed the demonstrations, including one in Liverpool Friday
night that drew about 1,500 outside the city's Philharmonic Concert Hall.

A singer at the concert dedicated a song to the demonstrators, sang Yoko
Ono's "'Oh, O'Oh, Walking on Thin Ice" and gave an impromptu rendition of
his "God Save L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poetry ."

"I'm not embarrassed in the least," Hughes said of the demonstrations.

He drew laughter from the reporters when he added, "as for the size of the
crowds, I've been on plenty of demonstrations in my life -- well maybe a few
years ago -- but I've not forgotten what is a big crowd and what is a small
crowd -- and that was not a big crowd" in Liverpool.

Bernstein was expected to return to NYC later Saturday.

i awoke this morning to find my ny times nearly drenched by a
thunderstorm... picked it up, flipped it open to the book review, and
read, half in a fog, this opening para, by david orr, his
(front-page) review of ~edgar allan poe & the juke-box:  uncollected
poems, drafts, and fragments~, by elizabeth bishop, just released by
fsg:

"You are living in a world created by Elizabeth Bishop.  Granted, our
culture owes its shape to plenty of other forces -- Hollywood,
Microsoft, Rachael Ray -- but nothing matches the impact of a great
artist, and in the second half of the 20th century, no American
artist in any medium was greater than Bishop (1911-79).  That she
worked in one of our country's least popular fields, poetry, doesn't
matter.  That she was a woman doesn't matter.  That she was gay
doesn't matter.  That she was an alcoholic, an expatriate and
essentially an orphan -- none of this matters.  What matters is that
she left behind a body of work that teaches us, as Italo Calvino once
said of literature generally, "a method subtle and flexible enough to
be the same thing as an absence of any method whatever."  The
publication of 'Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke-Box," which gathers for
the first time Bishop's unpublished material, isn't just a
significant event in our poetry; it's part of a continuing alteration
in the scale of American life."

comments?... it's probably clear what i think about this (or i
wouldn't have repro'd it)... it presumably "doesn't matter" to orr,
either, that bishop didn't live to see the last 21 years of that
period over which orr has her as the greatest american artist...

best,

Bernadette Mayer Poetry Reading Wednesday, April 5, 8 PM
Leonard Theater, Peabody Hall, Oxford Campus
Miami University, Ohio
Free and open to the public

Bernadette Mayer will read from her poetry at 8 p.m. Wednesday, April
5, in Leonard Theater, Peabody Hall.  Mayer, who will be on campus
for a week teaching a sprint course in poetry, is the author of many
books of poetry and prose, including Moving (1971), Studying Hunger
(1976), Midwinter Day (1982, 1999), Utopia (1984), Sonnets (1989),
The Formal Field of Kissing (1990), A Bernadette Mayer Reader (1982),
The Desire of Mothers to Please Others in Letters (1994),  Another
Smashed Pinecone (1998), and Scarlet Tanager (2005). A number of
these books already have the status of contemporary "classics."

As writer, editor, and teacher of legendary workshops at the St,
Mark's Poetry Project in New York City, Mayer has helped define the
possibilities of contemporary practice in poetry, transforming what
she inherited from the poets of the so-called "New York School" and
influencing younger writers from Charles Bernstein to Lee Ann Brown
and Lisa Jarnot. Her work viewed across its full spectrum is both
"experimental" and "traditional," which is to say that it includes
sonnets, epigrams, and translations of Roman lyric together with work
like Midwinter Day, one day of domestic life in poetry and prose with
perhaps a nod or two to Joyce, and The Desires of Mothers to Please
Others in Letters, epistolary writing with its batteries charged.

Mayer is also a love poet whose frank wit is every bit the equal of
her great model Catullus. Juliana Spahr's essay on her sonnets at
http://jacketmagazine.com/07/spahr-mayer.html is worth reading, among
many other discussions of Mayer's work, and those seeking a more
extensive introduction to her work accessible online might consult
the entry on Mayer at The Literary Encyclopedia (http://
www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5897).

Review by DAVID ORR

You are living in a world created by Elizabeth Bishop. Granted, our cultur=
e
owes its shape to plenty of other forces - Hollywood, Microsoft, Rachael
Ray - but nothing matches the impact of a great artist, and in the second
half of the 20th century, no American artist in any medium was greater tha=
n
Bishop (1911-79). That she worked in one of our country's least popular
fields, poetry, doesn't matter. That she was a woman doesn't matter. That
she was gay doesn't matter. That she was an alcoholic, an expatriate and
essentially an orphan - none of this matters. What matters is that she lef=
t
behind a body of work that teaches us, as Italo Calvino once said of
literature generally, "a method subtle and flexible enough to be the same
thing as an absence of any method whatever." The publication of "Edgar
Allan Poe & the Juke-Box," which gathers for the first time Bishop's
unpublished material, isn't just a significant event in our poetry; it's p=
art of a
continuing alteration in the scale of American life.

Just don't expect that change to be announced with a fanfare. In a tribute=
 to
Bishop, James Merrill famously noted her "lifelong impersonations of an
ordinary woman," and the observation applies to her writing as much as to
comportment. From the beginning, Bishop's work was descriptive rather
than assertive, conversational rather than rhetorical and discreet rather
than confessional. (It was also hard to come by: in her lifetime, she
published only around 90 poems.) This was surprising for two reasons.
First, her approach was completely unlike the modes favored by her more
flamboyant peers - Robert Lowell, John Berryman - as well as the guts-
spilling styles they helped inspire. Second, if you believe art mirrors li=
fe,
reticence is the opposite of what you'd anticipate from Bishop, whose
biography contains enough torment to satisfy St. Sebastian. An abbreviated=

list: her father died when she was a baby; her mother vanished into an
insane asylum when Bishop was 5; her college boyfriend committed suicide
when she refused to marry him and sent her a parting postcard that said,
"Go to hell, Elizabeth"; and the great love of her life, Lota de Macedo
Soares, with whom she spent many years in Brazil, fatally overdosed in
Bishop's apartment. From a writer with a history like that, we might expec=
t
announcements like Lowell's "I hear/ my ill-spirit sob in each blood cell.=
"
We don't expect to be told "I caught a tremendous fish."

This curious restraint has been admired by many critics (Bishop won the
Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the National Book Critics
Circle Award), but it also explains why she so often has been identified w=
ith
words like "quiet," "charming," "scrupulous" and, above all, "modest" - al=
l
of them perfectly useful adjectives, but none that would tip the reader of=
f to
the harrowing nature of her life or (more important) the colossal ambition=
 of
her poems. Even her admirers sometimes struggle to forgive her for
seeming so remarkably . . . unremarkable. Dana Gioia, a longtime Bishop
advocate and current chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts,
gets only a few paragraphs into an essay on her reputation's dramatic rise=

in the poetry world after her death before asking, almost apologetically, =
"Is
Elizabeth Bishop overrated?" "Perhaps a bit," he answers, which
presumably is what you say when you've gotten in the habit of thinking
about poetry so much that you forget Bishop's poems are less well known
to many people than the lyrics to "Total Eclipse of the Heart."

So why do we feel compelled to elevate Bishop while simultaneously
worrying that we're raising her too high? In large part, the answer has to=
 do
with the difference between difficulty and subtlety. Difficulty is a belov=
ed
concept in the poetry world, because it's the crux of an old but cherished=

argument: Are poems too obscure? Or not obscure enough? The debate is
a canned one, of course, but it lets all parties make their favorite point=
s,
and everyone is therefore happy to argue over "difficulty" at the drop of =
a
hat. The reality, though, is that most readers and writers aren't actually=

made nervous by "difficulty," at least as the term is usually meant. For o=
ne
thing, difficulty is straightforward - you either figure out what's diffic=
ult, or
you don't. You might fail, but you aren't going to be misled. (In this sen=
se,
and in its implicit endorsement of hard work, difficulty is a concept that=
 has
long been central to our shared identity as Americans). Subtlety is differ=
ent,
though. Subtlety wants to be missed by all but the chosen few; it is aloof=
,
withholding and aristocratic - sometimes manipulative and always
disguised. It has less to do with theory and technique, which can be
learned mechanically, than with style and sensibility, which require
intuition. It wants to be looked at but not seen. It's unnerving.

It's also exactly what distinguishes Bishop's greatest poetry, which is wh=
y
it's so hard to be entirely comfortable with this writer, or to know where=
 she
belongs. To begin, there is the peculiar Bishop voice, which is often call=
ed
faux na=EFf, but is probably closer to faux normal (the imitation isn't of=

innocence, but stability). On one hand, she can seem perfectly
straightforward - no poet, for instance, starts a poem more matter-of-
factly: "In Worcester, Massachusetts, / I went with Aunt Consuelo / to kee=
p
her dentist's appointment." And of course, no poet is as enamored of local=

color: "The ghosts of glaciers drift / among those folds and folds of fir:=

spruce and hackmatack - / dull, dead, deep pea-cock colors, / each riser
distinguished from the next / by an irregular nervous saw-tooth edge." Yet=

no one else moves as easily or abruptly into the uncanniest registers of o=
ur
literature: "The iceberg cuts its facets from within"; "Everything only
connected by 'and' and 'and' "; "More delicate than the historians' are th=
e
map-makers' colors." None of this is difficult, but it's astonishingly sub=
tle
and strange. The more one reads a Bishop poem, the greater the sense of
huge forces being held barely but precisely in check - like currents
pressing heavily on the glass walls of some delicate undersea installation=
.
It doesn't seem as if the glass will break, but if it were to do so, we'd =
find
ourselves engulfed by what Frost (her truest predecessor) called "black
and utter chaos."

"Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke-Box" allows us to see the cracks that could
form on those crystalline surfaces. It's no criticism of this collection t=
o say
the virtues of Bishop's finished poetry - style and poise chief among them=

- are often missing from the writing gathered here. These are, after all,
pieces that Bishop herself chose not to publish, but found valuable for
some reason; as this volume's editor, Alice Quinn, poetry editor of The Ne=
w
Yorker, noted in a recent interview, "A big part of the pleasure and
understanding to be gained is in knowing what was on her mind during
those years and in discovering new phrasing of hers, new avenues of
vision." In addition to drafts of poems - some accompanied by photos of
the manuscript pages in question, all following Bishop's often handwritten=

versions as closely as possible - Quinn has gathered several prose
pieces, including an intriguing series of notes that begins, "Writing poet=
ry is
an unnatural act." Essentially, this is a book for two groups of people:
Bishop fans (most of the poetry world, that is), and the increasingly tiny=

group who still think this poet was an unambitious and slightly chilly min=
or
writer. The former will be grateful for the insight into her meticulous
process; the latter will have to acknowledge the enormous patience and
skill that allowed her to hold the volcanic feeling on exhibit here in the=

poised vessels of her finished poetry. Lest you think that's overstating t=
he
emotional content of these drafts, consider the presence of such decidedly=

un-Bishopian lines as: "I have suffered from abnormal thirst - / I swear i=
t's
true - and by the age / of twenty or twenty-one I had begun / to drink, &
drink - I can't get enough."

That shouldn't, however, be taken to mean that the poems here are all
unformed, lesser efforts. If some of this work is mostly of interest becau=
se
of what it tells us about Bishop's published writing, other pieces can sta=
nd
alongside anything The New Yorker got its hands on back in the 1950's or
60's. "Vague Poem" plays on a confusion between rock roses and rose
rocks; it concludes:

Rose-rock, unformed, flesh beginning, crystal by crystal,
clear pink breasts and darker, crystalline nipples,
rose-rock, rose-quartz, roses, roses, roses,
exacting roses from the body,
and the even darker, accurate, rose of sex -

This openly erotic approach is actually more successful than much of her
published love poetry, which is considerably less forthcoming. Equally
strong are several of the poems intended for a sequence called "Bone
Key," and parts of the later poem "Keaton," which has one of Bishop's
finest, saddest openings - "I will be good; I will be good." Quinn's notes=

throughout are superb. In glossing "Vague Poem," for example, she
meticulously connects a particular phrase to a speech given by Bishop in
1976, discusses the poet's interest in crystallography and includes anothe=
r,
earlier erotic fragment that recalls the more finished poem she is
annotating. This is the devoted editing this material needed and deserved.

A few days after her death in 1979, Elizabeth Bishop's obituary in The New=

York Times noted that she "enjoyed extraordinary esteem among critics
and fellow poets" but was "less widely known than contemporaries such as
Robert Lowell." One can only imagine how Lowell and Bishop, lifelong
friends, would have thought about the comparison. In any case, though,
things have changed. The world of contemporary poetry can be a fractious
place, but one thing almost everyone agrees on is the significance of
Elizabeth Bishop - and that's as it should be. Our greatest poets aren't
monuments to be looked at but grammars to be absorbed; however long it
takes, we speak through them and they through us. "When you write my
epitaph," Bishop once wrote to Lowell, "you must say I was the loneliest
person who ever lived." Lonely? Maybe once, but not anymore - and
never again.

Jazz alto saxophonist Jackie McLean dies at 73

HARTFORD, Connecticut --Jazz alto saxophonist Jackie McLean, a
performer and educator who played with legendary musicians including
Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins, died Friday. He was 73.

McLean, a contemporary of some of the 20th century's most famed jazz
musicians, died at his Hartford home after a long illness, family
members told The Hartford Courant.

McLean was founder and artistic director of the Jackie McLean
Institute of Jazz at the University of Hartford's Hartt School. He and
his wife, actress Dollie McLean, also founded the Artists Collective,
a community center and fine arts school in Hartford's inner city
primarily serving troubled youth.

University of Hartford President Walter Harrison said Dollie McLean
called him Friday with news of her husband's death.

Harrison said that despite his many musical accomplishments, McLean
was a modest man whose connections with his students lasted for
decades after they left his classroom.

"He fully understood the way that jazz as an art should be passed down
to students," Harrison said. "He saw his role as bringing jazz from
the 1950s and '60s and handing it down to artists of today."

McLean, a native of Harlem in New York City, grew up in a musical
family, his father playing guitar in Tiny Bradshaw's band. McLean took
up the soprano saxophone as a teen and quickly switched to the alto
saxophone, inspired by his godfather's performances in a church choir,
he told WBGO-FM in Newark, New Jersey, in an interview in 2004.

McLean went on to play with his friend Rollins from 1948-49 in a
Harlem neighborhood band under the tutelage of pianist Bud Powell.
Through Powell, McLean met bebop pioneer Charlie "Bird" Parker, who
became a major influence on the young alto saxophonist.

He made his first recording when he was 19 on Miles Davis' "Dig"
album, also featuring Rollins, which heralded the beginning of the
hard-bop style.

In the 1950s, McLean also played with Charles Mingus and Art Blakey's
Jazz Messengers, experiences that he credited with helping him find
his own style.

"I never really sounded like Bird, but that was my mission," McLean
said in the WBGO radio interview. "I didn't care if people said that I
copied him; I loved Bird's playing so much. But Mingus was the one
that really pushed me away from the idea and forced me into thinking
about having an individual sound and concept."

McLean made his first recording as a leader in 1955. He drew wide
attention with his 1959 debut on Blue Note Records, "Jackie's Bag,"
one of dozens of albums he recorded in the hard-bop and free jazz
styles for the label over the next eight years. His 1962 album "Let
Freedom Ring" found him performing with avant-garde musicians.

In 1959-60, he acted in the off-Broadway play "The Connection," about
jazz musicians and drug addiction. McLean, a heroin addict during his
early career, later went on to lecture on drug addiction research.

In 1968, after Blue Note terminated his recording contract, McLean
began teaching at the University of Hartford. He taught jazz,
African-American music, and African-American history and culture,
setting up the university's African American Music Department, which
later was named in his honor.

He took a break from recording for much of the 1980s to focus on his
work as a music educator, but made his recording comeback in 1988 with
"Dynasty," and later re-signed with Blue Note. His last Blue Note
recordings included "Fire and Love" (1998), featuring his youthful
Macband with son Rene McLean on tenor saxophone, and the ballads album
"Nature Boy" (2000).

He received an American Jazz Masters fellowship, the nation's highest
jazz honor, from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2001, and
toured the world as an educator and performer.

Joe, I read that first paragraph and...what?  If I’d wanted to write a parody of
a mainstream review of Elizabeth Bishop, I don’t see how I could do much
better.

It's an extreme form of a very typical claim, no?  A type of autonomy argument:
that the kind of writing which most apparently eschews all forms of direct
engagement with the political is actually the most powerful force there is for
social change.

Typically that writing is called "poetry"--as in, eg,  Yeats' "The Symbolism of
Poetry," which I was just looking at, where Yeats actually _argues_ a version
of this claim.  It takes some nerve to nominate a single poet.  It takes a
peculiar mixture of nerve and conformity to nominate Bishop.

That first sentence!  Orr looks at his own taste and sees the world:  a kind of
universalizing which, historically, marks bourgeois culture, here taking the
form of the smug reduction of the world to the pages of The New Yorker (in
which Alice Quinn’s been publishing those unfinished Bishop drafts and
fragments for what seems like years now…)

Hi Bob and others,
   Is there any poet there who speaks Portugese and is interesting in
translating some popular songs and writing some music liner notes for a
record company ?  This is a paying gig.

Nicholas,

I am not clear. Do you mean you think Bishop is not a good poet and should=20
not be published? If so, why don't you say so?

A more interesting argument underlying the New York Times essay is whether a=
=20
poem is an artifact, where the idea of perfection is crucial, or basically a=
=20
fluid process where different versions are part of a continuum.

Of course, both sides in the New York Times article are on the same side.=20
Even the ones supporting the publication of the "fragments" defend the act b=
y=20
differentiating them from "really unfinished" poems. There is no question th=
e=20
article belongs to another poetic universe where the idea of "imperfection"=20=
in=20
relation to a poem is inconceivable.

But I don't really see how this has anything to do with politics (poem as a=20
political force, and not the politics of poetry) or symbolism or Yeats.

It appears to me you are focusing on a politics of poetry, focusing on the=20
critics (Helen Vendler and Alice Quinn both belonging to the same side), rat=
her=20
than the process of the poem itserlf?

What difference does what The York Times thinks make, considering it have no=
t=20
contained too money worthy things about poetry (except by complete accident)=
=20
the last twenty five years?

Ciao,

Murat

murat, nick can defend himself, BUT you're too smart to fall into the
trap---which so many in these regions have fallen into---of
pooh-poohing concern for what the nytbr says...

poetry may be a lot of things, but one thing one cannot---or at
least, one ought not---dismiss out of hand, not in the 21st century,
not in this country or any other, is the effect upon poetry of our
institutions (and vice versa)... i know---many here would prefer to
wish this reality away... but wish upon a star as one may, the
institutional realities of poetry are here to stay...

yes, it rhymes...

so when david orr, or anyone else for that matter, pipes up as he has
in a news organ with the circulation of the nytbr, we need to take
heed... unless, that is, we want to pretend that this will have
nothing whatever to do with the reception of our work, or worse, that
the reception of our work has nothing to do with us...

it's not anything to lose sleep over perhaps, but orr's is a
controversial value judgment that will likely reach hundreds of
thousands of ears... and as poets, we should give a shit about
that... i think you know this, at any rate, so apologies for stating
the obvious...

best,

joe

Murat--

Was my reply really so hard to read?

"I am not clear. Do you mean you think Bishop is not a good poet and should
not be published? If so, why don't you say so?"

I do not think that Bishop is not a good poet, and therefore,
I did not say so!

Perhaps arguments about literary publishing might choose terms a little more
nuanced than those you propose?

Ah!--now I see your misunderstanding--two threads in play at once here.

I was talking about the first paragraph of Orr's review, in response to Joe's
post.  I wasn't addressing the Vendler/Quinn debate, and I remain uninterested
in that debate (except to observe that very few poets other than Bishop would
receive such treatment from a trade press, whatever we think of the quality of
those previously unpublished poems).  My interest is in this paragraph as
representing a certain kind of discourse about poetry.

Here's that paragraph again:

"You are living in a world created by Elizabeth Bishop.  Granted, our
culture owes its shape to plenty of other forces -- Hollywood,
Microsoft, Rachael Ray -- but nothing matches the impact of a great
artist, and in the second half of the 20th century, no American
artist in any medium was greater than Bishop (1911-79).  That she
worked in one of our country's least popular fields, poetry, doesn't
matter.  That she was a woman doesn't matter.  That she was gay
doesn't matter.  That she was an alcoholic, an expatriate and
essentially an orphan -- none of this matters.  What matters is that
she left behind a body of work that teaches us, as Italo Calvino once
said of literature generally, "a method subtle and flexible enough to
be the same thing as an absence of any method whatever."  The
publication of 'Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke-Box," which gathers for
the first time Bishop's unpublished material, isn't just a
significant event in our poetry; it's part of a continuing alteration
in the scale of American life."

I still maintain there's a typically bourgeois universalization of a particular
point of view at work here; and that Bishop, the New Yorker poet par excellence
even after her death, is the perfect vehicle for Orr's smug assertions.  And
surely it still matters to point this out--even, or especially, if we don't
expect the _Times_ to change?

[that's all for today, folks]

Corey,

  I was thinking same, which means I'm in agreement. One wonders, as least I do, why some choose to debate such pointless arguments whilst wearing their insular "sensitivity corp headdress" -- and everywhere I've been, including South America, I've been called an American (in addition to many other less flattering terms).

  And this reminds me of being in Northampton, just a week ago, and going to a both a restaurant and shop purported to be Tibetan orientated, let me say, and as I'm entrenched in this cause, I, of course, visited out of cynical interest. Well, the place was full of snooty fart faced I'm so into my self into this saying I'm caring folk. The thing is, however, and I learned this early on -- that the place was Nepalese owned (and Nepalese soldiers often shoot down Tibetan refugees "just to watch them die") -- and that shop was filled with Guatemalan-type things hidden behind the beneficent image of HH.

Tonya Foster & Joanna Fuhrman
Friday, April 7, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.

Tonya Foster joins us from New York City. Her work appears in the Subpress
anthology Free Radicals: American Poets Before Their First Books and she is
co-editor of The Third Mind: Creative Writing through Visual Art published by
Teachers & Writers Collaborative. From her poem "Cinematic Neurosis: An
American Journal": "A memory of a thing is only an idea/of the thing without
the shape/by which we recognize it—a mountain, an afternoon,/a blueberry, a
squat, a pause. You—"

Joanna Fuhrman also joins us from New York, in celebration of her new book,
Moraine, just out from Hanging Loose. The Wall Street Journal called her first
book, Freud in Brooklyn (2000), "an impressive first collection," and
Publishers Weekly called her second, Ugh Ugh Ocean (2003), "a major
advance...intellectually challenging...passionate and politically savvy." Her
poems have appeared in many journals and anthologies including Lit, New
American Writing, The New York Times, American Letters and Commentary, and
American Poetry: Next Generation.

It's obviously an overstatement to say that we (or I) am living in a world created by Elizabeth Bishop, which is what Orr said at the beginning of his review.  Nevertheless, I like her poetry a lot.  Although, perhaps because I read it long after I became formed as a poet, I don't feel I live in a world created by her, I nevertheless look forward to reading this "new" book of her poetry someday.  All the complaints made about the NYTBR's treatment of poetry are justified.  Nevertheless, it should be noted that poetry is more often reviewed now than it was in the past.  That doesn't do much for the hundreds or thousands of us whose work hasn't been reviewed, nevertheless, out of a sense of fairness, this improvement should be noted in this discussion.

Was my reply really so hard to read?

"I am not clear. Do you mean you think Bishop is not a good poet and should
not be published? If so, why don't you say so?"

I do not think that Bishop is not a good poet, and therefore,
I did not say so!

Perhaps arguments about literary publishing might choose terms a little more
nuanced than those you propose?

Ah!--now I see your misunderstanding--two threads in play at once here.

I was talking about the first paragraph of Orr's review, in response to Joe's
post. I wasn't addressing the Vendler/Quinn debate, and I remain uninterested
in that debate (except to observe that very few poets other than Bishop would
receive such treatment from a trade press, whatever we think of the quality of
those previously unpublished poems). My interest is in this paragraph as
representing a certain kind of discourse about poetry.

Here's that paragraph again:

"You are living in a world created by Elizabeth Bishop. Granted, our
culture owes its shape to plenty of other forces -- Hollywood,
Microsoft, Rachael Ray -- but nothing matches the impact of a great
artist, and in the second half of the 20th century, no American
artist in any medium was greater than Bishop (1911-79). That she
worked in one of our country's least popular fields, poetry, doesn't
matter. That she was a woman doesn't matter. That she was gay
doesn't matter. That she was an alcoholic, an expatriate and
essentially an orphan -- none of this matters. What matters is that
she left behind a body of work that teaches us, as Italo Calvino once
said of literature generally, "a method subtle and flexible enough to
be the same thing as an absence of any method whatever." The
publication of 'Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke-Box," which gathers for
the first time Bishop's unpublished material, isn't just a
significant event in our poetry; it's part of a continuing alteration
in the scale of American life."

I still maintain there's a typically bourgeois universalization of a particular
point of view at work here; and that Bishop, the New Yorker poet par excellence
even after her death, is the perfect vehicle for Orr's smug assertions. And
surely it still matters to point this out--even, or especially, if we don't
expect the _Times_ to change?

What is important about Bishop, regardless of the merit of her work =
which is
a debateable point, is that she was one of the first American poets to =
begin
a dialogue with Brazil.=20

If you look at important USA (American, United Stateian,Vespuccian) =
poets
there has been much more of a dialogue with Classics, Europe, France et
cetera than with Latin America.=20

Regarding poets and our place the fact is that money talks that is why =
other
forms get more press and more focus.=20

murat, thanks for your response...

i hear you re poetry... that discussion would perhaps take us to the
ways in which the institutions that support the literary arts are
generally resistant to change in ways that (for instance) the
institutions that support the visual arts are not (which isn't to say
everything on the visual side of things is peachy, either)... why
this is---well, a lot of institutional history at stake here...

as to the poet/critic stuff:  one of the problems is that bishop is
no longer with us, and orr is... note the teleology at work here, in
the final lines of orr's review:

"Bishop once wrote to Lowell, 'you must say I was the loneliest
person who ever lived.' Lonely? Maybe once, but not anymore - and
never again."

that "must say" reads oddly to me, but anyway:  presumably bishop
will never be "lonely" again b/c she'll have us, her admiring
readers, to keep her company... now, poetry is generally understood
as figuring a telos of presence, but to imagine that bishop's
apparent "loneliness" as a person will be redeemed (or figuratively
mitigated) by her future readers -- the critic is clearly giving
voice to his own version of presence, and reciprocity, our 'being
there' for bishop complemented by her 'being there' for us...
naturally, lowell figures into this happy little formulation (and
isn't anyone just the least bit surprised that lowell himself hasn't
been nominated as Greatest Artist In Any Medium 1950-2000?)...

someplace in the midst of such assertions is bishop's writing itself,
celebrated by orr for its "subtlety," which for orr "has less to do
with theory and technique, which can be
learned mechanically, than with style and sensibility, which require
intuition"... so we're to proceed by intuition then in exploring
bishop's "strange" and "unnerving" poetry?... is it intuition too
that guides (orr's) critical style and sensibility?... how
convenient!... never mind alla that theory/reception stuff...

well:  i've always liked bishop's work well enough, even though i've
never been able to get all worked up about it... but doesn't it
strike you as, well, convenient! and entirely predictable to read, in
nytbr, that our "greatest artist" is chock-full of restraint, as
opposed to, say, wild abandon?... and while we needn't make the
mistake that orr is making---confusing his pronouncements about
bishop with bishop's actual poetry---it's a fair question to ask
whether the kind of interpretive activity evidently demanded by
bishop's writing (per orr) doesn't reflect a rather narrowly defined
rhetorical attention on the part both of writer and reader...
sophisticated, ok, but also, perhaps, a relatively conservative
sensibility as to what a poem can be, finally, and in this sense,
perhaps, domesticated, if entirely literate...

which might open to that term, bourgeois---or might not... actually,
i like the point ray is making---about bishop and brazil...

anyway, bishop's is not my preferred poetic mode, and orr's is most
def. not my preferred critical-review mode... whether bishop is
apolitical, i'm not so sure, but i think we can all agree that, in
this regard, her writing is a far cry from much of, let's say,
ginsberg...

best,

I must say that when I read Orr's opening paragraph (quoted below), it made
me homesick for the fifties and sixties when reviewers aspired to make 'home
run' statements about a particular author (authors aspired to such, and
readers awaited for such as well). Authority and Author were conflated terms
and there was the illusion that a particular author could do the whole job.
At nineteen, I was hungry for that!  For awhile I am sure Norman Mailer
thought he 'was the one.'  Robert Lowell - for about 30 seconds - was
invested with that role (and then, apparently, had the good sense to doubt
it), and T.S. Eliot, etc. before that.  David Orr - in some kind of retro
mode - aspires to maintain that world of looking for and sanctifying an icon
before which institutional genuflection must ipso facto gather its ranks. If
one stands back, Orr's stance is both comic and sad and has really nothing
to do with the value of reading Bishop's work on its own terms, which are
not without value, but hardly the controlling, shaping factor in the 2oth
century aesthetics of any medium.

As to why the NY Times Book Review permits this kind of faux grandstanding I
have long stopped thinking about that.

I rarely visit the Poetics site, anymore, but saw this
thread and--after reading Orr's article--was gald to
find Prof. LoLordo's response to it, which is rather
close to what I might have said about it.  I've now
read several pieces by Orr.  Is he the worst current
mainstream writer on poetry?  Has he ever written
anything that indicates any familiarity with poetry
using techniques not in wide use by poets fifty or
more years ago?

Steve,
You should read her; she was really quite good at what she did.  I feel =
fairly safe at saying she was no real influence on my thinking, =
therefore, I feel safe in saying I don't live "...in a world created by =
Elizabeth Bishop," what ever the hell that exaggeration might mean.  But =
I also believe she possessed enormous talent.  That, and I think I would =
have liked her had I known her. =20

I've read through the official complete poems several times at the
behest of people I respect. I really don't get it, at all, and I
think I read with a fair degree of subtlety. I wouldn't mind if those
who do get it let the rest of us know, with examples, what they see
in the work.

That said, I probably would have liked her, too. I didn't think we
got to vote for Miss Congeniality, tho.

Mark,
I'm not exactly sure what it is you "...don't get it..."  about =
E.Bishop's poetry, so I don't know exactly where to take the point...

Far be it from me to say everything she ever wrote is worth reading, =
with the intended meaning of "worth" here in the sentence being: worth =
the investment of the time and effort it took to read the piece.  I =
dislike the poem, Cape Breton; it did nothing for me to help me return =
intellectually to the place I visited often, nor did I feel any of the =
poet's angst when I read through the piece again.   =20

But there were others poems I enjoyed reading; I came away from the =
experience feeling I'd learned something about how another person felt.  =
I enjoyed reading Argument for just that reason.  That, and I like the =
feelings from the metrics on the lines.  Have you read this one?
Alex=20


            Argument
              =20
    =20
              Days that cannot bring you near
            or will not,
            Distance trying to appear
            something more obstinate,
            argue argue argue with me
            endlessly
            neither proving you less wanted nor less dear.

            Distance: Remember all that land
            beneath the plane;
            that coastline
            of dim beaches deep in sand
            stretching indistinguishably
            all the way,
            all the way to where my reasons end?

            Days: And think
            of all those cluttered instruments,
            one to a fact,
            canceling each other's experience;
            how they were
            like some hideous calendar
            "Compliments of Never & Forever, Inc."

            The intimidating sound
            of these voices
            we must separately find
            can and shall be vanquished:
            Days and Distance disarrayed again
            and gone...=20

superficial, anything that I didn't know before I=20

That's my two missives for the day. I'll sit back and listen.

bell hooks: A Critical Companion

Over twenty years ago, bell hooks began generating scholarship that
helped to make colleges and universities places where ideas and social
commitment can exist alongside each other.  This essay collection aims
principally to show how the practical examples manifested in hooks' work
have been widely registered in a range of cultural contexts.  The
editors of this collection invite essays that address any aspect of the
many themes and genres that demonstrate hooks' influence: Self-Help,
Public Intellectualism, Black Feminism, Black People and Love,
Children's Stories, Pedagogy, Race and Popular Culture, Race and Visual
Art, Black Masculinity, Sexuality, Sociology and Race, Politics and
Race, Economics and Race, and Criminology.

How wonderful to read the marvelous poem "Argument" on this listserv where arguments proliferate sometimes beyond reason as the poem says.  This poem should be read by all the contributors who regularly participate in these arguments here.

In the past, like Mark, I didn't "get" Bishop, either. So I thought I'd
just try reading through this poem and see what I could make of it.

Initially, the line wants to be more-or-less spoken and ordinary, but can
not do so, i.e. stretches to two lines, setting up two forthcoming rhymes,
but with a very awkward stumbling in terms of the rhythm that sets it up.
So there's initially a counterbalance between "balance" and
"out-of-balance" (the tone with the rhythm) that I do take as telling me
something about the person writing and the structuring of world, a world
that here seems to want to be rigorously structured but so obviously is
not. This lack of perfect balance is there in the weird off-rhyme of "not"
with "obstinate" (both also rhyming in that they are sorts of negatives),
in the record-player getting stuck on "argue argue argue" -- yet the desire
for something more calm & secure present in the ending with "dear." Again,
this is highly qualified, with that line's overabundance of things taking
away from the "dear" -- "neither" and "nor," and "less" repeated twice. So,
to argue a bit with Mark, with whom I agree on a lot of things poetically,
I think the poem is a fairly unique presentation of world, a world trying
hard to stay coherent but not quite achieving it.

In the second stanza the writing, while highly controlled, sees the subject
spin somewhat out of control. I.e. what was earlier "distance" between two
individuals now becomes "Distance" in the sense of far vista. But what
could be a sort of romantic interlude, a bright spot or memory of security,
is "dim" and indistinguishable. Reason, too, which wants to hold, is at its
end. So the memory is entirely generalized, not specific at all. And the
ability to hold onto one's thoughts, particularly logic, has dimmed
equally. Here inner world reflected in outer world, except that outer world
is only what the imagination inarticulately casts out as hazy and undetermined.

Now, through a parallel structuring device, "Distance:" becomes "Days:" or
space becomes time. So we aren't in a Newtonian ordered world any more so
much as a post-Einsteinian collapsing space-time-fold, where individual
instruments that are supposed to be associated with individual facts are
now "cluttered" and cancel each other out. The radar, in other words, isn't
positioning us correctly, or perhaps at all, and our experience (or at
least how we thought it might be measured) really doesn't matter. The
calendar has become entirely disordered and time, instead of being
portioned out evenly, is divided into "Never & Forever," yet even that is a
corporation, "hideous."

> >

At the end, the voices, lost in the clutter and disarray, are back, and
though intimidating, "must" and "shall" be found and "vanquished." But
don't those words "must" and "shall" sound like the speaker is pumping
herself up, rather insisting that this has to happen than actually
believing it. Or, alternatively, it is in the act of argument that the
voices are disarrayed and must be righted again. But can they? And if/when
they can, will it be too late, i.e. will they be gone? Is the end of "days"
and "distance" death?

I think the brink of confusion, set up at the beginning, becomes a spiral
going more deeply into disarray, and recovery is not to be found in this
poem, though it may be desired, even insisted upon. The structuring of the
poem is about trying to structure the world (in Mark's terms), but it
doesn't work as a controlling structure, and in its way the insecurity of
this poem, embodied against its form (though the form gives way to the
insecure at times, too), provides the tension that keeps us here, involved,
reading.

Mark, I never "got" Bishop, either, and that's why I thought I'd just try
to read through this poem seriously. I may not have done it justice, but I
at least have worked through it in a way that makes it meaningful, and even
a really good poem, to me. So I think I can get Bishop, and she may not be
the poet I perhaps thought she was, but someone less predictable, more
uncertain

my first encounter with the cult of Elizabeth Bishop was the first day =
of
Daniel Halpern's poetry workshop; his assignment was to bring enough =
copies
for everyone of ten poems by ten different living poets that you *liked* =
(I
do this a lot for undergrads; it is a way for people to get a mini =
anthology
very quickly)  BTW it was understood that this assignment would be
difficult, and it was; not liking much of the poetry by live poets I'd =
come
across, I'd been reading mostly the poems of dead Russians

anyway, even though she was quite dead, Elizabeth Bishop was =
apologetically
included in several of the anthologies;  I used to like Bishop a lot -- =
I'm
a sucker for Florida poems, for titles that end "...and a Complete
Concordance."=20

The great light cage has broken up in the air,=20
freeing, I think, about a million birds=20
whose wild ascending shadows will not be back,=20
and all the wires come falling down.=20

are my favorite Bishop lines, about kissing.  I had come across her work
through Marianne Moore fandom; she was one of the few who visited Pound =
in
St. Elizabeth's; when she was ill in bed in Brazil, she used to send out =
for
six packs and throw the empties into the corners of the room, where they
gathered in piles -- what a wonderful world it could be!; I like her =
more
than I like her great friend Robert Lowell; her anthology of Brazilian =
poets
was one of the only ones before Douglas Messerli published his

Alice Quinn loves loves loves Bishop, and since Bishop refused to =
publish
much of her work, Quinn started republishing those poems in the New =
Yorker
years and years ago, the genesis of the recent book; she taught a grad =
class
on Bishop even though -- qualification???; most of the poems are not as =
good
as the ones Bishop chose to publish, which to me is just a further =
credit to
Bishop, but that she chose not to publish poems about sex and love with
women and about drinking -- well, she was a wealthy woman of her time

All best,

"There=B9s an absolute and direct connection between my poetry and my activis=
m
in that what I=B9m writing about is what I=B9m experiencing in the world. And
what I=B9m experiencing in the world right now is the disconnect between my
reality and the reality we hear in the mainstream media."

"So far Belowsky has been very pleased by his U.S. experience and his
collaborations with so many musicians. Still he insists the writing comes
first. =8CI never look to a musician,=B9 he says. =8CI never work to marry my
words to their music. I lead, they follow me with the music.=B9"
--from The Musician's Poet: Belowsky Blows Away All of the Competition by

"Historically speaking, the division between songs and poetry hasn=B9t always
been clear. Poetry owes its invention to the transcription of songs (even
the epic poems of Homer were originally sung)."

Eric Rosenfield

Our Printed Matter section, edited by Mark Lamoureux

"With the poem =8CIn=B9 Benka takes a two-letter word and expands on its

doesn=B9t normally see."
--Erica Kaufman on Jen Benka's a box of longing with fifty drawers
(Soft Skull Press).

"Rizzo appears to practice a form of aural Dadaism in which his linguistic
materials exist solely within the compressed space of a chaotic emotional
life; feelings that seek a broader field than he might, in a more conscious
and deliberate frame of mind, be capable of giving them."

			THE CELEBRITY RAG: Op 
			by Stan Rogal (Toronto)




"Only the freak endures" - John Berryman

This is an interactive piece in which celebrity names are encrypted into
the poems as homonyms.  There are also further clues & allusions to assist
in the uncovering.  See how many you can dig up.

Of course, as the celebrities either pass their 'best before' date or have
disappeared from the public forum altogether, the poems are constructed to
stand on their own.

Toronto writer Stan Rogal's ninth book of poems, Fabulous Freaks, was
recently published by Wolsak & Wynn. He also has two novels and three
short story collections as well as plays produced here and there across
Canada. His novel, As Good As Dead, will come out in 2007 from Pedlar
Press. A short play was accepted for a Festival in Toronto and was
produced in March 2006.

Although I feel few poets have bored me as much as Bishop,
there was a poem, called an "unfinished poem" in the New Yorker
an old friend of mine who LOVES Bishop, and has written on Bishop
was telling me about.  This old friend said it was a "scandal"  to
print this "unfinished poem" and of course I read it.  And it  was
the VERY FIRST Bishop poem I read and liked.  Liked a lot
actually, the mud the crystal, red.  Set in the desert, I don't
remember everything about it, but it was talking to some part
of me I hadn't expected.  And my friend HATED that I liked it,
accused me of wanting to be confrontational.  But I liked it,  and
now I can no longer say Elizabeth Bishop never wrote a poem
that didn't make me sleepy.

ALSO, even though I've never been a fan of her work, I have to
admit to very much liking her SAM, or, her criteria for a good poem:
Spontaneity
Accuracy
Mystery
the three things she said she looked for for making a poem WORK.
Can't say that I'd probably agree with her choices for SAM, but,
that's okay.  I like that those are her three things.

It's funny too how we came to know about this SAM.  Bishop had
apparently written in the margin of a page something about the poem
being SAM.  She had a parrot named Sam, and some scholars had
thought that the parrot had something to do with the SAM in the
margin of the page, but later it was discovered to be an acronym.
This sounds funny, like, WHAT COULD THE PARROT possibly
have to do with it, right?

Part of me also believes that if Bishop and Marianne Moore had not
been friends, maybe Moore would have also not been so boring.   It
upsets people when I say these things, but I can't help it!  I  really
have tried to like Moore.  Haven't tried so hard to like Bishop.   But
many people whose opinion I hold above most LOVE Moore and
think I'm an idiot for not also liking her, but she just makes me  shrug.
I believe Moore's edges were shaved off.  I firmly believe that  there's
an argument to be made that if she had not listened to Bishop over
and over that she would have STOPPED making her poems so fucking
digestible for "us".

dear Catherine, I'm very happy that you wrote,
"but that she chose not to publish poems about sex and love with
women  and about drinking -- well, she was a wealthy woman of her time"

This line of yours is valuable, as it's a truth I feel many of us battle  out
on
a daily battlefield.  Bishop was a dyke.  A dyke in hiding.   Even in poems.

Money, class, these are such crippling things to movements in justice
and I'm talking about Everyone's justice, not just for fags like me.
When a wealthy man -- for instance -- like Andrew Tobias is deep in  the
closet writing a book about his life under a pseudonym titled, THE  BEST
LITTLE BOY IN THE WORLD or whatever the hell it was called, just so
he can continue making piles and piles of money on Wall Street (not  to
mention the BIG SCORE with the book sales for his closeted gay self)
this is an arrow shot right on the mark, taking out Everyone.  Class  will
breed cowards for their money's sake.  Andrew Tobias comes Out  of
the closet in 2001 with his sequel THE BEST LITTLE BOY IN THE WORLD
GROWS UP, and we're all supposed to say OOoo, Wow, he's so brave!
Brave?  He's already made his millions, and by the way, it's  2001!!!!!

Elizabeth Bishop went to Brazil because she was afraid of herself.
That's the poem I want to read!!!!!  Forget her damn MOOSE  poems!
What about being alive HERE and being AFRAID of your very desire?
Afraid of what you body yearns for.  Who you want.  Who you get  with.
The dreary men of her era were writing all kinds of dreary things  about
their love for women, why the hell couldn't she at least write a  dreary
dyke poem?  But she did.  But did she WANT it to come out  later?
When it was safe?  So long as she didn't have to help make it  safe?
Like Andrew Tobias, while others were getting their heads cracked
open and busted by the cops, treated like criminals, he was making
piles and piles of cash.  But he's so brave now.  What a jerk he  is!

Wilde was not just a genius, he was a brave genius.  Which made
him a much better person, not without much suffering.  Saint  Oscar.

Megan,

Great news that some real poetry might grace the box. I hope you guys =
get
your due.

(But I do wonder what the reporters thought of the Gold Mine. And how do
they enter the Gold Mine and then go back to PBS and act as though
everything is normal? They had to at least pick up a disease, right?)

Looking forward to watching/hearing.

I'm a fan of both Bishop and a whole lot of the poetry more congenial to
most of the subscribers on this site.  Without apologizing for the literary
journalism of David Orr, or making a case for the value of Bishops's scraps
(I won't do either).  I do have to say that I find knee-jerk remarks like
"Bishop is boring" pretty sophomoric.  Do you all realize just how
provincial. And narrow-minded you sound?

I didn't say that, but I might have. Football also bores me. I
reserve the right (I think it's inalienable) to be bored by anything at all.

Why so defensive? Or do you find anyone being bored by anything
narrow-minded? (Look up provincial and sophomoric, while you're at
it. I don't think they apply).

OK, that's my two for the day, and I'm signing off for a couple of

Calling something "boring" is the typical anti-intellectual response of most
of my provincial sophomores.

And that's my two.

Megan,

Great news that some real poetry might grace the box. I hope you guys get
your due.

(But I do wonder what the reporters thought of the Gold Mine. And how do
they enter the Gold Mine and then go back to PBS and act as though
everything is normal? They had to at least pick up a disease, right?)

Looking forward to watching/hearing.

Kaufman, kicked-off the evenings' proceedings.

Eluard was joined by Jazz great, guitarist Harry Sterling, who also has been
at the forefront of combining elements of poetry & jazz in New Orleans for
many years, having spent his younger days mentoring under New Orleans legend
Danny Barker.

Moore was actually the older poet in that relationship.  It was Bishop who =
resisted/gave in to the influence.  Check out: Becoming a Poet: Elizabeth B=

the effort she exerted helping me feel what and how she felt during the =
argument.  And the metrics of the lines in the poem are both structured, =
precise, complete, yet mis-written, discordant, jumbled and tripping =
into each other at awkward line shift places.   Why is that?  Oh, Fuck =
it, it's because she's a boring poet trying to pass as straight. =20

For me, "Argument" says it all...whether I quibble with me over cheating =

  dear Catherine, I'm very happy that you wrote,
  "but that she chose not to publish poems about sex and love with
  women  and about drinking -- well, she was a wealthy woman of her =
time"
  =20
  This line of yours is valuable, as it's a truth I feel many of us =
battle  out=20
  on
  a daily battlefield.  Bishop was a dyke.  A dyke in hiding.   Even in =
poems.
  =20
  Money, class, these are such crippling things to movements in justice
  and I'm talking about Everyone's justice, not just for fags like me.
  When a wealthy man -- for instance -- like Andrew Tobias is deep in  =
the
  closet writing a book about his life under a pseudonym titled, THE  =
BEST
  LITTLE BOY IN THE WORLD or whatever the hell it was called, just so
  he can continue making piles and piles of money on Wall Street (not  =
to
  mention the BIG SCORE with the book sales for his closeted gay self)
  this is an arrow shot right on the mark, taking out Everyone.  Class  =
will
  breed cowards for their money's sake.  Andrew Tobias comes Out  of
  the closet in 2001 with his sequel THE BEST LITTLE BOY IN THE WORLD
  GROWS UP, and we're all supposed to say OOoo, Wow, he's so brave!
  Brave?  He's already made his millions, and by the way, it's  =
2001!!!!!
  =20
  Elizabeth Bishop went to Brazil because she was afraid of herself.
  That's the poem I want to read!!!!!  Forget her damn MOOSE  poems!
  What about being alive HERE and being AFRAID of your very desire?
  Afraid of what you body yearns for.  Who you want.  Who you get  with.
  The dreary men of her era were writing all kinds of dreary things  =
about
  their love for women, why the hell couldn't she at least write a  =
dreary
  dyke poem?  But she did.  But did she WANT it to come out  later?
  When it was safe?  So long as she didn't have to help make it  safe?
  Like Andrew Tobias, while others were getting their heads cracked
  open and busted by the cops, treated like criminals, he was making=20
  piles and piles of cash.  But he's so brave now.  What a jerk he  is!
  =20

One Less is a bi-annual literary arts magazine founded in December, 2004 by
writer David Gardner and writer/photographer Nikki Widner. The intent of One
Less is to offer a space for thought-inspiring literary and visual art
forms.

Robert Doto is Managing Editor of Parabola Magazine and runs the online
journal of mystic hermeneutical Islam Baraka Bashment
(baraka.progressiveislam.org). He is co-founder of Man experimental press
and spins dancehall/dub/reggae for Many Hills Massive Sound System in NYC.

Matthew Langley is the author of two books, (...) and A Very Mild Eternity,
which are available from Subday Press (subdaypress.org). His work has
appeared in Bombay Gin, el pobre Mouse, One Less, and on the web at No Tell
Motel. He has lived and taught in Prague and Seoul, South Korea, and resides
in southern Pennsylvania.

Sean MacInnes is the author of Critical Series and A Room Of Trees from
Subday Press. Over the last few years he has published several works in
various presses and was recently a writer in residence at The Kerouac
Project of Orlando, FL. He lives in Pittsburgh.

John Sullivan lives in the Boston area, where he works as a webmaster,
fundraiser, and writer/editor for a nonprofit defending intellectual and
creative freedom. His poems appear in magazines now and then, including
recently in Watching the Wheels: A Blackbird and el pobre Mouse. More of his
work can be found at www.wjsullivan.net

Andrew Phillip Tipton met Rachel Talentino in Savannah while working at The
Gap.  A common love for catchy melodies, Carole King, and boys led them to
Brooklyn.  As The Sparrows, Andrew and Rachel make up the cutest anti-folk
duo around! Simple and lovely.

I too have never understood why Marianne Moore is held in such high esteem by so many people.  Recently, I reread some of her anthology pieces and said to myself, "not bad".  But, given how much her work is admired that is pretty small praise.  Years ago it annoyed me for it's eccentricity and the faux-naif-nasty quality of the opening of "Poetry", her most famous poem.  Now, her work still doesn't move me much but at least I no longer find it annoying as I did when I was young.

It seems some of my facts about Bishop's personal life were  incorrect,
and I'm sorry about that.  Thanks to Catherine Daly for clearing that  up.

But to Mr. Flynn, for you to assume that anyone saying they are bored
with Bishop's poems is "knee-jerk" is to assume you know whether or
not her poems were read, maybe many times.  That's the case with  me,
as I have an old friend who thinks Bishop is the greatest poet of the
20th century.  And this friend would show me poem after poem in  hopes
of converting me.  The truth is that I had already read on my own  the
very poems my friend was making me read, and she just bores me.
There's nothing "knee-jerk" about it.  I'm bored.  Bored  SILLY!

Mr. Flynn I could say to you that because you might REFUSE to wear
a dress I designed by hand made of pink and yellow marshmallow Easter
bunnies is a "knee-jerk" reaction!  How dare you Mr. Flynn!  NOT  wear
my beautiful dress I spent hours and hours designing just for you!   You
see, but the difference is Mr. Flynn, that I actually TRIED to read  Bishop's
poems while YOU decided my dress would make you look fat, and you
didn't even BOTHER to try it on first!  Hmph!

Happy Easter Mr. Flynn, candy candy candy EVERYWHERE!

Subject:      Surreal Photography at SFMOMA
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Just yesterday saw San Francisco MOMA's exhibit of surreal photography - 250
pictures from the Collection and local collectors - shown in parallel with
the current Calder and Surrealism show (which I was too visually exhausted
to go look at yet).  (In the interests of objective partiality(!) I have to
confess that the photography show was partly curated by my partner, Sandy
Phillips).

If you want a deep immersion in the complex turns and obsessions - from
interiority to the street - in  20th century history of surrealism as
practiced by photographers, this show will probably do it - including
multiple pieces by Atget, Man Ray. Joseph Cornell - all the way up to Bruce
Connor, Cindy Sherman, Sherrie Levine (the 'pool table') - among many
others.

It is interesting to me how the 21st century can now simultaneously 'layer'
several levels of a particular history - and/or put them on the same playing
field. I suspect this conjunction of several historical points will end up
provoking another series and 'progression' or is it 'serial progression' of
new points.

It is one those exhibits that inevitably pushes one around! But, forgetting,
just to visually coast and perch variously on a wall of Atgets is both
'lush' and terrific.

Of course.  Somewhere between 2nd and 3rd bases is where it starts to

Dear writer, poet, translator and editor friends,=20

=20

Putting together information on publications regarding literature in
Japan is something Ive been doing since 1993 when i founded Living Room
which then piggy-backed on Printed Matter the journal. Then came and
went my column "Poetry Mignettes" in Japan Times, as well as my
installments for about.com's Museletter. Now you can find the latest
news on poetry in Japan at the site below. Please pass the site link to
others and also send publications to me if you'd like to have your news
listed. I seek more support for my "editorial" work and if you know of
any opportunities for what Iam doing (including teaching, translation,
publication and book projects), please let me know.=20

=20

Thanks for everyone's work and poesie which gives me something to muse
and write about. & also kudos for Ry Beville, translator of Nakahara
Chuya, who has invited me to post my listings on his very classy site.=20

In terms of the long poem, isn't there a Metcalf glove in the stands
reaching out to the long ball over the top of the left fielder's Wilson?

"A stand-up double" = code for poem.

Put that in your diamond, she said.

As pregame anthem, they thought they'd play
John Cage's "very long" composition -- which
resulted in a several-centuries delay . . .
Some concession stands appreciated the gambit.

Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.  I intended to say that "This is boring"
is not a very useful critical insight.   Here is a not very useful

It seems some of my facts about Bishop's personal life were  incorrect,
and I'm sorry about that.  Thanks to Catherine Daly for clearing that  up.

But to Mr. Flynn, for you to assume that anyone saying they are bored
with Bishop's poems is "knee-jerk" is to assume you know whether or
not her poems were read, maybe many times.  That's the case with  me,
as I have an old friend who thinks Bishop is the greatest poet of the
20th century.  And this friend would show me poem after poem in  hopes
of converting me.  The truth is that I had already read on my own  the
very poems my friend was making me read, and she just bores me.
There's nothing "knee-jerk" about it.  I'm bored.  Bored  SILLY!

Mr. Flynn I could say to you that because you might REFUSE to wear
a dress I designed by hand made of pink and yellow marshmallow Easter
bunnies is a "knee-jerk" reaction!  How dare you Mr. Flynn!  NOT  wear
my beautiful dress I spent hours and hours designing just for you!   You
see, but the difference is Mr. Flynn, that I actually TRIED to read
Bishop's
poems while YOU decided my dress would make you look fat, and you
didn't even BOTHER to try it on first!  Hmph!

Happy Easter Mr. Flynn, candy candy candy EVERYWHERE!

1-800-Flowers - this little, well made volume of poems by Robert Fitterman
(Designed and Printed by Benjamin Friedlander for "The Alliance of Pigs With
Wings") got delivered to my door the other day. I had missed hearing it read
at the Zukofksy Conference at Columbia (September 2005), and I think it was
maybe variously acclaimed on either the UK or UB list some months back(?).

I just want to say I found it a delight and, more than that, a seriously
compressed view of an approach to Zufkosfky - a little PM ironic as its
title - but much more an act of fidelity - not without question - with an
intense focus and studied interpretation:

Complex Emotion

toward the poor that is
to say if the poet's
compassionate emotion for the poor
cannot be finally determined it
nonetheless can be inferred from
his love of language his
consciousness of word combinations and
their constructions but can it

(In print the whole piece is italic, except for the last three words, a
question with a question mark. For all I don't know of Z, Fitterman may be
quoting here?)

The poem - at least to me - speaks to the question of whether or not the
Post-12 Zuk pretty much divorces the poem/poetry either implicitly or
directly from political engagement. The thrust of the question is whether or
not the labor of combining words is parallel - and in solidarity - with any
other kind of any other kind of constructive work (the act of putting things
together). And, conversely, to be without such work is to know poverty and
its suffering.  If the answer is yes - that this work of poetry is
legitimate and integral to labor in the broad sense of other kinds of work,
then it keeps, for example, the rest of A-13 on in the realm of the
socio/political engaged. And goes toward explaining what others may see as
the inaccessibility of A-22 and A-23 which are so fundamentally committed to
the constructive combination of words. Which also connects with Z's WPA
study and publication of works on American craft and design.

But that can also be said of Fitterman's work here - their sense of compact
craft, as in the making of poems with the presence of real
objects/constructs, practically physically and small enough to be portable
as in:

Seedling Where to, a Close Reading

10-slender rods spring seed sway
the digit 1 and 0
as stem-and-bulb blows the letter
s from word to work
pollinating each word-front-back blowing s
off seed from seeds and
onto sway not way nor
away as slender rods sway

(Again I cannot replicate italics here)

The minuteness of the attention, the music - it's a construct that I want to
keep coming back to - to enjoy and study.

Ben Friedlander made 300 of these booklets. No price, but I suspect one can
find Ben's email address - or write to 86 Grand Street, Bangor, ME 04401.

On the other hand, boredom is a high state, as

Dear Mr. Flynn, it's not up to you to decide what's a critial  insight.
If a poem is boring then maybe little more needs to be said.

Frankly, I'd rather eat broken glass then have to write a paper on
WHY Elizabeth Bishop bores me.  There are millions (literally)  of
poems, poets, books, anthologies, why on Earth would I spend
my time reading Bishop if I don't like her?  Life's too short!

Here's possibly a much more useful question then any of your
questions so far:  What's one of the things about Bishop  that
you feel sets her apart from so many other poets?

And another:  What poem of Bishop's you would ask any
stranger to read in order to have that stranger understand
your answer to the previous question?

CAConrad
-------------

By Jane  Smiley

Bruce Bartlett, The Cato Institute, Andrew Sullivan, George  Packer,
William F. Buckley, Sandra Day O'Connor, Republican voters in  Indiana
and all the rest of you newly-minted dissenters from  Bush's
faith-based reality seem, right now, to be glorying in your  outrage,
which is always a pleasure and feels, at the time, as if it is  having
an effect, but those of us who have been anti-Bush from day 1  (defined
as the day after the stolen 2000 election) have a few pointers for  you
that should make your transition more realistic.1. Bush doesn't  know
you disagree with him. Nothing about you makes you of interest  to
George W. Bush once you no longer agree with and support him. No
degree  of relationship (father, mother, etc.), no longstanding
friendly intercourse  (Jack Abramoff), no degree of expertise (Brent
Scowcroft), no essential  importance (Tony Blair, American voters)
makes any difference. There is  nothing you have to
offer that makes Bush want to know you once you have come  to disagree
with him. Your opinions and feelings now exist in a world  entirely
external to the mind of George W. Bush. You are now just one of  those
"polls" that he pays no attention to. When you were on his side,  you
thought that showed "integrity" on his part. It doesn't. It shows  an
absolute inability to learn from experience.


2. Bush doesn't  care whether you disagree with him. As a man who has
dispensed with the  reality-based world, and is entirely protected by
his handlers from feeling  the effects of that world, he is indifferent
to what you now think is real.  Is the Iraq war a failure and a
quagmire? Bush doesn't care. Is global  warming beginning to affect us
right now? So what. Have all of his policies  with regard to Iran been
misguided and counter- productive? He never thinks  about it. You know
that Katrina tape in which Bush never asked a question? It  doesn't
matter how much you know or how passionately you feel or,  most
importantly, what degree of disintegration you see around you,  he's
not going to ask you a question. You and your ideas are dead to  him.
You cannot change his mind. Nine percent of polled Americans  would
agree with attacking Iran right now. To George Bush, that will be  a
mandate, if and when he feels like doing it, because...

3. Bush does  what he feels like doing and he deeply resents being
told, even politely,  that he ought to do anything else. This is called
a "sense of entitlement".  Bush is a man who has never been anywhere
and never done anything, and yet he  has been flattered and cajoled
into being president of the United States  through his connections, all
of whom thought they could use him for their own  purposes. He has a
surface charm that appeals to a certain type of American  man, and he
has used that charm to claim all sorts of perks, and then to fail  at
everything he has ever done. He did not complete his flight  training,
he failed at oil investing, he was a front man and a glad-hander as  a
baseball owner. As the Governor of Texas, he originated one
educational  program that turned out to be a debacle; as the President
of the US, his  policies have constituted one screw-up after another.
You have stuck with him  through all of this, made excuses for him,
bailed him out. From his point of  view, he is perfectly entitled by
his own experience to a sense of  entitlement. Why would he ever feel
the need to reciprocate? He's never had  to before this.

4. President Bush is your creation. When the US Supreme  Court
humiliated itself in 2000 by handing the presidency to Bush  even
though two of the justices (Scalia and Thomas) had open conflicts  of
interest, you did not object. When the Bush administration adopted  an
"Anything but Clinton" policy that resulted in ignoring and  dismissing
all warnings of possible terrorist attacks on US soil, you went  along
with and made excuses for Bush. When the Bush administration  allowed
the corrupt Enron corporation to swindle California ratepayers  and
taxpayers in a last ditch effort to balance their books in 2001,  you
laughed at the Californians and ignored the links between Enron  and
the administration. When it was evident that the evidence for the  war
in Iraq was cooked and that State Department experts on the  Middle
East were not behind the war and so it was going to be run as  an
exercise in incompetence, you continued to attack those who  were
against the war in vicious terms and to defend policies that  simply
could not work. On intelligent design, global warming, doctoring  of
scientific results to reflect ideology, corporate tax giveaways, the  K
Street project, the illegal redistricting of Texas, torture at Gitmo
and  Abu Ghraib, the Terry Schiavo fiasco, and the cronyism that led to
the  destruction of New Orleans you have failed to speak out with
integrity or  honesty, preferring power to truth at every turn. Bush
does what he wants  because you have let him.

5. Tyranny is your creation. What we have today  is the natural and
inevitable outcome of ideas and policies you have promoted  for the
last generation. I once knew a guy who was still a Marxist in  1980.
Whenever I asked him why Communism had failed in Russia and China,  he
said "Mistakes were made". He could not believe that Marxism itself
was  at fault, just as you cannot believe that the ideology of the
unregulated  free market has created the world we live in today. You
are tempted to say:  "Mistakes have been made", but in fact,
psychologically and sociologically,  no mistakes have been made. The
unregulated free market has operated to  produce a government in its
own image. In an unregulated free market, for  example, cheating is
merely another sort of advantage that, supposedly,  market forces might
eventually "shake out" of the system. Of course, anyone  with common
sense understands that cheaters do damage that sometimes cannot  be
repaired before they are "shaken out", but according to the  principles
of the unregulated free market, the victims of that sort of damage  are
just out of luck and the damage that happens to them is just a sort  of
"culling". It is no accident that our government is full  of
cheaters--they learned how to profit from cheating when they  were
working in corporations that were using bribes, perks, and  secret
connections to cheat their customers of good products, their  neighbors
of healthy environmental conditions, their workers of workplace  safety
and decent paychecks. It was only when the corporations began  cheating
their shareholders that any of you squealed, but you should know  from
your own experience that the unregulated free market as a  "level
playing field" was the biggest laugh of the 20th century. No
successful company in the history of capitalism has ever favored  open
competition. When you folks pretended, in the eighties, that  you
weren't using the ideology of the free market to cover your  own
manipulations of the playing field to your own advantage, you may  have
suckered yourselves, and even lots of American workers, but  observers
of capitalism since Adam Smith could have told you it wasn't going  to
work.

And then there was the way you used racism and religious  intolerance
to gain and hold onto power. Nixon was cynical about it--taking  the
party of Lincoln and reaching out to disaffected southern  racists,
drumming up a backlash against the Civil Rights movement for the  sake
of votes, but none of you has been any less vicious. Racism might  have
died an unlamented death in this country, but you kept it alive  with
phrases like "welfare queen" and your resistance to affirmative  action
and taxation for programs to help people in our country with  nothing,
or very little. You opted not to take the moral high ground  and
recognize that the whole nation would be better off without  racism,
but rather to increase class divisions and racial divisions for  the
sake of your own comfort, pleasure, and profit. You have used  religion
in exactly the same way. Instead of strongly defending  the
constitutional separation of church and state, you have  encouraged
radical fundamentalist sects to believe that they can take power  in
the US and mold our secular government to their own image, and get
rich  doing it. The US could have become a moderating force in what
seems now to be  an inevitable battle among the three monotheistic
Abrahamic religions, but  you have made that impossible by flattering
and empowering our own violent  and intolerant Christian right.

You have created an imperium, heedless of  the most basic wisdom of the
Founding Fathers--that at the very least, no man  is competent enough
or far-seeing enough to rule imperially. Checks and  balances were
instituted by Madison, Jefferson, Franklin, and the rest of  them not
because of some abstract distrust of power, but because they  had
witnessed the screw-ups and idiocies of unchecked power.  You
yourselves have demonstrated the failures of unchecked power--in  an
effort to achieve it, you have repeatedly contravened the  expressed
wishes of most Americans, who favor a moderate foreign  policy,
reasonable domestic programs, a goverrnment that works,  environmental
preservation, women's rights to contraception, abortion, and a  level
playing field. Somehow you thought you could mold the imperium  to
reflect your wishes, but guess what--that's what an imperium  is--one
man rule. If you fear the madness of King George, you have no  recourse
if you've given up the checks and balances that you inherited and  that
were meant to protect you.

Your ideas and your policies have  promoted selfishness, greed,
short-term solutions, bullying, and pain for  others. You have looked
in the faces of children and denied the existence of  a "common good".
You have disdained and denied the idea of "altruism". At one  time, our
bureaucracy was full of people who had gone into government service  or
scientific research for altruistic reasons--I knew, because I knew
some  of them. You have driven them out and replaced them with
vindictive  ignoramuses. You have lied over and over about your
motives, for example,  making laws that hurt people and calling it
"originalist interpretations of  the Constitution" (conveniently
ignoring the Ninth Amendment). You have  increased the powers of
corporations at the expense of every other sector in  the nation and
actively defied any sort of regulation that would require  these
corporations to treat our world with care and respect. You have  made
economic growth your deity, and in doing so, you have accelerated  the
power of the corporations to destroy the atmosphere, the oceans,  the
ice caps, the rainforests, and the climate. You have produced CEOs  in
charge of lots of resources and lots of people who have no more  sense
of reciprocity or connection or responsibility than George W.  Bush.

Now you are fleeing him, but it's only because he's got the  earmarks
of a loser. Your problem is that you don't know why he's losing.  You
think he's made mistakes. But no. He's losing because the ideas  that
you taught him and demonstrated for him are bad  ideas,
self-destructive ideas, and even suicidal ideas. And they are  immoral
ideas. You should be ashamed of yourselves because not only have  your
ideas not worked to make the world a better place, they were  inhumane
and cruel to begin with, and they have served to cultivate and  excuse
the inhumane and cruel character traits of those who profess  them.

That's really sad. Kaprow was an excellent writer too. I liked the things he
wrote about Jackson Pollock, and the transcripts of directions for the
happenings he created are fascinating to read.

In '99 I participated in a workshop he facilitated at Mills College, and
that was great. One of my favorite moments was when he paired people up: one
person drew a line on the ground with a piece of chalk, and the other person
erased the line.

The following brief notice - from David Antin and the family of Allan

Kaprow - announces the death of our longtime friend and neighbor:



"Today Allan Kaprow, Master of the Happening, the radical artist whose
work transformed the nature of art making forever, died peacefully in
his home in Encinitas, California. Beginning as a painter, his work
from the late fifties and early sixties, his spectacular and
theatrical environments and performance pieces, overran the capacities
of galleries and museums, as his increasingly austere psychological
and spiritual pieces from the seventies on managed to elude all but
the eager audiences who increasingly became participants and
collaborators in the work.  He leaves behind his wife Coryl and son
Bram, and Anton, Amy and Marisa, his children with his former wife
Vaughan Rachel."

I have an interview with Sparrow in Rain Taxi's spring 2006 online edition.

Here are a few lines from my intro: "His recent book America: A Prophecy--The
Sparrow Reader is a rip-roaring collection of Sparrow's various political,
cultural, literary, and spiritual writings. In his brief essays, and even
briefer poems, Sparrow's originality and persistence is clear. He writes
proverbs, bumper stickers, essays on the charms of spam email, and oddly
insightful political commentary."

Sparrow is joy and surprisingly poignant.

BIODOME

Snow thickens the light
through which tamarins plunge.

When I last went
she was still alive.
This is true of many places.

Sometimes a lone man sketches.
Sometimes a woman carries a child.

This is not the difference between life and imagination.

Even the briefest distance is divisible.

1. I seem to have lost Edmund Berrigan's contact information, has
anyone got it? You, Edmund, or Anselm, if you're listening?

2. So long as I'm on the horn here, I don't suppose in all the bustle
of Bishop that anyone noticed the Lehman piece in the Times? Two
poetry articles in one book review, it's some kind of movement.

The decision of High Court judge Smith to reject the case against
Dan Brown is fantastic!  How messy such a case would have been
making the future of art, poetry, and yes (snooze) novels too.

Imagine FLARF and its creator Gary Sullivan.  Well, not that
anyone's proposing million dollar lawsuits against poets these days,
but still, it's kind of GREAT to see a case work out where someone
gets to say, "LISTEN, WHAT THEY CLAIM I REWORKED IS REALLY
MY RESEARCH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"  And why not!?

Another thing, what a bunch of cry babies the authors of THE HOLY
BLOOD AND THE HOLY GRAIL are!  That book has SKYROCKETED
in sales BECAUSE of Dan Brown's book!  Whining millionaire scum!

Has anyone read the DaVinci Code by the way?  I loathe religion, and
despise its followers, so, I'm not interested in the book in any way.
HOWEVER, I've been fascinated by the explosion of christian
fundamentalists who freak out at the concept of a book of fiction
about Christ.  At least that's the word I'm hearing.

To be honest though, Brown NOT being sued is more important, at
least for me it is.  Not that he's sharing any of his wealth with  me.
Although it would be smart of me to contact him for a donation to

I don't think of most of the books being bantered about as being a "long poem" at least not if we are still staying with the notion / definition. A serial poem has breaks, for example Simon Perchik's Collected, five to 600 poems, each separated by an asterix that are all part of the same piece. It is not a long poem tho, like Frank Stanford's The Battlefield where the Moon Says I Love you.

  On EPOS, a list on the long poem that Miekal ran some time back, we decided on a few other distinctions, and following those categories Skip Fox's books _What Of_ and the new one (follow up) from Adahada would fall into the area of serial poems, not a long continuous poem. Also on EPOS was a big list created of long poems (continuous) and serial poems that if that list was archived would be well worth posting here if Miekal is able. (does this still exist?)

  For recent long poems, I read Ivan Arguelles Madonna Septet, about a 800 pager published by Peter Ganick and while I never asked Ivan if it is finished, at the least, it is the best example of the current long poem. And, to answer, I read it jumping around, the form, it's snakyness, begged for it.

Is the 'long poem' synonymous with the serial poem?
Is it just a question of semantics that denotes a difference
in how they are designated?
Joe Conte does a great explication of the long poem in postmodernity
in his 'Unending Design'.
Is it just the nature of a continuing, evolving structure and/or =
separate=20
discrete
volumes that designates the difference, as in let's say Nichol's=20
'Martyrology' or
Silliman's 'The Alphabet'? And mentioning Peter Ganick, he has written =
some
wonderfully diverse long poems that are difficult to fit into 'any'=20
category.
So maybe it is a constant evolution and change that cannot be nailed =
down=20
until
enough time has passed and we can view it in retrospect. What do you =
think?

BRUCE BEASLEY!

Bruce Beasley! Your book still sits unread on my shelf
as it has since 1988! I have to admit! It was Halpern's blurb
that scared me most! "The abundance of phlegmatic
narrative"! Then there's the black and white author photo!
You look too thoughtful! And yikes, those loafers!
Then there's the fourth line of the first poem!
"A pink scab along the bottom of each bloom"!
I do not like poems that refer to pink scabs on bottoms!
Just as a general rule, mind you, Bruce Beasley!
And later in the same poem! "You can smell it on every bush!"
Smell what though! I bet you'll tell us! Ah yes!
"This hankering to get born"! That's such a weird word!
"Hankering"! I am hankering to put your book back!
I wonder if this first edition is worth anything by now!
I don't mind just leaving it on my shelf though! It's OK!



+ + + + + + +

There are more poems on my blog! This is just one of them!

I've renewed my Mets Sunday plan for the 2006 season and I thought I'd see
if any of you might be interested in buying any tickets (and get the poetic
mojo by sitting in the same place where Jim Behrle, Jordan Davis, and
Jean-Paul Pecqueur have sat in years past). I've been sitting in the same
section for the past eight, now nine, years--mezzanine, sec. 2 (behind home
plate). I have two tickets for each game (prices below are per pair), and
they're under the overhang, so u don't get burned in the sun or wet in the
rain.

If you're interested in buying any tickets you can email me here. (Note that
the Mets charge different prices depending upon the opponents and the date,
so you'll see, for example, that the Marlins game costs more than the
Brewers game.)

hope this finds you well (and lets go mets!)

as ever,
david

New Yorker which surmised in the Independent (London) url above which
begins:=20

Bush administration 'secretly plans air strikes' as it seeks regime change
in Iran=20
By Raymond Whitaker
Published:=A009 April 2006

The Bush administration has sent undercover forces into Iran, and has
stepped up secret planning for a possible major air attack on the country,
according to the renowned US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh.
While publicly advocating diplomacy to stop Iran from pursuing a nuclear
weapon, Hersh reports in the next issue of The New Yorker magazine that
"there is a growing conviction among members of the United States military,
and in the international community, that President Bush's ultimate goal in
the nuclear confrontation with Iran is regime change...".

I know this will sound very comfortable to everybody! This guy is beginning
to look and act like Dr. Strangelove without clothes! Impeachment, it now
clearly seems, cannot happen too soon. And I would not doubt more radical
moves that will be destructive - unfortunately - for all of us.

This regime is getting too dark for words.

Of course not.

All you have to do is to go back and read what was said by the
inventors of the serial poem,
Spicer, DSunxcan and Blaser.

I understand the history of the serial poem, but does that negate the
evolution of its
nature? Once the idea of the serial form was conceived doesn't it follow
that it will transform
itself and will morph into an ever-changing form as time and personal
opinion dictate?

I suppose that depends on whether one hopes to define the serial poem as
based, for example, on correspondences and amplifications, and the  long
poem as based on episodic extensions. Each poet, of course, may choose
different terms to frame the question. A long serial poem also seems
possible, so it may serve us better to write some than to quibble.

I agree. I'd rather write it and let someone else worry about defining it.

I don't ever recall seeing a short serial poem.
Unless Spicer's "Red Wheelbarrow" can be called short.
The manuscript uses up quite a few pages in a scribbler.

Well, why not, if you are making something else, give it a name,

ABOUT THE FLARFLIST COLLECTIVE
Launched in May of 2001 by six poets, the Flarflist Collective is dedicated
to the exploration of “the inappropriate” in all of its guises. Poets mine
the Internet with odd search terms then distill the results into often
hilarious and sometimes disturbing poems, plays, and other texts.

ABOUT THE DREW GARDNER POETICS ORCHESTRA
The Poetics Orchestra is an ensemble conducted by poet and musician Drew
Gardner. His conduction system uses hand signals, tone cards, and rhythmic
forms to shape collective improvisation. The system is related to that of
Butch Morris, though simplified, and with the addition of tonal systems. It
also owes something to the tradition of new music which includes the
recitation of text- esp. Harry Partch, Robert Ashley and Rzewski. The group
always includes poets, who are conducted right along with the musicians
using the same system. The idea is to unite poetry and music in a
collaborative sprit.

has anybody else read the small item under this title in today's NY Times
Arts section?  I'm curious to know what the survey questions looked
like.  But I'll be grateful to the survey for one thing -- with these
results, maybe we can finally bury the cliche that poetry is only read in
college classrooms.

Small Press Traffic is pleased to present a reading by
Christine Hume & Shanxing Wang
Friday, April 14, 2006 at 7:30 p.m.


Christine Hume joins us in celebration of her 2004 book, Alaskaphrenia (New
Issues), which received a Book of the Year Award from Small Press Traffic. The
Board’s citation reads, in part: “… the wildly talented Christine Hume hits
her stride about two lines into the very first poem, then never lets up all
the way to the roller-coaster finish…we find a lucid, warm, disjunction which
welcomes the mind and the body to join in as one, several entrances to each of
her splendid rooms.” Hume’s earlier book, Musca Domestica (Beacon Press,
2000), won the Barnard New Women Poets Prize.


Shanxing Wang joins us from New York in celebration of his first collection,
Mad Science in Imperial City, just out from Futurepoem. Lyn Hejinian calls it:
“ a work of genius. It is intended to be so, and it is saturated with the
melancholy and exhibits something of the fear that genius in its machinations
may produce. The book is also comic, sometimes desperately and more often
happily so; the forces of genius are multiple…. [This book] proceeds through
involutions and across equations to create an astonishingly original counter
to the catastrophe of the contemporary world.”


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to SPT members,
and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of the Arts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &
Wisconsin)

I am no Biblical scholar, but with the revelation about this Judas Gospel, I
am wondering why no one has played up the Judas/Scooter Libby connection.
I mean Libby has spilled the beans on both Cheney and Bush to Fitzgerald,
the Justice Department's special counsel on this Valerie Plame case.
But, as with Judas, can't we see Libby's behavior as not that of a
self-serving  snitch, but as someone who is also involved in the production
of a miracle - in this case, the resignation or impeachment of both Bush and
Cheney.
I suspect both of them - for all their professed love and emulation of
Christ's will - will probably reject the opportunity to go out nailed to a
cross -  but Adobe Photo Shop in the hands of the Christian right, I
suspect, will come up with those details.

It will be interesting to see if democracy gets this miracle and/or
alternatively a distracting 'little' nuclear heave-ho in Iran.

In the meantime, go-Hispanics, go Latinos. A real breath of fresh air.

Everly optimistic!

chap10: Nascent Fashion - Larissa Lai


MODL Press is pleased to announce the long-delayed re-publication of Larissa
Lai's stunning political long poem Nascent Fashion.

"a kiss is just a kiss
we judas our guatanamo's ancient longing
clues accumulate to be ignored
war rages while cause evaporates
we street our puppets
bully proof vests
against all the vietnams in the world"

Previously self-published, Nascent Fashion is a poem cycle of elusions.
Politically charged, Lai's fiery hits sink the battleships that anchor in
how we use language to commit violence instead of communicate. These poems
are not a call to arms but a call for change.

Larissa Lai is the author of two novels: When Fox is a Thousand and Salt
Fish Girl. She is currently a writer-in-residence at Simon Fraser University
in Vancouver.

Produced in an unnumbered edition of 75. Battleship cover produced by Travis
Murphy printed in colour w/ faked full bleed. 30pp. 4.25" x 11". $10.00

Mills College’s 580 Split is holding a release party to celebrate the
launch of its eighth issue, featuring readings by Mary Burger, Michael
Heald, Kevin Immanuel, Rae Paris, Erika Figel Roliz, Nina Schuyler, and
Gordon Torncello, as well as the photographs of Stephan Babuljak.

580 Split Release Party
Thursday, April 27, 6-9 pm
Elbo Room, San Francisco

580 Split is a literary journal focusing on innovative and risk-taking
fiction, creative non-fiction, poetry, and art. Issue 8 features work
by Bruce Andrews, Edwin Torres, Daniel Alarcon, Mary Burger, Mark
Yakich and Anthony Doerr, as well as fiction contest winner Michael
Heald and poetry contest winner Molly Albracht Sierra, and an interview
with William T. Vollmann.

For information about purchasing copies of 580 Split, please visit our
website at www.580split.com.

Not far from our office at Mills College in Oakland, California, the 580
Split is a risky jumble of ramps, overpasses, and interchanges, where
highways cross, merge, intersect, and branch out in every direction.
580 Split, an annual journal of arts and literature, is both the
convergence and divergence of many roads: a place of risk and
possibility. Michelle Simotas is Managing Editor, Nina LaCour is Prose
Editor, Loretta Clodfelter is Poetry Editor, and Laura Davis is Design
Editor.

I think your mom is in some ways very fragile. The voluntary implosion  of orgasm, impacted; the voluptuous clip. Our wooden Sweetleaf grinder  rips pungent buds to sliver-shake, to be rolled. Ah, the older I get,  the more I need gender. Then I use a Graphix cigarette-rolling machine.

  Megumi despairs of ritual, which relates or boils down to or signifies  erosion, one of the many ways you and I are fucked by weather. It comes  into our bedroom as we sleep; its mouth is open, but there's no sound,  just the pale shear of its cold flesh shelling moonshine in pink grunt  ripples. Sometimes after midnight it's possible to swim the air, so  thick with silence, I'm wiping it on my pants. These are done, Megimi:  ripped by kittens and ripped by kittens.

 It takes believing  in that cry, the one whose sour fingers curl raucously around your  throat as you're singing. I fuck in the sun all day long as long as  Megumi, and her hunger pawing my brain bats bastard outlets across  someone else's cold floe.

 I think your mom is in some ways  yawning, blinking tiny girl-eyes so she can see more clearly what I  wish. I think your mom watches us sleeping, and maybe she forgives me  if I choke once in a while. I know those blank fattened arches fall  with leaving everything behind you; I know I love.

  My hands around my throat, wringing out kisses.

Wide Slumber for Lepidopterists

By a. rawlings

Coach House, 111 pages, $16.95

The Theory of the Loser Class

By Jon Paul Fiorentino

Coach House, 84 pages, $16.95

Lemon Hound

By Sina Queyras

Coach House, 103 pages, $16.95

Toronto's Coach House Press, once the hub of the burgeoning Canadian
literary scene, where young future icons like Michael Ondaatje and Anne=

Michaels first published poetry, is now home to Canada's best neo-dadai=
sts,
post-feminists and post-postmodern deconstructionists. This spring, Coa=
ch
House offers three new titles that seek to define the latest in our
nation's poetic avant-garde.

"A hoosh a ha."

These not-quite-words float in the middle of a blank page -- the openin=
g of
a. rawlings's Wide Slumber for Lepidopterists. On the next page, "a hoo=
sh a
ha," "a hoosh a ha," is scattered five times. The page after that adds =
a
few more, then a few more, until the last page of the section is nearly=

black with these onomatopoeic brushes of wings. The simultaneous sonic =
and
visual representation of butterfly flight works perfectly, bringing us =
into
both the formal and thematic concerns of the collection, capturing both=
 the
fluttering subject and attention of the reader with lightness and grace=
.

Wide Slumber then moves through six sections that explore states of sle=
ep
in counterpoint with the life cycle of lepidopterae, the order of insec=
ts
that includes butterflies and moths. The egg state is compared to insom=
nia,
the movement from egg to larva is set against dyssomnia (trouble fallin=
g
asleep), and so on until the emergence of the adult insect is offered a=
s a
kind of awakening.

Rawlings spins filamental connections between insect modes of being and=

states of sleep by excavating the scientific and sensual language aroun=
d
each concept, then using the page to orchestrate back-and-forth movemen=
ts
between her two interests. Her experimental placement of the text in bl=
ank
space, here forcing the eye to flit from word to word, there forcing th=
e
reader to dig for whole words among clusters of letters and phonemes, m=
akes
the reading experience itself mimic the fluttering, beat-beat motion of=

both flight and electroencephalographic waves.

The unexpected juxtaposition of these two realms of animal experience i=
s
interesting enough, but rawlings's ability to reproduce, using the most=

clinical terms, the to and fro of a frankly copulative energy pulsing
through both worlds is often breathtaking. Vulva rhymed with larva,
parallels of penis to proboscis -- this is one cool collection, a fresh=

combination of unashamedly brainy and unabashedly horny.

Jon Paul Fiorentino's fourth poetry collection, The Theory of the Loser=

Class, aims to "document the tribulations and insecurities of everyone'=
s
inner geek" and to map "inner states of urban ennui." Even if we all do=

have an inner (or not-so-inner) geek that could use validation, the
"psychic terrain of abjection" this book maps may not be one all reader=
s
will be able to lay claim to.

The title of the book plays on economist and sociologist Thorstein Vebl=
en's
most famous work, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Veblen, who coined t=
he
term "conspicuous consumption," made the observation that while every
society necessarily values tools and skills that support life processes=
,
every society also perpetuates a status structure that values people
according to their ability to display their own distance from productiv=
e
labour. Veblen becomes a character in a poem, imagined both as a suburb=
an
kid once known by the poet, and as theoretician referenced in support o=
f
the angry poet's apprehension of himself at the losing end of the
consumerist status game.

Interestingly, The Theory of the Loser Class is Fiorentino's least
accessible poetic work to date. His style has moved further and further=
 to
the abstract end of the spectrum with each of his collections, but so f=
ar,
the general reader willing to do a little work has always been allowed =
into
his self-interrogations. Though still often playing the smartass,
Fiorentino has until now spoken as a relatively humble fellow member of=
 a
larger population reliant on pharmaceuticals and mass culture to numb
itself against the friction of social intercourse. Now, however, he's
"tak[ing] the piss with Von Humboldt . . . exert[ing] shun tactics, dar=
k
leisure, snob method."

Loser Class's heightened abstraction would be fine if abstraction were =
left
to move us as it does best: through impression, mood and sensual affect=
.
However, one still senses a rhetorical urge in this voice, an urge to
convince that loses its persuasive power by refusing, for the sake of a=

rarefied aesthetic ideal, to reason out its points.

Ironically, Fiorentino's diction and terms of reference reproduce,
textually, the very display of distance from labour that would brand hi=
m at
least a partial winner in Veblen's status economy. Perhaps that's the
point: to appreciate the text is to become a member of the consolation
elite, comprised of those who conspicuously waste time and education on=
 a
poetry of syntax ruptures.

Fiorentino is smart and deft; I just don't buy the self-loathing. His
argument may well work for those who prefer their high culture apologet=
ic
rather than decadent. I find Fiorentino most winning when at his most
playful. I'll forgive much of the guy who calls Amway and Safeway
salespeople "Amwegian" and "Safewegian," and who invents the adjective
"Winnipeggiest."

Of these three titles, Sina Queyras's collection Lemon Hound shows the =
most
restraint, achieving a lovely balance between lyricism and experimental=
ism,
all the while unfolding a fierce intellectual and imaginative engagemen=
t
with the work of Virginia Woolf.

A master of the short sentence, Queyras writes prose poems that are
deceptively simple to read. The book opens with a visit to a lake, rend=
ered
in clear, descriptive language that seems born out of the West Coast ly=
ric
tradition: "Balsam poplar, tamarack -- they all look the same from the
window. Jack pines feed on fire, she reads, and wonders if this is all
second growth." But this is the lucid moment before the dreaming starts=
,
before she goes under surfaces to "enter into, finally; [and] tongue th=
is
idea of who she is."

Water waves are an image entry point to the waves of imagination and me=
mory
to which the poet is about to surrender. Queyras builds poems by layeri=
ng
images one atop the other, by echoing and repeating phrases -- "If you
embrace all, oarlock and tidal. If you look for light, spleen, splint."=


Sound and image settle like sediment into dense blocks of text. The rea=
der
is led through nuances of mood: Some journeys are spirals that return y=
ou,
somehow changed, to where you began; some are incremental, where one li=
ves
a thousand small details inside a brief moment. The overall effect is t=
onal
and painterly; I was reminded of Mark Rothko's colour layered on colour=
.

Like Woolf in her poetic novel The Waves, Queyras is not after story, o=
r an
argument, or a static statement on womanhood or personhood. Whether in
sketches of girls and mothers or in imaginings of Woolf's childhood,
Queyras writes to share a profound sense of witnessing. Her problem is
purely poetic: to represent in language the embodied depth of the moder=
n
moment, to capture the simultaneity of many truths and sensations happe=
ning
at once, and to do this using the gestures and commonplaces of real lif=
e.
She takes a hypnotic, almost hallucinatory approach, and succeeds.

Sonnet L'Abb=E9's forthcoming second collection of poetry is Killarnoe.=
 She
teaches creative writing and poetry at the University of Toronto.

Toronto's Coach House Press, once the hub of the burgeoning Canadian
literary scene, where young future icons like Michael Ondaatje and Anne
Michaels first published poetry, is now home to Canada's best neo-dadaists,
post-feminists and post-postmodern deconstructionists. This spring, Coach
House offers three new titles that seek to define the latest in our
nation's poetic avant-garde.

"A hoosh a ha."

These not-quite-words float in the middle of a blank page -- the opening of
a. rawlings's Wide Slumber for Lepidopterists. On the next page, "a hoosh a
ha," "a hoosh a ha," is scattered five times. The page after that adds a
few more, then a few more, until the last page of the section is nearly
black with these onomatopoeic brushes of wings. The simultaneous sonic and
visual representation of butterfly flight works perfectly, bringing us into
both the formal and thematic concerns of the collection, capturing both the
fluttering subject and attention of the reader with lightness and grace.

Wide Slumber then moves through six sections that explore states of sleep
in counterpoint with the life cycle of lepidopterae, the order of insects
that includes butterflies and moths. The egg state is compared to insomnia,
the movement from egg to larva is set against dyssomnia (trouble falling
asleep), and so on until the emergence of the adult insect is offered as a
kind of awakening.

Rawlings spins filamental connections between insect modes of being and
states of sleep by excavating the scientific and sensual language around
each concept, then using the page to orchestrate back-and-forth movements
between her two interests. Her experimental placement of the text in blank
space, here forcing the eye to flit from word to word, there forcing the
reader to dig for whole words among clusters of letters and phonemes, makes
the reading experience itself mimic the fluttering, beat-beat motion of
both flight and electroencephalographic waves.

The unexpected juxtaposition of these two realms of animal experience is
interesting enough, but rawlings's ability to reproduce, using the most
clinical terms, the to and fro of a frankly copulative energy pulsing
through both worlds is often breathtaking. Vulva rhymed with larva,
parallels of penis to proboscis -- this is one cool collection, a fresh
combination of unashamedly brainy and unabashedly horny.

Jon Paul Fiorentino's fourth poetry collection, The Theory of the Loser
Class, aims to "document the tribulations and insecurities of everyone's
inner geek" and to map "inner states of urban ennui." Even if we all do
have an inner (or not-so-inner) geek that could use validation, the
"psychic terrain of abjection" this book maps may not be one all readers
will be able to lay claim to.

The title of the book plays on economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen's
most famous work, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Veblen, who coined the
term "conspicuous consumption," made the observation that while every
society necessarily values tools and skills that support life processes,
every society also perpetuates a status structure that values people
according to their ability to display their own distance from productive
labour. Veblen becomes a character in a poem, imagined both as a suburban
kid once known by the poet, and as theoretician referenced in support of
the angry poet's apprehension of himself at the losing end of the
consumerist status game.

Interestingly, The Theory of the Loser Class is Fiorentino's least
accessible poetic work to date. His style has moved further and further to
the abstract end of the spectrum with each of his collections, but so far,
the general reader willing to do a little work has always been allowed into
his self-interrogations. Though still often playing the smartass,
Fiorentino has until now spoken as a relatively humble fellow member of a
larger population reliant on pharmaceuticals and mass culture to numb
itself against the friction of social intercourse. Now, however, he's
"tak[ing] the piss with Von Humboldt . . . exert[ing] shun tactics, dark
leisure, snob method."

Loser Class's heightened abstraction would be fine if abstraction were left
to move us as it does best: through impression, mood and sensual affect.
However, one still senses a rhetorical urge in this voice, an urge to
convince that loses its persuasive power by refusing, for the sake of a
rarefied aesthetic ideal, to reason out its points.

Ironically, Fiorentino's diction and terms of reference reproduce,
textually, the very display of distance from labour that would brand him at
least a partial winner in Veblen's status economy. Perhaps that's the
point: to appreciate the text is to become a member of the consolation
elite, comprised of those who conspicuously waste time and education on a
poetry of syntax ruptures.

Fiorentino is smart and deft; I just don't buy the self-loathing. His
argument may well work for those who prefer their high culture apologetic
rather than decadent. I find Fiorentino most winning when at his most
playful. I'll forgive much of the guy who calls Amway and Safeway
salespeople "Amwegian" and "Safewegian," and who invents the adjective
"Winnipeggiest."

Of these three titles, Sina Queyras's collection Lemon Hound shows the most
restraint, achieving a lovely balance between lyricism and experimentalism,
all the while unfolding a fierce intellectual and imaginative engagement
with the work of Virginia Woolf.

A master of the short sentence, Queyras writes prose poems that are
deceptively simple to read. The book opens with a visit to a lake, rendered
in clear, descriptive language that seems born out of the West Coast lyric
tradition: "Balsam poplar, tamarack -- they all look the same from the
window. Jack pines feed on fire, she reads, and wonders if this is all
second growth." But this is the lucid moment before the dreaming starts,
before she goes under surfaces to "enter into, finally; [and] tongue this
idea of who she is."

Water waves are an image entry point to the waves of imagination and memory
to which the poet is about to surrender. Queyras builds poems by layering
images one atop the other, by echoing and repeating phrases -- "If you
embrace all, oarlock and tidal. If you look for light, spleen, splint."

Sound and image settle like sediment into dense blocks of text. The reader
is led through nuances of mood: Some journeys are spirals that return you,
somehow changed, to where you began; some are incremental, where one lives
a thousand small details inside a brief moment. The overall effect is tonal
and painterly; I was reminded of Mark Rothko's colour layered on colour.

Like Woolf in her poetic novel The Waves, Queyras is not after story, or an
argument, or a static statement on womanhood or personhood. Whether in
sketches of girls and mothers or in imaginings of Woolf's childhood,
Queyras writes to share a profound sense of witnessing. Her problem is
purely poetic: to represent in language the embodied depth of the modern
moment, to capture the simultaneity of many truths and sensations happening
at once, and to do this using the gestures and commonplaces of real life.
She takes a hypnotic, almost hallucinatory approach, and succeeds.

Sonnet L'Abbé's forthcoming second collection of poetry is Killarnoe. She
teaches creative writing and poetry at the University of Toronto.

Hey, all, I've been way behind in making sense of the press' place in my li=
fe. I'm planning on putting together the second volume by the end of the su=
mmer. I have many great contributions but am looking to expand the wealth.

Below is the call. I'm posting a deadline of June 1, 2006 so I can have a s=
ense of time and space. Please e-mail all subs!

PO25centEM zines are pocket sized zines that will be handed out individuall=
y AND serialized with=20
other zines in the series to make an 'autonomous anthology.' So far we have=
 numbers one through=20
31 available, but single copies are always floating around and being traded=
: they are handed out=20
in Baltimore and in Washington, D.C. The pocket sized zines are compact and=
 are 16 pages or less,=20
making for an intimate read while waiting for the bus or the train, or just=
 lazing the day away.=20
The jist of this project is to get everyone to read more poetry. We're hand=
ing out free poetry to=20
recover the sense of readership in a public that seems to not care about po=
etry. Folks may keep or=20
give the zines away to others, so the turnover rate is unlimited, trading g=
oes on forever.

Furniture Press needs all the texts it can get. We're bent on publishing ev=
ery writer and=20
anthologizing this project: we're hoping to receive substantial funding and=
 a national coverage.=20
Hopefully other presses will start doing the same.

The goal, for now, while funding is low, is to serialize the zines and sell=
 them as 'autnomous anthologies'.
These contributions will go to the pressing of more zines for a wider distr=
ibution.

Here are the specifications for submission:

The zines dimensions are 4.25 inches by 5.5 inches. Send texts between 8 an=
d 16 pages that fit=20
nicely onto a 4 inch width by 5 inch height format. Please send texts to=20
furniture_press@graffiti.net. No titles are necessary, any work, old and ne=
w is welcome.

Send submissions to this e-mail address.=20

Anyone who would like the first volume of the series, please send $12 to:

Christophe Casamassima
304 A7 Stevenson Lane
Baltimore, MD 21204

make checks payable to yours truly.=20

Thank you! Spread the word!

incitement. During the second half of the show the floor will be opened =
for
questions from the audience.

Please note the time change from our normal schedule: doors open at 7:45
p.m. and the reading/recording will begin by 8:15 p.m. =96 please do =
your best
not to arrive late, so as to minimize the sounds of shuffling &

This article
(http://www.poetryfoundation.org/foundation/initiative_poetryamerica.html)
highlights the Poetry Foundation's bizarre use of its superabundance of
funds thanks to that huge endowment a few years ago.

This quote from the article--"In keeping with the Foundation's mission to
invigorate poetry's presence in our culture, the study focused on the
potential audience as well as the existing audience. Are there factors that
make one person a lifelong reader of poetry and the next person indifferent
to it? What are the barriers that keep people from reading poetry, and how
can they be eliminated?"--should make the PF people with the combinations to
the bank vaults think to hire more teachers, but instead they embark on an
across the nation poetry memorization & recitation project, culminating in
the Poetry Out Loud CD. I think young people would engage more with poetry &
be more likely to become "lifelong readers" if more money was directed
toward programs that help young people to engage in lively discussions &
analysis about poetry, and then more creative opportunities were put in the
forefront -- for poetry writing, public works type projects (such as
Berkeley's Addison Street Project), contests, etc. Rather than monolithic
memorization projects. We already live in a time where the federal
government wants everyone to mirror what they tell the media. Poetry
programs could/should provide active alternatives to that kind of dead air
environment.

yeah, i think we should be talking about that "scientific study"...
it's interesting, but:  two years ago the nea came out with their
study (READING AT RISK) to warn us that people in the u.s. weren't
reading (weren't reading literature, that is)... now along comes the
poetry foundation, and conducts its study of READERS, coughing up
what seem to be somewhat rosier results... but here's the pertinent
passage in this regard, from the "Report Summary":

"It is important to remember, when reading this report, that we did
not interview the general population of adults. We spoke with a
sample of adult readers, a group of people who are different in a
number of important ways from the general population."

so they divvy up their sample of 1000+ adult readers (all of which
resultant data was statistically weighted to account for this &
that---ok) into what they call the "poetry audience" (in the report
itself they're called "poetry users") " and the "potential audience"
(or "poetry non-users"---yes, poetry as an addiction), the latter
consisting of readers who read for pleasure but who haven't read or
listened to poetry in the past 5 years or more... now, if you read
the actual poetry foundation report, they do indeed discuss the nea
study... the poetry foundation used less restrictive criteria in
deciding what a reader is---they didn't assume, like the nea, that a
reader is someone who reads only literature for pleasure (they incl.
newspapers, magazines, and nonfiction, and even a few people who only
listen to poetry but don't read for pleasure)...

at any rate, even by widening the definition of reader, the
foundation rather sidesteps the sticky issue of what to do about all
of those presumed non-readers---or, people who don't read for
pleasure---about whom the nea is so worked up... sure, the nea study
is not w/o its problems, that much is clear... but it's also clear
that what the poetry foundation has learned from this study does not
necessarily refute that age-old claim that no one listens to poetry
(regardless of how false the latter may be)... that 94% of readers
have read poetry at some time in their lives tells us very little,
finally, about the percentage of readers who read for pleasure who
regularly read poetry for pleasure (wasn't the nea number something
like 7% [of literary readers]?---i forget)...

here are two stats that jumped out at me, in any case:  women account
for 62% of all poetry users, men for 38% (roughly the same as the
percentages for all readers generally)... and whereas 45% of poetry
users are likely to write poetry, only 1% of poetry non-users have
written poetry as adults... if correct, this latter is a staggering
statistical difference, and it tells me that writing poetry might
well be driving the reading of poetry among users...

but that's just for starters...

Dear Poetics List,

I have been informed by our Tech Support here that they will shutdown
our server for several hours. In the event of email bounce-back, please
understand the technical difficulty and accept my apologies. They have
agreed to perform their maintenance during hours when we are least
likely to receive email from the Western Hemisphere. I am sorry if any
bounces occur. I have also informed the list admin. I hope there are no
problems, but I know very little of these things.

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 12 pieces by Carlos Luis.

Science has taught us that the building blocks of matter are smaller
than the atom. Carlos Luis's research indicates that the building
blocks of language are smaller than the letter. Come taste the fruits
of that research.

Enjoy,

Statistics:

Who reads poetry? Here are some stats on some book sales over time;

Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass		1856 Sales 200 Copies
William Carlos Williams, Paterson	First Printing 900 Copies
Anna Akhmatova, Requiem			Published as Samizdat, 200 Copies
Emily Dickinson, Poems 			Most Never Published or read in her
lifetime

I think the issue is not who reads poetry.
It is what poetry is read and the impact it has.

There is lots of poetry read in the USA but it is Chicken Soup for the Soul,
Billy Corgan, Hallmark Christmas Poetry Books these books are just
entertainment. But my question is which book of poetry that has been
published will resonate? Which book will in 100 years be read like the
Wasteland is now as a defining book of our time?

These are the copies issued in the printing, aren't they? The actual
"sales" number may be much lower.

"Which book will in 100 years be read like the Wasteland is
now as a defining book of our time?"

Is it?  Read, or even a defining book of our time?

It seems that "soup-for-the-soul" collections of poetry ARE
defining works.  What else speaks so well for the pseudo-
psychologisms and anti-intellectualism of this culture?

Gabriel,

nice.  Is this a new rendering of yours?
Based on other English translation(s)?
Or on some study of the Sanskrit or Pali?

And the number of readers may be much higher--
unless, of course, the books self-destruct after a first
reading. And wouldn't THAT boost sales?

A LOOK AT THE DOOR WITH THE HINGES OFF

(Poems from the mid-1960s)

by Michael Heller

from A Note on the Poems:

"I try to re-imagine what went into these poems, the experimental
climate of those days, love of Weburn's pointillist music, the
background, not yet fully formed, in my love of poets like Williams,
Creeley, Oppen, Olson, Zukofsky.  Heady days, lighter days--looking
back we can always find signs of where we've been.  But I also find
in these poems, portents of an open, hopeful futurity."

About half a decade back, I threw in some effort, as part of a poetry
research project of my own, to find out which English language poetry
book written in the 20th century sold the most. The data I gathered
is far from complete (don't know how much trust one could put on all
of its sources), but I did make an attempt to reach poetry publishers
in USA, England, Australia, NZ, India, South Africa and a few other
countries where English language poetry books are printed and sold.

The data shows Lawrence Ferlinghetti's "A Coney Island of the Mind"
sold the most - more than a 1.2 million copies worldwide.

The english translation of Rabindranath Tagore's "Gitanjali" (Song
Offerings) came close with about a million copies. 3.5 million copies
of the original Bengali language collection were sold between 1910
and 2000.

Both books are still selling.

sells in english.

Interestingly, I saw about 5 copies of that book at my town's public
library's book sale this past weekend and last month, at the Planned
Parenthood annual book sale in Des Moines, there had to be no less
than 12 copies.

I doubt if such data could be found online. I had to get in touch

with dozens of printers worldwide. The City Lights website proudly

proclaims that it alone have sold more than a million copies of

A Coney Island of the Mind.



Tagore is like a Shakespeare in the non-english domain. So those

numbers aren't surprising. If you include the arabic-speaking world,

Gibran must have sold in millions too. It depends a lot on how widely

a language is spoken. I was told by an Estonian poet that nearly

every Estoninan home contains a poetry book - at least one, but

Estonian isn't a very widely spoken language.

it seems clear that they would like to use their money to replace =
chicken
soup for chickens with x

because they want to be a dominating discourse (not expecting to be a
dominant one)

the questions aren't about what people like in the way of poetry or how =
they
use poetry (with the success of hallmark, etc., it is obvious:  as =
gifts, as
comfort -- thoughtful exchanges, some content based, some not) but how =
to
shove poetry Wiman et.al. think appropriate down people's throats.  =
"How,
where, and when to reach out," "audience development," etc. being more
administrative catch phrases than "finding the audience where it is," =
and
"coordinating with the other arts and pop culture, and etc."  it would =
be
supremely unfortunate in my view if this leads to some sort of two week =
high
school curriculum about meter and stand up poetry in order to catch =
every
teenager at exactly the moment that s/he is most open to poetry and turn
them off forever... and then offer a number of collections that go well =
with
herbal tea when you're going through a rough patch...=20

how about Hallmark.  talk about poetry entrepreneurs.  anyway to become =
a
Hallmark, a Thomas Kinkaid, if you realize modernism happened?

all best,

wondering, what is the percentage of men who've published books of
poetry vs. women who've published books of poetry?

that's a good question... the study says this about
*perceptions*---and it would seem that perceptions are accurate
insofar as poetry readers go:

"The majority of respondents indicated that both poets and poetry
readers could be male or female, were of no particular age, and no
particular race. However, when adult readers do ascribe physical
characteristics to poets and poetry readers, they have very different
perceptions of what these groups look like. Among those respondents
who chose a particular physical characteristic to describe most
poets, the image of poets that emerges is fairly stereotypical. They
agree that poets are more likely to be old or middle-aged, white men.
In comparison, the only physical characteristic that was attributed
to poetry readers with significant frequency was gender. Respondents
believe that poetry readers are more likely to be women."

Let's get pataphysical

CHRISTIAN B™K

Shift & Switch:

New Canadian Poetry

Edited by Derek Beaulieu, Jason Christie and Angela Rawlings

Mercury Press, 192 pages, $9.95

Shift & Switch is an anthology of contemporary, experimental poetry,
written by young (under 40) poets. The book attempts to redress a
recurrent oversight in our literary history by showcasing the work of
upstart writers who do not subscribe to the lyricism of the personal
anecdote, but who instead aspire to extend the boundaries of expression
into unusual regimes of linguistic innovation. Such poets often go
underexposed, if not unrecognized, in this country.

Derek Beaulieu, one of the three editors, argues that, for far too long in
Canada, lyric poems of both "confession and reflection" have become
"flattened into a sameness," reiterating the same forms of nostalgia in
the same tones of quietude. But despite this monochrome, stylistic
sensibility, most anthologies of poetry in Canada have portrayed such
traditional verse as the most progressive genre, marginalizing alternative
varieties that question the limits of such linguistic convention.

Jason Christie, another of the editors, argues that many anthologies of
poetry in Canada have concerned themselves with definitions of cultural
identity (usually defined in opposition to the literary legacies of both
North America and Europe). But while the writers in this collection are
Canadian, their aesthetic interests extend beyond national concerns:
"Their nationality is not a distinguishing feature of their poetry." Such
poets subscribe to an eclectic ensemble of marginalized, cosmopolitan
styles.

Angela Rawlings, the last of the editors, reiterates some of these
polemical arguments in a manner far more flamboyant in tone, suggesting
that if the "cacophony" of this anthology has any cogent, poetic agenda,
it must reside in its "enthusiasm for questioning what a poem may be." The
anthology thus juxtaposes varied genres, all influenced by a smorgasbord
of avant-garde writers, including, among others, concrete poets, feminists
and pataphysicians, language poets, oulipians and conceptualists.

Greg Betts, for example, has submitted excerpts from If Language, a
collection of correlated paragraphs, each one a lengthy anagram that
completely recombines the letters from another passage by poet Steve
McCaffery. Betts even goes so far as to permute McCaffery in order to
requote Shakespeare, thereby rearranging the word
"Honorificabilitudinitatibus" into "Hi ludi, F. Baconis nati, tuiti orbi,"
a Latin phrase found in 1910 by the scholar Edwin Lawrence-Durning, who
used this anagram to attribute authorship of the plays to Bacon.

Jordan Scott, on the other hand, submits excerpts from his poem Blert, a
work that attempts to turn the linguistic impediment of his stutter into
the basis for a poetic genre. He gathers words that use phonemes too
difficult for him to pronounce because of his stammer, and then recombines
these glottal phrases into sound poems that, when performed by him, engage
his body in a powerful struggle for expression -- a kind of "mandible
chatter, a gatling hopscotch:/ herring clatter buccal cove, yokel coconut
acoustic."

Sharon Harris also offers excerpts from her project Fun with Pataphysics,
a work that explains poetry in the kind of low-tech lingo found in kids'
science classes. Harris rewrites science manuals, replacing a key word
such as "Earth" with another word such as "poems," so that, when asked,
"What would happen to the world as we know it, if poems were hollow?" she
discovers that, "We would be in danger of death by suffocation, thirst,
frying, starving, freezing, and drowning -- in that order."

Chris Fickling is among the many visual poets showcased in this anthology,
all of whom generate pictures from letterforms, producing texts meant to
be seen more than read. Fickling, for example, arranges letters on the
page in such a way that they reproduce celebrated paintings from the
history of art, including The Birth of Venus, by Botticelli, and Starry
Night, by Van Gogh. Such witty texts illustrate the degree to which the
"imagism" of poetry has always had to compete with richer, visual
traditions in the world of art.

Critic Carmine Starnino has already complained that the poets in this book
exist in "a state of permanent adolescence," unaccountable to the more
mature, more formal nuances of official lyricism. But his jibes at the
avant-garde have always struck me as an expression of the fear that
posterity is going to punish his generation of lyric poets for their lack
of imagination.

While this anthology does arise from the exuberance of youthful editors,
ready to break from the decorum of editorial protocols (going so far as to
include examples of their own work, which is quite respectable in
quality), the anthology nevertheless sets, in most cases, exemplary
standards of excellence for its selections, and such work certainly
provides a "core sample" of innovation in our literature. You may not yet
recognize many of the poets in this provocative compilation. Chances are
you soon will.

Christian B”k's work, Eunoia, won the Griffin Poetry prize.

I had the following questions regarding Buddhism and I would like to state
that I do not ask them to discredit the religion and its followers. I have a
sincere respect for the peace and beauty of Buddhism, especially in the
modern world. These questions are prompted from discussions I have had they
made me question the nature of my perceptions.

1) Are their examples of "Buddhist Atrocities" where religion was the
motivating factor? I am aware of atrocities against Buddhists and I have
heard rumors of atrocities done by Buddhists. I ask because someone I was
talking about claimed that Buddhists never ever committed atrocities in the
name of religion.

2) I heard from a convert to Tibetan Buddhism that the Dali Llama once had
slaves, is this true?

If possible, please give sources. Thanks and God bless,

Ian,

This is, merely a somewhat generalized answer.
I am not an expert in all the ins and outs of Asian history
over the past 2600 years (though I have studied something
of that history at a generalist and/or undergrad level).

Allowing that different people may have different definitions
of what comprises an "atrocity," still your framing of the
question presumably implies (especially) such activities as
the waging of wars, violence to persons, killing and maiming
And the like, yes?  The generalization that such actions have
not much been committed in the name of Buddhism per se, seems
probably correct.  Buddhism and Jainism are conventionally=20
understood as the two 'isms (among the so-called great religions)
that place the steepest premium on non-harm-of-others as a
central precept.  Admittedly, Judeo-Christian traditions do
have pesky things such as "Thou Shalt Not Kill" enshrined amid
their literature; but apparently some kind of loophole has kicked
into play at certain points in cultural history (as in, like,
nearly everywhere).  The Buddhists have been less successful at
finding such a loophole, or more successful at not finding one.

As for slaves and the Dali Lama [note single L -- Llamas are
another story] -- I think what you relay sounds like a garbled
version of the commonplace observation that there were said to
have been serfs (peasant farmers) under the authority of the
central government at Lhasa, who would pay (presumably grain)
tribute to The Patola (ultimately run by the Dalai Lama).
Perhaps somebody equates serfdom with slavery, though this seems
a muddled equation.

But as said, I am not up on all details, and do not know what
grievances somebody somewhere may have voiced.  On the face of it,
I a bit wonder whether the story you relay may not have origins in
Chinese Communist party rumor-mongering?  I'm sure s Tibetan
scholar could give a much better and clearer answer.

One could say that Buddhism on the whole seeks to shift the focus
of conflict away from the outside world and into the realm of the
individual practitioner's own mental awareness.  The same could be
said of other traditions as well.  But for various reasons, there
have not been a lot of Buddhist conquests etc.  Unless it can be
said that Genghis Khan was marauding in the Buddha's name? . . .

No doubt any sweeping statement will generate some embarrassing
exception.  So the quest for sweeping statements maybe needs some
interrogation of its own.

cheers,
d.i.=20

i am a big fan of buddhism and try to learn what i can about the
practice.  i have heard, though, that buddhists have played a violent
role in the civil war in sri lanka over the years.  i'm not sure what
the ethnicity/religion axes of the conflict are; that is, if religion
and ethnicity are bound together, or not, so that the two cannot be
meaningfully separated in determining what is at stake in the armed
conflict.

ps it's Dalai Lama...

hi everyone,

i'm getting ready to go to romania for a class on contemporary
society, art and politics.  i'm wondering if anyone out there lives in
either Bucharest or Sibiu which is where i'll be most of the month of
May and early June.  After I'm travelling to the Czech republic to
meet my family that still lives there and then on to Budapest and then
Berlin.

my focus for the class will be the investigation of experimental
writing (any "form", poetry, plays, fiction, cross genre, online, etc)
and for this i'm hoping to meet some folks in either Bucharest or
Sibiu (romania) who could help to inform me.

if you're out there, backchannel me at egvajda at gmail dot com so
that we can possibly meet!

or, if you're not in Romania but have some ideas on people to look for
or places to go, backchannel me that info, too.

thanks for your help!

best
grace vajda

david,
sort of a new rendering. i studied pali once upon a time, but this is
based on the original and some renderings by Thanissaro Bhikkhu,
Ñanamoli Thera, the Amaravati Sangha, Piyadassi Thera, and Acharya
Buddharakkhita. so it's like a compilation. just a very thrown together
hodgepodge. but this is one of my favorite suttas and i want eventually
to do a stronger rendering of it.

Then she'll come home and release her new album, tentatively titled Feeling=
s
Up the Wazoo. She's very excited for this chance to pay homage to Chrissie
Hynde, who had such a large influence on not only Phoebe's bangs, but the
bangs of her entire generation.

The Leader is a bass and drum duo with plenty of harmony. A little country,

The Sewing Circle is a musical collective centered around
keyboardist/multi-instrumentalist Preston Spurlock, with frequent
collaborations from his first cousin Chase McGuire. The project started in
West Palm Beach, Florida in the summer of 2003. Since then, they have
recorded two full albums and are currently working on a third, and have had
several live performances. The Sewing Circle specializes in songs about
cryptozoology, extinction, and sleep.

It's Erika Simonian=B9s unique combination of talent and personality that
critics have repeatedly celebrated about her. Having been compared to Liz
Phair for her straightforward lyrical tone and Aimee Mann for her
songwriting craft, Simonian continues to defy the stereotypes of the female
singer/songwriter with her prickly sense of humor and her characteristic
air-and-light-infused delivery. There's something in that voice--a cat and
mouse playfulness--that lets you know that Simonian's in control even when
she seems most vulnerable.

As far as I know Buddhism has few if any "atrocities".  There is an interesting case I would like to check out.  Apparently, according to two Thai movies I've seen about this event, there was a war between the Burmese and the Thais in the 16th or 17th century in which monks participated in the fighting force.  You might ask, can you trust movies as historical record, but since I've seen it twice, I'd like to check it out.  Since taking life of any kind is against the precepts Buddhist monks take when they ordain, this would run contrary to that if anyone was killed by Buddhist monks in this conflict.  Does anybody know anything about this war?  I actually don't know who to ask.Thanks, Tom Savage

modern world. These questions are prompted from discussions I have had they
made me question the nature of my perceptions.

1) Are their examples of "Buddhist Atrocities" where religion was the
motivating factor? I am aware of atrocities against Buddhists and I have
heard rumors of atrocities done by Buddhists. I ask because someone I was
talking about claimed that Buddhists never ever committed atrocities in the
name of religion.

2) I heard from a convert to Tibetan Buddhism that the Dali Llama once had
slaves, is this true?

If possible, please give sources. Thanks and God bless,

I just received an email message from a so-called "fast track degree

they "generated?" Does anyone know how this stuff comes to be? Are people
hired to write these things? Is it stolen? Why do they put these things at

what IS this?

Charles,

I think it's a "half-found poem." Just break the lines to complete it. I've
received a few of them from other commercial outlets. I can't remember if
any were for Viagra ads.  I assumed that somebody found me through my poetry
and thought they could hook me into buying something. I don't know what it
is or hw they do it. But I've taken the liberty of breaking the lines and
creating stanzas. If anybody would like to continue turning this into a spam
poem, please feel free to pick up where I left off.

Samurai?  Shaolin temple warriors?  Buddhist kings?  as was mentioned, =
Sri
Lanka? =20

You'd have to argue that war is not atrocious and to argue that religion =
and
politics, religion and culture, religion and nationalism, do not overlap =
to
say Buddhism -- or any religion -- was not involved in atrocity. =20

Also, Buddhist monk and or nunhood is not necessarily a lifetime vow, so =
to
argue that Buddhist monks can't perform violent acts -- there's a lot of
wiggle room in that.  You can be a monk for a vacation or take a =
vacation
from monkhood in many sects.

Buddhism spreads -- is designed to spread -- through cultural =
imperialism.
This is part of the reason it is violently repressed by nationalist
movements and often part of colonialism rather than the other way =
'round.

Just as non-violence is one of the five precepts of Buddhism, so too =
don't
kill is in the bible somewhere.  Don't words often diverge from acts?

All best,
Catherine

A LOOK AT THE DOOR WITH THE HINGES OFF

(Poems from the mid-1960s)

by Michael Heller

from A Note on the Poems:

"I try to re-imagine what went into these poems, the experimental
climate of those days, love of Weburn's pointillist music, the
background, not yet fully formed, in my love of poets like Williams,
Creeley, Oppen, Olson, Zukofsky.  Heady days, lighter days--looking
back we can always find signs of where we've been.  But I also find
in these poems, portents of an open, hopeful futurity."

I think it's important to separate practice from the teachings.
The history of most religions - I suspect - are full of contradictions.
In the way that - again, I suspect - many Jews are appalled or in direct
opposition to Israeli practices in occupied Palestine, and, many Christians
are also appalled and in opposition to the so-called Christian right,
particularly in the practices of President Bush, ostensibly devout man of
Christian beliefs. (One also remembers the Quaker, Richard Nixon).

Anyway, as perhaps obvious, both individuals and institutions go wayward, or
off path from the original message/teachings - be it of Buddha, Christ, etc.

  It may be considered strange that Zen has it any way been affiliated with
the spirit of the military classes of Japan. Whatever form Buddhism takes in
the various countries where it flourishes, it is a religion of compassion,
and in its varied history it has never been found engaged in warlike
activities. How is it, then, that Zen has come to activate the fighting
spirit of the Japanese warrior?
          -- D. T. Suzuki [1]

Suzuki's question remains the most problematic one for understanding the
place of Zen within Buddhism and comparative religion generally. In his
provocative study Zen and the Way of the Sword: Arming the Samurai Psyche,
[2] Winston L. King raises this issue on the first page and reminds us that
such perversions of moral and religious ideals are not found only in Japan.
We need only consider "how the simple otherworldly ethic of Jesus, the
carpenter of Nazareth, to love those who hate us and turn the other cheek to
those who strike us could have been transformed into the Crusaders" gospel
of killing infidel Saracens or into a church of bitterly feuding and even
warring sects. The answers to all such questions are always complex and
unsatisfactory. "This response too, for valid as it is it overlooks the most
important issue: the difference between our understanding of the Crusader,
who would now be considered benighted by all but the most fundamentalist
Christians, and the reputation of the Zen samurai spirit among contemporary
Japanese and those likely to read this article. The problem, then, is not
only how this perversion of Buddhism occurred, but why samurai Zen continues
to be accepted and praised as a legitimate form of Buddhism.

    King never addresses this question squarely, although at times he comes
close. Instead, Zen and the Way of the Sword provides a concise and
admirably clear introduction to a fascinating subject. An explanation of Zen
practice and experience is followed by chapters on how the samurai adopted
Zen (and

In fairness, I think a good place to take these questions would be to
practicing Buddhists who are also scholars of Buddhism, or who are monastics
-- they are the ones who could sensitively field questions about their
co-religionists present and past -- the only thing anyone else can do is
generalize --

For those of you in the LA area...Robin Ward's art opening (below) is
Saturday night...I find inspiration in her work...If anyone goes--I'm on
the east coast and won't make it--would enjoy hearing thoughts.
Best, Deborah Poe


Snow Blind Water Drop
sixspace gallery project room, Culver City, CA
April 15 - May 13
Reception: Saturday April 15, from 6-9pm

My recent paintings and drawings posit creatures, whether human or
animal, as bodies in largely empty environments where subtle landscapes
or terrains are evoked or fade away through delicate mark making and
insinuation. In Snow Blind Water Drop, the negative space of the support
surface becomes the landscape itself-water, snow, ice. The creatures
express, transform, struggle, float hazily, procreate, in a primordial
soup where the boundary between liquid, solid, and air has evaporated,
but where these confusions question the fundamental order of things and
the way living beings are positioned within that order.

Out here in a farflung aspect of the old British Empire, where the countries
are pink and sunny, it is unusual to find books by poets across the wide
blue oceans. On a poet's income, I am without credit card and therefore
often without access to such writers' works ... But shuffling through a
branch of Elizabeth's Second Hand Bookshop(s) recently I found Sheila E
Murphy's 'A clove of Gender'. Amazingly good find, a Stride book from Devon,
UK. So, while you all enjoy 'Continuations', I am enjoying Sheila's work
from 1995 ... Just think of its 'long and winding road' from Sheila's pen to
bedside table ...

Btw, for any who don't know, 'Sheila', perhaps with a lower case 's', is an
Ocker term for female of the species.

GET SLEEPY WITH GREGG BIGLIERI!
Booklaunch & Poetry Reading for Gregg Biglieri's Sleepy with Democracy
Saturday April 15th at Big Orbit (Sleepy time 8:00)
30D Essex Street=20
Buffalo, NY 14213-2332


Praise for Sleepy:

Benjamin Friedlander writes: =B3A system of representation in which each
particle of meaning contributes, no, is subsumed into a rhetoric that lulls
us, oh so shrewdly, into a state neither wakeful nor content with dreams.=B2

Bill Berkson writes: =B3Stepping lightly into the appointed area =AD- with 'Wha=
t
common language to unravel?' that iconic question of moment blinking over
the portals -- Gregg Biglieri shoulders the 'rival dictation' known as
poetry to wonder us awake. Indeed, if what here is invoked as =8CDemocracy=B9 i=
s
discussible -- and more to the point, livable -- there must be a whole new
conversation to engage all available terms by which it might reanimate from
present inertia. Biglieri's composite talk keeps all terms open, with
alarming interlinear bounce and extravagance ever palpable. This is a full,
heartening book.=B2
=20
Peter Quartermain writes: =B3=B9You sense uncertainty,=B9 puns Biglieri, =8CAnd
recover it.=B9 These poems are written in a world paralysed by its own aporia=
,
no road no lyric subject possible, the boundaries of subject and object
blurred beyond perception in an endlessly manipulated indifferent culture
lacking will and imagination. They are written, as one poem says, from the
exact middle of nowhere, where the alphabet is primal pun, and =8Cthe things
we really know are words.=B9 Ironic and sardonic, these witty poems, carefull=
y
sequenced but independent in their interlinking echoes and iterations, are =
a
wake-up call; they emerge from the gap between what is there and what is
not, testimony to our impossible desire for clarity of vision. The absence
is all here, one line says, and sleep can=B9t process it =AD a dilemma
beautifully caught in a headlong fluid syntax which demands close attention
and repeated reading, conundrums of thought and observation led by
Biglieri=B9s alert astonished ear, the mind led by sound. Wonderful poems,
voicing unillusion. They stay.=B2

What will you write? =B3Kick out the jams=B2 Saturday April 15th at Big Orbit.
Reading, booksigning, merrymaking...

Can=B9t get enough? Other works by Gregg Biglieri include: Profession (Idiom,
1997), Roma (Beautiful Swimmer, 1999), Los Books (Cuneiform, 2002), Reading
Keats to Sleep (Cuneiform, 2003), EL EGG (Eclipse Editions, 2003)
<www.english.utah.edu/eclipse/> & I Heart My Zeppelin (Atticus Finch, 2005)=

Cuneiform will be available at the event.

Learning the Wrong Things From Poetry

Fill your house with books if you want little Billy or Beth to grow up to
be an academic all-star. Shakespeare is good. But stay away from poetry --
books of poesy on your shelves may dumb down your child.

A research team headed by demographer Jonathan Kelley, of Brown University
and the University of Melbourne, analyzed data from a study of scholastic
ability in 43 countries, including the United States. The data included
scores on a standardized achievement test in 2000 and detailed information
that parents provided about the family. The average student scored 500 on
this test.

The researchers found that a child from a family having 500 books at home
scored, on average, 112 points higher on the achievement test than one from
an otherwise identical family having only one book -- and that's after they
factored in parents' education, occupation, income and other things
typically associated with a child's academic performance. The findings were
presented last month at the annual meeting of the Population Association of
America in Los Angeles.

Of course, it's not the number of books in the home that boosts student
performance -- it's what they represent. The researchers say a big home
library reflects the parents' dedication to the life of the mind, which
probably nurtures scholastic accomplishment in their offspring.

They also found that not all books are created equal. "Having Shakespeare
or similar highbrow books about bodes well for children's achievement,"
they wrote. "Having poetry books around is actively harmful by about the
same amount," perhaps because it signals a "Bohemian" lifestyle that may
encourage kids to become guitar-strumming, poetry-reading dreamers.

It is my experience that there are people who are willing to equivocate and
do evil from all traditions.

The Japanese Empire for example (until 1945) did evil and many of their
soldiers were Buddhists(with Shinto as well).

There is a great letter between DT Suzuki and Thomas Merton that gives me
some solace.

I think it was written in the early 60's where Suzuki tells Merton that
there is a mystical bond between the Buddha and his Followers, Islamic
Sufiism, Christians like St Francis, St John of the Cross and Charles De
Foucould, Jews like Caro and Abu Lafia and Hindus like Ghandi, Communists
like Neruda and that this is real truth and that those who equivocate are
the image of evil in the world.

I think we are seeing this today writ large.

This is something I'd expect to read here in the Ames Tribune, not the
Washington Post. It's common knowledge that poetry encourages kids to
pluck, not strum.

Writing Conference
At Western Connecticut State University
181 White Street
Danbury, CT 06810
=20
Frank McCourt Keynotes=20
Unique Writing Conference Open to
Teachers, University Undergraduates, Graduates,
Gifted High School Students, writers from the public
=20
=20
Sat. & Sun. May 6-7, 2006
Western Connecticut. State University
=20
Pulitzer Prize memoirist Frank McCourt will keynote a unique gathering =
of student and community writers from around the state the weekend of =
May 6 and 7 at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury.
=20
On Saturday, May 6, graduate and undergraduate creative writing students =
from the four Connecticut State University campuses, along with =
outstanding student writers from the state's high schools, are being =
invited to the fourth annual state-wide writing conference, with a =
second day devoted to writing seminars for the public.
=20
McCourt, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1997 for Angela=92s Ashes, a =
gritty portrayal of the author=92s upbringing in Limerick, Ireland and =
whose latest book is Teacher Man, about his 30 years teaching in the New =
York City schools, will hinge together the two-day writing experience =
with a talk on Saturday evening in Ives Concert Hall on Western=92s =
midtown campus.
=20
The Los Angles Times described Teacher Man as =93An enthralling work of =
autobiographical storytelling=85.Anyone who has ever faced a classroom =
of yawning, slouching adolescents will recognize the accuracy of =
McCourt=92s descriptions and applaud his honesty.=94
=20
In a recent New York Magazine interview McCourt mixed it up with Daniel =
Asa Rose, a critic, author and visiting writer with Western=92s MFA in =
Professional Writing. Rose will be one of the writers leading seminars =
in the Sunday public workshops May 7 in Danbury.
=20
=93McCourt: There=92s nothing in the world like getting up in front of a =
high-school classroom in New York City. They won=92t give you a break if =
you don=92t hold them. There=92s no escape.
=93Rose: It must be vindicating to show them that you knew what you were =
talking about.=20
=93McCourt: The best part=97the most exquisite part, the most delicious =
part=97is meeting those kids years later and to have proved to them that =
I wasn=92t talking out of my ass. Nobody ever said it, but I wondered if =
they were thinking, What has he ever done? If you have a =
physical-education teacher and he has a big beer belly and he=92s =
telling you how to run, you want to say, Hey, where do you get off?
=93Rose: You showed =92em.=20
=93McCourt: I got the Pulitzer Prize, baby! [Laughs]
=93Rose: You have a sly trick of being boastful while appearing humble. =
Where=92d you pick that up?=20
=20
=93McCourt: That=92s something the Church tells you: Pride is the first =
deadly sin. Self-deprecating is a roundabout way of praising yourself. =
Pretty nimble.=94
=20
On Sunday four well-known writers, including Connecticut poet laureate =
Marilyn Nelson and Rose, will conduct seminars for pre-registered =
students in the areas of fiction, nonfiction, poetry and screen writing. =
The afternoon will include the seminars, a panel on =93Insights for =
Marketing Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry and Screenplays.=94 There will =
also be book signings, and readings by the name writers.
=20
For a nominal fee of $20, 10 members of the public will be admitted on a =
first-come, first-serve basis to each of the four seminars given by the =
name writers. Once the four primary workshops are filled, additional =
participants will be placed into small, facilitated peer workshops in =
their genre. Each of these peer groups will be moderated by writers from =
Western Connecticut State University=92s MFA in Professional Writing and =
will consider the work submitted by each participant. =20
=20
The event, co-sponsored by the Master of Fine Arts writing program at =
Western Connecticut State University, the literary journal Connecticut =
Review,  and the IMPAC-Connecticut State University Young Writers Trust, =
has received substantial grants from CSU and WestConn's President James =
Schmotter. The program has additional support from Drunkenboat.com, an =
international on-line journal for the arts.

Faculty members from the CSU System and other state universities will =
volunteer their talents to lead workshops and panels for the Saturday =
event.

Conference organizers, including John Briggs, Senior Editor of =
Connecticut Review, and Ravi Shankar, poet in residence at Central, =
expect about 120 students to attend the Saturday events, and 50 or more =
writers from the community for the Sunday workshops.

Saturday's program will include small group workshops focusing on =
student work in fiction, poetry, nonfiction, screenwriting, and =
journalism. There will also be readings by faculty, students, and the =
keynote speaker. The panels, readings, keynote talk and bookfair will be =

Pinsky and best-selling Connecticut author Stewart O'Nan.=20

The University of Iowa was hit by a tornado last night. From the story above
the downtown area and the Student union were severely damaged and St
Patrick's church area around the Mill Restaurant was severely damaged. A
woman was killed.

As an alumnus of the University this is a sad time. Please do what you can
to help out.

I would bet dollars to donuts that - in this vein - the next study/article
to appear will be one that argues that poets, particularly innovative ones,
are harmful to poetry. In fact, in print or subliminally, I think that
article/notion actually appears with great frequency - including the
argument to keep it off the family shelves.  In particular you would not
want your child to start looking at the SAT exam as one f'...  of a horrible
poem!

It's alright. Resistance (to new poetry) is good. Makes many scream, shout
(sometimes) but, fundamentally try harder.

What does the standardized achievement test test?  I suppose
that these researchers suppose its standards are transparent,
reasonable and therefore universal.  If your highest values
are efficiency, practicality and avarice then surely reading
poetry must be detrimental to that.  But why then have a
library that even includes Shakespeare and other canonical
works?  Why not just have a complete set of the Washington Post?

Guitar strumming dreamers?  It's been what, 40 years since
Dobie Gillis?  Old habits, these.

a portrait of our findings; phone lines break the manes
of horses wild; like a hardy boy blue leans cautious
& a smugglers cove; homemade wild basement bucket wine
& longshore fears that beat the current hooks & tides
beyond the angular cells, beyond the clumsy signs,
the drunken birthdays, parties at the bare bone of listening
; a history of narration; when we sleep, we sleep inside,
quietly disbanding; a kitchen counter note of passage,
quick cautious halo sips; rain obeys gravity & grace;
my fingers lose practice, communal lip of cauterized trees
the backyard planted; dark watered deck at night
of your foreboding; or if like antlers,
the berkshire horse was all we left, a paper trail, a stone
encased in ice; each year a year, a starved gaunt
twisted & eaten, drifted over; who wrote our own way
into immortality

article) will be publishing the first ever book of poems and plays =
written
as Fibonacci sequences. The book is by Emily Galvin and will be released =
in
2007. Emily is astoundingly talented (poet, Harvard mathematician, LA =

The Call for entries 2006 is open until April 30th. In Autumn 2006, the
festival 'Rencontres internationales Paris/Berlin' will present in Paris
and Berlin an international programming focusing on film, video and
multimedia, gathering works of artists and directors acknowledged on the
international scene along with young artists and not much distributed
directors.
The festival aims at presenting those works to a broad audience, at
creating circulations between different art practices and between
different audiences, as well as creating new exchanges between artists,
directors and professionals. This event is supported by French, German
and international cultural institutions.

The 'Rencontres internationales' offer more than a simple presentation
of the works. They introduce an intercultural forum gathering various
guests from all over the world – artists and directors recognized on the
international scene along with young artists and directors who still
cannot enjoy a substantial distribution, directors from organizations
and emerging structures – testifying of the vivacity of creation and its
diffusion, but also of the artistic and cultural contexts that often are
in transition or sometimes experiencing deep changes. The festival
reflects specificities and crossings of contemporary art practices, and
work out this necessary time when points of view meet and are exchanged.

Anselm, Tom, Frank, howdy all, long time no speak, and most unforntunately so, wanted to get back to the subject of readings, the polemics, the ego enhancing methodologies employed to promote readings and so on. The primary problem seems to be the notion of having two readers, which all of you use to promote your readings in your respective cities. Why two? Poets, in general, (all of us, of course, being the exception) are a ridiculously fragile bunch, at least in my experience as a curator since 1998 for a reading series that has 30-35 readings a year, and then as a curator before that and the city before that and so on back to the late 1980's. Having two powerhouse readers seems preposterous and abstract to me. I mean with one reader things are different. Maybe part of it is our city's size, being the 13Th largest vs the first and the 5Th and the well over 50Th (not including daytime workers, Tom (by the way sorry not to see you southward much else to do, please report on
 that doodad & let me know about rodrigo he is the one that is important of all the rest).  And I want to back up NYC being a very weird experience while noting that in more than dozen readings in NYC as an outsider I experienced things such as suggestions as "If you appear at X's poetry reading then these people will appear at yours" which, professionally, I gave a big fuck off to, eat my shorts, and also to mention instances where it was apparent that "so and so has read here so many times in the past few months, you do not want to read with them." I mean who cares. I have created my moment in literary history, as each of you have, all of which will be known way outside of my readings. If I give a reading and upstage CK Williams or Lou Reeds or whoever else I'm paired with who cares.

  When Gabriel Gadding reads here on Monday, as with the week previous with Garin Cycholl, we will mention his name and nothing else about him. We will not tell how many books he has, or what they edit, or how good of head they give, or why they are important, or how hearing them read will advance their own poetic ends. I will assert that it will be a great reading; especially as it is apparent that that is all that is necessary in our city. If NO ONE shows up this Monday for Gabe it is because the weather is extremely bad, or the weather is extremely wonderful, or a large shipment of great drugs has arrived and all of us have not been able to find the location we arrive at weekly. But Otherwise he will have a fantastically enthusiastic crowd. In any case it will not be personal, or tied to the individual poets ego. What a fantastic thing!! I highly recommend it! What if all of your IMPORTANT reading series were run this way (BY THE WAY, ALL OF YOU OWE AN INVITE BY NOW EVEN
 IF YR UPSET, NO NEED TO ASK, I WILL HAVE NEW BOOK COMING OU FROM HIGH PROFILE PUBLISHER). Feel free to ask others, I get around like a bad day at the races--

Are there examples of "Buddhist Atrocities" where religion was the
motivating factor?



This might go against the shibboleths of my atheism, but I wonder if
religion has ever really been the motivating factor of atrocities anywhere.
If we're talking about wars and mass murders, I'll offer that the motivating
factor is always (why not be bold?) economics. Sure, from the Crusades to
September Eleventh, religion and the holy have been invoked as reasons,
calls to arms, excuses, and scapegoats for atrocities, but really we're
talking about power, which means we ought to be talking about money. No
Roman or Jew ever killed each other until money gave them something to fight
about.



How religion has been complicit in power, in the scheming for power and the
wielding of power, is of course a very real issue, and I don't believe that
Buddhism is any more innocent than Christianity or Islam in this regard,
even if I don't have any instances at hand. Certainly Buddhists have killed,
kill, and will probably continue to kill, even against the tenets of their
faith, but that's not related to the bigger question, which is how Buddhism,
how any religion, has been an integral part of structures of power.



And here I do have an example: In Tang China, the Buddhists were the
money-lenders; their temples were the banks. Bodhidharma came from India to
China and meditated, staring at a wall; he tore his eyelids out to keep from
sleeping, and where his eyelids landed on the ground the first tea-bushes
sprouted. While this is a fiction, tea came to China from India-along with
sugar and chairs and Buddhism-via the Silk Road, and tea was later, with its
darker cousin opium, the main economic vehicle of English imperialism and
oppression of both India and China. Atrocities galore! The vicissitudes and
vagaries of capital, religion, and power, are what we really need to trace
and take account of, especially if we're ever going to achieve freedom from
its binds.

Interestingly, I saw about 5 copies of that book at my town's public
library's book sale this past weekend and last month, at the Planned
Parenthood annual book sale in Des Moines, there had to be no less
than 12 copies.

Buddhists nerve gassed in Tokyo, Christians abused children in Waco, Muslims killed in NYC. You could go on some time with what the worst is capable of. Tibet was a sovereign, peaceful nation and had been deeply Buddhist for some time. It was occupied illegally by the Chinese Army, which proceeds to destroy thousands of monastaries, and so on. Martial law and atrocities on a scale we can't imagine. How does the leader of Tibet respond: Compassion for all beings, who all equally having Buddha nature.

The Dalai Lama won't profile and wiretap you, deny you due process, wage a wrong war and use your tax dollars to pay for it; his deputy will not shoot a fellow monk or rat out a good guy; there will be no Enron style video come to light of the Dalai Lama laughing with Chinese government officials at Tibet's plight.

Our own skit continues daily. We could be having a popular call for impeachment and refusal to support the groundwar another day.

Neil Young Records "Impeach the President" Song

By E&P Staff=20

Published: April 14, 2006 11:40 AM ET

NEW YORK As an E&P "Pressing Issues" column recently noted, rock star Neil
Young is the son of a famed Canadian journalist, so it should not surprise
many that he recently recorded a song in California with a very reportorial
-- or at least pundit -- feel to it.

It=B9s called =B3Impeach the President,=B2 so there can be little question what i=
t
is about.=20

Apparently it was recorded with a 100-voice choir. Rumors have circulated
the past few days on the Web, but E&P has tracked down the strongest
confirmation in a blog kept by Sherman Oaks, Ca. musician/singer Alicia
Morgan.

Previous reports quoted hints by Young and Jonathan Demme (who directed the
new documentary =B3Heart of Gold=B2) that Neil was working on a hard-rocking
political or =B3anti-Bush=B2 CD.

Last Friday, Morgan wrote on her LastLeftB4Hooterville blog that she had
been =B3summoned=B2 to a local studio to sing on the new record with 99 others.
=B3I'm not going to give the whole thing away, but the first line of one of
the songs was =8CLet's impeach the President for lyin'!=B9 Turns out the whole
thing is a classic beautiful protest record. The session was like being at =
a
12-hour peace rally. Every time new lyrics would come up on the screen,
there were cheers, tears and applause. It was a spiritual experience. I
can't believe my good fortune at being a part of this.

=B3We finished the session by singing an a capella version of 'America the
Beautiful' and there was not a dry eye in the house.

=B3Neil said it should be out in 6 to 8 weeks."

Harp magazine reported on its Web site Thursday that Demme had confirmed in
an e-mail, =B3Neil just finished writing and recording -- with no warning -- =
a
new album called 'Living With War.' It all happened in three days=8A It is a
brilliant electric assault, accompanied by a 100-voice choir, on Bush and
the war in Iraq=8A Truly mind blowing. Will be in stores soon.=B2

The magazine continued: =B3Details are pretty scarce, but the featured track,
titled =8CImpeach the President,=B9 features a rap with Bush=B9s voice set to the
choir chanting =8Cflip/flop=B9 and the like.=B2

Young has always been a maverick politically as well as musically. Although
he has recorded a few songs that drew cheers from liberals, such as "Ohio"
and "Southern Man," he also drew criticism from the left for pro-Reagan
comments many years ago.=20

Now how are you going to defer to your reader the status of "the author"
or "the author of..." if you don't mention their writing products? My
God! You don't actually just refer to them as "poets" do you?? That's
really experimental

Col Coleman's repentance was qualified. "If it wasn't for our
presence," he told the BBC, "what would the state of those
archeological ruins be?" - a repeat of the US claim that had its
forces not occupied ancient Babylon, the site would have been laid
waste by looters.

I wonder, though, if this resistence to the
professionalism of poetry might be counter productive,
unless, of course, a small, regular group of listeners
always comes, and you never have new attendees who
might be shy or reserved.

Listing books and editorships and the like (certainly
not "how good of head they give") can seem like a
mintature vita, but it can also clue people into where
they can find more work by the poet they've just heard
and enjoyed. "Oh, he edited that journal? I Never
would have known," they think as the jot it down in a
notebook. I know I've been to many readings where I've
benifited from this sort of information, especially as
I'm a bit shy about going up to poets who've just read
and asking them, "hey, where can I read more of your
stuff?"

So, though I can understand your resistance, it can be
useful. I was at a reading last night at Beyond
Baroque in Venice, where folks from Ugly Duckling
Press read. And afterwards, I made sure to grab up the
books by the readers I most enjoyed, and to write down
the names of books that I wanted to get later. The
little bios helped in that regard.

That said, I dislike the sort of introductions that
say things like, "Her poetry climbs the steep inclines
of Parnassus only to tear them down, casting a shadow
over individual subjectivity, blurring lines between
selfhood and art, art and life, asking why the
"matter" of poetry--the things in and of
themselves--the words, the black lines on paper, the
sounds etching the air--is less important that the
being there, the "the," that is, the absolute sense of
senselessness, which, at its best, appears within us
all, though also without. Please welcome..."

Break a leg on Monday, Gabe.

Best,
Joseph

Joseph -- this may be the most dead-on parody of an intro I've ever seen --
Think I'll appropriate it to use at a future reading -- I will be forever
grateful to you just for that initial image of the poet tearing down the
inclines that she is standing upon --

but back to the earlier post -- there can't be very many people who can, in
introducing a poet, speak knowledgably about what good head the poet gives --
that seems to bespeak a certain conflict of interest, no?

Hello Poetics Listers:

I'm currently seeking any information about the poet/teacher Judson
Jerome. I'm not as interested in his poetry, per se, but rather would like
to find anything -- especially names of people who might have studied with
him -- relating to his participation in the development of the Antioch
College experimental field research center at Columbia, Maryland
(1969-1973).

Please write me back-channel if you have any information, or forward this
to any one who may be able help with my search.

Thanks!

While it is true that Buddhism is mainly a pacifist practice, many Zen =
Buddhist priests, at least in spirit supported Japanese militarists in =
WWII, which comes from a long tradition of samurai (now businessmen) =
being trained in Rinzai temples. And the Dalai Lama is now being =
criticized by young Tibetans exiled in India, whose spiritual leader he =
is, for his political pacifism, which has gotten them no closer to be =
able to live in their homeland. They seem to be ready for a more active =
resistance.=20

Buddhists nerve gassed in Tokyo, Christians abused children in Waco, =
Muslims killed in NYC. You could go on some time with what the worst is =
capable of. Tibet was a sovereign, peaceful nation and had been deeply =
Buddhist for some time. It was occupied illegally by the Chinese Army, =
which proceeds to destroy thousands of monastaries, and so on. Martial =
law and atrocities on a scale we can't imagine. How does the leader of =
Tibet respond: Compassion for all beings, who all equally having Buddha =
nature.

The Dalai Lama won't profile and wiretap you, deny you due process, wage =
a wrong war and use your tax dollars to pay for it; his deputy will not =
shoot a fellow monk or rat out a good guy; there will be no Enron style =
video come to light of the Dalai Lama laughing with Chinese government =
officials at Tibet's plight.=20

Our own skit continues daily. We could be having a popular call for =
impeachment and refusal to support the groundwar another day.=20

NEW AND ON VIEW: MUDLARK NO. 31 (2006)

LOWCOUNTRY | POEMS by JOHN ALLMAN

LOWCOUNTRY, John Allman's just completed book, is his seventh collection
of poetry.  His first, WALKING FOUR WAYS IN THE WIND, was published in the
Princeton Series of Contemporary Poets (Princeton University Press 1979).
Subsequent poetry books include CLIO'S CHILDREN (1985), SCENARIOS FOR A
MIXED LANDSCAPE (1986), CURVE AWAY FROM STILLNESS (1989) and LOEW'S
TRIBORO (2004), all published by New Directions, who also published
Allman's first fiction collection, DESCENDING FIRE & OTHER STORIES (1994).
The Wallace Stevens Society Press published his INHABITED WORLD: NEW &
SELECTED POEMS 1970-1995 in 1995.  An extensive feature representing his
poetry can be seen at Caught in the Net, a PK Poetry List site that comes
out of Liverpool, England.  He has prose poems forthcoming in the online
journal Innisfree and in the print journals Sentence and Kestrel.

The recipient of a Pushcart Prize in Poetry as well as two fellowships in
poetry from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Helen Bulls Prize
from Poetry Northwest, Allman's poems, stories, and essays have been
widely published in such journals as The American Poetry Review, The
Atlantic Monthly, The Antioch Review, The Massachusetts Review, Michigan
Quarterly Review, North Dakota Quarterly, The Paris Review, Poetry, Poetry
International, The Quarterly, and The Yale Review, as well as the online
journals Full Circle, Blackbird, Slope and Enskyment. Allman holds an MA
in Creative Writing from Syracuse University and is now retired from
teaching. He lives in Katonah, New York, and spends his winters on Hilton
Head Island, South Carolina.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

my questions include:  can Houghton Mifflin and HarperCollins be said to =
be
publishing poetry?  (Houghton Mifflin published at least three of the =
books
under review, this seems to me to be a problem)

how is it that the poetry wars have started again in this time of war; =
can't
we do something about this?  [I've been noticing this in local LA poetry =
as
well]

how come this is all tied up with religious poetry that is political and
political poetry which is religious

thus, does reporting-based editorship in the Post's book section cover =
or
create divisive "issues" rather than... oh reviewing responsibly, I =
think so

It is very negative and about atrocities and such. I would be interested in

I can't offer a Tibetan response, but I have heard of Tibet's violent
culture through Christopher Hansard, who represents the gNam Ngagpa
lineage of the Northern Treasure School of Jangter Bön. The Tibetan Bon
tradition predates the introduction of Buddhism in Tibet by 17,000 years
and was the indigenous religion of Tibet.
Details on the lineage Christopher represents is at:
http://www.bonmedicine.com/lineage.htm

and interviews I did with him can be heard at:

I Reply: Yes. As these books are placed in the poetry section, they must be=
 poetry. Are you meaning "good" poetry? That's a very different question.=20

I Reply: Poetry wars? I haven't noticed any change in the attitudes of poet=
s/critics toward things they don't care for. So, in my estimation, either t=
he poetry wars never left us, or they were never really here to begin with.=
 Can we do something about this? My guess would be no. Unless we resort to =
a formula of "all poetry is just great!" Or is that what you mean by "poetr=
y wars"?
> how come this is all tied up with religious poetry that is political and>=
 political poetry which is religious
I Reply: All tied up with? I'm not sure that it is, or if it is, what you m=
ean by "it." But it would make sense to me that in these times of perceived=
 increased need for order-making systems, that many who feel so inclined wo=
uld turn toward overt politics or religious statements.=20

k so
=20
I Reply: I don't think the Post is doing anything other than the easiest th=
ing they can do with the easiest (content-oriented) poetry they can find. I=
 doubt they are creating any issues. They might be over-inflating them, tho=
ugh. Personally, I can't imagine a worse lot of books for them to choose to=
 talk about. Perhaps this is my contribution to the poetry wars...=20

Meanwhile, over in the contiguous republic of the New York Times, we get today
William Logan's review of the latest OXFORD BOOK OF AMERICAN POETRY, this time
edited by David Lehman.

Poetry Wars?

"You can get the idea of Ashbery in two paes--almost everything after that is
sludge."


"Whitman's and Dickinson's damaged psyches . . ."

Anne Bradstreet wrote "with the high-minded clumsiness of the imperfectly
educated."

"There's a quaintness to the work of the preacher, Edward Taylor . . . "

not sure "quaint" is the first word that leaps to mind when reading the
"Prepartory Meditations."

In one place he notes that the cut-off date of birth for inclusion in the
collection is 1950 -- later he remarks "The younger poets are getting older."
duh

"far more pages are wasted on giddy, crowd-pleasing poets like Billy Collins and
James Tate."  Whether I like them or not, I don't think I've ever found those

  The Bay Area Literary Community:
          What  small presses, literary journals, MFA programs, bloggers, and reading  series are doing to foster cross genre work, support collaboration,  & grow the literary community.


              Featuring Panelists:

   Jack       Boulware from Litquake

  Litquake-Jack  Boulware
          http://www.litquake.org/
  Litquake Mission Statement: Litquake galvanizes the Bay Area’s thriving literary scene by  bringing emerging, mid-career and established authors together with  fans  of the written word for a week of readings, performances, cross-media  events, and panel discussions. We strive to foster interest in  literature, to perpetuate a sense of community by making the solitary  social, and to publicize San Francisco’s  literary heritage, present and future. Litquake represents an ideal  complement to the city’s music, film, and cultural festivals – and is  unique as the only literary festival in the city. All Litquake events  are open to the  public and free or low-cost ($5-$10), so that all fans of the written word, from children to seniors, are able to attend.

Jack Boulware: Grew up in rural Montana. He has written two nonfiction social history books, Sex, American Style and San Francisco Bizarro, and has appeared in anthologies and won a few journalism awards. From 1989-1995 I was founding editor of the satirical investigative Nose magazine, and for several years wrote a column for SF Weekly. I  currently contribute regularly to a wide variety of publications, and have traveled to many countries and throughout the U.S. in search of  a cool story. Occasionally I do live readings and panel discussions, and appear on Air America Radio and in television documentaries. I’m also the co-founder and director of
 San Francisco’s annual Litquake  literary festival.

  Go. Reading  Series-Page McBee & Michael Braithwaite
          http://www.varnishfineart.com/events/index.php?t=past
              Duke  Ellington once said, "We aren't worried about posterity – we want it to  sound good right now." We know how that story ends, of course. Oakland  artist Michael Braithwaite and her partner, writer Page McBee, present  an innovative and provocative response to the timeless question of art  and immortality in their monthly, revolving collaborative art series,  "Go." Go.'s primary focus is to bring together artists across lines of  culture, gender, sexuality, race, and generation, to create an  experience that blends issues of identity and medium. Given only a  theme and a tight deadline, a visual artist, a writer, and an audio  artist work together to create a cross-media exhibit on display for one  night only. "Go." takes place on the first Friday of every month at  Varnish Fine Art, and it is sure to be San    Francisco's most satisfying one-night stand.

  Go. is curated every month by Oakland-based artist Michael  Braithwaite and her partner, the writer Page McBee.

  Eleven Eleven  {1111}-Brent Foster Jones &   Youmna Chlala http://www.cca.edu/academics/mfawriting/1111.php
          Founded in 2004, Eleven Eleven  is an annual journal of literature and art based at California   College  of the Arts. The journal is published each spring and is available at  most independent bookstores in the San Francisco Bay Area, select  bookstores in other major U.S.  cities, and through Amazon.com. The journal is a forum for writers,  poets, and visual artists to risk, experiment, and find answers for and  from their contemporaries. Our aim is to produce a publication that  serves as an exchange for writers and artists.

  Eleven Eleven  {1111} was co-founded by Brent Foster Jones &   Youmna Chlala

  Last Gasp-Bucky  Sinister
          http://www.lastgasp.com/
              Last  Gasp is one of the largest and oldest publishers and purveyors of  underground comic books in the world, as well as being a distributor of  all sorts of weird 'n' wonderful subversive literature, graphic novels,  tattoo and art books.

  Stephanie Young-Blogger & Mills   College Administrator
          http://stephanieyoung.org/blog/#

  Stephanie Young's long awaited debut, TELLING THE FUTURE OFF, ensnares  the reader in a loop of theatrical-sets, filtered through the  obsessive-compulsive call and response of self-help tag-lines. It's 3:30  at the office and the landscape is all twisted up in the bedsheets,  littered with car radios, eyeshadow and circuit training. In the  distance, the internet drones. TELLING THE FUTURE OFF is built of the  poetry of Today, of realism colliding with the dream-state. In it,  Young questions and she answers but never does she waver. When she  asks, "Am I tough enough?" The unanimous answer is Yes.

It was good to meet you in Lake Forest, tho the conference was on the
weak side. Your performance was good to see also, despite my
traffic-marred late arrival.

I sent Slumgullion a catalogue of Debra Van Tuinen's encaustic works,
with some poems written by JOhn Olson, Roberta Olson, & myself, with
some collaborations.

Stay well.

not that I'm here to defend the anthology, or its editor --- just noticing
things

here, here, Aldon!  one gets the sense from this review that no one and
nothing is good in American poetry.  i was waiting for Logan to champion
Donald Justice, a poet he's written about, but it seemed he was more
interested in repeating Samuel Johnson's line about Am. poetry: "like a
dog's walking on his hinder legs.  It is not done well; but you are
surprised to find it done at all."

which all makes me wonder more why i read the nyt book review-- and not Am.
poetry itself.

Well, just to be fair to Logan, the "dog's walking" line was in
reference to Am. poetry written before the Am. Rev. But don't
let me stop the fun.

Hal                    Flotsam, please, and a side order of jetsam.

Join Joe Green and Marty Brennan as they stroll, as if strolling through a
wood near Athens in the great tradition of Flute, Snout, Plato and
Parmenides, and discuss Kent Johnson's new book, his character, his probable
ethnicity, his probable sexual proclivities and the direction he should take
in his art.

Discussion also includes:
Annette Funicello
The theft by Walt Disney of a painting by Marty
The power of the legs of women
The mysterious book of Genta.

Was emailing with one of the whiz kids at Dalkey Archive Press the other
day: Dalkey's looking for reviewers for a new edition of Jacques
Roubaud's work translated by the Waldrops. See below for information --
and for the contact info at Dalkey in the event you're interested in
reading and reviewing this coolio book. -- Gabe


Title: The Form of a City Changes Faster, Alas, Than the Human Heart

Author: Jacques Roubaud

Translators: Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop

Pub Date: July 18, 2006
Pages: 247
Price: $13.95

Galleys: Available for anyone who would like to consider it for review

Contact: Chad Post at cwpost@dalkeyarchive.com

Jacket Copy: An homage and response to many of France's best-known
poets, including Charles Baudelaire and Raymond Queneau, this collection
moves through the streets of Paris, commenting on its inhabitants, its
writers, its monumental past, and all its possible futures. Moving
between honesty and evasion, erudition and lightheartedness, constraint
and freedom, THE FORM OF A CITY CHANGES FASTER, ALAS, THAN THE HUMAN
HEART explores a Paris that's no long "the one we used to find." A
sometimes mocking, sometimes poignant tribute to the City of Light,
Jacques Roubaud's poetry is filled with the melancholic playfulness
that's made him one of our most important contemporary writers.

Author Bio: Jacques Roubaud is the author of numerous books, including
the novels Hortense Is Abducted, Hortense in Exile, and The Princess
Hoppy, or The Tale of Labrador, as well as the poetry collections Some
Thing Black, Plurality of Worlds of Lewis, and The Form of a City
Changes Faster, Alas, Than the Human Heart. He is one of the most
accomplished members of the Oulipo, an innovative literary group whose
members whose members have included Raymond Queneau, Italo Calvino, and
Harry Mathews.

I'd like to hear what the initial impetus for this discussion is. And I hope we're confusing Buddhismus-- China has no Buddhism, perhaps subterranean one could easily argue, but Buddhism is antithetical to totalitarianism. I love yuh, Harry!

Little of you may know this, and perhaps this is only legend among the hill-stations, but Clinton offered pape smurf sticks and stones, following how prior foreign policy assisted in the disgrace of smurfs, and papa smurf said no. And even Smurfland warlords gave up power to create the insitution, which was not always good, sure, not unlike most things--including drink and filthy good sex.

  Another anecdote: "Their bullets used to go through our men on horseback, their modern guns, tatatakataka, and they could not kill us. But then, you know, they melted with fire our gold and places and destroyed our places, many many places and the people, you know, and then they shoot us. And we die."

  This is the big red machine...and lots worse than stinky ol' Pete.

1. Poetry Wars:
 From middle school onwards, my father devoted much of his son-raising
effort to trying to steer me away from literature, sometimes repeating
the warning that "When a war begins they always hang the poets first."
(he being a survivor, barely, of the Korean War).

I didn't have a tangible fear of being hung, just revulsion at the
thought of taking nothing but science and math courses the rest of my
youth. Although, during college, these, in fact, turned out to be much
richer than my humanities courses (except for one on Dante that I took
with fellow dormitory-mate Maria Damon).

One problem I had with the latter was that I tried to write term papers
on poetry as if they were scientific theorizations; at the time,
structuralism and cognitive psychology seemed the natural methodology
for building a bridge between poetry and science (my "self" and mon
pEre). For example, I did a phonology seminar project trying to find
underlying psycholinguistic patterns in some of Galway Kinnel's poetry
(egads!), having read  Samuel J. Keyser's work on Chaucerian meter
(Keyser, a Chomsky offshoot, was teaching at the university). Maria, do
you remember Kinnel's visits reading "The Bear," etc.? I can't remember
if you enjoyed them. By 1980 or so I cdn't figure out how his poetry
had made any impression on me; it must have been part of some poetry
war that I didn't know I had been mobilized for. Huge rally-like
readings by Rich, Voznesensky, Corso, Ginsberg: those were longer
lasting influences.

2. The New York Times Book Review:
The last few years, in a touching effort to make up for all the decades
of Korean conflict over whether I shd be allowed to pursue a life of
literature (for which I am always renewing hostilities), my father
often mails or gives me during my visits home any articles on poetry or
Asian authors he spots in the New York Times Book Review.

On the one hand, it disturbs me to know that, in his very small pockets
of spare time, he is relying on the NYTBR for his sense of Anglophone
literature. At the same time, I realize, after many years of ignorance,
how deeply literary and philosophical he already was long before he
could read English. "He was still of that generation" that received an
education in which classical Chinese, colonial Japanese, and native
Korean were often taught in literary forms. He wrote out lines of
Goethe (probably in kana) when courting my mother in the wonderfully
romantic parks of Seoul. When I told them over the phone once that I
was taking a seminar on Natsume SOseki, my Mom and Dad recited
immediately and cheerfully in unison: "Wagahai wa nekko de aru. Mada
namae wa nai!" (The untranslatably charming opening lines of SOseki's
early novel /I am a Cat/.) When trying to get me (about 13 years old at
the time) to do more weeding and raking, he gave me the line from the
Analects about how poets should know the names of many flowers and
plants, although it was not until I read Confucius a decade later that
I knew the tradition he was transmitting. (I painfully remember that at
the time I retorted with some Rimbaudian item about hallucinating
landscapes rather than naming pretty ones; I ended up doing plenty of
the former in college and it almost killed me!)

So there's nothing for me to worry about. I occasionally look at the
NYTBR to imagine how my father reads it, to imagine being him in the
fallen America he now post-imagines. He hands me the clippings as if
they were recipes from a flight magazine, occasionally scribbling very
brief comments in the margin like "Not impressed--are you?"

That one was about the latest novel by Chang-rae Lee, the "foremost
Korean American author." Pride swells in me over my father's good
taste. But it's also his sense of history and how his passion for
science--and its relation to survival--was a phase of his own history.
(He hadn't seen how the U.S. bombs that fell on Korea, on his cousins,
and the N. Korean ideology that executed his father were also part of
science.) I think he is also intimating that he would like me to
publish something that impresses him more. That particular poetry war
de moi is over, especially now that, at a late age, I have finally
found tenure-track employment in a department that won't hang me (I
think). Time to start a new battle! Nel mezzo del cammin di boku na
vita, May the Buddha guide all good cats and soldats.

Walter has me thinking about the responses of our families to our choices to
become poets and/or literary scholars/critics/journalists/ or even just people
who read all the time.

My father found my choice of major puzzling -- but by the time I got to grad
school, he was proudly introducing me to people as a doctoral candidate -- I
guess the professionalization stage was something he could fathom. He is the
only person who always addresses mail to me using the "Dr." title. (Though I
have never forgotten his surprise when he heard the salary attached to my first
tenure track job -- "When I was in school, being a professor was a good job.")

Now, though my dad doesn't read the NYTBR like Walter's, every time an obituary
appears in the WASHINGTON POST for a poet, my father clips it out and mails it
to me, asking if I knew the person.  Sad to say, Often did.  No poetry wars in
my father's house, though.  He sends them to me whether it's a Black Mountain
School poet, an old school formalist or a concrete poet.

ABOUT THE FLARFLIST COLLECTIVE
Launched in May of 2001 by six poets, the Flarflist Collective is dedicated
to the exploration of “the inappropriate” in all of its guises. Poets mine
the Internet with odd search terms then distill the results into often
hilarious and sometimes disturbing poems, plays, and other texts.

ABOUT THE DREW GARDNER POETICS ORCHESTRA
The Poetics Orchestra is an ensemble conducted by poet and musician Drew
Gardner. His conduction system uses hand signals, tone cards, and rhythmic
forms to shape collective improvisation. The system is related to that of
Butch Morris, though simplified, and with the addition of tonal systems. It
also owes something to the tradition of new music which includes the
recitation of text- esp. Harry Partch, Robert Ashley and Rzewski. The group
always includes poets, who are conducted right along with the musicians
using the same system. The idea is to unite poetry and music in a
collaborative sprit.

WORKSHOP THIS SATURDAY

Between Word and Image
A multimedia workshop with Kyle Schlesinger and Caroline Koebel
Saturday, April 22, 12-4 p.m.
CEPA, Underground Gallery, Market Arcade Building, 617 Main St., Buffalo
=2450, =2440 members
Co-sponsored by CEPA Gallery

All forms of writing are images, but not all images are forms of writing. O=
r are they?
This multimedia poetry workshop will explore the relationships between word=
s and
images. What effect has the evolution of new media had on the literary and =
visual arts
of the last fifty years? What are the distinctions between the languages of=
 visual and
literary arts? What are the ramifications of blurring these boundaries? Pai=
nters, poets,
filmmakers, collage, book and installation artists have a longstanding hist=
ory of
collaboration. In the first half of this workshop we will examine various e=
xamples of
poems inspired by visual art forms and vice versa. In the second half parti=
cipants will
engage in a series of poetic experiments in response to the other forms of =
visual art
using a variety of media and materials. Writers and artists working in all =
mediums are
welcome.

Caroline Koebel's work roams between film, video and installation art. She =
is also
curator, writer and Professor of Media Studies at SUNY Buffalo whose postco=
nceptual
artworks often confront the problematics of female being-in-the-world, the =
expression
of subjectivities at odds with commodity culture, and how individuals embod=
y the
collective past. Kyle Schlesinger is a poet, scholar, book artists and prop=
rietor of
Cuneiform Press. He received his Ph.D. from the Poetics Program at SUNY Buf=
falo,
and is the author of Moonlighting, Mantle (with Thom Donovan), A Book of Cl=

>George Bowering was born in Penticton, British Columbia, in 1935.
>After serving as a photographer in the Royal Canadian Air Force,
>Bowering attended the University of British Columbia.  George
>Bowering is a major Canadian literary figure and one of the most

>date.  Two-time winner of the Governor General's Award, his most
>recent collection of poetry, Changing on the Fly, is short-listed
>for the Griffin Prize for Poetry.  George Bowering approaches
>literature as he does life: with a playful gravity and a grave
>merriness that makes intellectual life and writing seem at once
>attractive, unintimidating and remarkable.  He dispels the myth of
>literature being hard or tricky and demonstrates, as he reads and
>chats, the accessible and enriching nature of great literature.  His
>appeal and great influence lie in his decision to work consistently
>against the grain of dominant aesthetic conventions and
>expectations.

>(University of Minnesota Press, 1993), the cairo noteboooks (Singing

just to plug Stephen's book. i had it out of the library for over a year
and if i had the dosh i'd buy one. I've even ganked the title woodcut
image for a poster of my own.

i'd say it is the stop before Close Listening.

i also found the report/discussion about one of Antin's talkpoems very
interesting. especially the fact that they couldn't start until ron
silliman had his tape recorder ready. it seemed that even back in those
early days that there very clear rules as to who got to eat the power pie.
(and yeah gender is in there too).

later,
kevin

"Sidelights"

Claudia Emerson is the author of two volumes of poetry, Pharaoh,
Pharaoh: Poems and Pinion: An Elegy. Born and raised in Chatham,
Virginia, Emerson writes poems that are, as Diann Blakely noted in
Nashville Scene, "redolent with... regional soil and its seasonal
varieties." Emerson, who studied writing at the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro, published her first poetry collection in 1997
at age forty; it was an auspicious beginning for the debut poet, for
that collection--Pharaoh, Pharaoh --was nominated for a Pulitzer
prize.

Pharaoh, Pharaoh "explores the irony of loss, a theme Emerson
identifies as particularly Southern," according to a contributor for
Contemporary Southern Writers. In poems such as "Cleaning the Graves,"
"Searching the Title," and "Inheritance," she presents what one
Publishers Weekly reviewer called "a meditation on the events and
repercussions of lives lived in the South." The same reviewer praised
the "soft, romantic spirit [that] haunts this collection." Similarly,
America reviewer Edward J. Ingebretsen noted the "measured and
elegiac" cadence of the poems and observed that Emerson's "confident
narrative voice is intimate and richly detailed without being
sentimental."

Pinion, published in 2002, is a series of short poems connected as one
long poem that runs over fifty pages. It explores more rural values
and qualities of Southern life through the voices of two members of a
farming family, Preacher and Sister. Both siblings are caught in the
web of family and farm obligations. Interspersed with their dialogue
is narration by the youngest and last surviving sister of the family,
Rose. Writing in the Blackbird Review Online, Susan Settlemyre
Williams found this narrative verse a "haunting, and haunted, work."
As compared to the author's first volume of poems about rural Southern
life, Williams felt Pinion is "more a full-length portrait than a
series of snapshots." Blakely commented that Emerson's language in
both volumes "is gorgeous but reticent... commemorating, even
celebrating, her family and the hard ground from which it sprang."

Hello---It's coming up on what is my favorite time of year,
doesn't get as much play as xmas and such, but Frank O'Hara
got the gist of it when he wrote. "It's April. No, May. It's May"
So before I cry MAYDAY (my band's playing a show that night---details
below),
let me first tell you about some writing of mine that has recently been
published
or is available on the web--

1--The first published EXCERPT from my memoir, RADIO ORPHAN
(still in search of a publisher, or an agent if you know of any!),
has just appeared in the NYC based literally magazine called LIT
(more info at www.nsu.newschool.edu/writing/lit

2. I am now writing weekly columns (on a pro-bono basis for the time being
    for the website of THE BIGTAKEOVER, a NYC-based rock magazine named
after a Bad Brains song
    founded 25 years ago by Jack Rabid.
    (www.bigtakeover.com)

3. I just wrote a piece on THANK YOU FOR SMOKING (though it also touches on
CITIZEN RUTH and
    THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA) on my backup blog---
      blog.myspace.com/chris stroffolino
    While I still babble away at
http://blog.myspace.com/continuouspeasant

Do I really expect you to read all of this? NO!

So, Mayday mayday---What's the deal with Mayday?
it used to be a pseudo phallic fertility ritual
but is more known as a cry for help.....
"So When You're Near Me Darling, Can't You Hear me S.O.S
(maybe Neil Martinson will spin that tune by a band whose
English wasn't quite as awkward as mi espanol)---
4 days to Cynco De Mayo), or hear me yell STD!
(but, no, it's not what you think; it's SAVE THE DATE!)
Oh the captain may be sinking but the ship is rolling right along
here in the city of Pirate Bands, Pirate Cat Radio (87.9),
faux Pirate stores run my the mysterious David Eggers,
the entire ABBA meets ARGGGGHHHH staggering genuis of this place--

"Be amazed at the world that others might have missed"
So if you come to the KNOCKOUT (which used to be called the ODEON)
(located where VALENCIA ST. rams into MISSION)
and catch Continuous Peasant (with an altered one-time-only lineup--
we gotta do a quieter acoustic show, and also try to squeeze onto a small
stage)
play with a local band, whose name I'm still trying to figure out,
6 EYE COLUMBIA (and they're at least twice as good as third eye blind),
WE will set some people in the audience up with free BRILLO PADS
(and maybe just maybe a GAVIN NEWSOME PINATA SMASHING!)

It is curious to see that each Pulitzer winner and finalist titles are
devoted to elegy (I assume no one can any longer title anything "American
Sublime" without an ironic and/or elegiac subversion of the concept!)

Elegy as subject and not even a faint nod to the wars! The soldiers coffins
continue to arrive, more or less anonymously, and who can fault the poets
and Pulitzer judges for not being able to acknowledge even the words/facts?

But given the journalistic history of the Pullitzer family, you would think
that, at least, one poetry title would be on top of the news - Iraq,
Katrina, emigration, Cheney-who, etc. We're obviously living in a thick brew
these days, and it particularly grates to hear a publisher's blurb re-invoke
"southern regionalism" for the 400th book in the last blankety-blank years.
I suspect those  folks in the Gulf Coast can't wait to read another such
nostalgic volume, let alone the rest of us. There's obviously much more
eco-southern gothic (hello, Katrina) going on that's unbuckling what ought
to be cranking up a post-nostalgic view of site(region).

Oh well, there will always be Pullitzer. And there will probably be a
Katrina video game, as well, if not already!

tiny world! jack rabid has been a friend of mine for over a decade now. and i have written for "big takeover," though not for quite a while.... i keep meaning to set up an interview with the fiery furnaces but just haven't gotten around to it. mazel tov on the column, and i hope you enjoy it.

wish i could come to the c.p. gig. a trip to your city is not on my next-few-weeks agenda, but it might well be on the next-few-months itinerary.

hope you are very well! also, i submitted an essay to "lit"--at an editor's request--several years ago and then never heard back about it (no response meaning, no). bummer, since she'd asked me for it...but whattya gonna do. i know the editor i speak of is no longer there. presumably the newer editors know how to say, "no, thank you" (or "yes, please!"). i will read your essay. and i do, in fact, have an agent here. who knows what could happen?

best, pam g.

Hi Pam---

Thanks for writing. I actually never met Jack in person but cool that you've
written for him. Would love to see some of your music writing (I guess I
could just google these days...but feel free to direct me to any particular
pieces...)

Yeah it's weird that I sent word of the show to a non-localized list. Sorry
about that. I get all kinds of invites from people, usually, in NYC, so I
guess I'm not too sorry about that.

But definite bummer when people specifically solicit work and then don't
even write back, or even if they do write back and don't use it. It's been
happening to me alot lately. And then there's all these discussions about
how WRITERS are unethical if they want to simultaneously submit---arggh!
It's so strange, about "solicitations" though because alot of editors seem
to solicit either because of 1) name recognition or 2) they have a sense of
a "style," a "type of writing," yet, let's say, a writer (like me, or you)
is writing (and is most passionate about) stuff now that is perhaps in a
different style, one that may take different kinds of risks than the kind of
writing that may have first gotten our name known or something, and the
editor doesn't like, sorry, but I still feel that if the editor doesn't like
the new work we send them, they should still publish it, or never solicit it
in the first place! The risk is on them now. But hardly any one ever calls
'em on it, coz people are cowed by the authority or something (even though
there's no money, etc...). it's even less forgivable when it's a web
magazine! Okay, enough little high horse spiel---

mazel tov on the agent though! that's something---
write back anytime...

Chris

Mainstream

by Michael Magee
Genre: Poetry
$11.00
Paperback: 100 pages

Mainstream // Right from the start, Magees work bristles with the spirit of
improvisation. Everything about it pops: classic poetry chops, a serious
sense of humor, unabashed rawness. Mainstream is thrilling because it can
turn in any direction at any time, moving effortlessly from wacked units of
thought turning inside out to tender moments of highly focused nonsense and
song that get, paradoxically, straight to the point. The frames we bring to
these poems cannot remain intact stanza to stanza -- and in this instability
there are great poetic pleasures and possibilities.
- Drew Gardner

MUSEE MECHANIQUE

by RODNEY KOENEKE
Genre: Poetry
$11.00
Paperback: 88 pages

These poems, like improvised apricots, are capacious enough to embrace gaudy
regalia, sky hooks, Flip Wilson, Jackson Mac Low, wasabi, pizza, evil
dummies, and kitties. Based explicitly on the egg-laying structures of
cicadas with grooved ovipositors, the poems lay bare their devices in the
special way that only a Wetumpkan high on yumyumcha can pull off. Koeneke,
like an oracle asquat his own fissure, has written a book that is
unconscionably nifty-gallifty. Put simply, its CLAM CHOWDER FOR THE SOUL. --

Saw three copies of Chas. Bernstein's _The Sophist_ in
the PHILOSOPHY section of the Barnes & Nobles, 48th
Street & 5th Avenue*, Manhattan, New York City, New
York State, USAmerica.

(*not to be confused with the newer Barnes & Nobles
two or three blocks south on 5th avenue--which a year
or two ago replaced a failed record store--somehow a
b&n so close to the other is supposed to be necessary
and viable?)

I guess it's nice that somebody in the store knew the
word "sophist" in it's classical sense and so assumed
it's a philosophy book. It wouldn't be the front
cover, I don't think, because the painting by Susan
Bee is more playful than what's on the front cover of
most philosophy books.

These merchandisers truly need those words that often
appear at the top left or top right of a book's back
cover that explain what kinda bookerooney it is (I
wonder around when these backcover labels ike "poetry"
"philosophy" "classics/ literature/ philosophy" became
pervasive, because booksellers didn't have much idea
anymore?)

Is this the ultimate Cliff "Flarf" Note?? I've got some vertigo issues, but
this one just about put me over the edge! Fortunately, I've heard Rodney and
I think he's pretty good - "apricots", I don't know, but "apricots" and
"clam chowder", I am sure not. Nada, what a "wetumpkan"! high on what!
Jeezus! Rodney, I am convinced gets it all - it appears to me - from very
carefully, pumping the local  iron.

I'm rearranging my library at the moment and it's giving me a headache (as
well as making me sneeze miserably, o the dust).  Days of tripping over
books I had forgotten we had, and no matter how many orderly shelves I am
making the piles on the floor seem to be just as big. For the first time in
my life I wish there were nice clear labels on every book to tell me where
to to put things. Ok, poetry goes together abc, so that's ok; but does the
biography of Albert Speer go in biographies or with the WW2 histories? And
should they both go with the journalism (Kapuschinski, Fisk, Gellhorn etc)
and should they go with the Chomsky? Or should that go with social
histories? Where do I put the books on boxing? What about the guide to
street drugs? Should Primo Levi go with the memoirs or in the WW2 history
section? Do I put the letters and biographies together or separately? Should
I put Kafka's letters and diaries and notebooks with the biographies or with
the fiction? (I put them with the fiction, also Pavese's, but nobody
else's...but...)

Also now I've taken all the books out there seem to be less shelves than
when they were in them. Or more books. I am thinking of the concept of
L-space. I am quietly going nuts with quandariness.

I am glad I'm not a chain bookstore.

Yesterday, I was reading W. Benjamin's essay about unpacking his library (in Reflections). Reading it might make you feel better, particularly because he was partly a nut about these things.

Thanks to the reorganisation, I actually know where the Benjamin is, so I
will... Is it Benjamin or Calvino who talks about the books he has carried
around for years but not read yet? That's also comforting.

Steve,

Someone may steal your computer? You may be tied to your bed post? Go to a deserted sand beach in the Middle of the Pacific where atolls prevent any signals to be picked up? Insert AOl software in your computer which will screw up everything and it will take more than a month to straighten it? Join a monastery where there is a vow of non-computer use? Have so much sex that you have no energy or desire for anything else?

Murat

"In 2005, Professor Emerson was chosen by U.S. Poet Laureate Ted Kooser as
one of two Witter Bynner Fellows in Poetry for that year. She has earned
three Pulitzer Prize nominations, and in 2003 was named Outstanding Young
Faculty Member at the University of Mary Washington."
(http://profcast.org/?p=3)

At a small conference at Mary Washington last month, I talked about
Harryette Mullen's Sleeping with the Dictionary.  Claudia (a friend of a
friend--definitely in the "official verse culture" but still a nice person)
attended--she had never heard of Harryette Mullen before reading the title
of my paper in the program, an unfamiliarity mirrored by the questions about
Emerson that have come to the list.  I assume almost everyone on this list
knows of Mullen's work; I think of it as important, even essential.  There
doesn't seem to be much exchange between different groups of readers and
writers, not even knowing who the others are.

Hello again, Stephen. Here we go: religious verse at a Marxist
convention. I cannot avoid thinking that Americans--poets included--may
indeed give a damn but have come to feel as powerless as the rest of us.
What does a poet do? Grab a .30-06, go into the hills, and become a
partisan? Then ask Muley's question in /The Grapes of Wrath/: "Who do I
shoot?" There's no answer because no one person is in charge. It's all
anonymous and corporatized. Maybe do what Wilfred Owen said: /Warn/. So
what? Warn what and warn who? Owen's and Sassoon's poetry didn't prevent
or even postpone World War II. Nor did Kollwitz's art. Erich Maria
Remarque did not turn the Germans against militarism. And /O The
Chimneys/ probably did not make Pol Pot think twice. It was and remains
all "faith-based," maybe the god is what Ginsburg called Moloch. What
has C.K. Williams changed since "In The Heart of the Beast" in 1970?
I'm tired of having my consciousness raised.  Baraka in his LeRoi Jones
incarnation wrote that if Bessie Smith had killed some white people she
wouldn't have needed those songs.  I hate to sound "results-oriented,"
I'm at the end of a long and failed career in business, but what do any
of the demands for a political and/or kinetic art actually accomplish?
What do we get?  Tennyson's "Charge," Kipling's "White Man's Burden," or
on the positive side Lowell's "Inauguration Day 1953"? So. What.

No, this is not defeatism.  It's defeat. It is recognizing that some
people just don't get moved to Art via a war or a flood or the manifest
racism and indifference of a government nominally presided over by a
mean-spirited drunk with an eschatological fixation enabled by his
various controllers. In the end our own itty-bitty lives may be our best
subject, and  sometimes you get out of the fight simply to save your
sanity and your ass because you're tired of Mike Tyson pounding the
latter into the canvas.

Do not mistake me: I am frustrated by what has been done to my country
by that walking bag of dysfunctions.  It could be there is a growing
sense that individuals--even massed into a "bloc"--have been
outmaneuvered, that vox populi has has its vocal cords removed by a diet
of shit entertainment, trivia, and "my country's always right and never
wrong" rah-rah. At some point the hands go up in the air.

Sam Hamill summoned forth the poets three years ago. Thank God for him
and George Bush because they got me to break a 2-year silence and write
again. I wrote for and participated in a reading at Brookdale Community
College in New Jersey.  One of my students found out and backed away
from me, then stopped coming to my class.  I had become poisonous. At
least the kid picked a side. The easy side, true, the side of Rah-Rah
Yea Team Remember 9/11 Kill the Towelheads. A side. /A bi gezint./

Something has changed.  I watched a PBS documentary last night on the
San Francisco earthquake (100 years today) and was fascinated.  These
people had the living crap beaten out of them, they suffered a disaster
at least as bad as Katrina. The US Gov't kicked in a million bucks, yes,
but most of the equity came from the residents, and from people who
emigrated into the ruins of the city to clear the rubble and rebuild.
Within 3 years San Francisco was functional again.  It had gone from
Dresden to San Francisco.  Something has gone wrong here.  A hundred
years later nobody can take a crap without a government grant and
everyone is busy pointing fingers.

Even more fascinating was what followed it: a docu on the Armenian
Genocide.  You really do what to turn your head away.  The only writer I
know of before the last several years who had the courage to own was his
countrymen did was Nazim Hikmet.  Maybe we need a Hikmet who is willing
to have his life broken in prison because he will call vileness where he
sees it.

The fact we remember his name may give everything I've said the lie.
Which is fine with me.

Enough of this aria.

Your statement reveals you know nothing about the situation. We have yet to receive any federal monies that were promised in rebuilding. It took eight months for my family to just receive our insurance money on our destroyed home. Eight months...and who exactly do you think has been doing the work and keeping the city alive while they quibble up in Washington about whose to blame?  And specifically what destroyed New Orleans was not a natural disaster, but a man made one.

and part of this has to di with the presses involved -- until SLEEPING WITH
THE DICTIONARY, all of Mullen's work was at small presses -- even very
small presses --

Still, given the post-MUSE & DRUDGE popularity of Harryette's work, you
really would have to be awfully insular not to have heard of her -- she
seems to be one of those for whom the mainstream might be willing to make
an occasional exception --

Whoever tasked me about the New Orleans comments was quite correct.  I
know jackshit about what happened "on the ground" in New Orleans.  That
was an irrelevant digression and it showed.

For the rest...poetry, power, warnings, change, blah-blah...not a
retraction, not a one.

In the days when I could cajole Barnes & Noble stores into carrying my books
by dong readings at them, I found that my fiction invariably got placed on
the same shelf as my poetry. Explaining to the staff that people looking for
my fiction might not look in the poetry section (and vice-versa) got me
nowhere. And the books specified fiction or poetry on the corner of the back
cover. Go figure.

Hello, hello--

Deadline for the Vincent Chin prize isJune 1, 2006.  Please feel free to=
 forward widely.

Best,
Sarah


***************************************************************

The Vincent Chin Memorial Chapbook Prize


Deadline:  June 30, 2006

On June 19, 1982, in Detroit, Vincent Chin was beaten to death with a
baseball bat by a man and his stepson. The two laid-off autoworkers
mistook Chin for Japanese =97 an Asian group they blamed for the ailing =
U.S.
auto industry. The assailants never served jail time, and later federal
civil-rights courts acquitted them entirely of the crime.

For many today, this is a rarely remembered footnote in American history=
.
However, the tragedy of Vincent Chin marked an important change in how
Asian Americans viewed themselves. It was the first time, according to A=
PA
advocates and academics, that people who traced their ancestry to
different countries in Asia and the Pacific Islands crossed ethnic and
socioeconomic lines to fight [politically] as a united group of Asian
Pacific Americans. They were Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Filipino; th=
ey
were waiters, lawyers, and grandmothers who were moved to action by what=

happened to Vincent Chin.

For the first time, Asian Americans banded together against the
discrimination and racism directed toward the APA community.  Decades
later, the need for Asian Americans to unite as a population and to
project a voice into the cultural mainstream is as urgent as ever.

In honor of Vincent Chin and this watershed moment in Asian American
history, Kundiman and Barrow Street are sponsoring The Vincent Chin
Memorial Chapbook Prize. This annual prize is an opportunity for both
Kundiman and Barrow Street to support and spotlight the talent of an
emerging Asian American poet, a new voice in the landscape of Asian
American _expression and power.

Winner will receive:
=95        $500 cash prize
=95        Chapbook publication in Barrow Street:
http://www.barrowstreet.org/journal.html
=95        Full scholarship to the 2007 Kundiman Summer Retreat

Applicant Eligibility
Asian American poets who have not published more than one book of
forty-eight pages or more.

Entry Fee
Check for $15.00 payable to The New York Foundation for the Arts

As mIEKAL aND so succinctly put it:

Had it been my books in the dump bin outside the door, I'd have scarfed them
up and redistributed them to a place where a better price might have been
had.  Is that double-dipping?

this is apparently another misunderstanding like the Nobel Peace Prize
nomination

you can nominate anyone with a book for a Pulizer (although 00 didn't read
closely -- might have to be avail both hardcover and softcover -- nota bene
pod publishers, exercise the hardcover option); being nominated (which the
current winner was, even after her first book) means about as much as being
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize or a Pushcart prize or for Queen of the
May.

So the problem is us, for not bothering to nominate anyone -- it seems
obvious that the Pulitzer Poetry field is pretty limited due to everyone's
sheer laziness

All best,
Catherine Daly
about to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize

To clarify: we do announce the reader, mentioning their triumphs and accolades DURING the reading but not as an exterior media device to gain an audience. To make the audience happy about their superior decision making process is always necessary and a gratuitous bio interspersed with tall tales and jokes seems to accomplish this quite nicely. Of course, the author likes to be given Kudos for their myriad of accomplishments, such as creating the quintessential American flatulence poem, and, in general, reads on a higher planar level if treated in this manner.

 If we were to start a new practice of fortelling expected forays into the archetypal  resonantial effects of future poetic endeavors and prizes that would be something truly, experimentally, memorable. I would be willing to try that Derek but I have decided to head to a rural locale, write another novel in a hovel, and run the series in abstentia.But I will keep it in mind.

Who:  Rosmarie Waldrop; author of /Blindsight/, /The Lawn of the Excluded
Middle/, /Reproduction of Profiles/, /Love Like Pronouns/, and many others;
translator of the work of Edmond Jabes, Paul Celan, and Emmanuel Hocquard;
editor of Burning Deck Press; left a German circus at eleven to become one of
the US's finest living poets.

Who:  Emmanuel Hocquard; author of /Theory of Tables/ (translated by Michael
Palmer), /Aereas in the Forests of Manhattan/ (translated by Lydia Davis), /A
Test of Solitude/ (translated by Rosmarie Waldrop), among others; director of Un
Bureau sur l'Atlantique; invites US poets to weeks long retreats in French
chateaus to translate poetry, eat, drink wine, and sleep.

Who:  Juliette Valéry; author of /Le bolide immobile an centre de l’écran/ and,
with Emmanuel Hocquard, /L’année du goujon and Les oranges de Saint-Michel/;
translator into French of American poets such as Cole Swensen, Norma Cole,
Rosemarie Waldrop, Keith Waldrop, Jackson Mac Low, Robert Creeley, Juliana
Spahr, Charles Bernstein, Michael Davidson, and Michael Palmer; teaches at the
École Supérieure d’Art et Céramique.

What:  Desert City Poetry Series, French and English, Bi-lingual, by George.

When:  This Saturday, April 22nd, 8:00pm, 2006, the only one this year.

Where:  Internationalist Books, 405 W. Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, NC, Thrill
on the Hill.

How much:  $2 dollar donation is requested to support the readers and series.

Why:  "From no point of the /canale/ is it possible to see / the burnt stump.
Not because of the hedge-row. / Because a word is missing."  "Still, depth of
field allows the mind to drift beyond its negative pole to sun catching on a
maple leaf already red in August, already thinner, more translucent, preparing
to strip off all that separates it from its smooth skeleton. Beautiful,
flamboyant phrase that trails off without predicate, intending disappearance by
approaching it, a toss in the air."

See you there.....

Thanks for a great 05/06 season!!!

Stay tuned for news of next seasons readings!

I put a ruler in my handbag, having heard men talk about their sex. Now we have
correct measurements and a stickiness between collar and neck. It is one thing
to insert yourself into a mirror, but quite another to get your image out again
and have your errors pass for objectivity. Vitreous. As in humor. A change in
perspective is caused by the clarity by the ciliary muscle, but need not be
conciliatory. Still, the eye is a camera, room for everything that is to enter,
like the cylinder called the satisfaction of hollow space. Only language grows
such grass-green grass.

from /A Test of Solitude/
by Emmanuel Hocquard (translated by Rosmarie Waldrop)

This chronicle contains all the words that
stake out the route from the hut to the burnt
stump except one.
The one that is missing.  What properties do
the stump and the /canale/ have in common?
/Memories/:  of the chalk pond traced in the
grass and of the ancient cedar uprooted by the
storm.
/Italy: canale/ is an Italian word designating a
long rectangular pond, and the burning of the
stump is a technique brought from Rome.
Two properties in common is not enough.
At least one more is missing.
The missing /word./

Passwords: Gillian Conoley on Henri Michaux
Tuesday, April 18, 7pm
Poets House, 72 Spring Street, 2nd Floor, NYC
$7, Free for Poets House Members


Gillian Conoley's talk on Henri Michaux (1899-1984), one of the most
original and admired French writers and artists of the 20th century, will
briefly encompass the arc of his career-the more than 30 books of poems,
prose poems, narratives and journals, including the 11-year writing
experiment while taking mescaline. The talk will more fully focus on
Michaux's relentless exploration of the repressed side of Western
conciousness, an obsession which lead him to a concurrent search for a tool
of communication that was up to the task. Of particular interest is
Michaux's fascination with universal languages. Late in his life, moving
restlessly between lines, silences, colors and rhythms in both his poetic
and visual work, Michaux begins to work from the model of the Chinese
ideogram, seeking and devising a new language of pure lines that would
communicate without the trappings of convention.

Gillian Conoley's most recent book is Profane Halo with Verse Press/Wave
Books. She is Poet-in-Residence and Professor of English at Sonoma State
University, where she is the founder and editor of Volt.

Join us this Thursday, April 20th as we celebrate the launch of
Darkness Spoken, the remarkable new collection of Ingeborg Bachmann's
poetry. Though Bachmann is recognized alongside Paul Celan as one of
the finest German language poets of the post-war era, dozens of her
poems remained unpublished until award-winning translator Peter
Filkins put together this volume.

We're thrilled to launch this beautiful and important book and hope
you'll join in on the festivities!

R.S.V.P. to davey.volner@gmail.com if you can attend and we'll see you at

  RICHARD WILBUR WINS 2006 LILLY PRIZE

            $100,000 Award One of Largest to Poets

=20

Chicago -- Poet and translator Richard Wilbur has won the 2006 Ruth =
Lilly
Poetry Prize. Established in 1986, the prize is one of the most =
prestigious
given to American poets, and at $100,000 it is one of the nation's =
largest
literary honors. Christian Wiman, editor of Poetry magazine and chair of =
the
selection committee, made the announcement today. The prize will be
presented at an evening ceremony at the Arts Club in Chicago on May =
25th.

=20

In announcing the award, Wiman said: "If you had to put all your money =
on
one living poet whose work will be read in a hundred years, Richard =
Wilbur
would be a good bet. He has written some of the most memorable poems of =
our
time, and his achievement rivals that of great American poets like =
Robert
Frost and Elizabeth Bishop."

=20

Richard Wilbur has published over two-dozen poems in Poetry since his =
first
appearance in the magazine in February 1948. Wilbur has served as Poet
Laureate of the United States and his many other honors include two =
Pulitzer
Prizes, the National Book Award, and the Bollingen Translation Prize. He
lives with his wife, Charlotte, in Cummington, Massachusetts.=20

=20

Born in New York City on March 1, 1921, Wilbur grew up on a New Jersey =
farm,
was educated at Amherst and Harvard, and served with the 36th Infantry
Division. He was a member of the prestigious Harvard Fellows and taught
there until 1954, when he moved to Wellesley and then to Wesleyan
University. From Wesleyan he went to Smith as writer-in-residence. In =
1987
he was named the second Poet Laureate of the U.S., following Robert Penn
Warren.

=20

"No contemporary poet has brought so much lived experience into such
formally perfect poems as Richard Wilbur. Entering a Wilbur poem is a =
deeply
civil and civilizing experience, from which we emerge better human =
beings,"
said John Barr, president of the Poetry Foundation. "The Poetry =
Foundation
is pleased to represent Ruth Lilly, once again, in giving this major =
award
to a poet as extraordinary as Wilbur."

=20

Wilbur began to write poetry in earnest only after experiencing the =
horrific
chaos of battle during WW II service as an infantryman in Italy. No poet =
of
his generation has been more committed to careful, organized expression =
or
has more thoroughly mastered the forms and devices of traditional =
poetry;
this conservative aesthetic and his deep love for "country things" link
Wilbur to the Roman poet Horace and to his fellow American Robert Frost. =
He
has also produced sparkling, witty translations of classic French drama =
and
several books for children.

=20

Wilbur's books of poetry include New and Collected Poems (1988), which =
won
the Pulitzer Prize; The Mind-Reader: New Poems (1976); Walking to Sleep: =
New
Poems and Translations (1969); Advice to a Prophet and Other Poems =
(1961);
Things of This World (1956), for which he received the Pulitzer Prize =
and
the National Book Award; Ceremony and Other Poems (1950); and The =
Beautiful
Changes and Other Poems (1947). Richard Wilbur's Collected Poems =
1943-2004
was published in 2004.

=20

Judges for the 2006 prize were poets Linda Gregerson, Don Paterson, and
Christian Wiman.=20

"A Barred Owl"

by Richard Wilbur=20

=20

The warping night-air having brought the boom

Of an owl's voice into her darkened room,

We tell the wakened child that all she heard

Was an odd question from a forest bird,

Asking of us, if rightly listened to,

"Who cooks for you?" and then "Who cooks for you?"

=20

Words, which can make our terrors bravely clear,

Can also thus domesticate a fear,

And send a small child back to sleep at night

Not listening for the sound of stealthy flight

Or dreaming of some small thing in a claw

Borne up to some dark branch and eaten raw.

About the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize

=20

American poetry has no greater friend than Ruth Lilly. Over many years =
and
in many ways, it has been blessed by her personal generosity. In 1985 =
she
endowed the Ruth Lilly Professorship in Poetry at Indiana University. In
1989 she created two Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowships, for $15,000 each, =
given
annually by the Poetry Foundation to undergraduate or graduate students
selected through a national competition. In 2002 her lifetime engagement
with poetry culminated in a magnificent bequest that will enable the =
Poetry
Foundation to promote, in perpetuity, a vigorous presence for poetry in =
our
culture.=20

=20

The Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize honors a living U.S. poet whose lifetime
accomplishments warrant extraordinary recognition. Established in 1986 =
by
Ruth Lilly, the annual prize is sponsored and administered by the Poetry
Foundation, publisher of Poetry magazine. Over the last twenty years, =
the
Lilly prize has awarded over $1,000,000. Previous recipients of the Ruth
Lilly Prize are Adrienne Rich, Philip Levine, Anthony Hecht, Mona Van =
Duyn,
Hayden Carruth, David Wagoner, John Ashbery, Charles Wright, Donald =
Hall, A.
R. Ammons, Gerald Stern, William Matthews, W. S. Merwin, Maxine Kumin, =
Carl
Dennis, Yusef Komunyakaa, Lisel Mueller, Linda Pastan, Kay Ryan, and =
C.K.
Williams.

About the Poetry Foundation

=20

The Poetry Foundation, publisher of Poetry magazine and one of the =
largest
literary organizations in the world, exists to discover and celebrate =
the
best poetry and to place it before the largest possible audience. The =
Poetry
Foundation seeks to be a leader in shaping a receptive climate for =
poetry by

Founded in Chicago by Harriet Monroe in 1912, Poetry is the oldest =
monthly
devoted to verse in the English-speaking world. Harriet Monroe's "Open =
Door"
policy, set forth in Volume I of the magazine, remains the most succinct
statement of Poetry's mission: to print the best poetry written today, =
in
whatever style, genre, or approach. The magazine established its =
reputation
early by publishing the first important poems of T. S. Eliot, Ezra =
Pound,
Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Carl Sandburg, =
and
other now-classic authors. In succeeding decades it has presented--often =
for
the first time--works by virtually every significant poet of the 20th
century.

With something like 1,000 books published a year, it's impossible to keep u=
p with every poet. And I don't feel much pressure to try. Even with, for me=
, a hefty buying cycle (about 25 books of poetry), I miss most things (well=
 something like 975 things, I guess). I'll look Claudia Emerson up, because=
 she seems to be the one ordained by the OVC.  It's fun to peek over the fe=
nce and see what they're up to over in their yard, every now and then. If t=
hey're grilling out, maybe I can sneak a hot dog or something.=20

I am thinking it would be also nice if the Poetry Foundation - in
association with a genuinely ecumenical group of judges (maybe lots of luck
on that) - could provide 10 grants of 10K  for poets over 45 to be placed in
IRA accounts that could not be opened until  the age of 62.5. The proviso
for consideration would be that these would be awarded to poets who have
somehow survived as adjuncts or in job situations without any form of
pension accounts.

Wouldn't this be an interesting and useful distribution of family wealth?

Just thinking,

Hey, I'm eligible for that one, Stephen--and the money could bypass
the IRA and go right into my checking account.

In short, I'm for it. And sooner is better than later.

  RICHARD WILBUR WINS 2006 LILLY PRIZE

            $100,000 Award One of Largest to Poets



Chicago -- Poet and translator Richard Wilbur has won the 2006 Ruth Lilly
Poetry Prize. Established in 1986, the prize is one of the most prestigious
given to American poets, and at $100,000 it is one of the nation's largest
literary honors. Christian Wiman, editor of Poetry magazine and chair of the
selection committee, made the announcement today. The prize will be
presented at an evening ceremony at the Arts Club in Chicago on May 25th.



In announcing the award, Wiman said: "If you had to put all your money on
one living poet whose work will be read in a hundred years, Richard Wilbur
would be a good bet. He has written some of the most memorable poems of our
time, and his achievement rivals that of great American poets like Robert
Frost and Elizabeth Bishop."



Richard Wilbur has published over two-dozen poems in Poetry since his first
appearance in the magazine in February 1948. Wilbur has served as Poet
Laureate of the United States and his many other honors include two Pulitzer
Prizes, the National Book Award, and the Bollingen Translation Prize. He
lives with his wife, Charlotte, in Cummington, Massachusetts.



Born in New York City on March 1, 1921, Wilbur grew up on a New Jersey farm,
was educated at Amherst and Harvard, and served with the 36th Infantry
Division. He was a member of the prestigious Harvard Fellows and taught
there until 1954, when he moved to Wellesley and then to Wesleyan
University. From Wesleyan he went to Smith as writer-in-residence. In 1987
he was named the second Poet Laureate of the U.S., following Robert Penn
Warren.



"No contemporary poet has brought so much lived experience into such
formally perfect poems as Richard Wilbur. Entering a Wilbur poem is a deeply
civil and civilizing experience, from which we emerge better human beings,"
said John Barr, president of the Poetry Foundation. "The Poetry Foundation
is pleased to represent Ruth Lilly, once again, in giving this major award
to a poet as extraordinary as Wilbur."



Wilbur began to write poetry in earnest only after experiencing the horrific
chaos of battle during WW II service as an infantryman in Italy. No poet of
his generation has been more committed to careful, organized expression or
has more thoroughly mastered the forms and devices of traditional poetry;
this conservative aesthetic and his deep love for "country things" link
Wilbur to the Roman poet Horace and to his fellow American Robert Frost. He
has also produced sparkling, witty translations of classic French drama and
several books for children.



Wilbur's books of poetry include New and Collected Poems (1988), which won
the Pulitzer Prize; The Mind-Reader: New Poems (1976); Walking to Sleep: New
Poems and Translations (1969); Advice to a Prophet and Other Poems (1961);
Things of This World (1956), for which he received the Pulitzer Prize and
the National Book Award; Ceremony and Other Poems (1950); and The Beautiful
Changes and Other Poems (1947). Richard Wilbur's Collected Poems 1943-2004
was published in 2004.



Judges for the 2006 prize were poets Linda Gregerson, Don Paterson, and
Christian Wiman.



"A Barred Owl"

The warping night-air having brought the boom

About the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize



American poetry has no greater friend than Ruth Lilly. Over many years and
in many ways, it has been blessed by her personal generosity. In 1985 she
endowed the Ruth Lilly Professorship in Poetry at Indiana University. In
1989 she created two Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowships, for $15,000 each, given
annually by the Poetry Foundation to undergraduate or graduate students
selected through a national competition. In 2002 her lifetime engagement
with poetry culminated in a magnificent bequest that will enable the Poetry
Foundation to promote, in perpetuity, a vigorous presence for poetry in our
culture.



The Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize honors a living U.S. poet whose lifetime
accomplishments warrant extraordinary recognition. Established in 1986 by
Ruth Lilly, the annual prize is sponsored and administered by the Poetry
Foundation, publisher of Poetry magazine. Over the last twenty years, the
Lilly prize has awarded over $1,000,000. Previous recipients of the Ruth
Lilly Prize are Adrienne Rich, Philip Levine, Anthony Hecht, Mona Van Duyn,
Hayden Carruth, David Wagoner, John Ashbery, Charles Wright, Donald Hall, A.
R. Ammons, Gerald Stern, William Matthews, W. S. Merwin, Maxine Kumin, Carl
Dennis, Yusef Komunyakaa, Lisel Mueller, Linda Pastan, Kay Ryan, and C.K.
Williams.



About the Poetry Foundation

Founded in Chicago by Harriet Monroe in 1912, Poetry is the oldest monthly
devoted to verse in the English-speaking world. Harriet Monroe's "Open Door"
policy, set forth in Volume I of the magazine, remains the most succinct
statement of Poetry's mission: to print the best poetry written today, in
whatever style, genre, or approach. The magazine established its reputation
early by publishing the first important poems of T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound,
Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Carl Sandburg, and
other now-classic authors. In succeeding decades it has presented--often for
the first time--works by virtually every significant poet of the 20th
century.

Public Lecture with Feminist Scholar and Activist
Silvia Federici
Witch-hunting and Violence Against Women in Capitalist Globalization
April 25
7-9 pm SFU Harbour Centre
(515 West Hastings)
Room 1700

Against the background of the 16th and 17th-century witch-hunts, Federici
examines why the rise of a capitalist world economy has required a war
against women. She argues that the devaluation and subjugation of women is
a structural feature of every phase of globalization, down to the present.

Silvia Federici is a feminist scholar, teacher and activist. She has
taught and lectured in many colleges and universities in Europe, Africa
and North America and was until recently Prof. of Philosophy and
International Studies New College of Hofstra University. She has written
many books and articles on women's work and social struggle from "Wages
Against Housework" (1974) to "Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body and
Primitive Accumulation" (2004). She is presently a coordinator of the
Committee for Academic Freedom in Africa and a former coordinator of the
Radical Philosophy Association's Anti-Death Penalty Project.

The Kootenay School of Writing is pleased to present a poetry reading by
Mark Nowak at Spartacus Books on Sunday 30 April 2006, 7 p.m. sharp.
(319 West Hastings)

MARK NOWAK is a radical poet out of St. Paul, Minnesota, who does
multidisciplinary work in anthropology, poetry and poetics, cultural
studies, and photography. His two poetry books are "Revenants" (2000) and
"Shut Up Shut Down" (2004), both published by Coffee House Press. His
innovative documentary poems demarcate stresses of race and class, and
constitute a working-class literature that focuses on the effects of
deindustrialization and globalization. "Shut Up Shut Down" is a
particularly sharp critique that engages with the ideology of
globalization; contains a foreword by Amiri Baraka.

Nowak is also the editor of the journal "Xcp: Cross-Cultural Poetics".
He's also edited Theodore Enslin's "Then, and Now: Selected Poems
1943--1993" (National Poetry Foundation), and with Diane Glancy was
co-editor for "Visit Teepee Town: Native Writings After the Detours"
(Coffee House Press). He currently works as an Associate Professor of
Humanities at the College of St. Catherine in Minneapolis, where he
teaches creative writing, folklore, and documentary studies.

This event is open to the public; admission by donation on a sliding scale
 of $3--$5.

   RICHARD WILBUR WINS 2006 LILLY PRIZE

             $100,000 Award One of Largest to Poets



Chicago -- Poet and translator Richard Wilbur has won the 2006 Ruth Lilly
Poetry Prize. Established in 1986, the prize is one of the most prestigious
given to American poets, and at $100,000 it is one of the nation's largest
literary honors. Christian Wiman, editor of Poetry magazine and chair of the
selection committee, made the announcement today. The prize will be
presented at an evening ceremony at the Arts Club in Chicago on May 25th.



In announcing the award, Wiman said: "If you had to put all your money on
one living poet whose work will be read in a hundred years, Richard Wilbur
would be a good bet. He has written some of the most memorable poems of our
time, and his achievement rivals that of great American poets like Robert
Frost and Elizabeth Bishop."



Richard Wilbur has published over two-dozen poems in Poetry since his first
appearance in the magazine in February 1948. Wilbur has served as Poet
Laureate of the United States and his many other honors include two Pulitzer
Prizes, the National Book Award, and the Bollingen Translation Prize. He
lives with his wife, Charlotte, in Cummington, Massachusetts.



Born in New York City on March 1, 1921, Wilbur grew up on a New Jersey farm,
was educated at Amherst and Harvard, and served with the 36th Infantry
Division. He was a member of the prestigious Harvard Fellows and taught
there until 1954, when he moved to Wellesley and then to Wesleyan
University. From Wesleyan he went to Smith as writer-in-residence. In 1987
he was named the second Poet Laureate of the U.S., following Robert Penn
Warren.



"No contemporary poet has brought so much lived experience into such
formally perfect poems as Richard Wilbur. Entering a Wilbur poem is a deeply
civil and civilizing experience, from which we emerge better human beings,"
said John Barr, president of the Poetry Foundation. "The Poetry Foundation
is pleased to represent Ruth Lilly, once again, in giving this major award
to a poet as extraordinary as Wilbur."



Wilbur began to write poetry in earnest only after experiencing the horrific
chaos of battle during WW II service as an infantryman in Italy. No poet of
his generation has been more committed to careful, organized expression or
has more thoroughly mastered the forms and devices of traditional poetry;
this conservative aesthetic and his deep love for "country things" link
Wilbur to the Roman poet Horace and to his fellow American Robert Frost. He
has also produced sparkling, witty translations of classic French drama and
several books for children.



Wilbur's books of poetry include New and Collected Poems (1988), which won
the Pulitzer Prize; The Mind-Reader: New Poems (1976); Walking to Sleep: New
Poems and Translations (1969); Advice to a Prophet and Other Poems (1961);
Things of This World (1956), for which he received the Pulitzer Prize and
the National Book Award; Ceremony and Other Poems (1950); and The Beautiful
Changes and Other Poems (1947). Richard Wilbur's Collected Poems 1943-2004
was published in 2004.



Judges for the 2006 prize were poets Linda Gregerson, Don Paterson, and
Christian Wiman.



"A Barred Owl"

by Richard Wilbur



The warping night-air having brought the boom

Of an owl's voice into her darkened room,

We tell the wakened child that all she heard

Was an odd question from a forest bird,

Asking of us, if rightly listened to,

"Who cooks for you?" and then "Who cooks for you?"



Words, which can make our terrors bravely clear,

Can also thus domesticate a fear,

And send a small child back to sleep at night

Not listening for the sound of stealthy flight

Or dreaming of some small thing in a claw

Borne up to some dark branch and eaten raw.

About the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize



American poetry has no greater friend than Ruth Lilly. Over many years and
in many ways, it has been blessed by her personal generosity. In 1985 she
endowed the Ruth Lilly Professorship in Poetry at Indiana University. In
1989 she created two Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowships, for $15,000 each, given
annually by the Poetry Foundation to undergraduate or graduate students
selected through a national competition. In 2002 her lifetime engagement
with poetry culminated in a magnificent bequest that will enable the Poetry
Foundation to promote, in perpetuity, a vigorous presence for poetry in our
culture.



The Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize honors a living U.S. poet whose lifetime
accomplishments warrant extraordinary recognition. Established in 1986 by
Ruth Lilly, the annual prize is sponsored and administered by the Poetry
Foundation, publisher of Poetry magazine. Over the last twenty years, the
Lilly prize has awarded over $1,000,000. Previous recipients of the Ruth
Lilly Prize are Adrienne Rich, Philip Levine, Anthony Hecht, Mona Van Duyn,
Hayden Carruth, David Wagoner, John Ashbery, Charles Wright, Donald Hall, A.
R. Ammons, Gerald Stern, William Matthews, W. S. Merwin, Maxine Kumin, Carl
Dennis, Yusef Komunyakaa, Lisel Mueller, Linda Pastan, Kay Ryan, and C.K.
Williams.



About the Poetry Foundation



The Poetry Foundation, publisher of Poetry magazine and one of the largest
literary organizations in the world, exists to discover and celebrate the

Founded in Chicago by Harriet Monroe in 1912, Poetry is the oldest monthly
devoted to verse in the English-speaking world. Harriet Monroe's "Open Door"
policy, set forth in Volume I of the magazine, remains the most succinct
statement of Poetry's mission: to print the best poetry written today, in
whatever style, genre, or approach. The magazine established its reputation
early by publishing the first important poems of T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound,
Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Carl Sandburg, and
other now-classic authors. In succeeding decades it has presented--often for
the first time--works by virtually every significant poet of the 20th
century.

Yes, this [The Poetry Reading: A Contemporary Compendium on Language &
Performance, edited by Stephen Vincent and Ellen Zweig] is definitely *the*
book to pair with Bernstein's Close Listening.  (Adelaide Morris's Sound
States is also good.)  It's substantial (at 350 pp.) and wide-ranging, with
sections on "Histories," "Oral Sources" (with an interesting piece from
Stephen on Ogoja poetics), "Performance," "Video," "Disc & Cassette,"
"Sound" and "The Argument for the Page."  The photo of Silliman in white
pants reading Ketjak on the street behind a Mickey Mouse balloon is worth
the price of admission alone.  Selections are diachronic in a stimulating
way (Thoreau rubbing shoulders with Antin) while there's a good
contextualization and history of the period: in particular, Vincent's
introductory essay, "Poetry Readings/ Reading Poetry: San Francisco Bay
Area, 1958-1980," is informative and a real eye-opener.  One gets a more
lively picture of the Bay Area scene (especially during the
seventies)--ecumenical, simmering with politics, and cross-arts
traffic--than the one telescoped through the narratives of Beat, San Fran.
Renaissance & "language" writing.  Other histories, by Alta ("The First
All-Women's Poetry Reading"), Thulani Nkabinde Davis ("Known Renegades:
Recent Black/ Brown/ Yellow"), and Victor Hernandez Cruz ("Europuehsi")
widen the picture considerably.  But it isn't only Bay Area: there's a very
illuminating short history, perhaps the first of its kind, of "The Circuit/
New York City Public Readings," by Harry Lewis.  The section on sound
poetry, with essays/notes by Amirkhanian, Morrow, McCaffery and Wendt offers
a nice slice (especially Wendt's account of the 1978 Toronto Sound Poetry
Festival), as does the section on page/ concrete poetry, with examples of
printing by Butler, Johnston, Teter & Myers (we get the typographers' witty
"Menu Appendix" from William Caxton by Zephyrus Image), and Ron Sukenik's
piece "Against Reading."  But the section on "Performance" may be the most
lively part (with a sense that the "Happening" is still happening, for the
editors), where it's interesting to come across someone as far from poetry
nowadays as Oliveros.  And, yes, co-editor Ellen Zweig's curious bit of
ethnography, "Where is the Piece? An Account of a Talk by David Antin," is
probably the best "reading" report I have ever read.  It's got a funny chart
of who was sitting where [it was an 80 Langton St. event] and a close
analysis of the power play in the interactions between Antin and his
audience, with special attention to gender issues.  There's also a response
from Antin.  It would be nice to see the same kind of close attention
informing the current/ recurring debate about readings on this list. Vincent
and Zweig's The Poetry Reading is a valuable text I consult often (since it
fell into my hands), and sometimes use for teaching.  $25 might seem like a
lot, but it's well worth it: snap it up!

There's an interesting party I went to in Harbin. Held for reason of marriage. Dad stands at the door while fellas in black suits deliver payolla, or grease for family relations, and some even refer to the Godfather. Now, this is very fuedalistic. But, Harbin's this strange mix of Russian, Japanese, Manchu, Mongol, Han and occasional expat (big fellas, from places called Darwin, white skin, pale, wearing b-ball jerseys numbered: "00" and, beer bellied drinkers). And the Manchu never bound their feet (and the people in the province are a beautiful mix of things, let me say) -- but anyway, it was what I might liken to a banquet of Orcs. In India, and seems to me I remember a case in the US during the nineties, extremely endangered wildlife is being hunted illegally by traders working for a Chinese-driven market with very different cultural values. Tigers, the parts easily found in Beijing and Dalian, are used in what is called TCM (and to a large extent, I would argue, is a far
ce,
 which is not to say what I might about pharmaceutical companies and lobbyists-- but that's a different argument). Japanese! The food is refined, he said. And they have style.

oh, and what is not used in TCM is eaten -- all of it -- turned into something and munched on. Quite complicated topic. Yes, rhino and monkey, and in "recent" times

Kind of reminds me of my high school textbooks in English (I believe I am
the only one to have read the whole thing). When you got to modern poetry,
anonymous poems of a similar vein popped out of the pages.

ABOUT THE FLARFLIST COLLECTIVE
Launched in May of 2001 by six poets, the Flarflist Collective is dedicated
to the exploration of “the inappropriate” in all of its guises. Poets mine
the Internet with odd search terms then distill the results into often
hilarious and sometimes disturbing poems, plays, and other texts.

I used "dong readings" to pass myself off as a former male stripper, hoping
that women who watch them in bars would attend my readings with great
anticipation and buy my poetry books before they opened the cover.
Naturally, I expected to make the NYT Best Seller list.



Unfortunately, the success rate was exactly the same as if I had just been
"doing readings" at the same bookstores and not making typos years after the
readings had happened.



Of course, you could consider the term as a special psychic technique for
reading the future of males and set up shop. But you won't sell any books
that way and might bring the morals squad crashing through your door.

I ought to challenge Christian Wiman to a debate and drinking contest.

After reading his quote on Richard Wilbur I was so insensed by the silliness
but this is the same man who said that Phillip Larkin and Donald Justice are
the neglected poets of recent times.

God, I hope they remain so because they are so banal but that fits the
magazine that once published Ezra Pound and now publishes blandness.

Imagine, Wiman said:

"If you had to put all your money on one living poet whose work will be read
in a hundred years,
Richard Wilbur would be a good bet."

Oh really?

Look at Wilbur's contemporaries and who he is dissing;

Charles Olson
Alice Notley
Robert Duncan
John Ashbury
Robin Blaser
Robert Creeley

I would be willing to meet Wiman, mano a mano here in Chicago. I would
relish it; meet me at Schaller's Pub (that is on the Southside of Chicago my
dear Christian)  the first shot is on me!

Ray, why stop at debate & drinking?  I'd hope for a bit of arm
wrestling.  We all need to do things to shake up the poetry world,
poetic terrorism even.

     works from each of the poets who read last season:

Is there going to be a publication of/from these commissions?

Sounds a great project - in a time of surveillance, out surveil the
surveillers - truth over sleeze and rhetoric (or is that, also, pray tell,
Fitzgerald about to nail Rove?)

Anyway, pleases, let know the potential sights/sites for the new goods

Listened to Ann Lauterbach at the SF Poetry Center yesterday afternoon.
Quite, I thought, astonishing work - a structural imagination full of great
twists and turns - without beeping and calling attention to itself - and, in
the context of the time, much work that is implicitly political,
particularly in the sense getting right in there at the attentions to
surveillance, being - as we suspect - watched, or, worse yet, watch the
perspective of the official citizen watcher - her eye, or the poem's eye,
going from the shoulders on the observed hawk, to the shoulders on the
soldier - but all kind of seamless, the way the language moves - a real
music weaving through the poem's frames. Genuinely moving stuff within a
lived aesthetic space, as, say, different from banging a predictable hammer.

At the poetry forum, Capriole, we were told to invent a new form...i did and
called the form, descending poem--poem of nine lines of free verse with three
stanzas of four lines, three lines, and two lines, in that order. The first
four lines of the poem must introduce the subject. The next three lines should
show conflict or tension which is overturned or dissolved in the third stanza.
The overall feel of the poem is one of surrender or letting go.

I just wrote the following poem..i don't know if it's the best example, but
just to illustrate...Anybody want to try it? ;) Thanks.


Light


we talk
about things
not worth
mentioning

how many there are
how many senses
to fill, to endanger

the light falls

"The Hystery of Heat" is The Society's new performance lecture about heat,
love, death, dance, hysteria and the dangers of rock and roll. Lead lecture=

under extreme heat duress and frequently bombarded by eerie and grating
noises generated by sound reconstructionist G. Lucas Crane. The ing=E9nue o=
f
the group, Jackie Milad will try not to freak out about such issues as
global warming, over population and our fast-paced hyperdigital age, and
projectionist Bonnie Jones adds moment-to-moment meta-commentary via live
power point presentation. Special appearances by Lauren Bender, Dan Breen
and Chris Fritton.
This piece is for anyone who has fears and/or believes they will someday
die.

The New York performances are part of the Ontological-Hysteric Theatre's
Outside/Input performance series, curated by Daniel Nelson, and also featur=
e
work by Alec Duffy, D Underbelly, and Shannon Sindelar.

Buck Downs & CA Conrad :: Thursday April 20th, 7pm:: Big Orbit Gallery:: 33=
d
Essex

* *Buffalo is in for a treat for the final installment of the Small Press
Sub-series via Just Buffalo's Orbital series as Washington DC's Buck Downs
and Philadelphia's CA Conrad come to town.  Both poets are remarkable in
their commitment to ethics and in their ability to convert their ethics int=
o
poems of beauty that retain their sense of humor to avoid being too heavy
handed=97indeed, with the state of (poetry in) America, who wants to be
lectured to?

Buck Downs has virtually dropped out of the trade-publishing world after hi=
s
first book *Marijuana Soft Drink* published by Aerial/Edge books, which is =
a
bit strange as he himself publishes books under the eponymous Buck Downs
Books.  In a world wherein people can constantly 'opt-out' of receiving
unsolicited marketing, Buck has managed to create a growing list of people
who wish to 'opt-in'.  In doing so, he has managed to dodge the back-door
politics that often dominate who is published by whom when via a series of
postcard poems and small booklets that simply arrive in the mailboxes of
those who have asked Buck to receive his poems.  Now, beyond the occasional
time when an editor of a magazine solicits him, Buck is completely content
with his decision.  "I'm sure that my opinion gets read as some kind of sou=
r
grapes and/or blithering contrariness. But I would put it to anybody who
writes poetry and is baffled or unhappy: stop sending poems to strangers wh=
o
edit magazines; make a list of the friends & fellow poets you want to share
with; send those people your poems, & expect nothing. If the results you ge=
t
are half as gratifying as mine, you'll never go back."

Buck is known to twist the traditional reading a bit, treating it more like
a conversation with the audience, mixing poems and thoughts together into a
stew that leaves people wanting more.  Mike Basinski, head curator of the
University at Buffalo's Poetry and Rare Books Library, has described Buck's
reading in Buffalo as "an important event."  Look forward to poems
such as *pontiac
fever* on Thursday:

drive off the side
of the driveway.

high off the side
of the highway.

punch a walking
set of quotation-
marks to make
the case complete

only got jerked
half off

so much for an
uncloudy day



CA Conrad is committed to numerous political issues, most notably economic
disparity and gay rights.  His first collection of poems, *Deviant
Propulsion* from Soft Skull Press, has Publishers' Weekly comparing him to
Allen Ginsberg.  Indeed, Conrad's poems have that sexy playfulness and the
willingness to expose hypocrisy that leads through Ginsberg back to Walt
Whitman with a bit of the New York Schools (Frank O'Hara and Ted Berrigan i=
n
particular) thrown in to keep it humorous. He has two books forthcoming, *T=
he
Frank Pomes* from Jargon Society and *advanced Elvis course* from Buck Down=
s
Books.  These snippets are from the title poem of his forthcoming book:

            she won't
            drive down
            Bush Street
            because of the
            president not
            the genitalia

            "i want to
            rub my titties
            all over this
            city" she says

             "me too!" i say
            today's inner child
            a sexy old whore

This reading may not fit everyone's politics, but it will get you engaged
with the work and through that, with the world around you.  If art is
supposed to do something else, somebody let me know.

>George Bowering was born in Penticton, British Columbia, in 1935.
>After serving as a photographer in the Royal Canadian Air Force,
>Bowering attended the University of British Columbia.  George

>attractive, unintimidating and remarkable.  He dispels the myth of
>literature being hard or tricky and demonstrates, as he reads and

Springtime greetings to you all!

There is a new series starting that will bring together an improvising
musician and a poet to see what happens. The first one was about a month ago
and it was well attended and a very enjoyable performance. I have been
asked to join Greg "The Monk of Funk" Bruce this Friday for the next one.
I've never really done this before but Greg is a great player and Paul
Bouissac, <http://www.semioticon.com/people/bouissac.htm> the fellow
putting this project off, used to own a circus! How cool is that?

I hadn't been in the Classic Cafe in years and I had forgotten how great the
view is. It's also under new ownership so the place is a lot more open and
has a great vibe.  Here are the coordinates:

Starburst    being an applet in    The Deitel Mods      I've been working on this one since September, and previewed it I believe
    on a few lists, so forgive me if you've seen it. Just finished the last bits
    of the poem addendum this morning.
    A series of generative/reactive Java applets; an accumulating poem...

Hi, y'alls,

I need some help:

I'm looking for good ideas for my argument:

I am positing two rhetors (Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz and Christine, de Piza=
n) and their concept of ethos.=20

That's about it! Please write me and suggest books and articles concerning =
the above, and if anyone has any ideas about example texts that would illum=
inate how proto-feminism shaped modern feminism.

Cheers (Sorry if this doesn't make sense!)

For Sor Juana you should look at her two protos in the Catholic and Spanish
tradition Teresa of Avila (get a copy of her Autobiography and the Interior
Castle)look at the sections of her reform of the Carmelites and her superior
relationship with St John of the Cross whose poetry serves the role in
Spanish that Dante serves in Italian; and also you should look at Catherine
of Siena as well the Dialogues these were two women who are doctors of the
church and who were condemned for their "ideas" but who also opened doors.
While today the RCC is quite retrograde in 1340 (Catherine) and 1560's
(Teresa) these were two of most powerful women of their day.

I would also recommend Octavio Paz's biography, "Sor Juana, or the

Subject: "descending poem" (new form)

At the poetry forum, Capriole, we were told to invent a new form...i did
and called the form, descending poem--poem of nine lines of free verse
with three stanzas of four lines, three lines, and two lines, in that
order. The first four lines of the poem must introduce the subject. The
next three lines should show conflict or tension which is overturned or
dissolved in the third stanza.
The overall feel of the poem is one of surrender or letting go.

I just wrote the following poem..i don't know if it's the best example,
but just to illustrate...Anybody want to try it? ;) Thanks.

Hao Wu, a documentary filmmaker, beloved blogger (and friend) has been =
held
without charges by the Chinese Government for over 50 days. Given that =
the
President of China is visiting the U.S. this week, I=A1=AFm taking the =
liberty
of forwarding information on Hao=A1=AFs case to the poetics and writenet =
lists.
More information on Hao Wu can be found at
http://ethanzuckerman.com/haowu/?page_id=3D2. Note that the =A1=B0Help =
us Out=A1=B1
link provides readers with a link to a petition to the Chinese =
Government to
release Hao.=20

=20

=20

Hao Wu (Chinese name: =CE=E2=F0=A9), a Chinese documentary filmmaker and =
blogger who
lived in the U.S. between 1992 and 2004, was detained by the Beijing
division of China=A1=AFs State Security Bureau on the afternoon of =
Wednesday,
Febuary 22, 2006.=20

On that afternoon, Hao had met in Beijing with a congregation of a =
Christian
church not recognized by the Chinese government, as part of the filming =
of
his next documentary.

Hao had also been in phone contact with Gao Zhisheng, a lawyer =
specializing
in human rights cases. Gao confirmed to one of Hao=A1=AFs friends that =
the two
had been in phone contact and planned to meet on Feb. 22, but that their
meeting never took place after Gao advised against it.=20

On Friday, Feb. 24, Hao=A1=AFs editing equipment and several videotapes =
were
removed from the apartment where he had been staying. Hao has been in =
touch
his family since Feb. 22, but judging from the tone of the =
conversations, he
wasn=A1=AFt able to speak freely. One of Hao=A1=AFs friends has been =
interrogated
twice since his detention. Beijing=A1=AFs Public Security Bureau (the =
police)
has confirmed that Hao has been detained, but have declined to specify =
the
charges against him.

The reason for Hao=A1=AFs detention is unknown. One of the possibilities =
is that
the authorities who detained Hao want to use him and his video footage =
to
prosecute members of China=A1=AFs underground Churches. Hao is an =
extremely
principled individual, who his friends and family believe will resist =
such a
plan. Therefore, we are very concerned about his mental and physical
well-being.

As of April 14th, 2006, Hao has been held for 52 days without being =
charged
with a crime, in clear violation of Chinese procedure. Numerous requests =
by
Hao's family for information have been denied by the State Security =
Bureau.

Hao Wu's friends and colleagues at Global Voices Online - where Hao =
served
as China editor - in cooperation with his sister Wu Na have organized a
website, a letter writing campaign and this petition to ask the Chinese
government for his immediate release.=20

More information about Hao Wu's detention is available at
http://freehaowu.org (or a mirror site, http://ethanzuckerman.com/haowu)

Talk: Blitzkrieg Pop & The Ruins Of New York: Susan Briante
=20
Throughout the Romantic period ruins frequently held a benign pastoral
appeal. But after World War II, urban ruins became monuments to our bombing
campaigns: a clock stopped in Hiroshima, a crumbling church in West Berlin.
Rose Macauley, writing in 1953 about what was the then newly created ruins
of European cities decries: =B3Ruinenlust has come full-circle: we have had
our fill.=B2  While spared devastation on the homefront, new demographics and
urbanization transform the US city into its own particular  kind of
wasteland. This talk will consider the ruins of New York in the postwar
years to the present as represented in the poetry of writers as distinct as
James Merrill and Brenda Coultas, Glyn Maxwell and Basil King. Susan Briant=
e
is a poet, essayist and translator who lives in Austin, Texas. Her
collection of poetry, Pioneers in the Study of Motion, is forthcoming  from
Ahsahta Press


Wednesday, April 26, 8:00pm
Reynaldo Jim=E9nez & Maureen Owen
=20
Poet, editor and translator Reynaldo Jim=E9nez lives  in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. His most recent work includes Musgo (Poes=EDa 2001, M=E9xico, Aldus)=
.
Poes=EDa 2001 (M=E9xico: Aldus), a book of essays Reflexi=F3n esponja (Buenos
Aires: Ts=E9-Ts=E9, 2001), and Shakti, an anthology of his work translated into
Portuguese (Sao Paolo, 2006). Maureen Owen is the author of nine books of
poetry and editor of Telephone Books Press. American Rush: Selected Poems
was a finalist for the L.A. Times Book Prize. AE (Amelia Earhart) was a
recipient of the Before Columbus American Book Award. Her new collection,
Erosion=B9s Pull, will be out this Spring.

In New Orleans, there is a need for SPECIFIC TEXTBOOKS for the Common Ground
summer school. See the list here:

www.kidsandcommunity.org/books.xls

The kids also need school supplies, as listed here:

http://www.kidsandcommunity.org/wishlist.html

These kids are at the greatest risk and need the most help. The school is=

being modeled on the Freedom Schools of the Civil Rights Movement.

They also are looking for experienced teachers to work all summer
(July-August). If my health were better, I would be there. Instead, I am
passing along the information to you and asking that you help them out in=

any way possible. Gathering school supplies should be an easy project for=

your own students and reading series.

Thanks,
Robin

I saw that St. John was mentioned in connection with Sor Juana, but I was
wondering if anyone knew of a collection of St. John's poetry. I am only
familiar with Dark Night, Ascent of Mount Caramel, and one poem whose name I

In regard to Sor Juana's relation to contemporary feminism--and queer
cinema--if you haven't already, you shd check out the film "Yo, la peor
de todas" (I, the Worst of All), dir. Maria Luisa Bemberg (Argentina,
1990). Beautifully acted, starkly framed and lit, and a controversial
interpretation (the editor of the Penguin edition of Sor Juana's
writings, for example, argues against it).

Subject: Rhetoric/Proto-Feminism Help!

Hi, y'alls,

I need some help:

I'm looking for good ideas for my argument:

I am positing two rhetors (Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz and Christine, de
Piza=
n) and their concept of ethos.=20

That's about it! Please write me and suggest books and articles
concerning =
the above, and if anyone has any ideas about example texts that would
illum=
inate how proto-feminism shaped modern feminism.

Cheers (Sorry if this doesn't make sense!)

Sor Juana knew of Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross's work. Teresa died
circa 1565, John circa 1570's and there was allot of contact between Spain
and New Spain (mexico) during their lives in fact both Teresa and John had
planned to travel to Mexico as missionaries but were not allowed to go but
their writings and their orders and companions the OCD's were very
influential in Mexico and remain so today.

You cannot easily place anyone into a proto "feminist" role since Feminism
in its current place is a recent movement my point is that you can find
influences that opened doors and influenced the writer/poet. For Sor Juana
who lived in Spanish America the most influential figures from the Religious
life she lived in the 1600's and 1700's was Teresa of Avila, John of the
Cross and Ignatius of Loyola and the only places in Spanish America where
women were educated, outside of the elite, were convents.

poet and musical acts' bios

Winnow Press published Shanna Compton=B9s Down Spooky in fall 2005. Compton i=
s
also the editor of GAMERS: Writers, Artists & Programmers on the Pleasures
of Pixels (Soft Skull, 2004). Her poems and essays have recently appeared i=
n
The Tiny, Coconut, MiPoesias, Spork, Court Green, Verse, and in the
anthologies The Best American Poetry 2005, The Bedside Guide to No Tell
Motel, and Digerati. Originally from Texas, she has lived in Brooklyn, NY
since 1995.

Casey Holford is a member of the bands Dream Bitches and Urban Barnyard, as
well as several other revolving musical projects. He has a new solo album
and also a new EP, which a Boog City cover story says sounds like what you
might hear "If Elliott Smith's Figure 8 was twisted through the buttcrack o=
f
Cyndi Lauper's She's So Unusual." He lives in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.

Phoebe Kreutz is a little joke folk gal who likes her thrills as cheap as
her beer. She's always singing songs about silly stuff. This spring she's
headed off to confuse and delight audiences on her first tour in the U.K.
Then she'll come home and release her new album, tentatively titled Feeling=
s
Up the Wazoo. She's very excited for this chance to pay homage to Chrissie
Hynde, who had such a large influence on not only Phoebe's bangs, but the
bangs of her entire generation.

The Leader is a bass and drum duo with plenty of harmony. A little country,
mostly rock, and lyrically obsessed with the sh*t hitting the fan.

Sharon Mesmer is the author of In Ordinary Time (stories, Hanging Loose
Press, 2005), Ma Vie =E0 Yonago (stories, Hachette Litt=E9ratures, France, in
French translation, 2005), The Empty Quarter (stories, Hanging Loose Press,
2000), and Half Angel, Half Lunch (poems, Hard Press, 1998). Lonely Tylenol=
,
an art book from Flying Horse Editions/University of Central Florida (2003)=
,
is a collaboration with the painter David Humphrey. She writes a seasonal
column for the French magazine Purple Journal and music reviews for The
Brooklyn Rail. Her fiction and poetry have appeared in New American Writing=
,
Van Gogh's Ear (France), Lungfull!, Gargoyle, Tears in the Fence (UK), and
The Brooklyn Rail, and on the websites Respiro, theeastvillage, the2ndhand,
and Nerve. She teaches graduate and undergraduate fiction-writing and
literature courses at the New School.

The Sewing Circle is a musical collective centered around
keyboardist/multi-instrumentalist Preston Spurlock, with frequent
collaborations from his first cousin Chase McGuire. The project started in
West Palm Beach, Florida in the summer of 2003. Since then, they have
recorded two full albums and are currently working on a third, and have had
several live performances. The Sewing Circle specializes in songs about
cryptozoology, extinction, and sleep.

It's Erika Simonian=B9s unique combination of talent and personality that
critics have repeatedly celebrated about her. Having been compared to Liz
Phair for her straightforward lyrical tone and Aimee Mann for her
songwriting craft, Simonian continues to defy the stereotypes of the female
singer/songwriter with her prickly sense of humor and her characteristic
air-and-light-infused delivery. There's something in that voice--a cat and
mouse playfulness--that lets you know that Simonian's in control even when
she seems most vulnerable.
=B3Her superb CD All the Plastic Animals is the gold standard for slowly
smoldering, fearlessly intelligent songwriting, infused with barely
restrained rage and subtle wit.=B2 -Alan Young of Trifectagram and New York
Press.

Jenny Smith is the author of Egon and Wait a Minute, Harriet. She writes
poems and takes pictures and is currently trying very hard to find an
inexpensive tuba so that she can play the tuba, too. Please find a tuba in
your basement and sell it to her.

I don't think there is a single English translation of St. John of the
Cross that would be remotely acceptable to poetry lovers.  Best to
read the Spanish with a good dictionary and stay away from the likes
of Roy Campbell and John Frederick Nims and Willis Barnstone.

Want to suggest, what I think is a great read, and a genuinely great
experience in "close reading" by forensic archeologists:

What Happened at Alder Creek?
Archeologists investigate the Donner Party.
Dana Goodyear

This one goes right down to the unearthed bones and artifacts at the Donner
Lake - as a way of not only getting at the domestic character and structure
of the Donner family site, but a way of examining the chronos of what became
the notorious cannibalism (the panic of starvation). The piece is a also a
good re-history of the events preceding and the stories by both survivors
and mythologizers in the subsequent eras up the present.

It's also hard not come away from reading this piece as somehow - without
anyway being explicit - as a totally captivating  legend of the present.
Perhaps it is the frightening sense that we - as a nation -  are stuck
inside this ice bound, frozen presidency, one apparently intent and bent on
devouring its every conceivable asset - whether financial, environmental,
educational, etc. - where it's gotten to the point where it feels like the
nation has begun to eat itself alive.

Well, with that cheery thought, it's a great essay. Interesting, I was
thinking this morning, Edgar Allan Poe's darkest tales of America were being
written and first read during the 1840's, not to distinct in time  from the
news of the fate of the Donner Party - "noir sur noir", or nothing
resembling a country's desired paradise.

Oops - forgot to say this is in the current New Yorker!

Want to suggest, what I think is a great read, and a genuinely great
experience in "close reading" by forensic archeologists:

What Happened at Alder Creek?
Archeologists investigate the Donner Party.
Dana Goodyear

This one goes right down to the unearthed bones and artifacts at the Donner
Lake - as a way of not only getting at the domestic character and structure
of the Donner family site, but a way of examining the chronos of what became
the notorious cannibalism (the panic of starvation). The piece is a also a
good re-history of the events preceding and the stories by both survivors
and mythologizers in the subsequent eras up the present.

It's also hard not come away from reading this piece as somehow - without
anyway being explicit - as a totally captivating  legend of the present.
Perhaps it is the frightening sense that we - as a nation -  are stuck
inside this ice bound, frozen presidency, one apparently intent and bent on
devouring its every conceivable asset - whether financial, environmental,
educational, etc. - where it's gotten to the point where it feels like the
nation has begun to eat itself alive.

Well, with that cheery thought, it's a great essay. Interesting, I was
thinking this morning, Edgar Allan Poe's darkest tales of America were being
written and first read during the 1840's, not to distinct in time  from the
news of the fate of the Donner Party - "noir sur noir", or nothing
resembling a country's desired paradise.

Not sure if this collection's been mentioned yet, but, after scanning
the digest of today's posts in my inbox, I don't see it.

The Collected Works of St. John of the Cross, rev. ed. Kieran Kavanaugh
and Otilio Rodriguez (trans.), (Washington: ICS, 1991).

The translations are sometimes not very energetic, but if memory serves
the book is facing page bilingual. The purpose of his work is to aid a
person in seeking union with God. Though I'm not a theist, I am
attracted to his work principally because of this, inasmuch as his
description of his method of achieving this union weirdly resembles the
practice of Vipassana as outlined in, among other places, the
Mahasatipatthana Sutta. Whether energetic in this translation or not,
San Juan de la Cruz shines thru either way:

To reach satisfaction in all
desire satisfaction in nothing.
To come to possess all
desire the possession of nothing.
To arrive at being all
desire to be nothing.
To come to the knowledge of all
desire the knowledge of nothing.
To come to enjoy what you have not
you must go by a way in which you enjoy not.
To come to the knowledge you have not
you must go by a way in which you know not.
To come to the possession you have not
you must go by a way in which you possess not.
To come to be what you are not
you must go by a way in which you are not. (p. 42)

Here's an interactive audio piece-in-progress. Jig-Sound:
http://vispo.com/jig

I sang these sounds, recorded and mixed them in Sonar, and smithied them in
Sound Forge. And wrote the software that links the sounds in Director.

1. Click a sound to play it.
2. Click and drag the middle of an icon
   to drag the icon
3. Click the left or right edge of an icon
   and drag to link two sound icons sequentially.
4. Click the top or bottom of an icon and
   drag to link two sound icons simultaneously.

More than you want to know about it at http://vispo.com/rhizome which is a
proposal to hopefully get funding for this project; Rhizome.org is funding
net.art projects up to $3k, so I put a proposal in there.

Some of you may recall the Nio project I did in 2000 (
http://vispo.com/nio ). I've done a few since then, but they've all been
building toward this one which, as noted, is still in-progress.

I'm pleased to announce a collaborative issue of Tinfish with trout, an
on-line journal out of Honolulu and New Zealand, edited by Robert
Sullivan, Anne Kennedy, Tony Murrow, and Brian Flaherty
(www.trout.auckland.ac.nz). Both journals specialize in Pacific
poetries; some of the authors have appeared in both publications, but
most are new to one or the other.

This issue features work by Hinemoana Baker, Cherie Barford, Linh Dinh,
Murray Edmond, Kari Edwards, David Eggleton, Glenn Mott, Eileen Myles,
Kit Robinson, Hazel Smith, Juliana Spahr, Richard von Sturmer, and Mark
Wallace, as well a review of John Kinsella by John Rieder.  And much
more!  Wonderful translations from the Chinese of Huang CanRan, Shang
Qin and others.

Each cover of the Tinfish paper version is unique, a slipcover map.
Centerfold by Thomas Wasson, designer of our roofing paper cover issue.

Yours for $8 or subscription to three issues of Tinfish: Tinfish Press,
47-728 Hui Kelu Street #9, Kaneohe, HI 96744.  Also call it up for free
on the trout site--the versions are not exactly the same, so you'll need
both!

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Dear all:

=20

The Palm Springs Book Festival - not a hurricane, but certainly a
brilliantly sunny, very windy, and decidedly chilly day - wind strong =
enough
in the unsheltered poetry area to whistle across the mic as we read.  In =
any
case, I could go on about Palm Springs (last time I spent time there was
five years ago) then and now, but I know I've been forwarding things =
about
poetryfoundation and the NEA, and here's the worst thing:

=20

Our current CA governor gutted the CAC upon assuming office.  This, in =
turn,
affected CPITS (CPITS is a nonentity here in LA where I live due to =
LAUSD,
but remained fairly active in the Bay area).  CPITS went ahead and =
created a
canned poetry writing curriculum with standard tests! and bar charts as
deliverables, leaving the poetry written in answer to the vetted =
exercises
as sort of an "extra" deliverable.  Hey, it is what they could do.

=20

In any case, along comes Poetry Out Loud, which is a coop program =
between
the NEA and poetryfoundation, led by just my favorite advocates for the =
oral
and the performative in poetry ever.  While NEA won't fund any creative
writing outside of "art" (for example, in the English or writing =
programs of
schools), apparently they will fund an oral poetry program with =
standardized
tests, NO creative writing, but optional CRITICAL writing, any time, any
where.

=20

http://www.nea.gov/news/news05/POLAnnounce.html

=20

http://poetryfoundation.org/foundation/release_111705.html

=20

this is not really JUST a high school poem memorization contest; it is =
the
most accessible way, apparently, for interested administrators and =
teachers
to get any poetry at all into the public schools (through CPITS or other
orgs) into the CA classroom (i.e., hiring poets to prepare students to
compete, etc.), and through a legislative grant match, a way to get =
enough
money into the budgets in order to spend on the arts, since every other
avenue was nearly eliminated

=20

http://www.cac.ca.gov/?id=3D308

=20

anyhow, while CPITS is urging CA poets to support poetry out loud since
every dollar of outside money means the opportunity to raise 10 dollars
(this is a pretty typical fund raising ratio), i.e., so much money that
despite the reprehensible Out Loud program, perhaps the ghost of poets =
in
the classroom could be summoned.

=20

All best,

Catherine Daly

Copper Nickel, a journal of art and literature at UCDHSC, presents a
poetry reading with:

Eric Baus & Joshua Marie Wilkinson

Tuesday, April  25th at 7:30pm

Auraria Campus, University of Colorado

in Tivoli 640

Click below for a campus map:

http://www.ahec.edu/parking/parking.htm

Eric Baus was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The winner of the 2002
Verse Prize, selected by Forrest Gander, his publications include The
To Sound and the chapbooks The Space Between Magnets (Diaeresis,
2001) and A Swarm In The Aperture (Margin to Margin), Something Else
The Music Was (Braincase Press) and the forthcoming Tuned Droves
(Katalanche). He has published poems in Verse, Hambone, First
Intensity, Colorado Review, and other journals. He currently lives in
western Massachusetts.

Explaining the award selection, Gander wrote, "The variously formal,
often epistolary poems of Eric Baus' 'The To Sound' slide open
uncanny sidewise logics, a sequence of shoji screens in the house of
lyric. There are lovely, subtle shifts in the lexicon, too, words
replacing the words that context suggests, as pyrite can replace
bone. The implications radiate into rich fields of emotive nuance.
The book is a sustained, swerving, humming pleasure."

"Eric Baus has channeled the consciousness of migratory animals, of a
collective self, of others, of objects," poet Peter Gizzi wrote. "He
has written an open letter from a marvelous land just beside this
one, a place of interior wonder and intimate noise. It's 'The To
Sound' of course: bent, exuberant notes that will wake you up
wherever you are."

Joshua Marie Wilkinson was born and raised in Seattle's Haller Lake
neighborhood. He earned degrees in English & Secondary Education (BA--
WWU), Poetry (MFA--U of Arizona), and Film (MA--U College Dublin).
His first film--a tour documentary about the band Califone entitled
Made a Machine by Describing the Landscape and co-directed with Solan
Jensen--will be released in 2007 by Thrill Jockey Records. He is also
the author of two book-length poems: Suspension of a Secret in
Abandoned Rooms (Pinball Publishing, 2005) and Lug Your Careless Body
out of the Careful Dusk (University of Iowa Press, 2006). New
Michigan Press recently released a chapbook entitled A Ghost as King
of the Rabbits (with illustrations by J'Lyn Chapman).


Drawing from the paintings of Susan Rothenberg, Gwyneth Scally, and
Eric Fischl as well as from the photography of Allison Maletz,
Wilkinson's Lug Your Careless Body out of the Careful Dusk is a book-
length poem written in small fragments. Comprised of seven sections,
the poem is formed as much by the poet's travels through Turkey, the
Baltics, and Eastern Europe as it is by the movies of Fassbinder,
Kieslowski, and Bill Morrison. The painters Francis Bacon and Lucian
Freud are here alongside whispers of Emily Dickinson and Wallace
Stevens. Lug Your Careless Body out of the Careful Dusk is a book of
cinematic images and fragments, of small stories overheard and
quickly abandoned, of hidden letters and phone booths, and of ghosts
who return with questions.

"Like the precisionist photographs of Charles Sheeler, Wilkinson's
delightful lyric fragments are notable for their wit and pathos,
their exactitude and wry self-irony. His tales of displacement are
verbal equivalents of Sheeler's realistic-yet wholly surreal-images:
we respond to these settings and situations with a shock of
recognition, especially since Wilkinson's control of sound and visual
prosody displays a nearly perfect pitch. A very sophisticated and
original book!"-Marjorie Perloff

Ha. Thanks. I hope the Rhizomers agree with you. It's kind of interesting,
the way they're going about their funding of net art projects.
http://rhizome.org , by the way, is a New York internet art org. Members
vote on the proposals. There are about 250 Rhizome members, last time I
heard, and they received about 190 proposals. So everyone is wading through
190 proposals, voting online. Kinda cool but mind numbing to try to wade
through 190 proposals for internet art. The members vote and then a small
jury decides among the most popular proposals.

I always have a very hard time writing these proposals when I don't have any
software or media to demo. And the more original the idea, the harder it is
to do well in a proposal, it seems. But this time I have some media *and*
software to demo that are part of the project; hopefully that will do the
trick (if they get that far). It seems that in these sorts of proposals,
you're best to have the project half-finished before applying for funding or
no one will get it unless it's going to save the whales or creates world
peace etc. What can be conveyed in a written proposal strongly about a media
art project is who/what the project will serve and other things, but it is
hard to convey the value of a project such as Jig-Sound without being able
to experience it since it unfortunately saves no whales and is merely about
experiencing sound and the visual representation of sonic pieces in a
different way that hopefully sheds some light on how we can listen actively,
meditatively, playfully, constructively, and create new forms of music and
audio experience with the help of a software instrument/player.

Subject: Notes from the Palm Springs Book Festival
Date: Sat, 22 Apr 2006 20:40:25 -0700

Dear all:



The Palm Springs Book Festival - not a hurricane, but certainly a
brilliantly sunny, very windy, and decidedly chilly day - wind strong enough
in the unsheltered poetry area to whistle across the mic as we read.  In any
case, I could go on about Palm Springs (last time I spent time there was
five years ago) then and now, but I know I've been forwarding things about
poetryfoundation and the NEA, and here's the worst thing:



Our current CA governor gutted the CAC upon assuming office.  This, in turn,
affected CPITS (CPITS is a nonentity here in LA where I live due to LAUSD,
but remained fairly active in the Bay area).  CPITS went ahead and created a
canned poetry writing curriculum with standard tests! and bar charts as
deliverables, leaving the poetry written in answer to the vetted exercises
as sort of an "extra" deliverable.  Hey, it is what they could do.



In any case, along comes Poetry Out Loud, which is a coop program between
the NEA and poetryfoundation, led by just my favorite advocates for the oral
and the performative in poetry ever.  While NEA won't fund any creative
writing outside of "art" (for example, in the English or writing programs of
schools), apparently they will fund an oral poetry program with standardized
tests, NO creative writing, but optional CRITICAL writing, any time, any
where.



http://www.nea.gov/news/news05/POLAnnounce.html



http://poetryfoundation.org/foundation/release_111705.html



this is not really JUST a high school poem memorization contest; it is the
most accessible way, apparently, for interested administrators and teachers
to get any poetry at all into the public schools (through CPITS or other
orgs) into the CA classroom (i.e., hiring poets to prepare students to
compete, etc.), and through a legislative grant match, a way to get enough
money into the budgets in order to spend on the arts, since every other
avenue was nearly eliminated



http://www.cac.ca.gov/?id=308



anyhow, while CPITS is urging CA poets to support poetry out loud since
every dollar of outside money means the opportunity to raise 10 dollars
(this is a pretty typical fund raising ratio), i.e., so much money that
despite the reprehensible Out Loud program, perhaps the ghost of poets in
the classroom could be summoned.



All best,

Catherine Daly

Was in northern part of China, what used to be called Manchuria, over weekend, on work assignment. Anyway, was reading, fingering though often, a wonderful collection of Paris Review interviews, something found on Ebay, yes, before the glut, and was moved, me being simple like that, by these two thoughts I'd like to share:

  Lawrence Durrell

  'To write a poem is like trying to catch a lizard without its tail falling off.'

  ...and something from Balthazar

  'I write so slowly, with such pain...landlocked in spirit as all writers are...like a ship in a bottle sailing nowhere.'

  For those of us who write, because we have to, and who do not feign the skill of painters (as it is the comfort of words we have), and who try our best-est to not settle for mediocrity in this task to gleen acuity for purpose of clarifying witness,

Popular Russian bookstore sees its final chapter
Owner evicted, thousands of books thrown out at Gaithersburg shop
Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2006

by Jaime Ciavarra
Staff Writer

http://gazette.net/stories/021506/montnew203830_31948.shtml

Dila Stepanov said it reminded her of Nazi Germany.

Thousands of books=97 torn, tattered, spines broken=97were lumped into =20=

literary mountains on a Gaithersburg parking lot, men shoveling them =20
into two green, 10-ton Dumpsters.

=91=91I won=92t let my children watch,=94 Stepanov said, pointing to her =
=20
toddler son, facing the opposite way in the back seat of her car. =20
=91=91It is horrible. It=92s like Hitler.=94

A Russian bookstore that has long been a haven for immigrants, =20
researchers, and=97some say=97even spies and CIA agents during the Cold =20=

War, unexpectedly closed its doors last week when the owner was evicted.

Thousands of books, all in Russian and some still in plastic =20
packaging, were taken to the trash transfer station at Shady Grove to =20=

be recycled.

Victor Kamkin Inc., one of the largest Russian book distributors in =20
the United States, was nearly six months overdue in rent at the brick =20=

building at 220 Girard Street in Olde Towne, the property manager said.

Last week, when the store owner had not moved the books from the =20
site, First Potomac Realty Trust began the eviction process, removing =20=

nearly 400,000 of the estimated 600,000 Russian books as customers =20
watched, and tried to salvage some titles, in the bitter cold.

Skip Dawson, executive vice president and chief operating officer of =20
First Potomac Realty Trust called the incident unfortunate, but =20
necessary.

=91=91We did make efforts over a long period of time to work with the =20=

store owner,=94 he said. =91=91Unfortunately, the remnants had to be =
moved =20
and we followed the [county] sheriff=92s requirements.=94

Because of the enormous volume of books, he said, almost 150,000 are =20
still in the store. Dawson said he has had offers by others to buy =20
the books or sell them at reduced prices.

=91=91We want to be sure to make the right move before we go forward on =20=

anything,=94 he said. =91=91We hope they don=92t get thrown out. We hope =
they =20
can benefit someone.=94

Igor Kalageorgi, owner of the more than 50-year-old bookseller, could =20=

not be reached for comment.

Contact numbers on the store=92s Web site for Gaithersburg and New York =20=

have been disconnected.

A person replying from the company=92s e-mail wrote to The Gazette that =20=

Victor Kamkin Inc. holds books =91=91in the highest regard,=94 and that =20=

attempts to work with the property manager to have the books moved =20
were unsuccessful. The person did not give his or her name.

The bookstore, which was previously housed in Rockville, came close =20
to meeting a similar fate in 2002 when Kalageorgi fell nearly =20
$200,000 behind in rent.

The store and books were saved when a going out of business sale =20
raised record revenue, and some politicos, including County Executive =20=

Douglas M. Duncan, and the Library of Congress, moved to stop the =20
eviction.
Kamkin Books moved to the Gaithersburg site in mid 2002, Dawson said.

The store=92s Web site says their books will now be sold exclusively =20
online.

For many in the Russian immigrant community, the closing of the store =20=

is a dispirited ending to years of tradition, said some who watched =20
the eviction process Wednesday morning.

The sight of books being destroyed was particularly disheartening to =20
those from Russia, a culture that holds books in high regard, said =20
Gayl Gutman, president of The Friends of Rockville Library, a =20
nonprofit voluntary organization.

=91=91If this was jewelry, it wouldn=92t be shoveled into the trash that =
=20
way,=94 said Gutman, who is also a member of the Russian book =20
initiative, a group that is pushing to get a 2,000-book collection at =20=

the library=92s renovation reopening in September.

=91=91That=92s how Russians think of their books. They love them, they =20=

value them,=94 she said. =91=91They think of them as a primary means of =20=

being in touch with their world.=94

The piles in the store=92s back parking lot will soon meet their fate: =20=

they=92ll be shredded, beaten into a fibrous pulp and then mixed with =20=

chemicals and water to create recycled paper.

Those who once visited the store weekly are now planning to frequent =20
another Russian bookseller in Kensington, or buy them online. The =20
transition won=92t be easy, they said.

=91=91This is trash?=94 asked Vladimir Novikovs of Gaithersburg, holding =
up =20
a Russian children=92s pop-up book he salvaged from the rubble.

He and a half dozen others watched the working crew crane more into a =20=

Dumpster Wednesday morning.
=91=91This is not trash,=94 he said.

John Tranter's new book

          Urban Myths: 210 poems

... will be published by the University of Queensland Press in May 2006.
(322 pages. ISBN-0-7022-3557-1, paperback)
UQP’s Internet site: http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/

Publisher’s cover blurb: Urban Myths: 210 Poems brings the best work to date
from a poet considered one of the most original of his generation in
Australia, together with a generous selection of new work. Smart, wry and
very stylish, John Tranter’s poems investigate the vagaries of perception
and the ability of language to converge life, imagination and art so that we
arrive, unexpectedly, at the deepest human mysteries.

The book will be launched in Sydney by Pam Brown
at Gleebooks, 49 Glebe Point Road, Glebe NSW 2037
on Friday May 19, 2006.   ---   Time: 6 for 6.30pm  ---   Cost: Free and
open to all
To reserve a place, visit:
http://www.gleebooks.com.au/default.asp?p=events/launches4_htm#John_Tranter

Extensive notes to the poems in the book have been posted on the Internet:

done in Stein scholarship. Working with her, I have added an earlier
summary, originally published on the Poetics List a couple of years ago:

Dydo recently edited a Stein page for PennSound. She is the author of

Subject:      Human Liberation: Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Marxism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I am beginning to think about my student teaching unit and I have decided to
develop a theme of Human Liberation as the vehicle to investigate
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Marxism. Now I need to do some reading in
order to develop a picture of the basic tenets of each of these. I am
familiar with all of them, but I want to be specific. In this vein, the
books should be kind of resource based. In addition, a book of Islamic
poetry (orthodox) would also help. For example, I have a good place to start
with Sufi poetry (thanks to Murat), but I want to counter balance it. So if
y'all could recommend a basic book for everything on the list but
Christianity (I have a good grasp on that) I would greatly appreciate it.
Thanks for your continued support. Peace,
Ian

It is true that a mathematician, who is not somewhat of a poet,
will never be a perfect mathematician.
--Karl Weierstrass (1815-97)

Paper Kite Press is pleased to announce our newest title:

My Dance is Mathematics
by JoAnne Growney

"My Dance is Mathematics" is a chapbook-length collection of poems
that dance in and around mathematical ideas and formulae. Japanese
stab binding. 24 pages.

Orders available online:

http://www.wordpainting.com/paperkitepress/pkpshop.html

From the book:

Can a Mathematician See Red?

Consider the sphere --
a hollow rounded surface
whose points seen from outside
are the very same points
insiders see.

If red paint spills
all over the outside,
is the inside red?

The mathematician says NO,
the layer of paint
forms a new sphere
that is outside the outside
and not a bit inside.
A mathematician

takes safe pleasure
in surface mysteries.

A poet
sees red
inside.

- JoAnne Growney

Found Poem: Work, Wine, and Beer

A dangerous virus is being spread
By email and face to face
Called WORK:

Worm-Overload-Recreational-Killer

If you receive WORK from any of your colleagues,
your boss, or anyone else
by any means
do not touch it -- this virus will wipe out
your private life completely.

If WORK-avoidance fails
and you are given WORK,
put your jacket on
and take two good friends to the nearest bar
that sells the antidote: WINE:

Work Isolated Neutralizing Extractor

Enough WINE will eliminate WORK from your system.

I=B4ve found that an alternative solution, BEER,

Best Equivalent Extractor Remedy.

will work as well as WINE,
but extensive testing has shown
that BEER usually requires
a more generous application.

Forward this warning to 5 friends.
If you do not have 5 friends
you have already been infected,
and WORK may be controlling your life.

Meet me at the bar.

The Dhammapada is a good place to begin with Buddhism.  Another book called Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche is also good but may be more geared to the potential practitioner than to students in a college.

If you plan to begin with Dhammapada, you might consider touching upon
its literary sequels like Charyapada and Tripitak.=20

Charyapada for example is a literary tradition (poetic) that was =
practised
for more than 5 centuries by Buddhism-influenced writers and poets in
Eastern Indian languages like Bengali , Assamese etc. Deeply insightful
compositions were made using a mystic language form called =
"Sandhyabhasa"
(languge of the dusk or twilight language). It was believed by the =
writers
of this form that "twilight" represented a daily time slot, a short
pause between work and repose, when insight,emotion and reason bring out =
the
best in the human mind. Charyapada had a lasting influence on these
languages and their literature until colonialization began in the =
18th-19th
centuries.

Did anyone catch Robert Grenier at Anthology (New York) on April 16th? If so
could you write a couple paragraphs about it for the rest of us? Thanks.

1. The Communist Manifesto
Authors: Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels
Summary: Marx and Engels, born in Germany in 1818 and 1820, =
respectively,
were the intellectual godfathers of communism. Engels was the original
limousine leftist: A wealthy textile heir, he financed Marx for much of =
his
life. In 1848, the two co-authored

neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/0451527100/qid=3D11175475=
03/sr=3D1-1
/ref=3Dsr_1_1?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> The Communist Manifesto as a =
platform for a
group they belonged to called the Communist League. The Manifesto =
envisions
history as a class struggle between oppressed workers and oppressive =
owners,
calling for a workers' revolution so property, family and nation-states =
can
be abolished and a proletarian Utopia established. The Evil Empire of =
the
Soviet Union put the Manifesto into practice.

2. Mein Kampf
Author: Adolf Hitler
Summary:
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/1410102033/qid=3D11175476=
52/sr=3D1-2
/ref=3Dsr_1_2?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> Mein Kampf (My Struggle) was =
initially
published in two parts in 1925 and 1926 after Hitler was imprisoned for
leading Nazi Brown Shirts in the so-called "Beer Hall Putsch" that tried =
to
overthrow the Bavarian government. Here Hitler explained his racist,
anti-Semitic vision for Germany, laying out a Nazi program pointing =
directly
to World War II and the Holocaust. He envisioned the mass murder of =
Jews,
and a war against France to precede a war against Russia to carve out
"lebensraum" ("living room") for Germans in Eastern Europe. The book was
originally ignored. But not after Hitler rose to power. According to the
Simon Wiesenthal Center, there were 10 million copies in circulation by
1945.

3. Quotations from Chairman Mao
Author: Mao Zedong
Summary: Mao, who died in 1976, was the leader of the Red Army in the =
fight
for control of China against the anti-Communist forces of Chiang =
Kai-shek
before, during and after World War II. Victorious, in 1949, he founded =
the
People's Republic of China, enslaving the world's most populous nation =
in
communism. In 1966, he published
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/B0007AFWEW/qid=3D11175478=
54/sr=3D1-1
/ref=3Dsr_1_1?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> Quotations from Chairman Mao =
Zedong,
otherwise known as The Little Red Book, as a tool in the "Cultural
Revolution" he launched to push the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese
society back in his ideological direction. Aided by compulsory =
distribution
in China, billions were printed. Western leftists were enamored with its
Marxist anti-Americanism. "It is the task of the people of the whole =
world
to put an end to the aggression and oppression perpetrated by =
imperialism,
and chiefly by U.S. imperialism," wrote Mao.

4. The Kinsey Report
Author: Alfred Kinsey
Summary: Alfred Kinsey was a zoologist at Indiana University who, in =
1948,
published a study called
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/0253334128/qid=3D11175479=
66/sr=3D1-2
/ref=3Dsr_1_2?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, =
commonly
known as
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/0253334128/qid=3D11175479=
66/sr=3D1-2
/ref=3Dsr_1_2?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> The Kinsey Report. Five years =
later, he
published Sexual Behavior in the Human Female. The reports were designed =
to
give a scientific gloss to the normalization of promiscuity and =
deviancy.
"Kinsey's initial report, released in 1948 . . . stunned the nation by
saying that American men were so sexually wild that 95% of them could be
accused of some kind of sexual offense under 1940s laws," the Washington
Times reported last year when a movie on Kinsey was released. "The =
report
included reports of sexual activity by boys--even babies--and said that =
37%
of adult males had had at least one homosexual experience. . . . The =
1953
book also included reports of sexual activity involving girls younger =
than
age 4, and suggested that sex between adults and children could be
beneficial."

5. Democracy and Education
Author: John Dewey
Summary: John Dewey, who lived from 1859 until 1952, was a "progressive"
philosopher and leading advocate for secular humanism in American life, =
who
taught at the University of Chicago and at Columbia. He signed the =
Humanist
Manifesto and rejected traditional religion and moral absolutes. In
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/0684836319/qid=3D11175483=
61/sr=3D1-1
/ref=3Dsr_1_1?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> Democracy and Education, in =
pompous and
opaque prose, he disparaged schooling that focused on traditional =
character
development and endowing children with hard knowledge, and encouraged =
the
teaching of thinking "skills" instead. His views had great influence on =
the
direction of American education--particularly in public schools--and =
helped
nurture the Clinton generation.=20

6. Das Kapital
Author: Karl Marx
Summary: Marx died after publishing a first volume of this massive book,
after which his benefactor Engels edited and published two additional
volumes that Marx had drafted.
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/089526711X/qid=3D11175485=
92/sr=3D1-1
/ref=3Dsr_1_1?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> Das Kapital forces the round peg =
of
capitalism into the square hole of Marx's materialistic theory of =
history,
portraying capitalism as an ugly phase in the development of human =
society
in which capitalists inevitably and amorally exploit labor by paying the
cheapest possible wages to earn the greatest possible profits. Marx
theorized that the inevitable eventual outcome would be global =
proletarian
revolution. He could not have predicted 21st Century America: a free,
affluent society based on capitalism and representative government that
people the world over envy and seek to emulate.

7. The Feminine Mystique
Author: Betty Friedan
Summary: In
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/0393322572/qid=3D11175487=
74/sr=3D1-1
/ref=3Dsr_1_1?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> The Feminine Mystique, Betty =
Friedan, born
in 1921, disparaged traditional stay-at-home motherhood as life in "a
comfortable concentration camp"--a role that degraded women and denied =
them
true fulfillment in life. She later became founding president of the
National Organization for Women. Her original vocation, tellingly, was =
not
stay-at-home motherhood but left-wing journalism. As David Horowitz =
wrote in
a review for Salon.com of Betty Friedan and the Making of the Feminine
Mystique by Daniel Horowitz (no relation to David): The author documents
that "Friedan was from her college days, and until her mid-30s, a =
Stalinist
Marxist, the political intimate of the leaders of America's Cold War =
fifth
column and for a time even the lover of a young Communist physicist =
working
on atomic bomb projects in Berkeley's radiation lab with J. Robert
Oppenheimer."

8. The Course of Positive Philosophy
Author: Auguste Comte
Summary: Comte, the product of a royalist Catholic family that survived =
the
French Revolution, turned his back on his political and cultural =
heritage,
announcing as a teenager, "I have naturally ceased to believe in God."
Later, in the six volumes of
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/0404082092/qid=3D11175495=
02/sr=3D1-7
/ref=3Dsr_1_7?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> The Course of Positive Philosophy, =
he coined
the term "sociology." He did so while theorizing that the human mind had
developed beyond "theology" (a belief that there is a God who governs =
the
universe), through "metaphysics" (in this case defined as the French
revolutionaries' reliance on abstract assertions of "rights" without a =
God),
to "positivism," in which man alone, through scientific observation, =
could
determine the way things ought to be.=20

9. Beyond Good and Evil
Author: Freidrich Nietzsche
Summary: An oft-scribbled bit of college-campus graffiti says: "'God is
dead'--Nietzsche" followed by "'Nietzsche is dead'--God." Nietzsche's
profession that "God is dead" appeared in his 1882 book, The Gay =
Science,
but under-girded the basic theme of
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/0679724656/qid=3D11175499=
60/sr=3D1-1
/ref=3Dsr_1_1?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> Beyond Good and Evil, which was =
published
four years later. Here Nietzsche argued that men are driven by an amoral
"Will to Power," and that superior men will sweep aside religiously =
inspired
moral rules, which he deemed as artificial as any other moral rules, to
craft whatever rules would help them dominate the world around them. =
"Life
itself is essentially appropriation, injury, overpowering of the strange =
and
weaker, suppression, severity, imposition of one's own forms, =
incorporation
and, at the least and mildest, exploitation," he wrote. The Nazis loved
Nietzsche.

10. General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money
Author: John Maynard Keynes
Summary: Keynes was a member of the British elite--educated at Eton and
Cambridge--who as a liberal Cambridge economics professor wrote
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=3Dur2&camp=3D1789&t=
ag=3Dhuma
neventson-20&creative=3D9325&path=3Dtg/detail/-/1573921394/qid=3D11175502=
18/sr=3D1-1
/ref=3Dsr_1_1?v=3Dglance%26s=3Dbooks> General Theory of Employment, =
Interest and
Money in the midst of the Great Depression. The book is a recipe for
ever-expanding government. When the business cycle threatens a =
contraction
of industry, and thus of jobs, he argued, the government should run up
deficits, borrowing and spending money to spur economic activity. FDR
adopted the idea as U.S. policy, and the U.S. government now has a
$2.6-trillion annual budget and an $8-trillion dollar debt.

Let's hope that readers of Human Events go out and read all of the books on
the list, and read them with open minds.

I'm not sure what Anthology had planned and i
can't tell from the description, but i will say
Bob's presentations are great.
After having seen him project his notebook
poems at Small Press Traffic in 2004 (on a
reading with David Bromige where they
heckled each other in comeradely fashion), i
wanted to have his work seen in the context
of cinema.  There was a wonderful exhibit at
Mariane Boeksy Gallery called POetry
Plastique which put poetry in the context of
visual art, and even published some film related
artifacts.

Last spring SF Cinematheque and The Poetry
Center had Bob to Yerba Buena Center for the
Arts (in SF) for a show with some of Stan
Brakhage's 35mm handpainted films which i
selected.

One reason i was so interested in relating Bob's
projected work to film is that it makes reading
into a process that *takes time* and even is a
theatrical event: audience here was encouraged
to attempt to read the scrawled projections out
loud -- to shout out their 'interpretations' of
Bob's script on the screen.  It worked better at
SPT because the heckling gave people license,
but the film audience was a little more uptight.
I hope those at Anthology were loud-mouthed New
Yorkers in the best sense!  It brings the kind
of orality of a "poetry reading" to the actual
Reading of poetry.

The reason to specifically relate it to Brakhage
was that both their work pushes back against the
transparency of their medium (word/page,
image/screen) that usually goes with 'reading,'
because it brings the tension between reading
and seeing into the open.

Brakhage's work does this with the reading of an
image, and Grenier's with the word.  The
competition between those two modes of using
your eyebrain is usually resolved quickly in
favor of one or the other, but in these works
there is no anxiety over *not-settling* into one
mode or the other, of needing to translate a
scratch into a representation, or a word into an
image.  Indeed there's pleasure in the suspence.

Mind altering stuff.

New from Tarpaulin Sky Press

[one love affair]*
by Jenny Boully

*A million wallowing anemones, a thousand eyes peeping through, a thousand
spies shivering, unnamable endless flowerings, countless empty bottles,
twelve flowers, eleven trees, eight fruits, four vegetables, four peppers,
two enemas, two kidnappings, one accident, one suicide, one soothsayer, one
drowning, one nightclub called Juicy.

[one love affair]* meditates on mud daubers, Duras, and the deaths of
mentally ill and drug-addicted lovers, blurring fiction, essay, and memoir
in an extended prose poem that is as much a study of how we read as it is a
treatise on the language of love affairs: a language of hidden messages,
coded words, cryptic gestures, and suspicion.

As with Jenny Boully's debut book The Body (Slope Editions, 2002), [one love
affair]* is full of gaps and fissures and "seduces its reader by drawing
unexpected but felicitous linkages between disparate citations from the
history of literature," a work that is "filled with the exegetical
projection of our own imagination" (Christian Bok, Maisonneuve). Told
through fragments that accrete through uncertain meanings, romanticized
memories, and fleeting moments rather than clear narrative or linear time,
[one love affair]* explores the spaces between too much and barely enough,
fecundity and decay, the sublime and the disgusting, wholeness and
emptiness, love and loneliness in a world where life can be interpreted as a
series of love affairs that are "unwilling to complete."

Jenny Boully is the author of The Body (Slope Editions, 2002). Her work has
been anthologized in The Best American Poetry 2002, Great American Prose
Poems: From Poe to the Present, and The Next American Essay and has appeared
in Boston Review, Seneca Review, Tarpaulin Sky, Coconut, and Conjunctions.
Her Book of Beginnings and Endings is forthcoming from Sarabande. Born in
Thailand and reared in Texas, she has studied at Hollins University and the
University of Notre Dame and is pursuing a Ph.D. at the Graduate Center of
the City University of New York. She divides her time between Brooklyn and a
small town in Texas.

Litquake Mission Statement: Litquake galvanizes the Bay Area’s thriving literary scene by  bringing emerging, mid-career and established authors together with  fans of the written word for a week of readings, performances, cross-media events, and panel discussions. We strive to foster interest in literature, to perpetuate a sense of community by making the solitary social, and to publicize San Francisco’s literary heritage, present and future. Litquake represents an ideal complement to the city’s music, film, and cultural festivals – and is unique as the only literary festival in the city.

I  currently contribute regularly to a wide variety of publications, and have traveled to many countries and throughout the U.S. in search of  a cool story. Occasionally I do live readings and panel discussions, and appear on Air America Radio and in television documentaries. I’m also the co-founder and director of San Francisco’s annual Litquake  literary festival.

Anti-sex, anti-Socialist, anti-Nietzsche, what a collection of anti-intellectual, right-wing, proto-neo-Fascists came up with this? The fact that Hitler's tome is on their list makes no difference whatsoever.  Why was this worth reading at all?  Perhaps to know who the enemies of free thought are, if we didn't know this already?

1. The Communist Manifesto
Authors: Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels
Summary: Marx and Engels, born in Germany in 1818 and 1820, respectively,
were the intellectual godfathers of communism. Engels was the original
limousine leftist: A wealthy textile heir, he financed Marx for much of his
life. In 1848, the two co-authored
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0451527100/qid=1117547503/sr=1-1
/ref=sr_1_1?v=glance%26s=books> The Communist Manifesto as a platform for a
group they belonged to called the Communist League. The Manifesto envisions
history as a class struggle between oppressed workers and oppressive owners,
calling for a workers' revolution so property, family and nation-states can
be abolished and a proletarian Utopia established. The Evil Empire of the
Soviet Union put the Manifesto into practice.

2. Mein Kampf
Author: Adolf Hitler
Summary:
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/1410102033/qid=1117547652/sr=1-2
/ref=sr_1_2?v=glance%26s=books> Mein Kampf (My Struggle) was initially
published in two parts in 1925 and 1926 after Hitler was imprisoned for
leading Nazi Brown Shirts in the so-called "Beer Hall Putsch" that tried to
overthrow the Bavarian government. Here Hitler explained his racist,
anti-Semitic vision for Germany, laying out a Nazi program pointing directly
to World War II and the Holocaust. He envisioned the mass murder of Jews,
and a war against France to precede a war against Russia to carve out
"lebensraum" ("living room") for Germans in Eastern Europe. The book was
originally ignored. But not after Hitler rose to power. According to the
Simon Wiesenthal Center, there were 10 million copies in circulation by
1945.

3. Quotations from Chairman Mao
Author: Mao Zedong
Summary: Mao, who died in 1976, was the leader of the Red Army in the fight
for control of China against the anti-Communist forces of Chiang Kai-shek
before, during and after World War II. Victorious, in 1949, he founded the
People's Republic of China, enslaving the world's most populous nation in
communism. In 1966, he published
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/B0007AFWEW/qid=1117547854/sr=1-1
/ref=sr_1_1?v=glance%26s=books> Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong,
otherwise known as The Little Red Book, as a tool in the "Cultural
Revolution" he launched to push the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese
society back in his ideological direction. Aided by compulsory distribution
in China, billions were printed. Western leftists were enamored with its
Marxist anti-Americanism. "It is the task of the people of the whole world
to put an end to the aggression and oppression perpetrated by imperialism,
and chiefly by U.S. imperialism," wrote Mao.

4. The Kinsey Report
Author: Alfred Kinsey
Summary: Alfred Kinsey was a zoologist at Indiana University who, in 1948,
published a study called
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0253334128/qid=1117547966/sr=1-2
/ref=sr_1_2?v=glance%26s=books> Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, commonly
known as
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0253334128/qid=1117547966/sr=1-2
/ref=sr_1_2?v=glance%26s=books> The Kinsey Report. Five years later, he
published Sexual Behavior in the Human Female. The reports were designed to
give a scientific gloss to the normalization of promiscuity and deviancy.
"Kinsey's initial report, released in 1948 . . . stunned the nation by
saying that American men were so sexually wild that 95% of them could be
accused of some kind of sexual offense under 1940s laws," the Washington
Times reported last year when a movie on Kinsey was released. "The report
included reports of sexual activity by boys--even babies--and said that 37%
of adult males had had at least one homosexual experience. . . . The 1953
book also included reports of sexual activity involving girls younger than
age 4, and suggested that sex between adults and children could be
beneficial."

5. Democracy and Education
Author: John Dewey
Summary: John Dewey, who lived from 1859 until 1952, was a "progressive"
philosopher and leading advocate for secular humanism in American life, who
taught at the University of Chicago and at Columbia. He signed the Humanist
Manifesto and rejected traditional religion and moral absolutes. In
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0684836319/qid=1117548361/sr=1-1
/ref=sr_1_1?v=glance%26s=books> Democracy and Education, in pompous and
opaque prose, he disparaged schooling that focused on traditional character
development and endowing children with hard knowledge, and encouraged the
teaching of thinking "skills" instead. His views had great influence on the
direction of American education--particularly in public schools--and helped
nurture the Clinton generation.

6. Das Kapital
Author: Karl Marx
Summary: Marx died after publishing a first volume of this massive book,
after which his benefactor Engels edited and published two additional
volumes that Marx had drafted.
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/089526711X/qid=1117548592/sr=1-1
/ref=sr_1_1?v=glance%26s=books> Das Kapital forces the round peg of
capitalism into the square hole of Marx's materialistic theory of history,
portraying capitalism as an ugly phase in the development of human society
in which capitalists inevitably and amorally exploit labor by paying the
cheapest possible wages to earn the greatest possible profits. Marx
theorized that the inevitable eventual outcome would be global proletarian
revolution. He could not have predicted 21st Century America: a free,
affluent society based on capitalism and representative government that
people the world over envy and seek to emulate.

7. The Feminine Mystique
Author: Betty Friedan
Summary: In
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0393322572/qid=1117548774/sr=1-1
/ref=sr_1_1?v=glance%26s=books> The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan, born
in 1921, disparaged traditional stay-at-home motherhood as life in "a
comfortable concentration camp"--a role that degraded women and denied them
true fulfillment in life. She later became founding president of the
National Organization for Women. Her original vocation, tellingly, was not
stay-at-home motherhood but left-wing journalism. As David Horowitz wrote in
a review for Salon.com of Betty Friedan and the Making of the Feminine
Mystique by Daniel Horowitz (no relation to David): The author documents
that "Friedan was from her college days, and until her mid-30s, a Stalinist
Marxist, the political intimate of the leaders of America's Cold War fifth
column and for a time even the lover of a young Communist physicist working
on atomic bomb projects in Berkeley's radiation lab with J. Robert
Oppenheimer."

8. The Course of Positive Philosophy
Author: Auguste Comte
Summary: Comte, the product of a royalist Catholic family that survived the
French Revolution, turned his back on his political and cultural heritage,
announcing as a teenager, "I have naturally ceased to believe in God."
Later, in the six volumes of
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0404082092/qid=1117549502/sr=1-7
/ref=sr_1_7?v=glance%26s=books> The Course of Positive Philosophy, he coined
the term "sociology." He did so while theorizing that the human mind had
developed beyond "theology" (a belief that there is a God who governs the
universe), through "metaphysics" (in this case defined as the French
revolutionaries' reliance on abstract assertions of "rights" without a God),
to "positivism," in which man alone, through scientific observation, could
determine the way things ought to be.

9. Beyond Good and Evil
Author: Freidrich Nietzsche
Summary: An oft-scribbled bit of college-campus graffiti says: "'God is
dead'--Nietzsche" followed by "'Nietzsche is dead'--God." Nietzsche's
profession that "God is dead" appeared in his 1882 book, The Gay Science,
but under-girded the basic theme of
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/0679724656/qid=1117549960/sr=1-1
/ref=sr_1_1?v=glance%26s=books> Beyond Good and Evil, which was published
four years later. Here Nietzsche argued that men are driven by an amoral
"Will to Power," and that superior men will sweep aside religiously inspired
moral rules, which he deemed as artificial as any other moral rules, to
craft whatever rules would help them dominate the world around them. "Life
itself is essentially appropriation, injury, overpowering of the strange and
weaker, suppression, severity, imposition of one's own forms, incorporation
and, at the least and mildest, exploitation," he wrote. The Nazis loved
Nietzsche.

10. General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money
Author: John Maynard Keynes
Summary: Keynes was a member of the British elite--educated at Eton and
Cambridge--who as a liberal Cambridge economics professor wrote
neventson-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/1573921394/qid=1117550218/sr=1-1
/ref=sr_1_1?v=glance%26s=books> General Theory of Employment, Interest and
Money in the midst of the Great Depression. The book is a recipe for
ever-expanding government. When the business cycle threatens a contraction
of industry, and thus of jobs, he argued, the government should run up
deficits, borrowing and spending money to spur economic activity. FDR
adopted the idea as U.S. policy, and the U.S. government now has a
$2.6-trillion annual budget and an $8-trillion dollar debt.

Hi,

Does anyone know when the poem "Chinese Whispers" was first published? There's about twenty magazines listed in the ackowledgements for the book by the same name published in 2002.

Or at least does anyone know of this poem as published before 2002?

Thanks,

Hi,

I am just learning.  Being a non-English speaking entity doesn=B9t help
either. There was no necessity to write in English though, however, can=B9t
avoid the occasional thoughts that come essentially in English.  Please fee=
l
free to criticize the works below (as harsh as you would like) and any
suggestions on reading materials will be deeply appreciated. I have read
very little. Want to read, learn.

Crestfallen weathercocks
---------------------------

Strings tied to the sky
snap=20
And weathercocks=20
Fall from their crests

Are you tired ? here, have some goat cheese

A becoming beckons; a deep one in essence and
chemistry lessons smother my turbidity

("Melting point" is a process for melting a point)

someone said--=20
coherence is a jerky goat
never sleeping=20
in anticipation of an extinct sabretooth

I saw tigers shedding from their sabers
In a riot of crestfallen weathercocks

Meaning of Moths
-------------------

Moths flew towards July
Their meanings towards November
Notations of my personal deer
bubbled through water

As if Monoliths were hewn from empty people
Transmitting a recurrence
As if recurrence was the first lamentation
And canopy became an essential utterance

Lost, for lost is the word

We could identify our shirts
Only in dialects of broken mirrors

And time became a night-cream
We put on our faces...... went to sleep.

Think of a magic that has no wings
A reality that has no magic

And a barber offering castration to broken mirrors

Think, It just takes the fear
blown into a pair of scissors
for our granaries to moult
and heaving enormous diaphragms
coruscating wings...... the meanings of moth
Fly into a surgical table=20

hi listfolks,

would very much appreciate hearing from anyone who has taught a college
course using the "american women poets in the 21st century" anthology
(edited for wesleyan UP by juliana spahr and claudia rankine). i'm
grappling with ways of presenting/sequencing the poets in question over
the course of a semester.

much thanks,
tom orange

Jesse is right. My confusion.

He was a Ph.D. candidate in Creative Writing at UWM when I was in the

My apologies to Jesse and to the venerable Johns Hopkins University.

I would agree that all of these books have been harmful but I would add to
the list the following that Human Events
Would not include

The Bible
The Koran
Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Freedman (the basis for Neo Liberal
economics)
Any book by Ayn Rand
Gone With the Wind
The Journals of Lewis and Clark

Lets agree that all the books they site have resulted in many deaths but how
many people have died from the books above?

Book of Mormon
Malleus Maleficarum
95 Theses

another list I'm on (where I heard about the harmful books) started adding
by mentioning the Koran and Bible, GWTW (although, surprisingly, no Ayn
Rand) and then got into a knock down on 1) religious tolerance, 2) body
counts

but aside from these adds, the original list sounds like the book lists in
the freshman seminars at the college I attended, or any sort of generic,
"books to read the summer before college," or any "great books" list --
though I will see there seems (I didn't count) to be a higher percentage of
harmful books by women than there are great books by women

or ar the books mostly nonfiction which is easy to misinterpret and/or can
be read a number of ways, whereas with GWTW and Ayn Rand aren't "harmful"
because they're fiction?

The Bible
The Koran
Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Freedman (the basis for Neo Liberal

actually almost any book, with some imagination, can be dangerous
(or with little imagination--think of the Brothers Grimm!)
Beatrix Potter's THE TALE OF TWO BAD MICE gave my brother and i when small
many great ideas for creating mayhem wherever we went--first introduction to

A soon-to-be-released book by someone named Steven F.
Sage claims that Adolf Hitler based his career on
three plays by Ibsen.  I first read about this in the
weekly Forward, but below are the editorial reviews
from amazon.com.

Also, according to a biography, Pol Pot is said to
have based his policies partly on his reading of
Kropotkin;  K.'s book on the French Revolution had
said that there was too much indulgence of the
bourgeoise during that revolution, and so P.P. was
determined not to be soft.

I would have thought that Ibsen & Kropotkin would be
*salutory* influences on historical figures.

_______________________________
Sage, a former research fellow at the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum, reveals that Hitler's life followed a
"script" based on his reading of three Ibsen plays—An
Enemy of the People, The Master Builder and Emperor
and Galilean. Sage argues that these were
"systematically adapted by the Führer over the course
of decades. He paraphrased their lines and restaged
highlights of their plots while assigning himself the
starring role in this grand drama. Sage pays lip
service to the influence of Wagner on Hitler, but it
was the Norwegian Ibsen, he says, whose words Hitler
cribbed. Sometimes, Sage nails his target, and he is
always interesting on the Nazis' obsession with
paganism, but there are moments when his examples of
Hitler's reliance on the playwright seem stretched
(e.g., "when the script called for a death the real
life character would perish," including six million
Jews)—while ignoring the extent to which the dictator
acted opportunistically or reacted instinctively to
events. Even so, the book is well placed to benefit
from this year being the centenary of Ibsen's death
and the increased attention that entails. (June)

Book Description

Steven Sage, research fellow at the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum, reveals that among Hitler’s first
crimes was a theft of intellectual property, until now
unexamined. Sage illuminates an influence impelling
Hitler’s master plan: his culling of language and
phrasing from one of Europe’s greatest writers, Henrik
Ibsen. The traces of this uncredited borrowing are
found in the Führer’s incendiary utterances, and in
Mein Kampf. Indeed, Sage shows that the blueprint for
the Third Reich was scripted from a trio of works by
Henrik Ibsen who had a cult following in 1920s
Germany. The author unveils a historical stunner that
has been hiding in plain sight for decades, letting
readers connect the dots with him through every step
of an unprecedented historical and literary
examination.

how are we defining helpful with these lists? books helpful with our poetry?
or any books helpful with our lives? either way, then where are the
biographies of artists and athletes, the graphic novels and comic strip
compilations, the collections of a favorite columnist's work.

Once the L train goes under the East River, you have three quick stops to hit before getting off the train at the fourth, Grand Street, which will take you a total of eight minutes once you’ve left the mother island. Be adventurous and come to the other side!)

Good Lord, Amy, I got this in my inbox and I thought there was a change to the program
and I was being asked to take my clothes off.

I'd need to go to the gym a few more times before subjecting everyone to that!

all-caps,

underscores, or abbreviations. *what about book titles?*

    =E2=82=AC     Your bio should begin with your first and last name, =
e.g. =C2=B3Jane

you have no

book credits listed in your bio, in which case you may list up to three =
journals or magazines in which your work has appeared.

grant, or

fellowship.

Yes, in effect, they're saying, "don't be creative."
What a sad state of affairs: a conference ostensibly
about writing and writing programs with bland,
instrumental and careerist panel biographies.

"Kluge: A Meditation and other work" is now onlline at:



http://www.arras.net/bks_kluge_thesis_disk/



I handed in a paper thesis including poems, the texts to the electronic
writing pieces and a few essays. The web page above is basically the CD that
I gave them this morning at 10 with the paper thesis. A pdf of the paper
part is also online.



You'll wonder why I include posters and videos as part of an electronic
writing thesis. Well, I include "regular" poems in the print part as well,
so I suppose those are just opposite extremems of writing and graphic art,
witch most of my stuff in between.



"Kluge" is getting really fun to play with. But I have a lot more
functionality I am presently adding, as well as video that interacts with
the text. I just didn't have time to have it done by this morning.

Jacket 29 is slowly growing, and should be complete within a few weeks.

Meantime, you can click on this link

     http://jacketmagazine.com/29/index.shtml

... to check out a couple of highlights: Mallarmé and Poland:

          Mallarmé revisited

=== Chris Edwards: A Fluke
'A Fluke' is a mistranslation into English of Stéphane Mallarmé's 1897 poem
'Un coup de dés...' with parallel French text.

=== Rachel Blau DuPlessis: Draft 73: Vertigo - a response to Mallarmé's
work.

=== David Brooks: Le Panier Fleuri: The Text and Texture of Les
Déliquescences of Adoré Floupette

=== John Tranter: Desmond's Coupé
A partly homophonic mistranslation into English of 'Un coup de dés', using a
nice, sensible even left margin.

=== John Tranter: a review of Musicopoematographoscope, by Australian poet
Christopher Brennan, a manuscript parody of 'Un coup de dés' written within
a few months of Mallarmé's poem being published in the May 1897 issue of the
Paris journal "Cosmopolis".

          POLAND

. . . and a selection of forty poems from twenty contemporary Polish poets,
from “Altered State - The New Polish Poetry” edited by Rod Mengham, Tadeusz
Pióro and Piotr Szymor (Todmorden, UK: Arc Publications, 2003) with a
supplement of recent work.

As well there are four interviews, a note on the late Barbara Guest, a
Gilbert Sorrentino feature, a James Schuyler feature, two pieces on Flarf,
eight poems by Margaret Avison,  a 95-frame Dan Dactyl comic strip and
dozens of articles, reviews and poems.

Thanks for posting it.

Sarah Crown on The Narrators | The Passion of Phineas Gage and Selected
Poems

Sarah Crown
Saturday April 29, 2006

Guardian

The Narrators, by Nicholas Murray (Rack Press, &pound;6)
Food plays a central part in the lucid landscape poems of Nicholas
Murray's latest collection. It features in treasured childhood memories
of "ham and salad teas"; in the here-and-now of his life in Wales,
where a "bowl of succulent beans / cools ... and a knife / slices
another wall of cheese"; in an evocative Greek sequence, in which
"dry, Samian wine" and "plate[s] of battered squid" give the
landscape sensual texture. His quick, vivid snapshots of nature often
suggest food, too; the sight of "berries on their rambling stalks"
leads him to imagine "their oozing weight / dark beneath a sweet and
sugared crust" with mouth-watering zest.

Away from the table, Murray's occasional tendency to overdo the whimsy
(as in the rather mawkish image of old men "affecting gravity and
beards / as a reproach to folly") is offset by the moments of real
style that his clear sense of internal rhythm and strong feeling for the
well-honed phrase produce. In "First Day of Summer", for example, the
opening lines - "All day the sun had struggled with this paste / of
lumpy cloud, occluded light and hampered heat. / Until, late afternoon,
the curtain rolled away / and sunlight splashed the gravel yard" - cast
a glow across the page.

The Passion of Phineas Gage and Selected Poems, by Jesse Glass (West
House Books, &pound;9.50)

In his latest volume, Jesse Glass prefaces a selection of poems from his
35-year career with a new, book-length sequence in which he considers
the life of Phineas Gage, a figure exceptional enough to merit the
attention of this accomplished experimental poet. Gage's story is
justly famous. In 1848 an explosion shot a three-foot-long iron bar
through the air into his brain. Incredibly, he survived, but his sense
of morality was permanently erased. In a virtuoso evocation of Gage's
life from that moment onwards, Glass intersperses contemporary accounts
of the accident with a series of brilliant and moving poems. In those
voiced by Gage, the painstaking fumble of his thoughts, perfectly evoked
by Glass's insertion of a comma between each word, contrasts
electrifyingly with his unexpectedly sublime language, which in turn
contrasts with the far more constrained voices of the other speakers.
The doctor's assessment of his patient ("Pulse 72; tongue red and dry;
breath foetid ... "), for example, pales before Gage's description of
his shattered head resembling a whale, "a, Nantucket, oil, well, /
gushing, ambergris".

The selected poems provide further evidence of Glass's ability, but it
is the remarkable opening sequence that stays in the mind.

I have posted  Entropy Slices--a very long poem that I have now finished.
It consists of about 160 slices, some one line and others run for several
pages. It is cultural and political commentary--Nixon tapes to your next
vacation.  It is one week repeat twice.  It started it in 1994. Over the
years I have sent it to several people and entered into several poetry
contests.  First book and all that.  I reformatted to fit the rules.   I
was once told it was one of the runner up! That was a major contest that
year.  Several issues ago, one very long  slice  was published a Van Gogh's
Ear. That was hard. I have sent out slices before, but it is looking at one
very small part.  It is a fragment of a string of fragments of multiple
sources and voices. Slices were performed at the Bowery Poetry Club with
the help of 11 others that Dan Waber helped put together.  I would send it
to O, but there not looking for 2007. No reading toward based on recent
published book. No poetry critics picking it.   I could print the fancy
multiple font version POD.   If anyone wants one let me know.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

Dear List,

Last month Jody Tate informed me that he was leaving Oregon State
University and that I would, therefore, need to find a new home for
the Versification web page.  At some point in the not very distant
future, we shall have to move it or potentially lose it for good.  I
cannot bring Versification back to my current Japanese university
because I face mandatory retirement in 2007.  I had hoped that the
Stoa Consortium might be able to adopt it, but they are worried about
who will edit the page.  I've not heard from my contact there in
weeks, so I assume they are reluctant to undertake the work.  Since
most universities require web page owners to be members of the
institution, I need to find a volunteer who can host the page and
help with editorial duties.  I will, of course, do all that I can on
my end, but we need an owner ASAP.

I've had an offer by an individual who helps the Stoa Consortium with
programming to put Versification on his personal web site, but I
would prefer to keep it at a university if at all possible.

Any suggestions to solve this problem will be very gratefully received.

Jody has done a wonderful job in modernizing and streamlining the
page.  His departure will be sorely missed by all, but especially by
me, who came to depend so much on his expertise.  gratias tibi
maximas ago!

Wow, interesting tangeant. I think the biggest problem with the Washington
Post article is that there is no attempt to show both sides. I mean it would
have taken literally one afternoon for the reporter to find say a Catholic
Scholar of the bible with a good reputation and who was familiar with this
man's argument. For me personally, that would have been important. Not
really a huge problem because anyone familiar with Christianity knows that
Fundmentalism employs a whole line of thinking that is not hard to break
apart. All I see is a Christian Fundmentalist who applied the logic of
Fundmentalism. Doesn't really affect me, but worth thinking about for oh,
say a half hour. Peace,
Ian

I suspect if the music industry gets things right, the USA is going to have
a fun and financially profitable run of the National Anthem in the language
of every migrant group in the Nation. In fact, yesterday in my local
neighborhood pub, I swear I heard some Irish-Am guys coming up with a
version in Gaelic. This could probably lead to competitions - Chinese,
Japanese, German, French, Arabic, etc.

We've already many great country and western and African-American Anthem
versions - Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock being my personal favorite.

What the hell, it might drive George Bush and a certain conservative cast of

interesting than the alternative.
